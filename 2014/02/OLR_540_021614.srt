00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,960
This week, Nintendo News continues as one highly anticipated title gets a release date.

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,840
Trademark news involving the creators of Candy Crush Saga continues with a recent accusation

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,000
of intellectual property theft.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
If it's not one game, it's another.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,000
All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,680
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:45,600
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 540 for February the 16th, 2014.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,540
My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,980
and video gaming, the gamer culture, gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
with me as always.

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,420
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,420
Sup bitches.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,700
Hey, how you doing?

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
That's going to be my thing now.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,740
I'm just going to do sup bitches.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
I think so.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,740
I think so.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,420
So I was admiring your shirt earlier because you have this really rad shirt and I know

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,460
it's a radio show so I was like, hey everybody, look at Jamie.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,460
I'll put a picture up.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
But I'll describe it.

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,540
It's basically like an old school NES cover, specifically like Excitebike.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,620
You know, they all had the, but it's Pee Wee Herman riding his bicycle and it says Adventure

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
Bike.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,620
I love it.

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,420
From the Loner Rebels series.

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,420
Yeah.

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,900
I loved Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,340
There was another one over here.

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,180
So instead of Nintendo, it's, you are, but what am I?

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
I know you are, but what am I?

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,180
Infinity.

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,180
I know you are, but what am I?

35
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,180
I know you are, but what am I?

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,180
Knock it off.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
Cut it out.

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,180
I love it.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,180
So instead of Nintendo, it says Infinity.

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,180
I know you are, but what am I?

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I know you are, but what am I?

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
Infinity.

43
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,180
Yeah.

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,180
I need to watch that movie again.

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
No way.

46
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,180
Stop it.

47
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,180
Cut it out.

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,940
Um, uh, but you said that shirt's no longer available.

49
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,540
I don't remember where Dan got it from, but it was like one of those one day sale things.

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,900
I mean, it could come up again.

51
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,900
I don't know, but they do like a different, it's almost like shirt.woot except, um, they

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,340
don't bring them back that you can pay five bucks more and order them later.

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,060
So, um, here's, here's a random question.

54
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,340
It's well, oh, go ahead.

55
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,220
One thing it's fun that I work in a place with like mostly dudes and they're like looking

56
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,260
at my boobs to see Pee Wee Herman and I'm like, um, I feel uncomfortable now.

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm going to go with my cubicle and hug my weighted companion cube until I feel better.

58
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Here's my random question and I'll, I'll introduce of course, Loki in a minute here, but starting

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,140
with you for this and of course our live chatters at live.vog network.com where we do tape live

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,100
every Wednesday or every Sunday night, excuse me, at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

61
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,980
right after the Bobby black will show.

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,740
Um, my question, since we're talking about your, your top, um, do you have a favorite,

63
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,400
do you have a favorite piece of gaming clothing, like game related clothing?

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,560
Cause I'll tell you mine and it always gets comments too is that hoodie I have with the

65
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,720
tanuki Mario on it where with the hoodie actually has the little raccoon ears on it.

66
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,040
I always like, what is that 35 year old man doing wearing a hoodie?

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,520
Well, I super love my N seven hoodie just because like now if I wear it at work, people

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,720
get it.

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,080
And I've, I've actually finally hit the point where I stopped keeping count of all of the

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,640
shepherd references I get at work because it's like I hit 30 and then I stopped cause

71
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,600
there's that guy that I meet in the hallway every day.

72
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,160
He's like, sup shepherd.

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,280
And I'm like, this is my favorite hallway in the Citadel.

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
I want coffee.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Nice.

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,320
But yeah, that's the good thing about working at a, um, for, uh, at the land of cubicles

77
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
and tech.

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
There you go.

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,400
Well look, I, he's, he's been sitting there very patiently and I, I think that's the five

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,040
minutes of silence from this man's, uh, too many.

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Say hello everybody to tech master Loki on the Skype line tonight.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do we have a tech?

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you muted Loki?

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Or did he go?

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,920
No, my, my key, my, uh, my new, uh, touch pad's really sensitive.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,800
So like I tap it and it's all unmute, mute, unmute, mute.

87
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,920
I was a little worried there for a minute.

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,120
I was like, well, this is going to be awkward.

89
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,760
No, no, no.

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,480
It's, it's, it's been a weekend, I guess.

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
It has been a weekend.

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
And all right, look, I'm, I'm dying because some of the listeners have seen your tweets.

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,600
You've got to tell us about why you're having technical issues tonight and so forth and,

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
and how this all started.

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Loki.

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,520
Well, I tried to play Titanfall on Friday, right?

97
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,280
You know, I downloaded it at work and I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to totally play it.

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,320
So I played it at lunch and you know, my laptop, I've done a lot of modifications to it, you

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,200
know, because it was an old ACES gaming laptop and it was, they're basically infamous that

100
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,600
model of being very terrible as far as heat efficiency goes.

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,760
And so it got to the point from playing Titanfall, I only went through the tutorial, I didn't

102
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
even get into a match.

103
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,720
I started a match and then I could tell that the graphics card was overheating a lot.

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,520
And you know, I was actually, I touched the top of the laptop, I'm like, ow, that is really

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
hot.

106
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,220
And so I just, you know, shut the thing down and you know, I was like, okay, I really need

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,100
to play with my cooling pad and because I have a souped up cooling pad that I made.

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,020
And so I was like, okay, I'm not going to play this anymore until I get that cooling

109
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
pad.

110
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:23,340
So, you know, yesterday I was playing Titanfall a little bit and had my cooling pad and you

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,300
know, I was just checking to make sure it still got hot.

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,480
So I shut it off again, updated my graphics drivers and then put a temperature monitor

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,580
thing on there so I could see how hot it was getting and ran it again.

114
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,940
And it wasn't getting that hot anymore because, you know, it seemed like it would, the new

115
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
drivers kind of did the trick.

116
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,380
So I was like, okay, cool, done that, I'm going to shut my laptop down for the night.

117
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,100
And so I flipped the screen down, which would put it in sleep and 20 minutes later it still

118
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
hadn't shut off yet.

119
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,840
And I was like, okay, what the hell, you know, so I had to force it off and so I held down

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,980
the power button to force it off, tried to turn it back on again, doesn't see the hard

121
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,020
drive anymore.

122
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,100
And when I went to go load like, you know, okay, I'm going to load the windows disk and

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,860
see if I can maybe recover the drive and stuff, there's just all sorts of graphical glitches

124
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,380
like that, that GPU is toast, is just damaged.

125
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,700
So the Titanfall beta was so awesome it literally melted faces.

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,820
Yeah, or at least GPUs, but you know what, to be honest, it's, I'm not surprised, that

127
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:39,820
laptop, like I said, is very, it just wasn't meant for, you know, that awesome game, I

128
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
guess.

129
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,580
So I had to get a new laptop, so I have a new laptop now.

130
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,340
It's kind of funny to me though, because I'm really surprised, you kind of took it in good

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,420
stride with a good sense of humor.

132
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,060
But there was a lot of people on Twitter this week about that Titanfall beta that were like,

133
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,100
how could EA release such a like crappy, you know, like, I guess it's still, I don't know,

134
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,980
when I played it, I didn't notice a lot of bugs or anything like that.

135
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Like it just, it seemed like the game was ready to go to me, but I guess other people

136
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,260
have been running into issues.

137
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,700
You had your laptop melt, literally.

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,020
And here's the thing, it's based off the source engine, and I had, it wasn't like I was running

139
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,620
like super ultra or something, it was all low, because it like, my GPU is so old and

140
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,860
that it's like a Nvidia 360M or something, it was like a really old one, and it couldn't

141
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
run crap.

142
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,300
So I was like, okay, all low settings, and it was fine, and when it ran, it just ran

143
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,340
really hot.

144
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,700
And it's really strange though, because I've run pretty graphically intensive games before,

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,500
and I've never had it overheat.

146
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,780
I mean, like I said, I built a custom, I've done so many cooling modifications to that,

147
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:48,780
I reset the, I put new thermal paste on everything, I literally have the bottom cut open to let

148
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:56,140
more air flow in, I built a, you know, a cooling pad that has two 120mm fans in there that

149
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
are running high.

150
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:03,820
I have the throttle on the fan that's in the actual laptop cut so that it runs high all

151
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
the time.

152
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,340
So, you know, the fact that it still overheated everything, and that's the weird thing is

153
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,660
when it locked up, it wasn't like it was overheating again, I think that's just that first time

154
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,740
that it got so hot that something got damaged in there.

155
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Huh.

156
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,460
So now, did you submit that feedback to EA?

157
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,180
I haven't gotten a chance to, because like I said, my laptop's been down, but I got a

158
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:39,860
new Asus though, and now it's an AMD quad core with a, I guess it's a lot newer of a

159
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:50,300
graphics card, it's an 8670M with 2GB of dedicated graphics RAM, or video RAM, and it's a native

160
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,860
1080p screen, it's like a 15 inch I think.

161
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,020
So the only problem is, and why you didn't see me on Skype earlier, is it's running Windows

162
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,740
8.1.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,720
I fucking hate Windows 8.1, because it's like, it's all, we're having trouble connecting

164
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
to the internet.

165
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm like, why the fuck, okay, so I downloaded Firefox just fine, I'm like, how the hell

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,900
did it, I can't connect to the internet, yeah I downloaded Firefox.

167
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
How is that fucking possible?

168
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,940
And then I go into my settings, oh, we disabled your WiFi card, what the fuck are you doing?

169
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,740
It's just so messed up.

170
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah I hate Windows 8.1, so.

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,440
So what are you talking to us now from, if you don't have a laptop?

172
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,760
No I have a laptop, I got it working, I figured out that it disabled my WiFi, so I turned

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
it back on.

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Okay, there you go.

175
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,460
Yeah, so I have my new laptop that I'm talking to you from right now.

176
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,020
You did end up having to buy a new laptop, it's not like you fixed the other one.

177
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,780
No there's no fixing that one.

178
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
Okay, fair enough.

179
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,100
Well I'm going to, you know what's funny is that right now, this particular portion's

180
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,140
only going to be heard on the podcast, because we cannot, we lost connection with the live

181
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,400
feed that broadcast our show, and it seems like Titanfall may have melted our host for

182
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,780
VOG Network as well, we're not able to broadcast right now, and a lot of our chatters are complaining

183
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
about it.

184
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,200
But some of the comments that did get through before it went down, Tigerclaw says, no matter

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,440
what they say, laptops are no, nor mentioned for high end gaming.

186
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Laptops are so thin that there isn't room for cooling the GPU inside it.

187
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
It's got a little fan and that wouldn't be enough to cool it down.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,460
Yeah, it's not, and that's why like I said, I literally had the bottom, I had drilled

189
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,640
holes in the bottom of the laptop to where the heat pipe was, and I had air blowing in

190
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,480
on it, but yeah, it was still toasty.

191
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,720
But I would think that they would have something built in place that like, okay it's getting

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,840
too hot, let's throttle the card back, because I've had that in my other, my PC had that,

193
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
so I don't know.

194
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,880
It might not have even been that, it could have been that the GPU's just, well the GPU's

195
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,540
not fine, but it, I don't know what exactly it damaged, and to figure it out I could buy

196
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,540
a new drive and put it in there and I might get Windows running again, but still that

197
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,620
graphics card's got damage to it, and even if I replaced that, it would just by that

198
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,900
time might as well buy a new laptop.

199
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,840
Do you use desktops at all, or do you only have laptops at home?

200
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,680
I only have a laptop because I've taken apart my desktop, it's so old now that I can't really

201
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,100
run anything on it, so I just run on my laptop now.

202
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,540
There you go, well at least we got our live listeners back, so that whole thing unmelted

203
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
there, that was really weird.

204
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,820
Usually if we had the live listeners get dropped, it's back in like literally 10 seconds, but

205
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,900
we lost them for almost a full two minutes.

206
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,320
That sucks, but that's just the joy of live radio, right?

207
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,860
Before we get into our quick kickoff topic tonight, Loki, I want to ask you the same

208
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,520
question I asked ARK Soccer a minute ago about clothes.

209
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,600
Do you have a favorite like gaming, you know, shirt or hoodie or something that you like

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
to wear?

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
The tingle costume?

212
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
No tingle costume.

213
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:14,240
No, I have a few different t-shirts, like I'm wearing my portal one right now from Woot.

214
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,320
I bought a lot of shirts from Woot, it's all about them being comfortable, and a lot of

215
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,520
the shirts, like I've bought some from Ripped and they shrank, which is annoying because

216
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
they keep shrinking.

217
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,560
The Woot ones for some reason though, they haven't shrunk, and that's why I kind of like

218
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
them.

219
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,040
My other one is my Video Game High School Season 1 Kickstarter shirt.

220
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,760
That one's super soft and comfortable.

221
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,440
But yeah, those are my favorite ones at least right now just because that's all I have.

222
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,040
I like that you're a little more practical when we talk about the favorite shirt.

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
You're like, oh well this one was the most comfortable, like it doesn't matter what was

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
on it.

225
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,240
In defense of my hoodie, it's super comfortable.

226
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,240
I had one from Ripped that was, you know, Lokeo's and stuff like that, and it shrank.

227
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,760
I was like, god damn it, now it's too damn small.

228
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,680
It looks really stupid when I wear it, but I don't know.

229
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Alright.

230
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,040
Well hey, I want to do a quick kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

231
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,160
and everything, and maybe Lokeo in a Tingle costume will be future DLC for this.

232
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
This is pretty funny.

233
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,260
We just announced this on the Bobby Black Wolf show because again we tape live on Sunday

234
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,200
nights and immediately before our show, Bobby Black Wolf, he's one man over in Atlanta talking

235
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,640
about games, and if you don't know Bobby, I know many of you that listen to this show

236
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,100
listen to Bobby, but if for whatever reason you don't know Bobby, Bobby also is kind of

237
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,600
like an indie programmer.

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,800
He's dabbled in things in the past like doing, you know, creating music for games, and he

239
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
does a little bit of programming.

240
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,120
He did the VOG Network site, which is, if you've never visited, it's also kind of a

241
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
game in itself because you can check into shows, you know, there's a passphrase somewhere

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,600
in this show if you're listening on the podcast or you can actually check in live, and you

243
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,240
get points and loot.

244
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,080
It's kind of like, I think like Foursquare or Get Glue, one of those types of sites.

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,640
Like that whole little game is built into the website for fun, and sometimes for little,

246
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,880
just little prizes, little raffles, but because Bobby's in Atlanta, you know, they had that

247
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,960
whole lockdown this week with the snow and the ice on the roads and, you know, after

248
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,120
what had happened there a couple weeks ago, they said, everybody stay the hell home.

249
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,640
Do not, do not leave the house, do not try to drive.

250
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,600
So some people in the snow go all Jack Nicholson and The Shining and, you know, go crazy, but

251
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,280
Bobby gets programming, and what he programmed this week is a really fun little thing for

252
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
the site.

253
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,520
flappy.vognetwork.com, that's flappy.vognetwork.com, yes?

254
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Bobby Blackwolf has unleashed flappy vog on the world, as if you weren't sick of flappy

255
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,480
bird clones, but you know what, no, this is really funny, and there are some really funny

256
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,700
flappy bird clones out there, you know, ever since they took that game down.

257
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
We had what?

258
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,480
We have Maverick Bird from Terry Cavana, the maker of VVVVV.

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
That one's amazing.

260
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,140
It's like very like Commodore 64 inspired.

261
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
It's great.

262
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,740
It might be, whatever it's called, that game is awesome.

263
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,940
And let's see, there was Flappy Burt from Sesame Street.

264
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,540
They did that.

265
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Flappy Kaiden.

266
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,740
That's how, you just saw that on Tumblr, Flappy Kaiden.

267
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,820
So you know, hey, we wanted a little piece of the parody action as well and it was a

268
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,660
good way for Bobby to kind of mess around in making his first game in, I think it's

269
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,080
his first game in Unity, his first public game, anyway, over in Unity.

270
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,140
So that's really cool that Bobby did that.

271
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,820
And what's also kind of fun, you actually play the game as hosts of the various shows

272
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,580
on VoG that don't shut up because we're podcasters, we never stop talking.

273
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,340
Bobby's in there, I'm in there, Brad from PodCulture's in there, and Travis from Understation

274
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Live's in there.

275
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,580
That's like the first set, but Bobby will be enhancing it in the coming days.

276
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,920
I mean, he literally did this on Wednesday until today.

277
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,060
So like those of us that couldn't get our voice samples in, because you know, like our

278
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,500
laptop's freaking melted or whatever, we're going to get in there a little later.

279
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,660
Like I know Dark Soccer's going to do some and so forth.

280
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,460
So Flappy VoG will only get bigger and better.

281
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,460
So Loki, have you been able to check out Flappy VoG yet?

282
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,900
Yeah, I did.

283
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,420
He wanted me to record some stuff for it and that was right before.

284
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Right before the meltdown, right?

285
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Yeah.

286
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Yeah, what'd you think?

287
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,860
Pretty, I mean, it's obviously very basic, but it's cool that he whipped that together

288
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
in days.

289
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Yeah.

290
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Yeah.

291
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Very cool.

292
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,260
Um, let's see, Akdeft is saying that I'm pronouncing Terry's last name wrong.

293
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
I apologize.

294
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Kavana.

295
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Kavana.

296
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Kavanagh.

297
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Kavanagh.

298
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Kavanagh.

299
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,020
I could see pronouncing it either way.

300
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,180
Every last name needs a pronunciation guy with it there.

301
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,220
Akdeft also saying VoG's Flappy Bird will get bigger and better.

302
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,120
GameGuru, in my response to the Jack Nicholson from The Shining response, said, Bobby did

303
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
go crazy.

304
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,180
He made a Flappy Bird clone.

305
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,180
Well, I know we're probably a little sick to death of talking about this game, but you

306
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
know what?

307
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,740
It's become this very strange phenomenon that a lot of people are talking about and I think

308
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,380
it is worth bringing up just a couple quick follow-up items here about Flappy Bird.

309
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,700
A, iTunes and Google Play are really starting to crack down on a lot of the clone apps that

310
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,980
are out there and if you look, actually if you look at the top 10 right now on iTunes

311
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,300
in the App Store for free stuff, like, in the top 10, three of them are Flappy Bird

312
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
clones.

313
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,820
The one is like the little swimmy, the cheep cheeps from Mario in their own game, so it's

314
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,240
very interesting there.

315
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,820
But why did Dong Nguyen take down Flappy Bird in the first place?

316
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Why?

317
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,180
He said to an interview with Forbes, he pulled the game because, quote, it's an addictive

318
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,900
product.

319
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,540
It happened to become an addictive product.

320
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,740
I think it has become a problem.

321
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,160
My life has not been as comfortable as I was before.

322
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,900
I couldn't sleep.

323
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
So what do you think?

324
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,140
Is Flappy Bird too addicting, Loki?

325
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Was addiction the problem?

326
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Loki?

327
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
No idea why.

328
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,460
I mean, I guess he could think that people would be addicted to it, but, you know, to

329
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,780
be honest, I think it was just all the attention he was getting was too much for him.

330
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,240
He just wanted just to make a game, because if it was any other developer, they would

331
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,220
be happy with attention to a game like that.

332
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,740
DarkSakura, are we proud of the creator of Flappy Bird for having the social responsibility

333
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,940
to recognize that his game was too addicting and pull it down, or is this all a little

334
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
cray?

335
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Sure.

336
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
What, you're telling me you have no opinion?

337
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Sure.

338
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,820
In the end, it doesn't matter why the fuck he did it.

339
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
He did it.

340
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
He made a choice.

341
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
He did it.

342
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Everyone else has to deal with it.

343
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
The end.

344
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,740
If you don't like it, tough titty.

345
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,220
That's a fair response.

346
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,420
Why do we keep trying to overanalyze this shit?

347
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,820
He did what he wanted to do.

348
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Deal with it.

349
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
I know, right?

350
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,220
It's like, aren't there, you know, babies being abandoned in Russia and, you know, people

351
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,620
being shot on the street?

352
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,860
Yes, but we do a show about video games, DarkSakura.

353
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
I know, I know, I know.

354
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,940
People listen to us to escape those things.

355
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,820
Yeah, but in the end, does it really, really matter why he did it?

356
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Does it?

357
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:14,500
Well, I could, one could argue that yes, because would future games possibly suffer a similar

358
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
fate?

359
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
And maybe ones that-

360
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Maybe they should.

361
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,140
Maybe ones that have a little more depth than Flappy Bird.

362
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,220
What if Mass Effect, what if, what if the creators of Mass Effect, DarkSakura, decided

363
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,020
they have a social responsibility to stop-

364
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,220
Ha ha ha, EA social responsibility, ha ha ha ha ha.

365
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
Yeah.

366
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,900
EA recognized they have a social responsibility to stop Mass Effect fan fiction.

367
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,380
It needs to be stopped.

368
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,620
Nothing will stop the link.

369
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,700
Nothing will stop the link.

370
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
I do think it needs to be stopped.

371
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,180
Yeah, well, I think tacos need to be here at Rob's house.

372
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
But are they here?

373
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
No.

374
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,980
Alright, so there you go.

375
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,540
You have all caught me, by the way, in mood.

376
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
In mood?

377
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
In mood.

378
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,500
It will be a night of honesty.

379
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Alright, oh, oh, you're having one of those nights like I was having a couple weeks ago.

380
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I might be.

381
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
We're gonna do a special segment tonight, ask DarkSakura a question.

382
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Okay, we'll do it.

383
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Alright, maybe later, maybe later.

384
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Alright.

385
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,260
Why did I get disconnected from chat?

386
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,980
Because, because it wanted to deal with it.

387
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
It wanted to kick you.

388
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
You know what?

389
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
It's because of your butt.

390
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,020
You farted or something, and it affected the internet, and it was like, you know what,

391
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,500
you don't get to be online.

392
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Fuck you.

393
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,460
Really, internet?

394
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Fuck you back.

395
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Bitch.

396
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,540
Alright, look, DarkSakura, I am gonna ask you a question, and that question is, how

397
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,580
is your gaming week?

398
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,060
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

399
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
It was really shitty.

400
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,140
All I've done is play Animal Crossing, and nothing else.

401
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,900
I really want tacos, by the way.

402
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,220
Are you Dunny Fire?

403
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,940
I just really want tacos, okay?

404
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,600
So don't judge me.

405
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,080
So yeah, I've, I played some Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, and I actually saved

406
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,980
a lot of the screen captures, and they're part of my desktop thing at work, at the land

407
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,080
of cubicles and tech, and, oh yeah, I need to go to Act Deaf's Animal Crossing town,

408
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,340
because I have one of those stupid petitions, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, this makes

409
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
me actually happy.

410
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,000
Like, for real happy.

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,040
In my village, that motherfucker, Ed, is gone.

412
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,280
He didn't even tell me.

413
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,080
Next thing I see, Isabelle's like, Ed's leaving, isn't that sad?

414
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm like, no.

415
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,320
Fuck him.

416
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,640
So I planted black roses where his house was.

417
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,360
Did you throw a little party in town to celebrate that he finally left?

418
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,240
Throw a little party in my head.

419
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,560
Did you leave a little sign where his house used to be, going like, you know.

420
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,760
He's not worth leaving a sign.

421
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm just planting the black roses there so that my grass will grow and I won't have to

422
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,360
remember he was ever there.

423
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Fuck him.

424
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Love it.

425
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
All right.

426
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,520
Alan Alchemy in chat says, you got Ed to move out.

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
That is huge.

428
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Finally.

429
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,760
Well, I had to ignore him for what?

430
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
What was it?

431
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,520
Because I had him soon after I started my village and then I kept hitting him and beating

432
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,680
him and he apparently liked it because, you know, I guess he's a dirty horse.

433
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,400
So finally I just started ignoring him.

434
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
And actually-

435
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,760
You're a very dirty horse, Mr. Ed.

436
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,200
You name one, Politary, okay?

437
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,880
When we were playing this horse racing, at least it wasn't a horse humping game like

438
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
that other one.

439
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
For Final Furlong.

440
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
For Final Furlong.

441
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
For Furlong, yeah.

442
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,800
But like, fucking Ed.

443
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
I did salt the earth.

444
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,920
I salted and burned the bones.

445
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,400
And actually, oh, thank you for saying something, Queen Sumia, because she's the one who gave

446
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,720
me the idea to ignore him and it worked.

447
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,520
So thank you for, even though I'm still totally jealous that like she got rid of her Ed first.

448
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,760
Alan Alchemy in chat says, Dark Sakura salted the earth, quote, nothing can ever grow here

449
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
again, quote.

450
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
I think it's all a front.

451
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,880
I think you got Isabelle to lie for you and I think you somehow figured out how to-

452
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm the mayor, fuck that.

453
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,880
You sent Ed to the glue factory.

454
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,240
You made him disappear.

455
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,840
I sent Ed to, um, I don't know.

456
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
All right.

457
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,520
No, you know why I wouldn't send Ed to the glue factory or to any type of factory?

458
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Because he's useless.

459
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,320
No one's allowed to use that carcass.

460
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,200
Even the earth will not absorb the nutrients from this decayed corpse.

461
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,360
It will just lay there forever in a sludge of black decayed goo.

462
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
All right.

463
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,600
Next week on As the Animal Crossing Village Turns, who will Dark Sakura set her sights

464
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
on next?

465
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,040
No, cause I like everybody in my town now.

466
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,120
I have Groucho and Lobo and I have Margie and Whitney, the two that were from the anime.

467
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,880
I couldn't tell you shit about my Animal Crossing village.

468
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,920
That's because you abandoned your people when they needed you the most.

469
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,000
You are the worst mayor ever.

470
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
You should be ashamed of yourself.

471
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm going to go hang out with that deaf now, bye.

472
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,800
But I'm playing Bravely Default.

473
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,580
You know what?

474
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm mad because I want that game.

475
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
All right, Loki.

476
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
How was your- yeah, you okay over there?

477
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,020
We can hear all your movements.

478
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,200
Be careful.

479
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

480
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:26,360
Okay, so I played Titanfall and well, that didn't work out too well.

481
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,800
I actually did get to check out another thing.

482
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,960
It was Jazzpunk and Jazzpunk is this game that's- I don't really know how to describe

483
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
it.

484
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,600
It's kind of like an adventure game, but it's just got a lot of really strange humor in

485
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
it.

486
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,720
It's kind of done like you're a secret agent and you're investigating all these different

487
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:54,960
missions that have you steal a kidney at one time and you know, find some carrier pigeons

488
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,240
and I don't know, it's just a really strange game.

489
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
It's got a lot of funny humor in it though.

490
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,840
So I got to check that out and play a couple hours of that.

491
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,480
And then I went in and played some Grand Theft Auto 5 online just because they had a new

492
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,800
weapon out for this week for Valentine's Day and also all the strip club lap dances

493
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
were free.

494
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,480
So, you know, why not?

495
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,720
And yeah, I think that was pretty much it.

496
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Oh, Call of Duty 4.

497
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,000
I actually played a little bit of that online on Wednesday, but yeah.

498
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,160
Hopefully now that I've got a better gaming PC, I'm going to check out some of my Steam

499
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,200
Backlog maybe or try Titanfall again.

500
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Hopefully it won't eat this one too.

501
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Are you really trying to push your luck there?

502
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,320
Hey, you know what, they have a one year, no condition warranty.

503
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,440
So you know, if this thing gets set on fire by Titanfall, they'll replace it for free.

504
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
So I don't care.

505
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
There you go.

506
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
There you go.

507
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
All right.

508
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,560
My gaming week, my gaming week was pretty abbreviated as well because I had a big show

509
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
on Friday.

510
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,880
So like, you know, the few days before that I was literally like just stressed.

511
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,580
You were spending all night in high heels and pantyhose.

512
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,160
It was the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

513
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
That's what you're supposed to do.

514
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
But yes, that was Friday.

515
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,200
Yeah, I know, I know.

516
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,160
But well, we had a sold out show in the middle of February, which is which is on Valentine's

517
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Day nonetheless.

518
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
So that was that was pretty awesome.

519
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
I got to say.

520
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Oh, I almost forgot.

521
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
Dan and I did something really romantic for Valentine's Day.

522
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What did you do?

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Our taxes.

524
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OK, you can go.

525
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
All right.

526
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,440
Well, I wore women's clothes in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and, you know, that was

527
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
in front of 500 people.

528
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Never be embarrassed.

529
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
All right.

530
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,220
No, it's I've been doing it for years and years and I love the community and the environment

531
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
it creates.

532
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,960
I miss doing cast crew stuff.

533
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Oh, yeah.

534
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Crew is fun.

535
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
It's good.

536
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,400
We have a we have a lot of like just out of high school girls that kind of do our crew

537
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
and they have a lot of fun with it.

538
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,240
So they have a good time.

539
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,740
But anyway, this isn't the Rocky Horror podcast.

540
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,960
This is a podcast about video games.

541
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,680
So what have I been playing outside of that this week?

542
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,440
I've been because of the show Friday.

543
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
I've been really like this whole weekend.

544
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
It's just been like dead man walking like I'm just like my back hurts.

545
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,480
I want to sleep seriously.

546
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,880
Oh my God.

547
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
We have these little.

548
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
OK, sorry.

549
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
Not to talk about Rocky again, but you need to know it.

550
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,920
Now it's relevant to the story.

551
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,300
OK, you we have these stairs backstage.

552
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,420
It's like it's just like the movie Showgirls.

553
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,800
You have to run up and down these stairs all night.

554
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,480
When you want to go do a quick change.

555
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,640
So I was running down the stairs and no, nobody pushed me down them because I'm not a bitch

556
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
or whatever.

557
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,600
But only one person can fit in the staircase.

558
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,280
So you have to like kind of yell if you're going to go down the staircase because somebody

559
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,560
might be coming up.

560
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,800
So anyway, I had to go up and down this thing like a ton of times because there's all the

561
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,820
costume changes.

562
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,800
So by the time Saturday rolls around, I wake up and I'm like, my back hurts.

563
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,640
I hate being old.

564
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,760
I used to do this shit every week without a problem and now my back hurts so much.

565
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,720
So yeah, so Saturday I was like, I'm not going to do anything.

566
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,520
I'm going to sit around and play video games all day.

567
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,120
So I played Final Fantasy 14 and one other game that I played was Diablo 3 on PlayStation

568
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
3.

569
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,920
Diablo 3, of course, I played a long time ago on PC and I played the demo on PlayStation

570
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,200
3 a while ago and I decided I would put the game in my rental service queue and get it

571
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,040
at some point because I was like, I want to try it, but I don't really want to buy it.

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,520
Maybe I'll buy it on PlayStation 4, but I don't really want to buy it on PlayStation

573
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,380
3 if they're not going to do the upgrade.

574
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,360
So yeah, I got it on PlayStation 3 from the rental service and I was playing a lot of

575
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,280
that and it is really weird to get used to the controller at first because I can't like,

576
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,000
I hate that you can't specifically target things like you can kind of point the direction

577
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,860
and it sort of targets what it thinks you want to go for, but it's really weird that

578
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,880
I can't, like you don't have that precision from the mouse.

579
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,200
Now the game is tuned to that and you know, it works and I'm not saying it's a bad experience,

580
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,520
but it does take some real getting used to, especially having played through the game

581
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,960
once on the PC, but you know, it works on console.

582
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,280
I'm having fun.

583
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,380
I like the fact that there's no auction house.

584
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,840
It really does make a difference because you really have to work for the gear that you

585
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,840
want and it makes crafting more important and all that, so it changes the challenge

586
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
a little bit.

587
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,040
I have nobody to play multiplayer with yet, but maybe when the game is released for PlayStation

588
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:33,440
4, people will kind of rediscover it all over again, so that would be really cool.

589
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,880
That was Diablo 3 on the PlayStation 3, so yeah, I'm having enough fun with it.

590
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,440
I heard that your characters will get to transfer over to PlayStation 4 and that's more incentive

591
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,920
for me to get the PS4 version whenever it comes out.

592
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,760
I mean, they were saying it was like a launch window game and then it kind of disappeared.

593
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,580
My thought is they're going to sell it with the expansion, because I can't see them selling

594
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,600
the game alone and then trying to sell you an expansion right after.

595
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,720
I would kind of think they're going to time the release of the PlayStation 4 to be the

596
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,520
game plus expansion, but I think that's what they're doing.

597
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,240
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, but that's my guess.

598
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
That's my big guess.

599
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
That sounds reasonable.

600
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Yeah, exactly.

601
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
So, yeah, other than that, some of the other same old stuff on DS, you know, lying in bed

602
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
with my back hurting.

603
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,380
I play a little more bravely default, but not a lot.

604
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,980
All my friends have run circles around me in that game, but I'm okay.

605
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,260
I had other things to do this week, so yeah, there you go.

606
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,660
So that was pretty much my gaming week, so I think that's all of us.

607
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,780
So quickly, some housekeeping.

608
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,860
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com

609
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:41,300
slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and our Google Plus page, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

610
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,020
We appreciate all you guys that follow us on the various social media, and you can keep

611
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,540
up with the latest and greatest of the show, answer our frugal question of the week, give

612
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,740
us your feedback, and so forth.

613
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,500
Also, we are definitely, definitely going to be closing the mailbag that we currently

614
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
have.

615
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,260
This week will be the last week to use that email address that we have, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

616
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,660
It will no longer work after episode 541.

617
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,360
Don't want to discourage you from sending emails, but we have such a huge spam problem,

618
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,940
we do think we know what we're going to do to fix it, so that will happen next week.

619
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,180
So mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com will no longer work.

620
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,420
After how many years have we had that address?

621
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Like 12 years?

622
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
After 12 years of using it.

623
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Four Eves.

624
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,740
Yeah, it just has too many spammy problems, so we're just going to, we're going to burn

625
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,540
it down to the ground and plant black roses, just like Dark Soccer did with Ed's corpse.

626
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,660
All of Ed's house.

627
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,620
Everything having to do with Ed.

628
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Amazing.

629
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Amazing.

630
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,460
All right, let's get into some gaming news, and I believe Loki's going to start us off

631
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,740
talking about his favorite game of the week, right Loki?

632
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,460
It, you know, you joke, but I had a great time playing the two matches I did before

633
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,380
my computer exploded.

634
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,180
But Titanfall Beta is going to be open to all very soon.

635
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,940
In fact, it's actually already open for everybody as of the 15th on Xbox One, and it's supposed

636
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,220
to be through this Origin as well on the 16th.

637
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Here's the weird thing though.

638
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,460
I've gotten like four or five beta invites, or not even invites, but codes.

639
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,340
They keep sending me codes for everything.

640
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,060
In fact, I checked my mail like right before the show started, and I had yet another set

641
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
of codes.

642
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,940
One for Xbox One, one for PC.

643
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,780
So I don't think it's that hard to get into the beta in the first place, but...

644
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,620
Hey, I didn't get in until you gave me the code, which by the way, I only really had

645
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,420
enough time to play the tutorial section, but I liked that it had like matrix elements

646
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,900
of running on the walls.

647
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,060
I liked that it was really doing some different stuff that we haven't really seen in first

648
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,620
person shooters.

649
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:45,060
I liked the idea that you could just summon this gigantic mech to fall from space onto

650
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
where you're at.

651
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
I mean, it's a little bit ridiculous.

652
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,100
It's pretty awesome, and even the whole six on six thing is not a big deal, because there

653
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,300
is a lot of AI guys running around, although the AI people are completely retarded.

654
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,820
I mean, you seriously can walk up right to them and punch them in the face, and that's

655
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
it.

656
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,660
I think it was Bobby was comparing it a little bit to League of Legends, and like the gruntlings

657
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,460
in that game, that they're supposed to be easy like that, but it's just if you get kind

658
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,860
of like, if the numbers of them become insurmountable, that's how you can lose.

659
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,820
That's kind of the idea I got.

660
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
I guess.

661
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
I mean, it was fun.

662
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:23,660
I had a lot of fun, so I'm definitely going to check it out some more, but yeah, so if

663
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,420
you haven't got in yet, you should be able to get in now.

664
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:35,540
So at least definitely on Xbox One and PC, I'm assuming it's open now, so go check it

665
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,620
out if you haven't, because it's pretty awesome.

666
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,780
Just be careful if you're playing on a laptop.

667
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,920
And then the other thing is, of course, they're going to be fixing the Xbox One controller,

668
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,820
and I guess this is by request from Respawn.

669
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,180
They were saying that they're fixing, I guess, some of the inputs in there.

670
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,100
They haven't really said what exactly it says.

671
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,500
It wasn't really, it didn't feel like it should be, it was a little overly twitchy with the

672
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,300
current controls, and they're saying now it's fixed and they're happy with it.

673
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,860
So I'm wondering if that means that they're just going to adjust the dead zone on the

674
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,500
controller or what.

675
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,820
I would think that's almost something that they could do with the actual game itself.

676
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,460
Like you wouldn't have to adjust the controller, just adjust the game.

677
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
But whatever.

678
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,740
As long as it works better, I'm all about better.

679
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,900
I wish EA or Activision would have complained about the D-pad on the 360 a long time ago,

680
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,020
and how awful it was.

681
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,640
Even like, they have that convertible D-pad now on some of those controllers, and that's

682
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,060
even more terrible from what I've seen.

683
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,420
It can break off real easy too.

684
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:50,260
I think what would be awesome is if they would put out the goddamn PC drivers for the Xbox

685
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
One controller.

686
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,740
That would be pretty awesome.

687
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,380
That's true, wasn't that supposed to happen like soon?

688
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
At some point.

689
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,620
I would think that maybe with Titanfall launching that would be a good, well I don't know, they

690
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,420
still want you to play on Xbox One I guess.

691
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,900
And I gotta say, playing Titanfall I was like, could I get an Xbox One?

692
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Ah, here we go.

693
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,780
No, I'm not doing it.

694
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,460
Unfortunately you just had to buy a new laptop, so that kinda screwed that plan.

695
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,660
Alright, I didn't really want to spend that money, and my wife's gonna be a little mad,

696
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,900
but she said I could, so you know.

697
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,940
She said you could do it, you got permission, so you're good.

698
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,580
And to be honest, it's not as expensive, I mean, I don't know, I think it's reasonable,

699
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,580
whatever.

700
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,920
Alright, fair enough.

701
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,580
Other big gaming news this week, you know, since apparently I'm the show's resident Nintendo

702
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,900
fanboy, I'm gonna talk to you guys about a little bit of Nintendo news, why are you making

703
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
angry face?

704
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:54,500
I know you do, no I was going off that email from last week, but I like everybody, and

705
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,300
Nintendo had a big thing this week, they did their big Nintendo Direct, so let me quickly

706
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,020
review some of the news that came up in Nintendo Direct this week, and then we'll talk about

707
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
it a little bit.

708
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,700
So Nintendo Direct took place on February 13th, and we learned the following, Little

709
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,500
Mac will be a character in Super Smash Brothers.

710
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,500
That was the best trailer ever.

711
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,780
That is actually, kinda one of those things where I was like, oh yeah, like why the hell

712
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,260
wasn't he in the previous games?

713
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,780
We've really been missing this guy for a while, so, I know a lot of fans have been demanding

714
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,660
it for a while, so there you go.

715
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,900
Kirby Triple Deluxe, finally announced for North, well, sorry, it's been announced, but

716
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,100
now it's officially dated, and of course I don't have the date in front of me, Loki help

717
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
me out.

718
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
May 2nd.

719
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Thank you.

720
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
What's that, May 2nd?

721
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Yeah, May 2nd.

722
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
There it is.

723
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:46,240
Same as, what is it, it's same as Mario Golf World Tour, I think.

724
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,040
And then they also dated Mario Kart 8, which will be out on May 30th, and they announced

725
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,860
along with that that all of the Koopa Kids are going to be playable in that game, which

726
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,320
is pretty exciting.

727
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,400
That seemed not very exciting at all, in fact I was just like, man, you know, instead of

728
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,280
having like 8 Koopa Kids, why couldn't they have had like 8 interesting characters?

729
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Actually, it's 7 Koopa Kids, not 8, because Bowser was World 8's boss, so it's 7 Koopa

730
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Kids.

731
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,360
Okay, so 7 Koopa Kids, instead of 7 Koopa Kids, they could have had like 1 or 2 Koopa

732
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:23,840
Kids and, you know, Geno, or, you know, I don't know, maybe like a Shy Guy, or...

733
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,260
Well, I don't think they're necessarily cutting all these, I just get the sense that Mario

734
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,520
Kart 8's going to have a huge roster, which is pretty cool, so, you know, I'm okay.

735
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,640
I'm okay with that, some of the Koopa Kids are pretty cool and don't really get, like,

736
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,760
enough attention, so I think it's pretty cool.

737
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,960
Except, no one is ever going to get the reference for Morton Koopa Jr., unless they are old

738
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
like us.

739
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I like Wendy O Koopa.

740
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Yeah.

741
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
See, you know, punk rock school.

742
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,040
But anyway, NES Remix Volume 2 is announced.

743
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,920
It's going to come with Super Luigi Brothers, those are coming out on April 25th.

744
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,960
NES Remix Volume 2 is going to have the good NES games, or I should say the re- because,

745
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,040
to be fair, NES Remix did have some good games in it, but it also had a lot of filler crap,

746
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,600
so it looks like NES Remix Volume 2 is going to cut a lot of the filler crap in favor of

747
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,280
games that we actually remember, so that's pretty cool.

748
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,320
I'm kind of tempted, but we'll see.

749
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,680
Game Boy Advance games will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in April.

750
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
That is official.

751
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,440
Pokemon Battle Troizei is going to get a sequel on the 3DS eShop, and Steel Diver Sub Wars,

752
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
one of those It's Out Now announcements, the free-to-play version of Steel Diver that we've

753
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,800
been hearing about for some time, that is now available for download on the 3DS eShop.

754
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,560
I'll quote myself here, stop trying to make Steel Diver happen.

755
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,960
It's just not going to happen.

756
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,720
I downloaded it, I didn't get to play it yet, so I don't have an opinion on it really yet,

757
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,840
but hey, if it's free, I'll try it, especially with Nintendo jumping into this territory

758
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,080
themselves, you know?

759
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,920
Steel Diver I think is a good choice to test the waters with, no pun intended, so, you

760
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,080
know, because you're right, Loki, it didn't work on 3DS, so it'll be interesting to see

761
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,360
if this kind of revives it, or if it, not really, so we'll see.

762
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,280
Also on the eShop announced today, Inazuma 11, which is the soccer RPG that's been out

763
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,800
in Japan and Europe for some time, it was just, bam, it's going to be on the eShop right

764
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,680
now for North America, so I know some people are very excited about that, so.

765
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,440
There was also a new trailer for Bayonetta 2, so quite a bit of news for Nintendo in

766
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,840
that Nintendo Direct.

767
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,720
A little heavy on 3DS, which is of course Nintendo's money machine right now, I was

768
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,640
a little disappointed in how light it was on Wii U, I was hoping there might be a little

769
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,400
something else, but I suppose they did say it was only supposed to be spring type of

770
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,240
releases, but yet then they threw in Bayonetta 2, now I wasn't expecting the Bayonetta 2,

771
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,120
I'm still sitting here thinking that, oh, we ain't gonna see Bayonetta 2 until 2015,

772
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,720
but apparently, it's gonna be in Japan this summer.

773
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,320
Bayonetta 2 will be a game this year, apparently.

774
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,960
That is what Platinum Games and Nintendo announced, is that Bayonetta 2 is gonna be out in Japan

775
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:13,200
in the summer, and will be in the west sometime this year, so, color me a little bit surprised.

776
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,840
So they did talk about some non-spring releases, because there was that.

777
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,040
So I'll be very curious to see what E3 brings us as far as, you know, what other big, because

778
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,560
Bayonetta 2 is not gonna be enough, you know?

779
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,960
I mean, Bayonetta was great, but I do think Bayonetta 2 has a really limited audience,

780
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,480
and I'm a little worried about how it's gonna sell, because Bayonetta 2 is for those fans

781
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,160
that actually went and bought a Wii U.

782
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,360
I don't know if there's gonna be a lot of people that go buy a Wii U because of Bayonetta

783
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,720
2, but we'll see, I guess it really depends on how good the game is.

784
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,000
We actually had talk about getting a Wii U because of Super Smash Bros.

785
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,060
Oh, there you go.

786
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,680
And so if we do that, then I definitely want Bayonetta 2.

787
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,180
I wonder if Super Smash Bros. is gonna make the holiday this year.

788
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,780
They're sure acting like it.

789
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
That would be...

790
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
It looks fun.

791
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,140
I mean, if Wii U does get Bayonetta 2, Super Smash Bros., and maybe one other little Nintendo

792
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,720
secret that they're sitting on until E3 all this year, that's gonna be a nice little boost

793
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
for Nintendo.

794
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,300
Now, again, they still really need the third-party support, but, you know, it'll still, well,

795
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,780
if they could work a price cut in as well, I think they would really be competitive.

796
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,780
But we'll see.

797
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
We'll see.

798
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
There you go.

799
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
That's my news from Nintendo Direct.

800
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Um, Loki, I don't know if you had some opinions on what you saw on Nintendo Direct.

801
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Loki, did you mute yourself again?

802
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
You gotta watch that.

803
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,780
Or did he just go away for a minute?

804
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I think Josh took over.

805
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
I guess so.

806
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Decided to fill in for him, but he shouldn't.

807
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Right.

808
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Well, that is why he does the show on Skype right now.

809
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,780
He's taking kids' shoes off.

810
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
That's what we figured.

811
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
All right.

812
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
Anyways, um, so let's see here.

813
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
No, no, no.

814
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,780
We were asking you about the Nintendo Direct and what you thought of it.

815
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
It was boring.

816
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,780
I mean, they didn't really announce anything interesting, and they spent way too much time

817
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,780
on just, I don't know.

818
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,780
I mean, is any of that stuff really supposed to get me excited about a, you know, Wii U

819
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
or anything?

820
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
I mean, it was all 3DS news.

821
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,780
And, honestly, you know, with Bayonetta, even though they're kinda claiming that it's gonna

822
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,780
be out later this year, I just don't buy it.

823
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
I mean, and even...

824
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
You'll believe it when you see it?

825
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Yeah, I guess.

826
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
I mean, here's the thing.

827
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Even though Bayonetta 2 might be coming out later this year, is it really gonna sell any

828
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
systems?

829
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,780
I mean, some people, yeah, they're all, oh, I'm so excited about Bayonetta and, like,

830
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,780
the Wii U, but I don't know.

831
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,780
It's just, like, even, even, like, in the second quarter, I was talking about, like,

832
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,780
what titles are coming out, and they've only got, like, maybe two or three Wii U games.

833
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,780
I mean, it's literally, like, six Wii U games in the first half of the year.

834
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Like, retail releases.

835
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
And that's kinda what I count.

836
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,780
I mean, yeah, you can go digital all day, but let's be honest.

837
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Digital offerings even, you know, on other consoles are way better than what's being

838
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,780
offered on Wii U.

839
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,780
I mean, it's just not, like, a ton of digital releases on there.

840
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
I just...

841
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
They're hurting.

842
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,780
They really need, like, Mario Kart 8 better be...

843
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
I mean, it's gonna be awesome, but is it gonna be enough to...

844
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,780
Are they gonna start selling a ton more units than they were before?

845
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,780
I just don't think that they are.

846
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,780
I think it'll be a slight uptick, but it's just not...

847
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,780
They still haven't found a good hook.

848
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,780
I mean, we already know that there's gonna be great Wii U games from Nintendo,

849
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,780
but that's not enough to hook a lot of people to buy the system.

850
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Alright, well, we'll see.

851
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,780
I think a price cut might be the trick, but we'll see.

852
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
I mean...

853
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
That would help.

854
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
That would definitely help.

855
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,780
Because right now, even selling Wii U to my customers and stuff,

856
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
no one wants to bring it in.

857
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,780
They have no interest in it at all.

858
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,780
And so now you're losing retailer interest, you're losing third-party interest,

859
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
you're losing consumer interest.

860
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,780
I don't know where they're gonna be able to make it up.

861
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Alright, well, we'll see as the year continues.

862
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,780
In the meantime, DarkSakura.

863
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Yeah, I got something.

864
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,780
So, as we might have teased,

865
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,780
there was talk going on about virtual purchases becoming regulated.

866
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,780
And this is, by the way, news out of Amsterdam.

867
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,780
You know, where...

868
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Pot brownies.

869
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, no, they have other stuff than that.

870
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Like history and art.

871
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
And Sil.

872
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
And Sil.

873
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Oh, I miss Sil.

874
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Hi, Sil, if you're listening.

875
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,780
Anyway, you know, there's been the whole thing with kids

876
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,780
that are basically spending all their parents' money on little transactions and games.

877
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:49,780
And so now, because of an investigation going on from the UK Office of Fair Trading,

878
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:56,780
they've got a lot more information about what kids are spending their parents' money on pretty much

879
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,780
in those little games.

880
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,780
They said they found a lack of, I'm gonna just quote this,

881
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,780
transparent, accurate, and clear up-front information about costs.

882
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,780
You know, saying that the costs may change as you hit levels.

883
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,780
And there's actually even a quote from Peter Mullineau,

884
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:23,780
who says that it was shameful that developers are exploiting their users that way.

885
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:29,780
So now there's talk, and they're actually talking about, in some countries,

886
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:36,780
of having these transactions be regulated and even taxable.

887
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,780
So I'm really, really interested in seeing how that plays out.

888
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
Yeah, I'd be curious.

889
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,780
I mean, it would seem so hard to regulate the internet.

890
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,780
Kind of arbitrary in a way.

891
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,780
I know. Yeah, yeah. That too. Anyway.

892
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:01,780
But coming into the situation that we've seen families finding themselves in,

893
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,780
because, of course, kids have no concept of money when it's virtual,

894
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,780
and a lot of adults don't have a concept of money when it's a card,

895
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,780
or just, oh, I get my points.

896
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Why do you think we had, in the first place, things like Xbox Live Points,

897
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,780
and Nintendo Wii Points, and things like that?

898
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,780
I mean, it's to make it sound like...

899
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,780
Separate the concept of cost.

900
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,780
Exactly. Now, granted, Microsoft got rid of that.

901
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,780
Nintendo still has it, though.

902
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,780
Well, also, it means that they can charge a universal amount of points

903
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,780
and make the individual country cost of it different.

904
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,780
So, for example, what may be 400 Wii U points in Japan may be something completely different here.

905
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:50,780
So, that, again, is hiding that illusion of how much money you're actually spending on it.

906
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,780
So, I'd like to actually see some type of regulation come out, especially over here.

907
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,780
But then again, I don't know.

908
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:06,780
I don't know that we are, because people will pay off their attorneys, and judges, and everything,

909
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,780
and circumvent copyright law, and so...

910
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,780
I wish I could buy Nintendo Wii U games with Dogecoin.

911
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,780
Or whatever. However it's pronounced.

912
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Doge.

913
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,780
Doge.

914
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Doge.

915
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,780
Doge.

916
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
I think it's from Strongbad. The whole thing is from Strongbad.

917
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,780
So, it's however he said it, and I forget.

918
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,780
But, yeah, I wish I could use my Dogecoin to buy Wii U games.

919
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,780
Oh, virtual currency.

920
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Well, it's gonna be...

921
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,780
That's a whole other thing.

922
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,780
I mean, this is opening a whole other can of worms.

923
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
That whole Bitcoin, and, you know, Doge, and all that.

924
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,780
It's very interesting that that stuff isn't really regulated yet.

925
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
I'll tell you what about the Bitcoin.

926
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,780
I had a very entertaining day about a month ago, month and a half ago,

927
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:57,780
of watching someone just completely take about, what was it, like, 9 million or something worth of Bitcoins.

928
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,780
Just completely taking it from right out in front of people, packing his way out of the money.

929
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard about that.

930
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,780
That was hilarious!

931
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,780
Well, that's kind of why I personally like the Dogecoin,

932
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,780
because it's not very valuable, and it's used in a much less serious manner.

933
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Like, more about, like, what internet community is supposed to be about.

934
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,780
So, I think that currency is kind of fun.

935
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,780
But, yeah, all the rest of it is really volatile.

936
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,780
And you kind of are waiting, like, are they gonna try to clamp down on this?

937
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,780
But then again, how do you clamp down on something that's born of the internet?

938
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,780
That's a world thing.

939
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,780
Anyway, that's a whole other thing.

940
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,780
And I'm still of the opinion that I should form my own country, my own island nation,

941
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,780
where everyone rides, where we have a complete monorail system,

942
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,780
everyone else will ride a Vespa, and we don't have this fuckery going on.

943
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,780
We're supposed to get the shoes that tie their own laces next year, just like Back to the Future.

944
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,780
Oh!

945
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,780
Queen Simeon, in our chatroom, says,

946
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,780
It's Doge. Doge. Doge.

947
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,780
If you pronounce it like the actual word there, so, alright, fair enough.

948
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,780
Well, give me more of it. I will gladly accept donations in Doge.

949
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,780
For the record, I made one of those little memes to put in my cubicle.

950
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Did you?

951
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,780
I did.

952
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,780
With the Shiba Inu?

953
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,780
Yeah, with Shiba Inu. It was awesome.

954
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,780
I can't say what it was because then I'd have to mention where I work.

955
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,780
Oh, I was like, I don't want to know what it is.

956
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,780
But I am gonna design a picture for the land of cubicles and tech.

957
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,780
Okay, fair enough.

958
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,780
Alright, moving on. Loki.

959
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:37,780
Alright, so we have some information about the brand new, was it, Japanese Arcade Expo coming in 2014.

960
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,780
Some of the games are gonna be showing off there.

961
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Looks like some updates to just a bunch of games that I've seen before.

962
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Like, you know, remember that old Alpine Racer game that they had, you know, with the downhill skiing game?

963
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,780
So they're gonna have a new one of that, Midnight Maximum Tune 5.

964
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Hopefully some great new music coming from that as well.

965
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:06,780
Let's see, a game called Mock Storm, which is kind of like some sort of, looks like a dog fighting game.

966
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,780
And then Taiko no Tatujin Master White version is gonna be coming out as well.

967
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,780
So that looks kinda cool.

968
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,780
Taiko no Tatujin in the arcade is so fun. I played that in San Francisco.

969
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:27,780
It was when we had the Hoard House night, when Shane was visiting, and when we went to Japan Town with Grandpa and extra for everybody.

970
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:34,780
I played Taiko no Tatujin, and it's so much better in the arcade when you have that gigantic taiko drum to bang on.

971
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,780
But anyway, sorry, just random tangent.

972
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:44,780
No, and then of course, you know, being Japan, they've got a Gundam versus game coming out as well.

973
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,780
It looks kinda cool.

974
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,780
Is it like the older Gundam game?

975
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,780
It was like the first person Gundam game?

976
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:00,780
Yeah, I think it's like that. It's hard to tell. The screenshot's really small.

977
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:09,780
And then, what was I gonna say? There's a, I was gonna say, I saw like an AKB48 shooter game.

978
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,780
What?

979
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,780
It's a zombie shooter game.

980
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,780
Are the girls zombies?

981
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,780
Yes, I've seen this game. Yes, it's the pop idols as zombies.

982
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,780
I might need this.

983
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,780
Yeah, I've heard of this. Hilarious.

984
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,780
Awesome, awesome.

985
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,780
By the way, our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com say hi to Josh.

986
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,780
We can hear him in the background, which is fine. It's cute.

987
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:42,780
Alright, moving on. A lot of people, you might want to mute your speakers there, Loki, with the kids around,

988
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,780
because I'm gonna use some naughty language with this, because this really ticks me off.

989
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,780
And this is more, and there's really no better word for this, which is why I told Loki to mute it,

990
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,780
because it's really pure fuckery is what's going on there with Candy Crush Saga.

991
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,780
And I'm sure many of you have heard this, because this is a news story.

992
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,780
The interesting thing about it is that much like Candy Crush Saga, this news story has really caught wildfire through Facebook,

993
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,780
and there's all these people sharing, like people that I didn't even know really played games,

994
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,780
that share these things that say, here's why you should stop playing Candy Crush Saga.

995
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:21,780
And it's because of another game out there called Candy Swipe, which many, many, many people are confusing for Candy Crush Saga.

996
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:29,780
In fact, the creator, Albert Ransom, has put together quite the evidence that his game gets confused with Candy Crush Saga all of the time.

997
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,780
Well, what's the problem? Candy Swipe is a rip-off game, right? Wrong.

998
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:41,780
Candy Swipe was written in 2010. In fact, Candy Swipe was written by Albert Ransom as a tribute to his mom,

999
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,780
who had passed away at 62 because of leukemia.

1000
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,780
And it has better graphics.

1001
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,780
Yes, and Albert Ransom details this all in a letter that he wrote openly, that has gone viral,

1002
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,780
to King, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, in a note over at candyswipe.com.

1003
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,780
And he basically said to the makers of Candy Crush Saga, congrats, you win.

1004
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,780
You're taking the food out of my family's mouth when Candy Swipe clearly existed well before Candy Crush Saga.

1005
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,780
And this all boils down to trademark issues.

1006
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Because Albert Ransom, when he made Candy Swipe, he tried to actually get protection for his name, intellectual property protection.

1007
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,780
But the makers of Candy Crush Saga are coming in and saying, nope, you've got to change your game,

1008
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,780
because people are getting it confused with us, and we own the trademark.

1009
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,780
We bought the name Candy as a trademark, because they didn't actually get that. They bought it.

1010
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,780
And so your game is too confusing, even though it was out first.

1011
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:46,780
So this guy who made the game is battling these trademark issues, and now Candy Crush Saga is trying to cancel the Candy Swipe trademark.

1012
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,780
So the guy who made this game can't even use his own name.

1013
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,780
And the way trademark issues work in this country, it doesn't necessarily matter that he's first.

1014
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,780
It matters that Candy Crush Saga is kind of the well-known one, so to speak.

1015
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,780
It's just completely stupid.

1016
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,780
It's completely stupid, and it just keeps on going, like, why we need reform of these laws in this country.

1017
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:14,780
But unfortunately, our Congress, which can't get a fucking thing done, like, not a single fucking thing done, will never get around to this.

1018
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:20,780
Because I'm sure, as many of you probably feel, there's far more important things that they need to be dealing with.

1019
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:32,780
And, you know, certainly there are some other things too, but, I mean, this is the type of fuckery that these laws not being reformed, that were written well before the internet, are leading us to.

1020
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:39,780
So anyhow, so basically, you know, this maker is saying, congrats, you win.

1021
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,780
And it was very, very passive-aggressive there.

1022
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:48,780
Congratulations on your success, is how it ended there, but I think we all know that was very tongue-in-cheek.

1023
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:59,780
Anyhow, so, I mean, again, if you're still out there playing Candy Crush Saga, you know people that are out there playing Candy Crush Saga, I have no easy way to say this.

1024
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,780
You're continuing to support this.

1025
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,780
Now, it's important to note-

1026
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,780
That makes them part of the problem.

1027
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,780
It really does. Like, there's no nice way for me to say that.

1028
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,780
You are part of the problem in letting King-

1029
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,780
Literally, you're part of the problem.

1030
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,780
Because, what did we just say?

1031
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:23,780
In trademark laws, because Candy Crush Saga is more well-known, because it's more popular, because people continue to play it, they can stomp the little guy like this.

1032
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:32,780
I think it's very important to note, Candy Swipe isn't really a replacement for Candy Crush Saga, because Candy Swipe, yes, it uses little pictures of candy too, but it plays like you connect lines.

1033
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:38,780
It plays more like that- there's a puzzle game, like Puzzle Miner or something on iOS that's very similar, but not the same.

1034
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,780
iOS.

1035
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,780
Sorry, iOS, the puzzle- I can't think of the name of it.

1036
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,780
I don't know.

1037
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,780
But yeah, it's-

1038
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
But I bought Candy Swipe.

1039
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
Yeah.

1040
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,780
I'm very proud to say that I've never, ever gotten Candy Crush.

1041
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,780
So.

1042
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:59,780
But yeah, there's that, and yeah, so please, if you're playing Candy Crush Saga, stop.

1043
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:05,780
There's many, many other games out there that are very similar, like I would even say, play Bejeweled, which is now an EA game.

1044
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:11,780
I would rather- much rather you be playing Bejeweled than Candy Crush Saga, which is a much better match 3 game.

1045
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,780
So, just throwing that out there.

1046
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,780
A little tough love from Rob Roberts.

1047
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,780
Well, I fully condone that course of action, because I mean, seriously?

1048
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,780
Mhm.

1049
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,780
Fuck those guys.

1050
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,780
Yeah.

1051
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,780
Fuck them.

1052
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
King needs to be put to an end.

1053
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,780
King needs- King needs to be buried in the backyard and assaulted-

1054
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,780
With Zynga.

1055
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,780
And just like Ed was.

1056
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,780
I'm just gonna call them Ed Corp.

1057
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,780
Yeah, seriously, look, many of you listen to this show on your mobile phones.

1058
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,780
Take a moment right now.

1059
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,780
Do it.

1060
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,780
This is peer pressure.

1061
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
Do it.

1062
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,780
Delete Candy Crush Saga.

1063
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,780
Just do it.

1064
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,780
I don't care if you're on level 250.

1065
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,780
I don't care if you're on level 300.

1066
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,780
These guys are evil.

1067
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,780
Do it.

1068
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,780
Right now.

1069
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,780
Delete it off your phone.

1070
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,780
Do it.

1071
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,780
Peer pressure.

1072
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,780
And if you don't, I'm very disappointed with you.

1073
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,780
Mhm.

1074
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,780
You make me-

1075
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,780
I'm borderline angry.

1076
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,780
I'm crying a little bit.

1077
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,780
You're crying on the inside.

1078
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,780
I am.

1079
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,780
I'm just angry.

1080
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,780
I'm not gonna buy Dark Soccer at a taco, because you won't delete that app.

1081
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,780
I really want a fucking taco.

1082
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:13,780
If you don't- if I don't get my taco, I'm going to kill another horse.

1083
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,780
In my village.

1084
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,780
And I don't even have another- I'm gonna import another fucking horse into my village,

1085
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,780
and I'm gonna stab it with a shovel.

1086
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,780
Because of you.

1087
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,780
Because of you people playing that game.

1088
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
You made me do it.

1089
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,780
That's what all the mentally ill people say when they kill people, right?

1090
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,780
You made me do it.

1091
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
Alright.

1092
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,780
ActDeftInChat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1093
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,780
Sky, I won't do it, because I never installed it in the first place.

1094
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,780
Well, that's fair.

1095
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,780
That's fair.

1096
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,780
See, that means that you and I are the very awesome people, because we don't ever have

1097
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,780
to deal with that shit.

1098
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:50,780
But make sure that- also, I will even give people three dollars to buy Candy Swipe.

1099
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,780
Be careful what you offer.

1100
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
One or two people.

1101
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,780
One or- okay.

1102
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,780
And I have to really like you.

1103
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,780
Like, I'd buy it for you and Alan.

1104
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,780
Okay, that's fair.

1105
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
Thank you.

1106
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,780
Appreciate that.

1107
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,780
I would buy it for, maybe ActDeft.

1108
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780
Maybe.

1109
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,780
I don't know.

1110
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,780
You have to send me real tacos.

1111
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,780
Because you're like where real tacos are.

1112
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,780
Alright, anyway, full disclosure, I tried Candy Crush Taco because all my friends were

1113
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,780
playing it.

1114
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,780
I would never put a horse's head in someone's bed.

1115
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,780
I would just- no.

1116
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
That's disgusting.

1117
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,780
What kind of a sicko are you?

1118
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,780
Okay, so how about some other stuff?

1119
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,780
How about it?

1120
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:35,780
Well, we might have covered this before about Yasumi Matsuno, who directed Vagrant Story

1121
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,780
and Final Fantasy Tactics.

1122
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:43,780
Well, there's a partnership with PlayDeck that's a mobile developer to do a Kickstarter

1123
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,780
campaign for a tactical RPG called Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians.

1124
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,780
And it's turn-based, 3D map, all of that.

1125
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,780
Well, it actually funded.

1126
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:00,780
As of Valentine's Day, the Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians Kickstarter fully funded.

1127
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:08,780
The first 200,000 backers that pledged 20 bucks reserved a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android

1128
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:13,780
copy of Unsung Story that's supposed to be out on July 15th.

1129
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,780
And if you donated 50 bucks, there's digital versions of the strategy guide, the soundtrack,

1130
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,780
and a poster.

1131
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,780
So congrats to you, dude.

1132
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,780
It looks neat, except I really, really hate turn-based RPGs.

1133
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,780
So I'll let other people enjoy it for me.

1134
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,780
Well, there's a lot of fans in that game, so.

1135
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah, and I definitely would get soggy, so I don't want soggy tacos.

1136
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,780
I'll just have to come hang out with you.

1137
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,780
All right.

1138
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,780
And ew, Nemesis, yuck.

1139
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Doritos tacos, ew.

1140
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,780
That just made my stomach curdle.

1141
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,780
I don't want tacos anymore now.

1142
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:47,780
Those Loco Tacos?

1143
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,780
The Dorito Taco, whatever the crap they are.

1144
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,780
The Loco Tacos from Taco Bell.

1145
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,780
I don't want tacos anymore, Rob.

1146
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,780
I've just been completely-

1147
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,780
They're not that bad, but here's the thing-

1148
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,780
I hate Doritos.

1149
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,780
Here's the thing.

1150
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,780
There's Taco Bell Tacos, and then there's real tacos.

1151
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,780
I want real tacos, but right now that just made me nauseous,

1152
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,780
and I'm angry again.

1153
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,780
I'm angry at the world.

1154
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Doritos Tacos make me hate people.

1155
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
A lot.

1156
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,780
All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

1157
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,780
Wow, okay.

1158
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,780
So this week we've got a bunch of, well, a few good games coming out.

1159
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,780
Starting off with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release of Rayman Legends.

1160
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,780
They'll be coming out this week.

1161
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,780
NASCAR 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1162
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:40,780
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze coming out on that Friday.

1163
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:45,780
And then, of course, the biggest game of February, in my opinion,

1164
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,780
Earth Defense Force 2025 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1165
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,780
Finally.

1166
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,780
Wow, all righty.

1167
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,780
It's starting to pick up a little bit.

1168
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,780
A little bit.

1169
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,780
Well, moving on to Japan.

1170
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,780
Guess what?

1171
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,780
Japan actually has a really huge week this week because on February 22,

1172
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,780
the PlayStation 4 is out.

1173
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,780
Yay, Japan.

1174
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,780
So Japan, we finally get to read PlayStation 4 release dates for Japan

1175
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,780
because they are getting the PlayStation 4 on Saturday.

1176
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,780
So there you go.

1177
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,780
So, yes, coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.

1178
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,780
The PlayStation 4.

1179
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,780
And with that, you can get, like, a vertical stand.

1180
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,780
You can get the camera, supposedly.

1181
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:28,780
And I'm thinking you got all the inventory that they're not making in the U.S. right now.

1182
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,780
So enjoy that.

1183
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,780
And here are some of the games you can check out in Japan.

1184
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,780
Drive Club is on the list, supposedly.

1185
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,780
So I guess that's actually happening in Japan.

1186
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,780
So I'm hoping we're getting it over here soon, too.

1187
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,780
No, it's not happening.

1188
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,780
Really? All right.

1189
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,780
Because it's still on the list here for February 22.

1190
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:50,780
But coming out as well in Japan, Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts,

1191
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,780
DualShock controllers in black, red, blue, and a little charger stand for those two.

1192
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,780
FIFA 14 World Class Soccer, Killzone Shadow Fall, NAC, NBA 2K4.

1193
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,780
Now, wait a minute.

1194
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,780
Aren't they getting NAC for free?

1195
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,780
I wonder why they're having a separate release of NAC.

1196
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,780
I thought NAC was being bundled in.

1197
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,780
Maybe it's a PlayStation Plus thing.

1198
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,780
NBA 2K14, Need for Speed Rivals.

1199
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,780
Nobunaga no Yabu Sozu comes out as well.

1200
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,780
And let's see, what else did they get?

1201
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:23,780
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out from Sega and Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.

1202
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,780
And I don't know why Watch Dogs is on the list.

1203
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,780
There's no way that's coming out.

1204
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,780
But for some reason, that's on my list.

1205
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,780
But I think that is a falsity.

1206
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,780
I think that just hasn't been updated.

1207
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:37,780
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Strider comes out in Japan.

1208
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,780
Strider.

1209
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,780
The new Strider game.

1210
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
Strider.

1211
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,780
Hiryu.

1212
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,780
Hiryu is what they're calling it in Japan.

1213
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,780
There's a regular and limited edition.

1214
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,780
What?

1215
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,780
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out there as well.

1216
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,780
Far Cry 3 gets a price reduction.

1217
01:02:52,780 --> 01:03:00,780
And on the PlayStation 3, Shin Kohime Musou Otome Taisen Sangokushi Engi comes out this week.

1218
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,780
So check that out on the PlayStation.

1219
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,780
Little Princess what?

1220
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,780
On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.

1221
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,780
On the Vita this week, not a lot.

1222
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:17,780
Chon no Doku Hana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.

1223
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,780
I'm trying to see what game that might be.

1224
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:24,780
Of course the website's not working for me right now, so I can't get any more on that game.

1225
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,780
Let's see the Wii U.

1226
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Nothing on the Wii U this week.

1227
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:38,780
And the 3DS gets Kuroko no Basuke Shoryu no Kisuke comes out from Bandai Namco.

1228
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,780
So there you go, your Japanese release dates.

1229
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,780
Enjoy your PS4, Japan.

1230
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,780
There's some games coming out in the UK.

1231
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,780
But my list has not decided to load for me, so...

1232
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,780
Yeah, suddenly we're having a...

1233
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,780
Are we still broadcasting?

1234
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,780
Yeah, we are.

1235
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,780
I suppose we are.

1236
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,780
On the 19th we have Banished for PC and Ikaruga for PC.

1237
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,780
On the 19th we have Strider!

1238
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,780
Yay!

1239
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,780
On everything, and I'm going to have every version of it ever and on the PC.

1240
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:16,780
On the 20th we have Blue Eden for iPhone, which the name sounds cool, I don't know what it's about.

1241
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:23,780
There's also Men of War Assault Squad 2, but I don't have to see why it has to be so patriarchy focused.

1242
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,780
And Weapon Shop de Omas on the 21st.

1243
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,780
Wow, this is a pretty busy week over in the UK.

1244
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:37,780
We have Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Earth Defense Force 2025, Rayman Legends on various variouses.

1245
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,780
That's it.

1246
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,780
You know, Rob, women can be a war too.

1247
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,780
Why does it have to be Men of War?

1248
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,780
Maybe that'll be the sequel.

1249
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,780
Alright, just like Ms. Pac-Man.

1250
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:57,780
See, now I'm coming up with subtitles for it, it'd be Women of War, fuck shit up.

1251
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,780
I'd make that game, I'd play that game.

1252
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,780
Alright, moving on. Loki.

1253
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,780
Alright, so there was another announcement this week, not necessarily from Nintendo, but Sony.

1254
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,780
They had a press event where they showed off some Playstation 4 games coming out,

1255
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:23,780
and also announced that, guess what, that redesigned Vita game is going to be coming over here as well in April, I believe.

1256
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:30,780
They're going to have Borderlands 2 launching with that release, a special Borderlands 2 bundle.

1257
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:36,780
So that'll be coming out for $1.99 as well as an 8GB memory card.

1258
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,780
So that's kind of cool.

1259
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:47,780
And then of course, with that, I want to say, oh yeah, it actually includes all the DLC too, so that's a pretty good deal.

1260
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,780
And then I'm not sure how much the system is by itself.

1261
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:58,780
I'm assuming that you can get it without buying Borderlands 2, but probably slightly cheaper than that.

1262
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:08,780
But it's 20% slimmer, 15% lighter, and has just a LCD screen instead of an OLED screen.

1263
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:18,780
So, kind of neat. I don't know if that's going to necessarily help drive the Vita, but I know that games like Borderlands 2 probably will help.

1264
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Alright, do you think folks are going to actually buy that new Vita model here?

1265
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,780
Maybe. I don't know. If they're looking for something smaller, perhaps.

1266
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:39,780
I'm not really sure. Probably if they put out the new version, maybe the old version will be dropping in price?

1267
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:44,780
Yeah, I think certainly price is a big, big key driver of this stuff.

1268
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:52,780
Borderlands 2 on Vita, I guess that's kind of cool, but I also sort of think that most people who wanted to play Borderlands probably have by now.

1269
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,780
I mean, they gave it away for free on PlayStation Plus, or I think it's still there for free, so I'm just...

1270
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:03,780
It seems like it's almost too late to put it out on the Vita. You know what I mean?

1271
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:09,780
Maybe, but it's still a good handheld. I mean, if you want to take it with you, that's kind of cool.

1272
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:16,780
Alright, well, added to Steam this week, tags. Tags came to the Steam store this week.

1273
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:22,780
But here's what's interesting about it. It's actually a crowd-sourced tag system. They're not like official tags.

1274
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,780
Oh, I'm sure that'll be effective then.

1275
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:31,780
Well, it's had some very interesting effects, because people have tagged things with very interesting things, but yeah, it's all kind of like crowd-sourced.

1276
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:41,780
So you can suggest tags, and you can tag things yourself, you know, that this is an action game or a hardcore game or whatever, or you can come up with your own inventive tag.

1277
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:51,780
You can browse by popular tags. You can also look at tags that are recommended for you, I guess, based on some type of algorithm behind the scenes.

1278
01:07:51,780 --> 01:08:03,780
It is localized for various languages, so you can tag in, you know, I know Steam is very big in Russia, it's in big part thanks to Dota 2, and other languages as well, so you can tag in those languages.

1279
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:13,780
And yeah, looking at it, what your friends have tagged things with and so forth. So it is in beta right now, but it's not like one of those invite-only things.

1280
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,780
It's just kind of out there, and you can check that out, the Steam tags. So there you go.

1281
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:29,780
All right. Well, you know, I'm going to go back to a day when we didn't really have a way to tag games. It was just like, which drawer are you going to put this in, or which bin are you going to throw this game in?

1282
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,780
Tagging games meant that you took spray paint to a billboard.

1283
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,780
Or you took masking tape and you put it on the NES cartridge.

1284
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,780
And you wrote your name on it.

1285
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,780
Exactly. It's the classic game of the week.

1286
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:50,780
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking this game out, because if you don't, you like suck or something.

1287
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,780
Seriously, what's up with you kids? Get off my lawn and play it.

1288
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,780
Here it is, the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer. What would you pick?

1289
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,780
I sure do like my compile games, don't I, Rob?

1290
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,780
You sure do like your compile games.

1291
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:08,780
This one is Golvelius, which, well, the technical name is Mao Golvelius, which is Devil Golvelius.

1292
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:14,780
It was an action adventure game that was done for the MSX, developed by compile and released in 1987.

1293
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:23,780
Then Sega licensed it in 88 and did a remake of it for the Sega Master System, which was the Mark 3 in Japan.

1294
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,780
And that's the version that actually this music is coming from, because I couldn't find the MSX one.

1295
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:37,780
And then later on, compile also did a remake for the MSX2 that was called Shin Mao Golvelius, which was True Devil Golvelius.

1296
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Although, is that true or new? I don't know.

1297
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:46,780
Anyway, it looks like the Sega Master System version, but had different layouts.

1298
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:57,780
Now the thing about this game is that it actually was announced that it would be coming out on the iOS platform.

1299
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:15,780
In 2009. I actually haven't seen if it actually did, but there was a spin-off game that was called Super Cooks that was released in 1989 with the disc station Special Rokugo.

1300
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,780
So yeah, it's kind of a neat little game.

1301
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:31,780
Basically, this game, I have to say the American artwork is just another one of the sufferers of the really bad 80s style let's change the awesome artwork that it had into shit.

1302
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:41,780
But anyway, the game has got some really interesting type of motion mechanics in it.

1303
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:51,780
Can I just say this whole thing we're looking at right now in the video where the power bar and the gold and everything is scrolling on the screen repeatedly.

1304
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,780
The whole level itself is scrolling.

1305
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,780
Yeah, it's so weird.

1306
01:10:54,780 --> 01:11:01,780
And see, that's one of the things. When you're exploring your overworld, it's just the standard above ground thing.

1307
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:08,780
Then you have these levels that are like this that Rob was describing, where it's almost like you're playing a scrolling shooter.

1308
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,780
Yeah, it's like a shooter, but with a sword and shield type of thing.

1309
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,780
It is compile. I mean, hello.

1310
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,780
True.

1311
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:19,780
But you're just walking around stabbing things and then killing gigantic, cute looking, weird bats.

1312
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:27,780
The other types of levels that you have in here are side scrolling levels, platform style.

1313
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:36,780
Where one of the first ones that you do is the one with the giant red snake in it and you shoot all the little cute baby snakes and the red snake just looks at you disapprovingly.

1314
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:40,780
And then you stab him in the face and he dies, which is what you're supposed to do with snakes apparently.

1315
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:51,780
Then, as you go through it, I mean, really the way to make it through this game is to grind, to grind, to grind.

1316
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:56,780
And find your shopkeepers, buy stuff, you can get potions to extend your life meter.

1317
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:04,780
You get bibles, and bibles increase the amount of gold you can carry, which is very apt of religion in the United States.

1318
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,780
I wonder if that's the same all over the world.

1319
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:11,780
You know, but it's just really a grind heavy game.

1320
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:16,780
But it's got different, it's pretty straight forward in how you play it.

1321
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,780
It doesn't really have a lot of the puzzle solving stuff.

1322
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:24,780
It's just really, you know, you have the side scrolling stages, you have the overhead stages.

1323
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,780
Sorry.

1324
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,780
And also, once you scroll the screen, you can't backtrack, so you have to keep going forward.

1325
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:36,780
And you can really get stuck in tight places, you know, if you've got your screen scrolled just the wrong way.

1326
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,780
But you do have a big, huge world to explore.

1327
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,780
And it's really detailed.

1328
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:50,780
It really makes the most of the capabilities of the, definitely the Master System at the time.

1329
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:54,780
And like I said, I tried to find some more of the MSX version.

1330
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,780
The MSX2 Govellia sequel is actually really, really nice as well.

1331
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:03,780
And I mean, some of the writing in it is like super, super funny.

1332
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:10,780
There's even a place where, you know, you find a woman and she's mistranslated.

1333
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:14,780
And it says, why, thou art but a moron of the first class, hit the road.

1334
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,780
And, you know, it's just a fun little game.

1335
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:23,780
And like even the levels have some fun type of things thrown in here and there.

1336
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:35,780
And like in the snake level, for example, when you get to the end of it, there's actually like an arrow built into the ground when you get past the snake.

1337
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,780
You're in the one with the big snakes.

1338
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:42,780
But keep in mind, you know, the other stuff that Compile did, they did the Alest series.

1339
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,780
They did Zanac, which I've covered. Puyo Puyo.

1340
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:51,780
They did Maru Monogatari for, you know, if you're looking, again, to RPGs.

1341
01:13:51,780 --> 01:14:02,780
But really, Golvelius is, I'd even say it's probably got to be one of the unsung classics of the adventure RPG genre.

1342
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:07,780
And yeah, it did actually come out on iOS.

1343
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:12,780
So I knew about it, but I didn't get it.

1344
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,780
So I actually didn't see if it did, if it was available.

1345
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,780
But it's the Sega Master System version that has touch controls.

1346
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,780
So definitely go get the game. It's pretty neat.

1347
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,780
It's Golvelius.

1348
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,780
Devil Golvelius.

1349
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,780
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1350
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:35,780
Golvelius for the Sega Master System is what we're looking at here in studio, but MSX sounds like probably the definitive version there.

1351
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:40,780
Actually, for the one that most people would have seen would have been the Master System one.

1352
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,780
Well, here anyway.

1353
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:48,780
No, no, no. From what I understand, because it was the touched up graphical one, it ended up being one of the more notable ones.

1354
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:53,780
But yeah, but I mean, you know, the MSX was also, of course, super popular.

1355
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:57,780
But I've got the game. It's a fun little game.

1356
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,780
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1357
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,780
Not one I'm super familiar with, I've got to be honest.

1358
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,780
So that was pretty cool to learn something new tonight in the classic game of the week statement.

1359
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,780
I aim to educate.

1360
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,780
Well, we've got plenty more show to come, some rapid fire news.

1361
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:17,780
The Fookle Question of the Week, the mailbag, and plenty more to come.

1362
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,780
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1363
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,780
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1364
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:37,780
Live here on February the 16th of 2014 with the 540th episode of our show.

1365
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,780
And we've been talking a little bit about Flappy Vog and Dark Soccer.

1366
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:44,780
She just don't give a fuck tonight.

1367
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:49,780
No, not a single fuck has been, is being, or will be given.

1368
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,780
Because she is taco-less and this is upsetting.

1369
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,780
No, you know what it is? Is it like the last two days of completely carb-fested?

1370
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,780
Oh, that sounds awesome.

1371
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:06,780
It was awesome. I had Choco-Pon and Cream-Pon and On-Pon.

1372
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,780
And chocolate, lots of chocolate. And beer, lots of beer. I love beer.

1373
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,780
And I had a legit cheeseburger with a bun.

1374
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,780
Did you see that Jelly Belly is doing a beer flavor?

1375
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,780
Don't tell me these things.

1376
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,780
They supported what's-as-fuck, so I'm not giving them.

1377
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,780
Yeah, I know. They're kind of crappy.

1378
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,780
They don't, douchey people don't get my money.

1379
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,780
Jelly beans are really good though.

1380
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,780
Jelly bellies are really good. Other jelly beans are made of gummy material.

1381
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,780
They suck. I can't eat them because I'm allergic to them.

1382
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,780
See, I'm not gonna lie. I used to love, like on Easter,

1383
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:41,780
because that's like when you get all those types of jelly beans,

1384
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,780
I used to love getting the licorice ones are my favorite.

1385
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,780
And some people are like, ew!

1386
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:49,780
You and Dan can go hide in licorice land and eat that shit far away from me.

1387
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,780
It's the Dutch. It's got to be a Dutch thing. Is it? I don't know.

1388
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,780
I need to ask Sil. I'm bringing her up for the second time on tonight's show, but that's okay.

1389
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,780
I love Sil. I say that every time you mention Sil too.

1390
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,780
I don't like licorice.

1391
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,780
You don't like licorice? Are you Dutch, Loki?

1392
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,780
But you're not Dutch.

1393
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,780
Well, then maybe that's the thing.

1394
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,780
I'm not Dutch, but I have a Dutch name because of Dan. Dang it.

1395
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,780
I hate Starbursts a lot, Brad, from Pod Culture,

1396
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,780
because they have the stuff in it I'm allergic to, so they make me vomit.

1397
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,780
The jelly beans are really good though. He's right.

1398
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:22,780
They're the same stuff. They make me vomit.

1399
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,780
Well, I don't know. They don't taste like they don't have the texture of Starbursts at all.

1400
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:32,780
But the only ones I can actually eat are the ones that are actually the crystallized, like the jelly bellies are.

1401
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:38,780
They seem more like jelly bellies to me than regular jelly beans, but I don't know.

1402
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,780
I wouldn't risk it. It's not worth risking it. They're not that good.

1403
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,780
No, it's not worth risking it.

1404
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:49,780
But, Dan, I do actually buy him licorice.

1405
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:56,780
Even though I cannot stand the smell of it, he is respectful enough to be gracious

1406
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:02,780
when I sacrifice my olfactory senses to bring him a treat.

1407
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:06,780
He is kind enough to take it to work and not eat it in front of me.

1408
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,780
Alan will say, I went to the store and I got you a surprise.

1409
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:16,780
It's either good and plenty, which I really like, or the Australian licorice that they sell at the store.

1410
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:20,780
But, to be fair, I will also buy him mayonnaise. That's love.

1411
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:25,780
I bought Dan something awesome. You'll hate it, but I bought him cool because I love him.

1412
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,780
I also can't be around sriracha because the smell makes my nose break out.

1413
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,780
Oh, yeah.

1414
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,780
I got him sriracha mayonnaise.

1415
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,780
He is a happy, happy Dan.

1416
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,780
No thanks.

1417
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,780
I can't have Swedish Fish either because they totally just make me...

1418
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,780
Swedish Fish are the bomb.

1419
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,780
Yuck.

1420
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:46,780
Alright, anyway.

1421
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,780
And I hate absinthe.

1422
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:53,780
We could talk about candy all night long. I did not have absinthe until...

1423
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,780
You know what?

1424
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,780
Dragon Con this year.

1425
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,780
You know what I brought you last week?

1426
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,780
And I don't know if you had any of it.

1427
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,780
I haven't, but I think Alan did.

1428
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:04,780
I made vanilla... I'm making a full bottle of vanilla vodka right now.

1429
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,780
Nice.

1430
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,780
Alright, look. We could talk about booze. We could talk about candy.

1431
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,780
You're listening to Orange Booze Radio.

1432
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,780
We're now CoinTrow Radio.

1433
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,780
Cause it's orange liqueur.

1434
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,780
Let's get back into games with the rapid fire news segment.

1435
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,780
Loki, start us off.

1436
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,780
Alright.

1437
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,780
Alright.

1438
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,780
So, first up, South Park.

1439
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,780
You know, it's been pushed back and back and back and back.

1440
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,780
It's finally gone gold.

1441
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,780
So, South Park The Stick of Truth will actually be releasing on March 6th.

1442
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,780
Which is only a few weeks away.

1443
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:38,780
And they even teased about 13 minutes of gameplay and it looks fantastic.

1444
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:43,780
So, that'll be coming out on current gen systems and on PC.

1445
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,780
It looks like...

1446
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,780
Was it the...

1447
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:51,780
6th is also a European day.

1448
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,780
I want to say maybe coming out on the 4th over here.

1449
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:58,780
Yeah, I'm sorry. The 4th of March for North America.

1450
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:01,780
The 6th for Europe.

1451
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,780
And then, let's see.

1452
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:08,780
Gearbox has announced their final DLC for Borderlands 2.

1453
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:12,780
And Borderlands 2 is going to be getting two campaigns.

1454
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,780
So, first, they was, let's see here.

1455
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:21,780
featuring Sir Hamlock and it's...

1456
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,780
Did we lose Loki? We lost you, Loki.

1457
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,780
I don't know if it's your magic mute button.

1458
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,780
Hello?

1459
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,780
Hello?

1460
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,780
Hi.

1461
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,780
Welcome back.

1462
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,780
That's weird.

1463
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,780
This live thing is weird.

1464
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,780
Okay, no. Keep going. We lost you for a minute. That was weird.

1465
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,780
That's strange.

1466
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:47,780
Okay, yeah. So, they have a couple new pieces of DLC.

1467
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:51,780
One is Sir Hamlock versus the son of CrawlerMax.

1468
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,780
That's supposed to be coming out, I think, later this year.

1469
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,780
And then, let's see.

1470
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:03,780
They had another one for Valentine's Day recently that was...

1471
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,780
Oh, I'm sorry. That is the final Borderlands DLC.

1472
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,780
I was going to say they had one more that just came out.

1473
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:17,780
It was for Valentine's Day featuring Mad Moxie and the two rival clans that were in Borderlands 2.

1474
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,780
I can't remember their names.

1475
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,780
It's kind of like some hillbilly clans in there.

1476
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:27,780
And so you had to kind of bring them together with some forbidden wedding thing.

1477
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,780
It was pretty funny.

1478
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,780
But they put that out for Valentine's Day.

1479
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:37,780
But this one, I don't think they've given a date yet when this is supposed to be coming out.

1480
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,780
But it's only supposed to be April 5th.

1481
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:45,780
So, $2.99 on April 5th.

1482
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,780
So, wow.

1483
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,780
They've been really...

1484
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,780
Considering that this game came out in 2012, they've really supported it with some DLC.

1485
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,780
That's for sure.

1486
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,780
Alright, and then...

1487
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,780
Let's see, I was going to say last but not least.

1488
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:07,780
We have The Witcher 3 is going to be a possibility on Linux.

1489
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,780
That's suing how well SteamOS does.

1490
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:20,780
If it ends up being popular enough, they will go ahead and create a version for SteamBoxes and SteamOS.

1491
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:24,780
But their comment of course was,

1492
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:30,780
First of all, we have a lot of respect for Steam and we think they are very, very good business guys and good gamer friendly guys.

1493
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,780
And that's really, really important.

1494
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:39,780
We like what they're doing with the SteamBox and if they're able to deliver a cool console, definitely we are interested in having a game there.

1495
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:45,780
You know, one of the reasons we have not released Witcher on Linux is that the most...

1496
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:53,780
Probably they have to address five different versions of Linux and this is always terrible, the support quality of the game afterwards.

1497
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,780
The patches, the updates and everything.

1498
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:01,780
If Steam will deliver a constant Linux environment and call it SteamOS or anything like that, we'd love to have our games there.

1499
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,780
Because, you know, most of the people play our games.

1500
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,780
The more people that play our games, the better for us.

1501
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:15,780
So, cool, we'll have to see how that turns out and maybe we'll get Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk 2077 or something like that.

1502
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,780
I wonder how some of the Linux fans feel about that though.

1503
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:24,780
That like, you know, they're waiting for SteamOS to kind of unify it when maybe people are attracted to Linux because it's not that way.

1504
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:25,780
You know what I mean?

1505
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,780
So, hmm.

1506
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,780
Alright, moving on with some more news.

1507
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:33,780
A very interesting statement from Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

1508
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,780
I don't know if you have played this game.

1509
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,780
It's on like the 3DS and it's on the Wii U, it's on Steam and all this.

1510
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:46,780
But the developer, Renegade Kid, says he has seen the best sales for Mutant Mudds Deluxe on Wii U.

1511
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,780
Which might be surprising.

1512
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,780
Better than PSN and Steam combined.

1513
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,780
He mentioned this on Twitter.

1514
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:58,780
And there was also a follow-up tweet that said the 3DS was undoubtedly the most popular platform for Mutant Mudds Deluxe.

1515
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:03,780
Which was a free content download on the original Mutant Mudds game for the 3DS.

1516
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,780
But, yeah.

1517
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,780
Apparently it's doing very, very well on Wii U, so go figure.

1518
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:13,780
I wonder if that's just because there's not a lot else available there.

1519
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
I don't know.

1520
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,780
Alright.

1521
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:16,780
But, yeah.

1522
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,780
Anyhow, going on to other games.

1523
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:23,780
These are some real classics that are coming to Steam.

1524
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,780
Descent. Do you remember Descent?

1525
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,780
I had Descent on 14 disks.

1526
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:29,780
Yeah.

1527
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,780
Please insert disc one. Please insert disc two.

1528
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,780
No, no, no, no.

1529
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,780
I told you about my friend Avery in Alabama, right?

1530
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,780
Probably a while ago, yeah.

1531
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,780
Who built the chair.

1532
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,780
Mm-hmm.

1533
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:43,780
That had, like, two full-sized joysticks, extra things, and all this.

1534
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,780
Just so he could play Descent.

1535
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,780
That's awesome.

1536
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,780
Yeah, I know Descent.

1537
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,780
But, yeah. It goes full 360 degrees.

1538
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,780
It's like Doom in 360. That's kind of what Descent is.

1539
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:52,780
So, it's awesome.

1540
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,780
It's actually now on Steam.

1541
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,780
It's not coming to Steam. It is now on Steam.

1542
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:00,780
350. So, no more 14 disks.

1543
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,780
Have. Must have.

1544
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,780
Digital download.

1545
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:03,780
Must shoot everything.

1546
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,780
There it is.

1547
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,780
Descent, by the way.

1548
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:08,780
Guess how old Descent is. Uh-oh.

1549
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:09,780
Old as balls.

1550
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,780
19 years old.

1551
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,780
Older than this show, so, yes.

1552
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:15,780
Older than some of our listeners.

1553
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,780
All right, yeah.

1554
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,780
Also coming to Steam, however.

1555
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,780
See, Dark Soccer, I wouldn't hit the buy button on Descent just yet,

1556
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:26,780
because then you may not have the money for Ikaruga is coming out on Steam.

1557
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,780
Do you know how many freaking copies of Ikaruga I have?

1558
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,780
Well, what's one more?

1559
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,780
Dan will be the one getting that.

1560
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,780
I actually already bought BlazBlue.

1561
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,780
That will be coming out actually on February 18th.

1562
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,780
So, you have a couple more days.

1563
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:40,780
But, yeah.

1564
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:44,780
As you might remember, Ikaruga, Dreamcast, GameCube, 360.

1565
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:47,780
The Steam version, by the way, is based on the 360 release.

1566
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:51,780
And you can just plug in a 360 controller via USB, and voila.

1567
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,780
It'll magically work. Imagine that.

1568
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,780
You know what's funny?

1569
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:58,780
Dan needs to just put on playthroughs of Ikaruga so he can take a nap.

1570
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,780
Because the music is so good.

1571
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:04,780
Very interesting little experiment going on at Twitch TV.

1572
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,780
Something called Twitch Plays Pokemon.

1573
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,780
Yes, it's where you have this Twitch stream,

1574
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:17,780
but you actually have the viewers can control the hero of Pokemon Red and Blue

1575
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,780
by actually putting commands in the chat window.

1576
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:25,780
And at one point, there was 10,000 viewers after two days of play,

1577
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,780
and people just typing A, B, up, down, and so forth.

1578
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:33,780
And the Pokemon Master, of course, he just runs around in circles a lot of the time

1579
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,780
because people can't seem to coordinate how to do it.

1580
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,780
But, yeah.

1581
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:43,780
Apparently, though, viewers did get far enough to get past Misty, the second gym leader.

1582
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,780
So, it's not all just running around in circles.

1583
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,780
So, maybe late at night, people have been able to coordinate a little better

1584
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,780
and be able to battle Misty.

1585
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,780
I don't know if it's still going. I think it is.

1586
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,780
You know what? I want to battle Misty for real.

1587
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,780
We need to get her back on the show so we can battle.

1588
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,780
October, I believe, is when.

1589
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,780
Okay, you better come with all of your Pokemon.

1590
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:01,780
I'm kidding.

1591
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,780
I'm trying to see if the video will come up.

1592
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:06,780
Oh, God, I probably broke our own stream trying to pull this up.

1593
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,780
That was done.

1594
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,780
Okay, yes, it's still going.

1595
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,780
Good Lord.

1596
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,780
That's all you get.

1597
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,780
That slowed my computer to a crawl there.

1598
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,780
I didn't want to lose our own feed.

1599
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,780
All right.

1600
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,780
So, an interesting little experiment.

1601
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,780
Who knows what game will come next after that?

1602
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,780
Act F says the update is they currently have four gym badges.

1603
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,780
So, it might actually beat the game.

1604
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,780
Who knows?

1605
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,780
Dark Soccer, your turn.

1606
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,780
There's some stuff.

1607
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,780
First of all, this one makes me stupidly happy

1608
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:41,780
because what is one game that I have always just gone completely off about?

1609
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,780
It's Awesometasticness.

1610
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,780
Fucking Drunken Robot Pornography.

1611
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:46,780
Hell yeah.

1612
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:52,780
So, on February 19th, it is going live.

1613
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,780
I have been playing in the early access.

1614
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:58,780
That game is fucking amazing, and it's fucking hard.

1615
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:04,780
So, it was made by a company called Dejobaan, and it's just awesome.

1616
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:09,780
I mean, you can basically just shoot them with everything.

1617
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:17,780
It's really a lot of, like, maybe a cross between Oratorio Tengram,

1618
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,780
Virtual On, and Jumping Flash, and games like that.

1619
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,780
But it's crazy, and the music is amazing.

1620
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:30,780
It's going to retail for 15 bucks, but it may have a Steam discount on launch day.

1621
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,780
Everyone get this game.

1622
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,780
It is awesome.

1623
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:42,780
So, also, there is another game coming out for the Dreamcast.

1624
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,780
It's Neo XYX.

1625
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,780
That is another shooting game. Yay!

1626
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:52,780
So, I mean, the Dreamcast is 15 years old.

1627
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,780
Actually, it's Neo Xixu.

1628
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:57,780
That's how it's pronounced, so I said it incorrectly.

1629
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:04,780
And it's like Truxton and Batsugun, so it's like those other arcade games.

1630
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,780
So, yay.

1631
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,780
And, um, I won.

1632
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:10,780
Also, Sonic Boom.

1633
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:15,780
I don't know how I feel about this, because Royd Knuckles is just not attractive.

1634
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:22,780
There is actually an interview out that has some details about it.

1635
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:23,780
So, it's going to be...

1636
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,780
They're going to be using the Wii U gamepad for map upgrades,

1637
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:32,780
and some other functions that they have not completely unveiled.

1638
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,780
And then, um, all the games...

1639
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,780
All the levels are connected by story and location.

1640
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,780
It's supposed to be more organically challenging.

1641
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:44,780
It's an adventure style with currency and upgrades.

1642
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,780
And, yeah, I still don't know how I feel about it, so...

1643
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:53,780
But they are taking inspiration from Sonic 2, Sonic Adventure, and Sonic Generations.

1644
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:56,780
And those were all good games, so maybe.

1645
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,780
Maybe it'd be fun.

1646
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,780
It could be crap, too, so...

1647
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,780
I'm just being honest.

1648
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,780
It's a night of honesty. It could be crap.

1649
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,780
But it might not be.

1650
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,780
It might be okay.

1651
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,780
We'll see.

1652
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,780
Um, are you looking more...

1653
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:14,780
Are you looking...

1654
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:20,780
Well, I guess the question would be are you looking less forward to the game or the cartoon?

1655
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,780
I might just hide under my bed when the cartoon comes out.

1656
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,780
The cartoon didn't look that bad.

1657
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,780
I think the cartoon's probably getting better than the game.

1658
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:30,780
I mean, because their games haven't really been that great to be in with.

1659
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:34,780
Oh, and it's Nintendo exclusive, so I'm sure that'll sell somewhere we use systems, right?

1660
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:38,780
Yeah, you never know. You never know. Kids. Kids.

1661
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,780
Maybe.

1662
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,780
Do kids even care about Sonic, though? That's the thing.

1663
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,780
Does anyone care anymore about that series?

1664
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:47,780
It looks like really bad fan art.

1665
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,780
It's just...

1666
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,780
Ugh. Okay, sorry.

1667
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,780
No, it's fine. It happens.

1668
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:57,780
I can't right now. I really have lost the ability to can, so let's continue.

1669
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:01,780
Alright, um, I'm gonna get to the frugal question of the week, but for whatever reason I didn't have...

1670
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,780
I was trying to buy myself a little time because I don't have my little bumper.

1671
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,780
Well, you know what else I could say since we're having a night of honesty?

1672
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:09,780
Sure. Why not?

1673
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:20,780
I think that the best ever Sonic thing that has ever come out of anything in the newer era that they did something different with was Sonic Adventure.

1674
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:24,780
And then Sonic Adventure 2 came out and it was kind of turd-like.

1675
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:29,780
I mean, it had some fun parts, but it was kind of turd-like, but Sonic Generations was really good.

1676
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:35,780
It's like, I don't know what's going on. Like, sometimes they smoke, like, something really good and have a great Sonic game.

1677
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:39,780
And then sometimes you just get that bad batch of, like...

1678
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,780
Sonic 2006.

1679
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:42,780
Of, like, tainted heroin.

1680
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:44,780
Sonic the Bad Batch?

1681
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:47,780
Yeah, and they make Sonic the Bad Batch.

1682
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:50,780
It's, like, tainted.

1683
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,780
OrangeLunchRadio.com. Use the passphrase, Frost.

1684
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,780
All right. I found bumper music, so let's get to the...

1685
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,780
How was my buying time, Rob?

1686
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,780
It was good.

1687
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:07,780
Hey, it's not a show if we don't talk about tainted heroin.

1688
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:20,780
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together, you get FUGL.

1689
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:25,780
It's the FUGL question of the week, and this week is a little more about classic games.

1690
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,780
Inspired a little bit by our own classic game of the week segment.

1691
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:33,780
Look, we have all heard of Super Mario Brothers and Alex Kidd, Legend of Zelda, Phantasy Star.

1692
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:41,780
What do you think, however, is a game from the NES and Sega Master System era that has been grossly neglected by time?

1693
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,780
Let's get to some of the answers here.

1694
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:50,780
Ragenator says, most of the good ones haven't been neglected, but Mike Tyson's Punch-Out could have used more sequels.

1695
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:53,780
There were two. There was the one on the Super Nintendo and then they did a Wii one.

1696
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,780
Some people forget about the Wii one.

1697
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,780
And you can't have Mike Tyson's name on it anymore because he's crazy.

1698
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,780
That's right.

1699
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,780
What?

1700
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:06,780
Alternatively, T&C Surf Designs, while being somewhat mediocre, could have seen some more love.

1701
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:16,780
Nemesis 47 says, it's a Japanese import game on the Genesis, but one that comes to mind is Pulseman on the system along with Ristar and Mutant League.

1702
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:21,780
I said Master System, not Genesis, but I guess I'll accept it anyway because I just read it.

1703
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:25,780
Awesome Unicorn says, Legend of the Ghost Lion.

1704
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:34,780
It was an old NES RPG starring a female protagonist, and it could have created a much larger presence for serious games of the girly edge if others had followed his lead.

1705
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:41,780
Kane IM says, Caveman Olympics for the NES. How else are you supposed to hit your friend with a stick?

1706
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:43,780
With a stick?

1707
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:48,780
But if he says, if we're just going by that time period in general, how about a Zork remake?

1708
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,780
Dude, Zork was pretty awesome.

1709
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:54,780
I wonder who owns the rights to that now. I'm sure it's on Wikipedia or something.

1710
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:59,780
But then there was like the Zork, that first CD-ROM game, Zork Returns.

1711
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,780
There was like Zork Grand Inquisition and all that stuff.

1712
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:09,780
For the short time GameTap was really cool, like I played all those Zork games again on there because Zork is cool.

1713
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:16,780
Emily C says, Marble Madness is due for a reboot. It could be enhanced with the capabilities of the Wii U or 3DS.

1714
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:21,780
Check out a game on the Wii that would actually work on the Wii U called Koro Impa.

1715
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:27,780
Because this came up on the show not that long ago. I think Marble Madness is the classic game of the week, but Koro Impa is very, very similar.

1716
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:31,780
Well, Koro Impa is more like Super Monkey Ball, I think.

1717
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:35,780
Oh, that's a good point too. Well, Super Monkey Ball in turn is very similar too.

1718
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:39,780
But yes, Marble Madness was a good game.

1719
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:47,780
Dart Tetsuya says, Crystallis, SNK should stop with the fighting game nonsense and give us a sequel.

1720
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:52,780
Daniel S. replied and said, Where are my Lolo games at?

1721
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:57,780
Where did Lolo go? Did Lolo and Lala get married and go to puzzle heaven?

1722
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:59,780
They got stomped flat, now they're being used for Bingo.

1723
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:09,780
Degenerate Johnny says, Bad News Baseball. There's something about having pink umpires in this game that made it so addicting.

1724
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,780
Not to mention, I believe this was the only baseball game on which there were teams for both men and women.

1725
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:17,780
If we had the Bad News series today, I would come back to the sports gaming genre.

1726
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,780
I thought that was Baseball Stars. Maybe it was both.

1727
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:23,780
Is it like the Bad News Bears?

1728
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:26,780
I think it's inspired without copying, yes.

1729
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:32,780
Let's see, Harold the Wonder Dog replied and said, Star Tropics.

1730
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,780
Yes.

1731
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,780
Wasn't Star Tropics 2 one of the very last NES games?

1732
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,780
So was Revenge, yeah.

1733
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,780
I'm surprised you haven't rebooted that franchise.

1734
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:44,780
Ospurr with another Sega Genesis answer.

1735
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,780
Steph said that Lolo and Lala are Kirby characters.

1736
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:50,780
Are they really? I didn't realize that.

1737
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:54,780
I guess they do because it's the same studio that ended up making them.

1738
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:57,780
Aren't they like Lolo and Lala?

1739
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:02,780
I guess that's true, yeah. They're like the king and the queen or something like that.

1740
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:06,780
Anyway, moving on, we have...

1741
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,780
Did I say Ospurr said Ristar?

1742
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:15,780
Let's see, which by the way is another Genesis answer. Shame, shame.

1743
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:19,780
Katsuhiko J says, Jackal and Iron Tank deserve a sequel or reboot.

1744
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,780
That's not a real name so you can say the full thing.

1745
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,780
Oh, well, I... Look.

1746
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,780
It's after an anime.

1747
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:29,780
Anyway, as Joe 100 Matt says, Blades of Steel.

1748
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:35,780
It's probably the most important sports game of its time and still that one sports game that people don't mind playing.

1749
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:40,780
The last Blades of Steel game was on the N64. I didn't even realize that on N64.

1750
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,780
But a reboot of the classic will be well received.

1751
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,780
Chigurh says, EVO.

1752
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:50,780
I love that game and our Mormon friends weren't allowed to play it because it was promoting evolution.

1753
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,780
Really? Really?

1754
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,780
I think it was pretty awesome though.

1755
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:58,780
Get this, get this, Arcadian42.

1756
01:36:58,780 --> 01:36:59,780
I miss him.

1757
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:03,780
Well, get this, get this. He didn't, he was not, he does not know what was gonna be on the show tonight in advance.

1758
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:07,780
You know what his answer was? Golvellius.

1759
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,780
So there you go, Arcadian42.

1760
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,780
You win some air.

1761
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,780
You win. He did mention it has some pretty memorable music.

1762
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,780
It does have good music.

1763
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,780
There you go.

1764
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,780
It's fucking weird.

1765
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:21,780
B replied and said, I was also gonna say Star Tropics, but here's a few more.

1766
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:26,780
Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Tailspin, Darkwing Duck, Adventures in the Magic Kingdom,

1767
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,780
Battletoads, Casino Kid, Wall Street Kid, and River City Ransom.

1768
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:31,780
That's a pretty lengthy list.

1769
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,780
But yeah, those Capcom Disney games were the bomb.

1770
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,780
Well, they did end up doing DuckTales.

1771
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,780
DuckTales?

1772
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,780
So if maybe, there's a chance, Ryan. There's a chance.

1773
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:44,780
For the record, I'm actually looking to see if Golvellius is still in the store.

1774
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:49,780
Dr. Noir says, the very first Western RPG I played was Sword and Sorcery,

1775
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:53,780
and the character customization and the horribly difficult puzzles made for a very exciting challenge.

1776
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:56,780
It is, and it's only two bucks.

1777
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:00,780
Hitstun says, let's see a Sunsoft NES compilation.

1778
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:05,780
Everybody knows Blaster Master and the Batman games, but more people should play Super Spy Hunter.

1779
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:12,780
Known as Battle Formula in Japan, its aimable second gun pushed cross-country, excuse me, vehicular combat to its limits.

1780
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:18,780
At the title screen, press A, B, select start to play a roulette game to decide how many lives you start with.

1781
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,780
You might have up to 12 lives, but you might be stuck with just one life.

1782
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:26,780
You know what was another Sunsoft NES game that came up on Twitter today in random conversation?

1783
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,780
Adventure Island?

1784
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:31,780
No, that wasn't Sunsoft. That was, uh, no, that was Hal.

1785
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,780
Hal, the B, Hudson.

1786
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,780
Hudson, yeah.

1787
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:44,780
Fester's Quest, which was basically Blaster Master's overhead stuff without the car stuff, which kind of made it not as good, but yeah.

1788
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:47,780
Dando said, I'd have to say River City Ransom and Marble Madness.

1789
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:51,780
There was a great GBA remake of River City Ransom, but I need more.

1790
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:58,780
Renee said, on the NES, Wampum, which is a Native American themed Mega Man clone.

1791
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,780
I didn't realize, actually no, I think I have heard of that game.

1792
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,780
And Amanda R. replied and said, the Lufia series.

1793
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,780
So there you go.

1794
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,780
Very good answers over on Facebook.

1795
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,780
But wait, there's more, because we have to get to the Google Plus answers, of which we have just a handful here.

1796
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,780
Flaco Jones, who was gonna be here tonight, but got sick.

1797
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:20,780
So get better soon, Flaco.

1798
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:21,780
Stop getting the plague.

1799
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:23,780
Yeah, we will have him on the show in the future.

1800
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,780
He was supposed to be here tonight, but sadly couldn't make it.

1801
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:29,780
Flaco Jones said, I love the NES ports of the Mac Venture games,

1802
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:34,780
but while most people liked Uninvited or Shadow Gate most, my favorite was Deja Vu.

1803
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:37,780
Still one of my all-time favorite games, despite the cheap deaths.

1804
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:40,780
Well, they are doing a Shadow Gate remake, for what it's worth.

1805
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:44,780
I know Deja Vu is your favorite, but they have that Kickstarter for Shadow Gate.

1806
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:45,780
So that's coming soon.

1807
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,780
I was, I don't know, I kicked like 60 bucks to that game or something to get my name in the credits.

1808
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:51,780
So, excited to see that.

1809
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,780
Oh my god, it just occurred to me.

1810
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,780
I can afford to kickstart now.

1811
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,780
Awesome.

1812
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,780
Well, change your password though, because you know.

1813
01:39:58,780 --> 01:39:59,780
Yeah, and all that.

1814
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:00,780
Yeah, and all that fuckery.

1815
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:03,780
I don't even think I've ever done, bought anything on there yet.

1816
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:04,780
Mmm.

1817
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,780
Retertainment says, Skate or Die.

1818
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,780
Yeah, I'll call that game.

1819
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:09,780
Didn't they have Ski or Die?

1820
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:10,780
I thought they did.

1821
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:11,780
Was like, kind of the sequel.

1822
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:12,780
I think they did.

1823
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,780
There was Ski or Die, I think came out later.

1824
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:15,780
Mmm.

1825
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,780
And lastly, Act F says, RC Pro-Am.

1826
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,780
Ha ha.

1827
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,780
That game doesn't get the love it deserves.

1828
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,780
It's fun and challenging, and it could seriously use a new version.

1829
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:29,780
I thought you were about to say it seriously needed a neutering.

1830
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:35,780
Well, you guys, those were really good answers all around, but I'm going to express my disappointment with all of you.

1831
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,780
None of them said the game.

1832
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,780
None of them said the correct answer.

1833
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:39,780
None of them.

1834
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:45,780
Not a single one of them said the correct answer to this question, which is the Guardian Legend.

1835
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:51,780
Fail. Fail. Fail.

1836
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,780
Good lord.

1837
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:57,780
Loki, would you answer the Guardian Legend as well, or do you have your own answer for that?

1838
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,780
Oh, I think Guardian Legend is good.

1839
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:01,780
There you go, that's the correct answer.

1840
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,780
I would probably say, um...

1841
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,780
The Guardian Legend.

1842
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:07,780
Sure, because I can't remember.

1843
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:08,780
More Space Harrier.

1844
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,780
I like Breakthrough.

1845
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:10,780
Breakthrough is kind of fun.

1846
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,780
Okay.

1847
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,780
I don't know if it was a really great game.

1848
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,780
Buy it at Commando.

1849
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:18,780
Oh, except that new one they did on the 360 and stuff was not that good.

1850
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,780
You know what we need a new one of?

1851
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,780
I don't care.

1852
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,780
I got them on PC too during the Steam sale.

1853
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,780
But the remakes were really good.

1854
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,780
Yeah, Dark Saga?

1855
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,780
A new Fantasy Zone.

1856
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,780
Ah, that'd be fun.

1857
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:29,780
Yep.

1858
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:30,780
There you go.

1859
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,780
And not just the re-releases like they did with the Sega Ages.

1860
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,780
We need a new Fantasy Zone.

1861
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,780
I would love to see...

1862
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:39,780
A game I was randomly thinking about today was Life Force.

1863
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,780
Or, you know, Salamander, if you will.

1864
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:43,780
We haven't really seen that series in a while.

1865
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,780
So, I'd like to see that.

1866
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,780
But we're getting other Gradius stuff.

1867
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,780
Have we?

1868
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:49,780
When was the last time we had a Gradius game?

1869
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:51,780
Gradius 5 was the last one.

1870
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:52,780
Gradius 5 was the last one.

1871
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,780
That was a while ago.

1872
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,780
That was PlayStation 2, right?

1873
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,780
That was a while ago.

1874
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:58,780
That's what I want.

1875
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:02,780
Anyhow, but Konami would rather make two-hour Metal Gear games.

1876
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,780
Anyhow.

1877
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,780
Two-hour?

1878
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,780
No, two...

1879
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:08,780
Metal Gear games with two-hour endings.

1880
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,780
Well, no, there's that.

1881
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:12,780
There was a whole controversy last week about the...

1882
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,780
It's basically the prologue game.

1883
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,780
But anyway, I'm not gonna go there.

1884
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:17,780
It's old news.

1885
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:19,780
They said it's like four hours now.

1886
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,780
I think they had another playthrough that didn't do any of the side stuff.

1887
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,780
And they said four hours.

1888
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,780
Oh, wow.

1889
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,780
Alright.

1890
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:26,780
Yeah.

1891
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:27,780
Let's move on with some other news.

1892
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:28,780
This week's news, Loki.

1893
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,780
This week's news.

1894
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,780
This week's news?

1895
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,780
Okay, I'll try.

1896
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:37,780
So, we talked about, I think, before that there was some information leaked out about

1897
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,780
a bunch of different things that were supposed to be coming out.

1898
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,780
This is from NeoGaf and stuff.

1899
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,780
And one of which was the Halo 2 Anniversary Edition.

1900
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,780
Kind of like the HD remake that they did of Halo 1.

1901
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:52,780
Well, now there's even more fuel to that that's supposed to be coming out this year.

1902
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,780
I think they said November was the original leak.

1903
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:59,780
And this is coming from the actual voice actor for Master Chief.

1904
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:04,780
Saying that, yeah, there's gonna be a new game.

1905
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:09,780
Something like, I wouldn't expect anything until 2015 for Halo 5.

1906
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:14,780
He says, but what you can look forward to this year is an Anniversary Edition of Halo 2.

1907
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:16,780
So.

1908
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:20,780
Well, now you know what's interesting about this being pretty much confirmed?

1909
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:25,780
Is that we had those rumors a few weeks ago from that, you know, the Xbox leak or whatever

1910
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:27,780
that was posted on NeoGaf.

1911
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:28,780
And it had all this other stuff.

1912
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,780
Yeah.

1913
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,780
Was it us?

1914
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,780
It was all the other...

1915
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:34,780
Is it in boat or...

1916
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:35,780
Us boat or something like that.

1917
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,780
The disc list, Xbox One and all this stuff.

1918
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:43,780
And, you know, I mean, it does sort of make you go, hmm, you know, that's one.

1919
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:46,780
But I did, I remember being a little bit critical of that post in the past

1920
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,780
because I was like, these are all safe bets it's making.

1921
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:52,780
So wouldn't Halo 2 Anniversary Edition be kind of a safe bet too?

1922
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,780
Yeah, but it is, it's okay.

1923
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:55,780
It's interesting.

1924
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:01,780
So it gets that, that little post gets a little more credit, but I'm still a little, so.

1925
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,780
Yeah.

1926
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,780
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com said it was Seaboat.

1927
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:10,780
And I think it turned out that Seaboat was a mod who hated Microsoft.

1928
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:13,780
They unearthed all that crap a few weeks ago, I think.

1929
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:15,780
Oh, internet drama.

1930
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:18,780
Girl.

1931
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:19,780
That's all I have to say.

1932
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:23,780
The internet has more drama than Dark Soccer's Animal Crossing Village

1933
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,780
and that's saying something right there.

1934
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:29,780
My village is pretty, well, now that that bitch Ed's gone, then I don't have any more drama.

1935
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,780
I don't know Dark Soccer, you've been...

1936
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,780
Except for Isabel's crack habit because, you know, she never sleeps.

1937
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,780
That too.

1938
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:39,780
I love Isabel, I really do.

1939
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:45,780
All right, well, there was a little exploit on PlayStation Network this week

1940
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:51,780
where somebody was able to exploit the 14-day PlayStation Plus trial subscription

1941
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,780
into about a 21-year subscription.

1942
01:44:54,780 --> 01:45:01,780
Basically, they signed in and they got the free 14-day PS Plus trial

1943
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,780
and they spammed the offer over and over and over again.

1944
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:09,780
They did this through the PlayStation 4 and, yeah, now this guy is a member until 2035.

1945
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,780
There has not been really a comment from Sony on this yet.

1946
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:15,780
I imagine they had to have closed this loophole up by now.

1947
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,780
But, yeah, you can't already have a membership in order to see this.

1948
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,780
So if you're already a PlayStation Plus member, you can't do this.

1949
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:24,780
Plus, if a bunch of people jump in on this, then Sony's really going to crack down.

1950
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:26,780
They're going to take away all those trials.

1951
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:33,780
But it does beg the question, like, how the hell did something this easy get exploited like this?

1952
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,780
I mean, this doesn't seem that hard that you could take a 14-day trial,

1953
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,780
which I guess was specifically branded for Outlast,

1954
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,780
and make it go on and on and on and on.

1955
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,780
I mean, doesn't this get tested somewhere along the line?

1956
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,780
Huh?

1957
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:49,780
Loki, did you try to extend your...

1958
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:51,780
Oh, you don't have PlayStation 4, though, yet, huh?

1959
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:53,780
I didn't try it.

1960
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:55,780
And, you know, I don't know.

1961
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:58,780
It would be wrong. Stealing is wrong.

1962
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,780
But it's an experiment for news.

1963
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:04,780
That's true. I'm pretty sure it's closed up now.

1964
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,780
We're doing it for the people.

1965
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:08,780
I know. I know.

1966
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,780
Just being honest.

1967
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,780
I want to see what happens next week, though, if that guy got it all taken away,

1968
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,780
or if he got the ban hammer.

1969
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:15,780
Probably a combination.

1970
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:17,780
We ban you. Although, I mean, he didn't hack it.

1971
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:20,780
He just exploited it. There's a huge difference.

1972
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:25,780
You know, if you just abused something that was there for the taking,

1973
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:28,780
did he really steal anything?

1974
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:29,780
It's an ethical question.

1975
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,780
They will say yes.

1976
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,780
They will say yes, but we'll see.

1977
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,780
All right. Moving on. DarkSakura.

1978
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:39,780
Oh, I've got stuff for you.

1979
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:43,780
There is a guy in Oslo who killed a bunch of people once,

1980
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:45,780
and so he's in prison now.

1981
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:48,780
His name is Anders Breivik, which I'm just laughing because it's Anders

1982
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:52,780
for anyone who's played Dragon Age 2.

1983
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,780
Because of the character in there also went crazy.

1984
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,780
Anyway, he killed 77 people in Oslo, Norway,

1985
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:01,780
and he's calling himself a human rights activist now

1986
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:04,780
because he's complaining that he only gets to play kids' video games

1987
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:07,780
while the other inmates gets to play grown-up video games.

1988
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,780
He's quoted as saying,

1989
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Other inmates have access to adult games

1990
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,780
while I only have the right to play less interesting kids' games.

1991
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:17,780
One example is Rayman Revolution, a game aimed at three-year-olds.

1992
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,780
He says he behaves better than most prisoners

1993
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,780
and deserves more liberties because of this,

1994
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:26,780
and that he considers himself a human rights activist.

1995
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:30,780
So you don't give people the right to kill people.

1996
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:31,780
You don't give people the right to live.

1997
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:32,780
You take that away from them,

1998
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:36,780
but you think you get rights to play video games that you want to.

1999
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,780
You want to know what's also shitty about this?

2000
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:42,780
He's serving a 21-year sentence, which is the maximum in Norway.

2001
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,780
Isn't this the guy that killed all those kids

2002
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,780
that were at the leadership camp or something?

2003
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:47,780
Isn't this that guy?

2004
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,780
Fuck that guy.

2005
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:52,780
Why is he getting to play a video game at all?

2006
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:54,780
He should sit in the corner and think about what he's done

2007
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:57,780
for a very, very, very long time, like eternity.

2008
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,780
According to Norway, that's 21 years.

2009
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,780
Oh my gosh.

2010
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:04,780
But his other complaint is that the chair in his cell is not up to his standards,

2011
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:07,780
and he would like to have access to a PC instead of a typewriter.

2012
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:09,780
Guess what? Too bad.

2013
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:12,780
Someone send this guy to prison in Korea, okay?

2014
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,780
North Korea.

2015
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,780
I'm sorry, specifically North Korea. My bad.

2016
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,780
I'm going to look this guy up, so keep going,

2017
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:21,780
and I'm going to look him up to make sure this is who I think it is.

2018
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,780
I see the picture there. I'm pretty sure it's that guy.

2019
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,780
What an ass.

2020
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,780
So yeah, and the chat room is backing me up there.

2021
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:31,780
SJ100Matt says, yes it is, Robin.

2022
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:36,780
SJ100Matt also says, I'm sorry, but why are any of them playing games to begin with?

2023
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:40,780
Marissa made a good point that they renew the sentences for five years at a time

2024
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:43,780
if they're determined to be a dangerous society, which, yeah,

2025
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,780
if you kill that many people.

2026
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,780
He bombed government buildings in Oslo,

2027
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:51,780
and then he had the mass shooting at the Workers' Youth League.

2028
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,780
Yeah, no. This guy needs to not be playing video games at all.

2029
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:56,780
That's a privilege.

2030
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:57,780
Yeah.

2031
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:00,780
Weird.

2032
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:05,780
He also is opposed to feminism and is an extreme Zionist,

2033
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,780
which gives all the rest of the people who are Zionists a bad name.

2034
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,780
And is not somebody whose name should ever be uttered again.

2035
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:12,780
He should be forgotten about.

2036
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,780
Yeah, banned from OLR.

2037
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:15,780
Yeah, I mean.

2038
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:17,780
Banned from everything.

2039
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,780
Gross.

2040
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,780
Night of honesty, scorpions at the ass.

2041
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:30,780
Let's talk about someone a bit more sane, Loki.

2042
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,780
All right.

2043
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:38,780
Peter Molyneux basically saying that, you know, talking,

2044
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:41,780
I think this is probably coming from the fact that, you know,

2045
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:45,780
he was looking at the Dungeon Keeper, you know, mobile game,

2046
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:49,780
which is kind of like, yeah, what did they do to my game?

2047
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:53,780
But basically saying that Goddess is going to be a,

2048
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:57,780
not a free to play game, but an invest to play game.

2049
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:03,780
Basically saying, you know, there cannot be a term that is less true.

2050
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:08,780
What we want is a new term and that term is more like invest to play.

2051
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:12,780
What we're really doing is we're tempting people, or what are we really doing?

2052
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:15,780
We're attempting people to invest some of their money into the game.

2053
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:21,780
And I guess it's kind of basically saying that they're incentivizing people

2054
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:26,780
to want to get the in-app purchases or in-game purchases and that kind of stuff.

2055
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:34,780
You know, to tempt people to think about being proud and to invest.

2056
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,780
Before we even talk about monetization,

2057
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:41,780
we want players to feel like Goddess is a hobby and not just a game.

2058
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,780
And then of course commenting on Dungeon Keeper,

2059
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:49,780
yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks,

2060
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:52,780
talking about the free to play formula,

2061
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,780
yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks are worth taking.

2062
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:56,780
We could layer it in.

2063
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:01,780
It takes six days to build this house and maybe we would make a shitload of money,

2064
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:04,780
but that's not my ambition for games.

2065
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:09,780
Yeah, because it was completely broken, that Dungeon Keeper game,

2066
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:14,780
and he's got to be disappointed what they did to his original IP.

2067
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:17,780
I thought Goddess was supposed to be like $9.99.

2068
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,780
Like, why are they now talking about invest to play or whatever?

2069
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:24,780
Like, I didn't, I thought this was a game that always was supposed to be,

2070
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,780
or are not enough people buying it or something.

2071
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:29,780
I think maybe they want to make more money.

2072
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:33,780
You know, maybe this is kind of like DLC or something.

2073
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,780
Hmm, maybe.

2074
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:39,780
All right, well, moving on to a story that never seems to die,

2075
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:42,780
it's about 38 Studios, remember when they,

2076
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:45,780
and you know, with all due respect,

2077
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:48,780
because I do understand that Curt Schilling a couple weeks ago

2078
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:51,780
had announced that he had cancer, you know, which sucks,

2079
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,780
fuck cancer, period.

2080
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,780
So I'm not saying all this to be mean,

2081
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:58,780
I'm just saying this to be very matter of fact,

2082
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,780
about the 38 Studios settlement bill,

2083
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:03,780
because obviously 38 Studios,

2084
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,780
there's not really a nice way for me to put it.

2085
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:08,780
It failed spectacularly, and a lot of money, you know,

2086
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,780
was put up by the state,

2087
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,780
and it's kind of one of those tough lessons learned,

2088
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,780
and you know, they didn't make it back.

2089
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:16,780
So anyhow, the Rhode Island House of Representatives

2090
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:22,780
actually passed this bill that's going to move on this out-of-court settlement.

2091
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:25,780
The bill passed in a vote of 53 to 16.

2092
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,780
It will protect the defendants who settle from lawsuits filed by codefendants

2093
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:31,780
over the damages those codefendants are found liable for.

2094
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,780
So in other words, the bill encourages settlements and so forth,

2095
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,780
so if a 38 Studios person settles with the state,

2096
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:41,780
they can't get those damages from any other 38 Studios official

2097
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:44,780
tied up in proceedings, so that bill is going to be signed.

2098
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:51,780
That bill goes along with the default on the $75 million loan

2099
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:58,780
that they gave to 38 Studios, where the state, I guess,

2100
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:01,780
they default on the loan, and Rhode Island gets off the hook

2101
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:04,780
for $12.5 million of payment.

2102
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,780
So I guess they basically just passed a bill that said,

2103
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:12,780
we're not going to pay the bill.

2104
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:14,780
That's kind of ironic.

2105
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,780
Isn't it?

2106
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:17,780
I want to do that.

2107
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:19,780
Isn't that great when government finally does something,

2108
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:24,780
and in this case it is, all right, we're going to vote majority

2109
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:27,780
that we're not going to pay the bills.

2110
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,780
That's just like the unemployment thing that happened.

2111
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:30,780
I won't go there.

2112
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:32,780
I thought that was federal government.

2113
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,780
Well, that's state or federal.

2114
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:37,780
Neither one of them is working.

2115
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:42,780
So anyhow, it's all broken.

2116
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:44,780
Fix it, Dark Sakura.

2117
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:45,780
Fix it.

2118
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:47,780
Oh, fuck.

2119
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,780
How about I just do other stuff?

2120
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,780
All right, how about you read some emails,

2121
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,780
because every week you guys send us emails,

2122
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:54,780
and for one more week you can send them to Mailbag

2123
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:57,780
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2124
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,780
Here we go, the emails.

2125
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:03,780
So of note, if you want to be the very last email ever

2126
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,780
at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

2127
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:06,780
this is the week to do it.

2128
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:07,780
Do not delay.

2129
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:08,780
Yeah.

2130
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,780
But we do have, what, one email tonight, two emails?

2131
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,780
We have two.

2132
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,780
Two?

2133
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:13,780
There was only one earlier.

2134
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,780
Yeah, well, someone got sneaky.

2135
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:16,780
All right.

2136
01:54:16,780 --> 01:54:19,780
Sneaky, sneaky monkey.

2137
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:22,780
Dear OLR, with another Valentine's Day coming,

2138
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,780
I have heard many people discussing their favorite video game relationships.

2139
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:29,780
While it's very easy to come up with examples of the types of relationships

2140
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,780
that will go down in history, side note, Cecil and Rosa forever,

2141
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:37,780
I am writing today about other types of relationships in video games,

2142
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:41,780
the relationships that are either doomed or nonexistent.

2143
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:44,780
Sorry.

2144
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:47,780
Personally, my favorite depiction of unrequited love in a video game

2145
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:51,780
is from Luthia to Rise of the Sinistrals.

2146
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:54,780
The relationship between the characters of Maxim and Tia

2147
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:57,780
has really touched me in the dozen or so times I've played the game.

2148
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,780
Tia, a small-town crybaby, leaves her life behind

2149
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:02,780
to follow the man of her dreams on his quest.

2150
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:05,780
Over the first half of the game, Tia has to come to terms with the fact

2151
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:10,780
that Maxim always is and always will be an adventurer with no plans of settling down.

2152
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:14,780
Soon after Maxim falls for the first leotard-clad battle mage to join the party,

2153
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:17,780
Tia decides to move on with her life and give up adventuring.

2154
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:20,780
As a child, I've never paid much attention to the character of Tia,

2155
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:23,780
but I've been impressed on subsequent playthroughs

2156
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:25,780
by the frank depiction of Tia's feelings.

2157
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,780
So I pose to you this question.

2158
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,780
What are some of your favorite dysfunctional relationships in video games?

2159
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,780
Thanks always for the excellent show, yours truly, Awesome Unicorn.

2160
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:38,780
Well, thanks for being awesome, Awesome Unicorn.

2161
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:42,780
Dysfunctional relationships in games, wow.

2162
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,780
Um, um...

2163
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:45,780
How about...

2164
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:46,780
Chell and GLaDOS.

2165
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:47,780
That's a pretty dysfunctional...

2166
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,780
Hey, he said relationship.

2167
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:51,780
And relationships can be friendships.

2168
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,780
That's right.

2169
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:54,780
They can be parental.

2170
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:56,780
You did not say romantic.

2171
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:58,780
So, Chell and GLaDOS.

2172
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:01,780
Um, well, how about that whole story in Gone Home?

2173
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:03,780
But that wasn't really dysfunctional.

2174
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:04,780
It was just kinda, you know, sad.

2175
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:07,780
Um, how about, um, no, for real though.

2176
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:09,780
What about, like, Mario and Princess Peach?

2177
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,780
For real.

2178
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,780
For real.

2179
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:14,780
What the heck kind of relationship is that going on there?

2180
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:17,780
Like, is it, like, what is it even?

2181
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:20,780
Like, you kinda think it's romantic between Mario and Peach,

2182
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,780
but then it seems platonic in other games.

2183
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:25,780
And wouldn't it, I mean, if the thing between Mario and Peach was romantic,

2184
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:29,780
wouldn't it be weird that sometimes it's, like, his brother that comes in to save the day?

2185
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:30,780
Like, is there a whole...

2186
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:34,780
That's kinda, like, someone explain the relationship of the Marioverse to me,

2187
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:36,780
because I think it's a little weird.

2188
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,780
Just saying.

2189
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,780
Yeah.

2190
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,780
I shouldn't say weird.

2191
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,780
It's modern.

2192
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:42,780
It's very modern.

2193
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,780
Yeah.

2194
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:52,780
Well, in that, I honestly have a big problem with people expecting there to be romantic subplot in games.

2195
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:59,780
And I just wanna see, you know, I wanna see people who are really close,

2196
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:02,780
really tight friends without other people fucking shipping them.

2197
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:03,780
And, no, no, no.

2198
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:05,780
I don't have a problem with people shipping.

2199
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:06,780
Okay?

2200
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:07,780
That, it's gonna happen.

2201
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,780
I'm fine with it.

2202
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:17,780
But I would still like for the shippers out there to accept that some people would like a canonical response

2203
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:21,780
that does not involve two characters fucking.

2204
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,780
They could be romantic friendships, all of that.

2205
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:26,780
I just don't want the fucking involved.

2206
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:29,780
Sorry, the instant you said shipping, I was like,

2207
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:34,780
you know, the shepherd, or the romance between shepherd and Jack is very interesting.

2208
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,780
Oh, did you do that one with...

2209
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:37,780
I've seen it.

2210
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:41,780
I've watched all the YouTubes, and I'm like, that's a very interesting relationship in that game.

2211
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:43,780
I mean, yes, it's romantic, but it is.

2212
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:49,780
It's also kind of like, it's a very interesting depiction of like, it's not,

2213
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:52,780
like, you get the sense that that relationship is really about the Nookie.

2214
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:53,780
Yeah.

2215
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:54,780
More than anything.

2216
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:55,780
She's angry and likes to fuck.

2217
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:56,780
Yeah, exactly.

2218
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,780
It's very interesting to see that depicted in games.

2219
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,780
Like, they just wanna hook up.

2220
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,780
But it does get serious.

2221
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,780
It does, depending on how you go with it, too.

2222
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,780
But also, she kind of grows up a bit.

2223
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:11,780
So, I do get weirded out by the dating tally thing,

2224
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:14,780
because I always think of her as the little sister type, and no.

2225
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:18,780
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2226
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:21,780
Bobby Blackwolf says, there is no romantic subplot in flappy vog.

2227
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:22,780
Hallelujah.

2228
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:26,780
Except for the love affair with the podcaster's face and the wall.

2229
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,780
Yeah.

2230
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:33,780
ST100Matt asks, are Mario and Peach even officially a couple?

2231
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,780
I don't think so.

2232
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:37,780
AwesomeUnicorn in our chat room.

2233
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,780
He's actually there and says, it was a tough question for on the spot,

2234
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,780
so I'll accept any relationships.

2235
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,780
Mario's just in it for the cakes.

2236
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:45,780
Yeah.

2237
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:51,780
I honestly, I've never once seen a romantic relationship at all

2238
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,780
between Mario and Peach.

2239
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,780
I never saw it happen.

2240
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:59,780
I think he is a loyal servant, deciding to relocate from, you know,

2241
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:03,780
his beloved, somewhere in New York-ish place,

2242
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:08,780
and living in the romantic, fantastical Mushroom Kingdom,

2243
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,780
where he actually gets to do a really important job

2244
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:14,780
instead of pull stuck shit out of people's pipes.

2245
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:19,780
Loki, any relationships that you can think of that are strange in games?

2246
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:25,780
No.

2247
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,780
That's fair. It's a tough question.

2248
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:29,780
It's not, you know, you gotta be a little more prepared for that one,

2249
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:31,780
but that's a really good question.

2250
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:34,780
I'd be curious if we get, like, follow-up emails with that.

2251
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,780
I'm curious what some of your favorites are.

2252
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,780
One more email, you said?

2253
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,780
Yeah, there was one more.

2254
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:44,780
By the way, Shepherd Garris. All the way.

2255
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,780
That's not dysfunctional.

2256
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:48,780
No, theirs is hot.

2257
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:49,780
Okay.

2258
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,780
Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican.

2259
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:52,780
Act deft.

2260
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:53,780
Hola.

2261
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:55,780
I've had this question in my head since the Fugu question

2262
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,780
for February 2nd, Bull Night,

2263
01:59:57,780 --> 01:59:59,780
and I thought I would share it with you.

2264
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:01,780
A lot of gamers and geeks don't like sports,

2265
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:04,780
whether they legitimately hate them or just don't give a puck.

2266
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,780
Haha.

2267
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:08,780
But we all have a favorite sports video game.

2268
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:11,780
I hate export, but I love game about export, so why is that?

2269
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:13,780
Why do people sometimes diss on sports,

2270
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,780
but at the same time they love games like NBA Jam,

2271
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:18,780
Blades of Steel, and Mario sports games, et cetera?

2272
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:21,780
I could even include stuff like Wii Sports

2273
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:23,780
and such that resemble traditional sports a bit more.

2274
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,780
Well, that's all for now.

2275
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:26,780
Hopefully you're having a great night, like always.

2276
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:27,780
See you.

2277
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,780
Deft as kabrown.

2278
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,780
Sometimes it's not so much the sport,

2279
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:33,780
but maybe the sport culture.

2280
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,780
Yes, it is totally the sport culture.

2281
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:39,780
Well, for me, it's like, you know how I get about when people hype movies

2282
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:41,780
and it just makes me not want to see them?

2283
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:43,780
I'm the same way about sports,

2284
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:45,780
because the more I hear people just like,

2285
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:51,780
I don't, and to be honest, I don't dislike a lot of sports.

2286
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,780
I'm just kind of apathetic about a lot of them.

2287
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:55,780
But yeah, there's some sports video games I enjoy.

2288
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:57,780
But to be fair and to be complete,

2289
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,780
I've been to some basketball games.

2290
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:01,780
We do have a basketball team here in Sacramento.

2291
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:03,780
It's the only professional sports team we have.

2292
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:07,780
And they've gone ten ways to Sunday

2293
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:10,780
to make sure they're going to keep them here for better or for worse.

2294
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,780
It's a very controversial thing here, but I'm not going to get into it.

2295
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,780
But I've been to a few Kings games, and I've had a good time.

2296
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:17,780
I have a problem.

2297
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,780
I've enjoyed myself.

2298
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:19,780
With something Rage Nader just said.

2299
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:20,780
What?

2300
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,780
Mario gets a bum rap.

2301
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,780
He saves Peach's ass.

2302
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:25,780
God only knows how many times.

2303
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:26,780
Oh no.

2304
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:27,780
Yet he gets nowhere with her.

2305
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,780
Not even a kiss.

2306
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:29,780
Uh oh.

2307
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:30,780
What does she owe him?

2308
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:32,780
She owes him nothing.

2309
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:35,780
She thanks him, yes, and gives him a fucking place to live.

2310
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,780
Just because a guy does something nice for a woman

2311
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:40,780
does not mean she has to put out.

2312
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:41,780
Fuck you.

2313
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:45,780
She does give him flowers.

2314
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:47,780
Okay, she gave him something.

2315
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:51,780
But it doesn't mean that any time a guy does something nice for a woman

2316
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:52,780
that she has to put out.

2317
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:53,780
No, she doesn't.

2318
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,780
She only has to put out if she wants to put out.

2319
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:56,780
The end.

2320
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:59,780
Well, now, okay, to be fair, though, in his defense, he didn't say

2321
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,780
why don't they ever have sex.

2322
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:02,780
Just a little kiss.

2323
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,780
Have a little kiss on the cheek.

2324
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,780
No, she doesn't owe him any of that.

2325
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:07,780
She does not owe him a damn thing.

2326
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:11,780
All right.

2327
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:15,780
That is what's wrong with guys.

2328
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:17,780
Not all guys.

2329
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,780
Not all guys.

2330
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:19,780
You're cool.

2331
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,780
Loki's okay, too.

2332
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,780
I guess.

2333
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:26,780
Loki, I think you're cool.

2334
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:28,780
Loki, did you want to say anything on the sports game email?

2335
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:30,780
No.

2336
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:31,780
Fair enough.

2337
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:33,780
Then let's get to the FUs of the week.

2338
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:34,780
I don't know.

2339
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,780
Dark Soccer has started a little early over there.

2340
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:39,780
And I hate the term friend zone because it just makes it look like

2341
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:40,780
being friends is bad.

2342
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:42,780
Being friends is great.

2343
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,780
I like having friends.

2344
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,780
Unless all you're interested in is fucking someone

2345
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,780
and then that's not a friendship.

2346
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,780
You know what?

2347
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:50,780
I love having women as just friends.

2348
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,780
There's nothing wrong with that.

2349
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:55,780
I love having everybody as just friends except for my husband.

2350
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,780
And I love my husband.

2351
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:59,780
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2352
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:16,780
Fuck you to the patriarchy.

2353
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:21,780
If you are for equality, you are for feminism.

2354
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:22,780
That's why we need it.

2355
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:26,780
Because of people saying that Pete should put out.

2356
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:28,780
She doesn't have to put out.

2357
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:29,780
She doesn't have to give a kiss.

2358
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:30,780
She doesn't have to do anything.

2359
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:33,780
She is a strong, independent woman who don't need no man.

2360
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:38,780
Well, if she's that strong...

2361
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:40,780
Hey, she was a main character in Mario 2.

2362
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:43,780
Why does she keep getting kidnapped by Bowser?

2363
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:45,780
I mean, surely she would have set a trap.

2364
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:48,780
A strong woman would have set a trap for Bowser at this point.

2365
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:51,780
Okay, she's moderately independent.

2366
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:54,780
But she doesn't lift weights because she was raised in privilege.

2367
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:56,780
She's a privileged white girl.

2368
02:03:57,780 --> 02:04:01,780
So she doesn't think anything bad will ever happen to her until it happens to her.

2369
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:04,780
What?

2370
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:07,780
Does Princess Peach have an Instagram?

2371
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:08,780
Probably.

2372
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,780
And wears glasses in her spare time.

2373
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:12,780
She's a privileged white girl.

2374
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:14,780
And?

2375
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:23,780
She has to rely on poor Mario with his weight problem.

2376
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:27,780
I can't do this with a straight face.

2377
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:33,780
Just because he doesn't fit the standard of aesthetics for guys

2378
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:36,780
does not make him any less valuable as a human being.

2379
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:40,780
When he lands on someone, he lands on them.

2380
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:44,780
Loki, what's your F.U. of the week?

2381
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:47,780
Uh, F.U. of the things breaking.

2382
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:52,780
Like, you know, my laptop and then knew it's even better.

2383
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:57,780
So I decided to, you know, play some games during Josh's nap.

2384
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:00,780
And my chair breaks.

2385
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:04,780
You're not having a lot of luck, are you?

2386
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:06,780
We'll get you some duct tape.

2387
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:07,780
By the way...

2388
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:10,780
The bolt's breaking out of it.

2389
02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:13,780
In chat? What'd he say?

2390
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:17,780
Princess Peach shows up to her security detail ten minutes late holding a Starbucks.

2391
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:19,780
That's why she always gets kidnapped.

2392
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:20,780
Alright, look.

2393
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:23,780
My F.U. of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.

2394
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:26,780
F.U. to screwing up my sleep schedule.

2395
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:28,780
Because you know what I really, really, really like?

2396
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:29,780
Sleep.

2397
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:34,780
Sleep, in fact, I would go so far to say, and I might piss Jamie off with this, but I don't care.

2398
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:36,780
Sleep might be better than tacos.

2399
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:37,780
Just saying.

2400
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:39,780
No, I think sleep is better than tacos.

2401
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:40,780
Okay, well good.

2402
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:43,780
But you know what's even better, though, is combine the two, have a taco, take a nap.

2403
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:46,780
Fair enough.

2404
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:49,780
Because then you go to bed with tacos in your stomach.

2405
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:51,780
And that's happy.

2406
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:54,780
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

2407
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:57,780
Then we're gonna open the Skype line at 1-877-GAMELR.

2408
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:59,780
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2409
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,780
We'll also get Twitter topics and last minute stories.

2410
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:03,780
I'm in a feminist tizzy right now.

2411
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:05,780
Did that, did that...

2412
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,780
I was actually angered.

2413
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,780
Alright, let's, let's move on.

2414
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,780
I have Rage at Rageinator.

2415
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:13,780
You know what, let's talk about a strong woman in games.

2416
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,780
Loki.

2417
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,780
Yes, Lightning.

2418
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:22,780
She is basically done now.

2419
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:30,780
The Lightning, they're saying Lightning Returns is the last part of the story for Lightning.

2420
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:38,780
However, they're saying that Lightning may come back as a guest character in other games.

2421
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:42,780
So, I don't know.

2422
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:46,780
They could get cliche, or they should get like really cheesy with it.

2423
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:49,780
Like, you know, Lightning strikes twice or something.

2424
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:52,780
No, we're just gonna see her a bunch more in Final Fantasy XIV.

2425
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:57,780
I was gonna say, they're doing the quest right now in XIV that has her in it that's very strange.

2426
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:02,780
I don't know why she would return in other games.

2427
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:05,780
I mean, I could see maybe like, you know, XIV.

2428
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:09,780
I guess they can do like some fun stuff where they have like guest characters and stuff from other games.

2429
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:14,780
But, it doesn't really make sense for Lightning to be in other games.

2430
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:17,780
I guess then, then again, Cid is in all the games.

2431
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:19,780
So, I don't know.

2432
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:22,780
Thinking of Lightning in all the games is a different person.

2433
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:25,780
That would be a little silly though.

2434
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:26,780
Like, I don't know.

2435
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:30,780
Like, her picture should just be hanging on the wall as a little cameo in the later games.

2436
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:34,780
I mean, you don't really see characters from one Final Fantasy appear in the other.

2437
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:36,780
I mean, even Cid, sure, okay, there's a dude named Cid.

2438
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,780
But they're all different, you know.

2439
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:41,780
In fact, I believe the one in XIII was more of a villain than a...

2440
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:42,780
Well, it's mixed.

2441
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:45,780
But, you know, they're always different.

2442
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:48,780
Anyhow.

2443
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:52,780
There's always an airship. There's always a Cid.

2444
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:54,780
There's always a crystal.

2445
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:56,780
There's always Moogles, at least in the later one.

2446
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:58,780
Moogles didn't start until like 3, right?

2447
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:01,780
Well, they'll just have her, you know, guest star.

2448
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:03,780
Maybe she could be a summon or something.

2449
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:07,780
Or, you know, they'll have her guest star in all the different thunder spells.

2450
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:11,780
You would think that characters like Cloud would have been a little more iconic.

2451
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:15,780
But then again, they did dress Lightning up in a cloud suit.

2452
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,780
So, maybe that's the type of stuff we're looking for.

2453
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:20,780
DLC Lightning crap in later games, right?

2454
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:24,780
Act-Def says Final Fantasy XIII, too Lightning, too Furious.

2455
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,780
Don't give them ideas.

2456
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,780
All right.

2457
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:31,780
Well, sadly, our last story is a bit of a sad note tonight.

2458
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:38,780
And gives us a chance to reminisce, though, about some very classic PC and Sega CD and CD-based games.

2459
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:40,780
I don't know if you ever played a game called...

2460
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:42,780
That's not Microcosm, is it?

2461
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:44,780
No, no. This is actually a clip from Sewer Shark.

2462
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,780
Oh!

2463
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:52,780
And, you know, full motion games were, like, a big thing, especially in the early 90s, like the CD-ROM games.

2464
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:56,780
Ken Melville was one of the guys to thank for a lot of that.

2465
02:08:56,780 --> 02:09:00,780
Unfortunately, he passed away this week at age 65.

2466
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:08,780
He produced Sewer Shark, and he also created other full motion video games like Make My Video in XS and Make My Video Criss Cross.

2467
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:09,780
Excellent.

2468
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,780
You know what? I have both of those games.

2469
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:21,780
Also, and probably most infamously, Ken Melville helped create Night Trap, starring Dana Plato, which is a pretty epically remembered CD game.

2470
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:28,780
Even though it really wasn't very good, people still remember it just because, you know, it was like Chicks and Horror Movie and all that stuff.

2471
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,780
But yeah, there you go.

2472
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:32,780
So Ken Melville, unfortunately, passed away.

2473
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:36,780
But, you know, without him, we might not have some of the things we see.

2474
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:40,780
I mean, yeah, sure, games can kind of render all this real time now, but, you know, I don't think we would have got there.

2475
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:46,780
We would have certainly never had the SimCity version with the SimCity Action News Report, if it weren't for this.

2476
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:49,780
So, for that, I'll be forever thankful.

2477
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:56,780
Some folks in chat also saying, SSJ100Matt says, RIP John Henson, Jim Henson's son.

2478
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:58,780
That also happened this week. That's very sad, too.

2479
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:02,780
Lots of, what, Sid Caesar had passed away this week.

2480
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:05,780
That made me so sad. And Shirley Temple.

2481
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:06,780
Shirley Temple.

2482
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:15,780
I mean, Caesar was like in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Silent Movie and History of the World Part 1 and Greece.

2483
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:18,780
I had thought Shirley Temple was already dead. Like, I felt horrible.

2484
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:21,780
But she disappeared from the public eye a long time ago.

2485
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:27,780
Like, I think she came to one Oscars as a, I don't know, but then she became a diplomat of sorts, right?

2486
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:30,780
Wasn't she like an ambassador or something at some point?

2487
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:34,780
She's not really in the public eye like she used to be. So, sorry.

2488
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:38,780
You know, you know what? When I was probably about 13, I read her autobiography.

2489
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:42,780
Which was, oh my God, she went through some shit.

2490
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:43,780
Oh, I bet.

2491
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:48,780
But it's, if anyone can find her autobiography, though, it's definitely worth a read.

2492
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:49,780
Her life was just so interesting.

2493
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:50,780
Yeah.

2494
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:51,780
So.

2495
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,780
Excellent. All right. We are going to open up the Skype line right now.

2496
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:57,780
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2497
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:03,780
If you'd like to give the show a call and interact with us, participate, you can do that right now.

2498
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:07,780
Once again, that's 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2499
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:09,780
The Skype line is now open.

2500
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:12,780
I'm going to go around for some last minute stories, though, first.

2501
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:14,780
Loki, I don't know, do you have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

2502
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,780
No.

2503
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:16,780
No?

2504
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:17,780
I do not.

2505
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:19,780
Sorry. No, I don't.

2506
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:21,780
All right. Fine. Fair enough.

2507
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:25,780
I also want to look and see if there's any, like, Twitter topics, but we'll see here.

2508
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:31,780
Okay. The book, by the way, is called Child Star.

2509
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:33,780
There you go. Child Star.

2510
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:34,780
By Shirley Temple Black.

2511
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:40,780
Well, that is what Shirley Temple was, was a child star, but we're going to go to the Skype line right now.

2512
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:42,780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2513
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:48,780
It's Ronma, and will you tell a brother next time you turn the cam on so I can have mine on, too?

2514
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:55,780
Oh, there you go. Oh, we're on the cam tonight. Yay. How you doing?

2515
02:11:55,780 --> 02:12:00,780
Good, good. As you can see, I just got back from Catsicon 20.

2516
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:01,780
You're wearing your VOG shirt.

2517
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:02,780
What did you get me?

2518
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:04,780
Love it. Great.

2519
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:07,780
I got you a lot of Ronma would have cosplay pictures.

2520
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:11,780
Yay! Did you take me any home stocks?

2521
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:13,780
I got a couple.

2522
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:14,780
Yay!

2523
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:17,780
There you go. They didn't turn the pool gray this year, did they?

2524
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:28,780
Uh, no, but let's just say the hotel and the convention were gunning more at professional photographers than anything else.

2525
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:29,780
Really?

2526
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:43,780
Yes. If it looked like you had more, if you had more attachments on your SLR, like big lights and this and that, they will tell you to leave the area because they assume that you're a professional photographer.

2527
02:12:43,780 --> 02:12:50,780
A friend of mine had an assistant with him, and they told him, you can't have your, you're a professional photographer.

2528
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:51,780
Interesting.

2529
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:55,780
It boiled down to, as long as it's attached to your camera, it's fair game.

2530
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:59,780
Huh. I went to Katsucon a few years ago. I had a good time.

2531
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:04,780
Yeah, but they're no longer in that area. We're in a different area.

2532
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:05,780
Okay.

2533
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:09,780
The hotel convention is bigger, and it's all about the gazebo.

2534
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:11,780
I've heard about the gazebo.

2535
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,780
Oh, I've seen the memes about the gazebo.

2536
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:18,780
I'm in California for fuck's sake, and I've heard about the Katsucon gazebo, so I'm just saying. I'm just saying.

2537
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:21,780
That's because you have West Coast cosplayers going to Katsucon.

2538
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:23,780
There you go. There you go. Fair enough.

2539
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:36,780
I was going to say this. There was all those stormy storms in the Northeast, and I was reading that the con, like, they were going to say a con is happening no matter what, but I imagine that led to some hilarious fuckery right there.

2540
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:45,780
Yes, because they made an announcement that even though you can't make it to Katsucon, you are not getting a refund. The salt was strong on that.

2541
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:49,780
Ooh, ouch. I can only imagine on that. Yikes.

2542
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:55,780
So what gaming stuff did they have at Katsucon? Did they still have a game room down there? I know.

2543
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:59,780
Yes, there was two pump it up machines and a DDR third mix.

2544
02:13:59,780 --> 02:14:02,780
Nice. Third mix. I fucking love third mix.

2545
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:03,780
Vivid mode.

2546
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:04,780
Erotic songs.

2547
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:10,780
And I've never heard of this game. I don't know if you guys reviewed it, but it's a rhythm game by Sega.

2548
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:17,780
It's two players, and it's five lines of colored lights, and you're bouncing lights back and forth.

2549
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:20,780
You start from one, then three, then five.

2550
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:27,780
I actually didn't know that was a Sega game. It looks like a giant table, like air hockey looking thing, right?

2551
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:30,780
There was one of those at Arcade Infinity before it closed down.

2552
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,780
I have video footage of that.

2553
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:35,780
Nice. Yeah, that game looked interesting. I think I did play it once.

2554
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:46,780
You know, I didn't talk about this on the show the week that Shane was here, but we had gone to Golf Land, the place where video games go to die, and we played a Pac-Man air hockey machine.

2555
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:47,780
What?

2556
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:54,780
Yeah, it was kind of like normal air hockey, but like at random parts, all these little pucks would just fly onto the table.

2557
02:14:54,780 --> 02:15:00,780
Like you'd have your normal puck, like air hockey, but then all of a sudden like 20 small pucks would fly on the table.

2558
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:06,780
Like that was the whole little trick, and they were worth like half a point, whereas the other, the big pucks were worth like five points.

2559
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:13,780
Sorry, random tangent, but you talking about the big table games in Arcade kind of made me think of that, so.

2560
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,780
That's quite alright.

2561
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:20,780
Alright, so we're gonna hear the full Katsukan wrap up, I imagine, this week on Anime Jam Session?

2562
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:38,780
Yes, you will, and we'll have two of our cosplay guests on the show, Avalon Cosplay and Serafita Cosplay, because Serafita had a booth going selling patches and a lot of cool stuff, and it was pretty fun, especially since somebody cosplayed the gazebo.

2563
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:40,780
Oh, I have to ask you.

2564
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:42,780
That's like when somebody cosplayed the carpet at Dragon Con.

2565
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:45,780
Did you get pictures of Kayla?

2566
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:47,780
Yes, I got a couple.

2567
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:49,780
Because I went in to see her Lilith costume.

2568
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:51,780
I got one of her Lilith costume.

2569
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,780
Yes! Awesome.

2570
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:55,780
Alright, well Rama, anything else before we let you go?

2571
02:15:55,780 --> 02:16:04,780
I will say this much, when it comes to gaming cosplay at this convention, the most popular gaming cosplay was Danganronpa.

2572
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:07,780
Oh yeah, that's not surprising.

2573
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:09,780
Then Legend of Zelda.

2574
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,780
Yeah, that's not surprising either.

2575
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:13,780
You hear that the sequel's coming out this year as well, right?

2576
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:15,780
Loki said the sequel's coming out this year.

2577
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:20,780
I haven't played the game, but I've watched the anime, and holy shit, what a mindfuck.

2578
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:28,780
Yeah, the first one just came out, I think, last week, and then the sequel, I think, is already announced for...gosh, I want to say it's this summer.

2579
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:30,780
Did you hear what Loki said?

2580
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,780
Yes, I did.

2581
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:34,780
By the way, I'm working on something for you.

2582
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:35,780
Ooh!

2583
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:37,780
A Rama troll.

2584
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:38,780
Oh no!

2585
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:40,780
Yep, you're getting a Rama troll.

2586
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:41,780
Sweet.

2587
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:45,780
Alright, well Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls, but have a good one, buddy, thanks for calling.

2588
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,780
Hey, no problem, you too.

2589
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:47,780
Alright, take care, bye.

2590
02:16:47,780 --> 02:16:48,780
Oh, bye.

2591
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:52,780
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

2592
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:57,780
I always thought that Ranshan should cosplay the Rama troll out of irony.

2593
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,780
That would be hilarious.

2594
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:04,780
Alright, I'm gonna try to pull up the OLR Twitter here.

2595
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:07,780
A lot of activity on Twitter around FlappyVog, that's pretty exciting to see.

2596
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:09,780
Yay.

2597
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:11,780
Um, let's see.

2598
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:16,780
DarkTetsuya says, I'm trying to start an OLR me for Monster Hunter 3.

2599
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,780
God dammit, I forgot, sorry guys.

2600
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:23,780
I'm routing Skype a different way, so I have to route it through the mixing board.

2601
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,780
Little bit of faux pas there.

2602
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:29,780
I'll go back to DarkTetsuya's tweet in a minute, but we are getting another call, so let's get to it.

2603
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:31,780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2604
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:36,780
Hey there, guys, it's nemesis47, I'm from the chat, how you guys doing today?

2605
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:39,780
Hey, good, nemesis47, what's up, buddy?

2606
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:47,780
Nothing much, guys, I'm just getting ready for a convention here in a couple weeks as well, just like Rama said earlier.

2607
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:49,780
Where's here?

2608
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:55,780
In Colorado, he was in out east, I'm over here out in Rocky Mountains west.

2609
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:03,780
I would bet Jason, our good buddy VXJ's next V, who just said goodbyes on the show last week for now,

2610
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:08,780
he lives in Colorado, he's been living in San Francisco for the past couple months, he's usually in Colorado.

2611
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:10,780
He'll probably be there, I would bet.

2612
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:14,780
I guess he would, though, we have a lot of guests this year.

2613
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:19,780
This is actually my first convention I'm going to be staffing for this year.

2614
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:21,780
Nice, sounds like fun.

2615
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:22,780
Yeah.

2616
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:30,780
Yep, I'm mainly just the guy that's going to be doing the photoshoots.

2617
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:35,780
I've actually got all the photoshoots already done with the posters and everything.

2618
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:38,780
We just gotta get him hung up a lot of comments.

2619
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:43,780
There we go, it's the Anime Land Wasabi convention I'm doing in a couple weeks.

2620
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:45,780
Sounds like fun.

2621
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:46,780
Yep.

2622
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:52,780
So, are you trying to plug the convention here? Is there something else on your mind tonight?

2623
02:18:52,780 --> 02:19:00,780
That's one thing, and plus the whole thing with the Sega Genesis thing, my apologies about that.

2624
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:04,780
I had brain fart earlier and stuff, so yeah.

2625
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:11,780
That's fine, and to be fair, because the Sega Genesis did come out, I want to say it was a year or two before the Super Nintendo,

2626
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:17,780
there was a little bit of overlap, especially in the late NES period, kind of overlapped with the beginnings of the Sega Genesis.

2627
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:23,780
And I seem to remember, DarkSocker, correct me if I'm wrong, or Loki, Sonic the Hedgehog was a Genesis game,

2628
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:28,780
but then they back-poured it to the Master System because it was kind of like the 8-bits was still going on.

2629
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:30,780
Or was that one of those Chinese hacks?

2630
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:38,780
No, no, no, there's actually quite a number of Genesis games that were sort of back-engineered for the Master System

2631
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:40,780
because of countries where the Master System was the big thing.

2632
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:46,780
Like, for example, Brazil. Brazil has a massive Master System following.

2633
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:48,780
But they had a huge Genesis following.

2634
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,780
But Master System was really big.

2635
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:52,780
Yeah, I've heard that too.

2636
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:53,780
Even to today.

2637
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:58,780
So there's lots of games that you'll find those older versions.

2638
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:07,780
I think the Sonic one had been released, don't quote me yet, but it was really, some of those countries where the Master System was huge,

2639
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:14,780
so they took their most popular titles from Genesis because the Genesis ones weren't selling, the Master System ones were.

2640
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,780
They were milking the money where they could.

2641
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:22,780
Interesting. Well, there you go. I learned something. So yeah, don't feel too bad about the answer.

2642
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:27,780
I actually still got my Genesis still to this day. I had that thing since I was a little kid.

2643
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:35,780
Nice. I saw my Super Nintendo hooked up. I can play Super Metroid in its purest form.

2644
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:40,780
I tripped over Super Nintendo today. We have three of them in the house.

2645
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:43,780
I think you should always have a classic console hooked up for good measure.

2646
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:49,780
Of course, of course. Have you guys ever heard of a game called Double Switch on the Sega CD?

2647
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:50,780
Yes, I have it.

2648
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:54,780
I have it too. It has late Corey Haim in the game.

2649
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:56,780
Yes, it does.

2650
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:06,780
It is not one of my favorite games, though. If I was going to sit down and play a Sega CD game that I would actually say was among my favorites, it would probably just be Sonic CD.

2651
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:20,780
Oh, yeah. Sonic CD can never go wrong with Sonic CD. Another thing about Double Switch, Arlie Ermes is in the game. He knows the story of Simon Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He's in the game.

2652
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:23,780
Yeah, that's right. It had actually a pretty decent cast, didn't it?

2653
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:33,780
Yeah, he played while I was a handyman in the game. So, at first I was like, that doesn't look like I didn't know who it was after this thing.

2654
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:38,780
It was Arlie Ermey and they pretty much put the voices two and two together and, hey, it matches!

2655
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:44,780
Yeah, it's worth a lot. The GI.

2656
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:51,780
Alright, well, Nemesis 47, enjoy the classic gaming on your classic consoles and thanks for calling us tonight, alright?

2657
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:54,780
No problem, man. Good to see you guys.

2658
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:56,780
Alright, take care, buddy.

2659
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,780
Alright, bye bye.

2660
02:21:58,780 --> 02:21:59,780
Bye.

2661
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:14,780
1877 game OLR, I wish I could disable the sounds. I'm actually using Skype on the iPad, so I wish I could disable the sounds. Maybe it's possible. I could disable all the sounds, but then I wouldn't be able to hear the callers and that would be a bad thing.

2662
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:25,780
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio. Before we took that call, I was talking about a tweet that Dark Tetsuya had sent us saying, I'm trying to start an OL army for Monster Hunter 3 on Wii U.

2663
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:39,780
By the way, that's how you do online on Wii U. I gotta be honest, Dark Tetsuya, I wasn't able to get into Monster Hunter. That's my honest answer on that, but, hey, for those of you that are enjoying it, I definitely would support an OL army being created for that.

2664
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:43,780
But we do have another call on the line, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?

2665
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:44,780
Hey, it's Marissa.

2666
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:49,780
Marissa! Oh my gosh. We haven't heard from you in forever, Marissa. How you doing?

2667
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:50,780
I wonder how you need to call right now.

2668
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:58,780
It's been too long. I feel like an old lady though, trying to figure out this Skype thing. I thought this was only for the kids doing the porn thing.

2669
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:01,780
No, that would be Snapchat.

2670
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:02,780
Yeah, that's Snapchat.

2671
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,780
Oh, okay.

2672
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:06,780
That's for the porn thing. What's on your mind, Marissa?

2673
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:13,780
I was calling to say hello and check in. Oh, and fuck the new Thief game, but I guess, yeah, that would probably be it.

2674
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:16,780
Oh, yeah. Is that, like, coming out finally?

2675
02:23:16,780 --> 02:23:24,780
I know! They put so much into it. They have so much on the line at Eidos Montreal, and it's coming out next week and nobody really seems to know or give a shit.

2676
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,780
Oh, two weeks, says Logie.

2677
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:28,780
The 25th.

2678
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:34,780
Wow, they've got a great marketing push going on on that one. That's sure to do well. They must have a lot of faith in it.

2679
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:44,780
It's funny, because of my interest, the voice acting is particularly bad. I mean, everybody is outraged that they got rid of Stephen Russell, who's just brilliant.

2680
02:23:44,780 --> 02:24:01,780
But I've been listening to it in general, and the direction itself is just... it's really bad, but there are laws with regard to casting and doing projects in Canada, and everyone suspects that they did that to keep funding.

2681
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:03,780
Oh, like Canadian content?

2682
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:06,780
Canadian content laws or something. Oh, that's an interesting theory.

2683
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:08,780
Damn Canucks.

2684
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:11,780
Damn it Canada, you do so many things right, but sometimes you get it wrong.

2685
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:16,780
Damn it Canada, you gave us Rush, but you also gave us Bieber.

2686
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:21,780
You know, I hate Justin Bieber too, but to be fair, we've exported a lot of shit to them too.

2687
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:27,780
That is true. That is true. Fair's fair. I mean, they get like Miley Cyrus.

2688
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:32,780
Thanks to a friend of mine, I actually did hear about a Canadian band that I've started liking a lot called Stars.

2689
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:33,780
Okay.

2690
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:34,780
They're really good.

2691
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:35,780
Rock on.

2692
02:24:35,780 --> 02:24:36,780
Okay, I will.

2693
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:38,780
I like Alanis Morissette. She's cool.

2694
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:43,780
Hey, actually to be fair, they import a lot of comedians too. We get a lot of great comedians.

2695
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:48,780
That is true. We get a lot of comedians from Canada. I feel like it's like Canada history 101 today.

2696
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:53,780
As opposed to Canadians from Alaska? Or Canadians from Norway?

2697
02:24:54,780 --> 02:25:03,780
I remember when I was a little girl, actually, I had a friend that was from Peachland, and I was trying to explain Canadian bacon to her, and I had this exact reply.

2698
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:05,780
You mean ham?

2699
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:11,780
Although, isn't that also just what they call bacon in England?

2700
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:13,780
You're not supposed to talk about bacon, Jamie.

2701
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:16,780
You know what? I've seen you eat bacon.

2702
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:20,780
See, I'm allowed to be a heathen. I don't give a shit.

2703
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:23,780
It's not going to go away if you pretend it doesn't exist.

2704
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:26,780
For the record, I had turkey bacon today, so I'm still being a good Jew.

2705
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:28,780
Of course, there was cheese with it.

2706
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:34,780
So Marissa, I know you're very disappointed about The New Thief, but is there any games you've been checking out lately?

2707
02:25:34,780 --> 02:25:44,780
Otherwise, I haven't had a chance to look into a lot of them. I've had the chance to record and rehearse in various studios with some interesting video game scripts.

2708
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:48,780
Some of them haven't come out yet, so you can't talk about them.

2709
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:51,780
Some of them was the interesting little tank commander bit I sent you.

2710
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:57,780
I don't know what it's from, but they had me rehearse this thing about giant eyeballs are attacking the city.

2711
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:01,780
That sounds like something out of Earth Defense Force or something. Who knows?

2712
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:05,780
I can only hope.

2713
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:09,780
Marissa, I know you haven't been on the show in a while, but it seems like since the last time you were here,

2714
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:12,780
you've been really getting into studying voice acting and doing all that.

2715
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:16,780
I know you sent me some of the demo reels that you did, and it was great.

2716
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,780
I thought I was actually listening to commercials on FM radio. It was cool.

2717
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:22,780
Oh, thank you. That shit that you skip over.

2718
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:29,780
Well, you can't when you're in the car and waiting for the next Lady Gaga song to come on. You're kind of held hostage.

2719
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:36,780
Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. That's actually what I've wanted to do my whole life, and I decided to go for it.

2720
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,780
That's awesome. See, I always talk about...

2721
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:42,780
You like the sexy sax, though? That's important if you like the sexy sax bit.

2722
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:49,780
I always talk about wanting... I would love to be a voice actor in a video game just once in my life. That would be my dream.

2723
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:54,780
But you're actually going and doing it. But you know what? I do have flappy vog.

2724
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:59,780
I did get flappy vog, so I did get my game that I have a voice actor in.

2725
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:04,780
Well, Rob Paulson, when he hosts his podcast, he sometimes brings it up north.

2726
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:11,780
I suggest everyone to check that out, Talking Tunes. He brings Maurice LaMarche sometimes, and they do Pinky and the Brain live, and they've all done video games as well.

2727
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:12,780
It's awesome.

2728
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:13,780
It's a lot of fun.

2729
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:21,780
Awesome. Awesome. All right. Well, you want to give us your best voiceover sign out for the night before we let you go?

2730
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:25,780
Not to put you on the spot or anything.

2731
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:29,780
Good night, everybody.

2732
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:36,780
I don't always do that, but it's interesting how it's really incestuous when you go from this to...

2733
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:38,780
Hi, how have you been?

2734
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:42,780
That's a lot of anime work. You do a lot of that.

2735
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:45,780
Oh, my God. I love it.

2736
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:46,780
Have fun with that helium.

2737
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:50,780
I accidentally did that with my answer machine message once. I was trying to be professional.

2738
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:56,780
Your reception isn't very good, so I was trying to be, hey, this is Marissa. I hope to hear from you soon.

2739
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:01,780
But this is how it turned out. Hey, it's Marissa. I'd love to hear from you.

2740
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:08,780
I didn't realize until my doctor called me one day. She just left a message, and she said this exactly.

2741
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:15,780
She said, Marissa, what a suggestive sounding answering machine you have.

2742
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:20,780
Well, I think there's a lot of our listeners that would like to see you operating a 900 number or something along those lines.

2743
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:23,780
Maybe I can get that gig. Call us now.

2744
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:25,780
All right.

2745
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:32,780
All right. Well, Marissa, when you're a super popular voice actress touring the country at anime cons up and down the coast, I'm going to say she started here.

2746
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:33,780
We made her.

2747
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:35,780
No. Her first role on Vogue.

2748
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:38,780
I don't know some of the bits I've done on your show. I want to be known.

2749
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:45,780
No, no, no, no. I know what your first fun voice was on Orange House Radio. It was Uso's Braziers.

2750
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:50,780
Yes. I'm going to dig up those shows. You better watch out.

2751
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:54,780
Actually, I'm just trying to get started, but I know lots of people are doing indie projects.

2752
02:28:54,780 --> 02:28:59,780
That's where a lot of people cut their chops, and if anybody's interested, I'm always happy to do indie projects.

2753
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:03,780
Awesome. All right. Well, how can people get a hold of you?

2754
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:12,780
Well, I have that sound cloud you can link to later, but my name is Marissa Meisel, so M-E-I-Z-E-L.

2755
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:19,780
I can always send out demos that way, or you can contact me where the old people are on Facebook.

2756
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,780
Awesome. Awesome. And if you email the show, we'll get you in touch with her, too. We'll forward it on over.

2757
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:24,780
As long as we still have that email address.

2758
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:29,780
Yes. All right. All right, Marissa, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much for the call.

2759
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,780
It's so good to hear from you. Miss your face.

2760
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:33,780
One time, I'll have to come up soon and have giggle time.

2761
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:34,780
What's that?

2762
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:37,780
I'll have to come up soon, and we can have Rob and Marissa's giggle time.

2763
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:41,780
Yes. I cannot wait. All right. Bye.

2764
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:42,780
Bye.

2765
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:45,780
I always love hearing from Marissa. She is great.

2766
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:48,780
All right. I can probably squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try to get through.

2767
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:52,780
1877 Game O-L-R, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2768
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:56,780
Trying to get to some more tweets beyond that.

2769
02:29:56,780 --> 02:29:58,780
S2100 Matt tweets us.

2770
02:29:58,780 --> 02:30:02,780
Old story, but the Kickstarter hack reminded me of it.

2771
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:06,780
Best and worst online retailers password safeguards.

2772
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:08,780
And he links us to this article from Ars Technica.

2773
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:17,780
I don't believe I read this, but apparently, the headline on the site is this.

2774
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:20,780
Apple.com does more to protect your passwords.

2775
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:22,780
The study of the top 100 sites finds.

2776
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:27,780
I guess some sites will allow you to have 123456 as a password.

2777
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:32,780
Apple.com was the only site to receive a perfect score of 100 based on 24 criteria.

2778
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:39,780
Amazingly, 55% of the sites allowed 123456 and password.

2779
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:46,780
Sites like Toys R Us, 1-800-Flowers, and J Crew sent passwords as plain text in emails.

2780
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:50,780
Interesting. So, yeah, Apple got a 100.

2781
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,780
Microsoft and Chegg, C-H-Egg.

2782
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:57,780
Chegg is a book rental for school book rentals.

2783
02:30:57,780 --> 02:31:00,780
And if you run from them, they actually plant a tree.

2784
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:03,780
They were right behind that with a score of 65.

2785
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:05,780
Of course, I want to see who's on the bottom.

2786
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:11,780
MLB, the Major League Baseball website, negative 75 was their score.

2787
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:14,780
Kind of surprised that somebody's in the bottom.

2788
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:18,780
Hulu, negative 45. Disney Store, negative 45.

2789
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:20,780
Interesting story there on ArsTechnica.com.

2790
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:22,780
Thanks for that, SJ100Matt.

2791
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:26,780
And don't use shitty passwords, people. Don't use shitty passwords.

2792
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:28,780
And don't use the same ones for your financial institutions.

2793
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:34,780
Never, never, never have your email password used anywhere else.

2794
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:36,780
Same thing with your banking passwords.

2795
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:41,780
At least those two should be unique and separate. For real.

2796
02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:44,780
Alright. Anyhow, let's see.

2797
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:48,780
Going on, we have another tweet from SJ100Matt.

2798
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:52,780
Someone made a Space Jam mod for NBA 2K14.

2799
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:56,780
Now you can play with the Tune Squad or Monstars from the movie.

2800
02:31:56,780 --> 02:32:00,780
That's it. We've accomplished all we need to in gaming.

2801
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:04,780
That's it. Done. Video games are over, everybody. Pack it up. Go home.

2802
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:10,780
They put Space Jam in NBA 2K14. Wait. Somebody made that game good?

2803
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:13,780
NBA 2K14 was apparently pretty good.

2804
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:16,780
I thought it got like hazed and stuff in the video.

2805
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:18,780
That's NBA Live 14.

2806
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,780
Oh. Pardon me. Pardon me.

2807
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:22,780
Yeah, Rob. I don't know how to play either.

2808
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:23,780
Sorry.

2809
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:25,780
No one's making any mods for that.

2810
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:29,780
And Strudels89. It was a tweet to me as well.

2811
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:31,780
But this is worthy of mention on the show for Dark Sakura.

2812
02:32:31,780 --> 02:32:34,780
OMG. I found a pink berry.

2813
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,780
It's been so long. I missed it.

2814
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:39,780
You would think this show is sponsored by that company.

2815
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:41,780
But sadly, nope. No free yogurt here.

2816
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:45,780
Well, it doesn't appear that anybody else is calling in.

2817
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:48,780
So I guess we're gonna go ahead and close up ye olde Skype line.

2818
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:50,780
Which means we don't have last minute stories.

2819
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:52,780
I have one last minute story.

2820
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:54,780
Oh, you got one. Alright. Well, Loki, what did you get?

2821
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:58,780
It's kind of a little easter egg for Disney Infinity.

2822
02:32:58,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Apparently, once you've collected all of the characters,

2823
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:04,780
say if you buy every single one of them,

2824
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:08,780
you will unlock a lightsaber.

2825
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:12,780
Like an actual lightsaber in the game as a weapon.

2826
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:16,780
Of course, no one has figured this out yet.

2827
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:20,780
Except for one person who got some of the toys early that haven't been released yet.

2828
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:24,780
But that's what's gonna happen when you do collect all of them

2829
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:27,780
if you happen to pay for all of those different characters.

2830
02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:34,780
Alright. Bobby Black Wolf has just sent me an update via private message

2831
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:36,780
worthy of last minute story.

2832
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:42,780
Per Bobby Black Wolf, over 1300 people have died in Flappy Vog during OLR.

2833
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,780
So I don't know if that means...

2834
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:44,780
Third place.

2835
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:46,780
What? Does that mean 1300 plays?

2836
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:49,780
Or like 1300 unique people have played the game in 3 hours?

2837
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:52,780
I don't think we have those kind of numbers at VoG.

2838
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:55,780
But I would imagine that's 1300 plays.

2839
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:57,780
That's still pretty impressive.

2840
02:33:57,780 --> 02:33:59,780
I imagine a lot of you guys are just zoning out, listening to the show,

2841
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:02,780
and playing Flappy Vog, and that's totally cool.

2842
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:04,780
If that's the case.

2843
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:09,780
Black Wolf says 1300 plays. Well, that's still impressive.

2844
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:13,780
So, wow. God, how many times has my head crashed into a wall in the past 3 hours?

2845
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:14,780
That's a little disturbing.

2846
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:15,780
Mine hasn't at all yet.

2847
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:16,780
Yet.

2848
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:17,780
But we're doing my lines.

2849
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:18,780
But you're gonna be in the first DLC.

2850
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:21,780
I could give people a sample.

2851
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:24,780
Okay. Give them one sample. Don't ruin it. Give them one sample.

2852
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:25,780
Yarp.

2853
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:32,780
Alright. That is about gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

2854
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:35,780
Hey, I wanna thank you guys for listening to the show,

2855
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:38,780
having fun with us, whether it be live or podcast.

2856
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:40,780
I really appreciate your support of the show.

2857
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:42,780
You know, all we ask here, we do ask it every week.

2858
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:45,780
If you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two or five about the show.

2859
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:47,780
Help spread the word. That's all we got.

2860
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:51,780
We also could really use some nice reviews.

2861
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:56,780
Five-star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio go a very, very long way in helping to promote the show.

2862
02:34:56,780 --> 02:35:01,780
And we thank you very, very much for all the nice words you guys have to say.

2863
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:04,780
It is about that time where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2864
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:10,780
Loki, hope to see you back soon, but I understand you gotta do what you gotta do there at home.

2865
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:13,780
So, take care of yourself and say hi to Nellie.

2866
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:15,780
Do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

2867
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:18,780
Yes, I'm third place on Flappy Vogue.

2868
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:20,780
Are you really? What's your score?

2869
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:24,780
Forty-two, I think? I don't know.

2870
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:27,780
That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

2871
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:32,780
My final thought tonight is I wanna go to Disneyland.

2872
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:34,780
I wanna go for my birthday.

2873
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:37,780
Well, I kinda had an offer to go next week.

2874
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:38,780
Jeez.

2875
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,780
Jeez.

2876
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:46,780
I might, but it would be literally Lee Friday to go Saturday to drive back Sunday in time for the show.

2877
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:50,780
Which will probably kill me, but do you know what's on Saturday?

2878
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:54,780
Like why I really gotta go? Dapper days.

2879
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:55,780
Bring me back something, Duffy.

2880
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:58,780
Oh, of course. How could I not? How could I not?

2881
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,780
I know.

2882
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:00,780
All right.

2883
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:03,780
And last but not least, Lee, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2884
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:09,780
I start my new schedule at the land of cubicles and tech, Locat.

2885
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:13,780
So I'm happy that I can actually stay up to a normal time tonight.

2886
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:15,780
Huzzah.

2887
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,780
That's it.

2888
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:20,780
All right. That's it. We're done. We're out of here.

2889
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:22,780
We'll be back to do it all again next week, though.

2890
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:24,780
Thank you guys for staying with us and listening.

2891
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:28,780
Oh, wait. Marissa says we have to go to Knott's to see the Billies.

2892
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:29,780
Is that where they moved?

2893
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:30,780
That's where they are.

2894
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:31,780
Get out.

2895
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:32,780
I've never been there either.

2896
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:34,780
I thought they have really good fried chicken.

2897
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:35,780
This is the record.

2898
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:38,780
But I didn't I didn't I thought the Billies were like a part of Disney.

2899
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:41,780
I thought there's like a bunch of Billies.

2900
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:43,780
They do performances at various places.

2901
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:44,780
And I love the Billies.

2902
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:46,780
Well done to Knott's.

2903
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:47,780
Well done on them.

2904
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:48,780
All right. We're out of here.

2905
02:36:48,780 --> 02:36:49,780
Have a good night, everybody.

2906
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:53,780
We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2907
