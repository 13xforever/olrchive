14000	27000	This week, our favorite gaming companies are strengthening their history with rumors of Sony bringing backwards compatibility to the PS4, Microsoft Studios taking ownership of Gears of War, and Nintendo bringing dual screen games to the console. Your comments and more on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	49000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 538 for this February the 2nd of 2014. Happy Puppy Bowl Sunday everybody. It's a big big day today.
49000	50000	Kitten Bowl
50000	56000	Kitten Bowl, Puppy Bowl. Hey, my name is Rob Roberts and that other voice you hear over there is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	57000	Sup bitches.
57000	59000	How you doing Jamie?
59000	61000	Um, feisty.
61000	63000	Were you really excited about all the big games going on today?
63000	66000	Well yeah, I played some Mass Effect today and it was great.
66000	68000	That's the only game you need right?
68000	71000	Well yeah. Now that I've got text mod working.
71000	76000	There you go, there you go. So have you watched the Puppy Bowl or the Kitty Bowl yet and how did you choose?
76000	83000	No, I didn't watch any but I've been looking at Tumblr and Tumblr has been taking care of it for me because then I can watch both through the power of animated gifs.
83000	84000	That's true.
84000	85000	GIFS!
85000	92000	Who needs picture in picture and all that stuff anymore when you just have Twitter and it just tells you everything you need to know and Facebook and all that stuff.
92000	100000	Well that and they were talking about the sports ball stuff in the front room and I felt my brain shutting down and my eyes glazing over and I had to leave.
100000	108000	We do tape live and if you're joining us live and skipping the big football game to listen to our show, first off thanks, we really appreciate it.
108000	120000	If you are participating with us, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
120000	129000	Loki is not here tonight, Techmaster Loki, as y'all know, they had a new baby a couple weeks ago, Loki and Mrs. Loki, so he is still off on baby leave.
129000	133000	He'll be back soon, we don't know if he'll be back next week or the week after.
134000	142000	Jason has been filling in a lot lately but he is also not here tonight because of course the Super Bowl stuff going on, he decided to go to a party and he's earned it.
142000	146000	He comes here from San Francisco which is quite the drive every week or so.
146000	159000	But, you know what, because I know a lot of you are distracted with the big game going on, I got a few stunts up my own sleeve here on how we can have ourselves a heck of a show here on the Big Puppy Bowl Sunday.
159000	168000	So we've got some special guests in studio, one of them I told you was going to be here and he is here in the house, he hasn't been on Orange Lawn's radio in a very long time.
168000	173000	But you might know of him from his frequent phone calls to the show or his time on Horde House.
173000	175000	Everybody say hello to Shane.
175000	176000	Hello.
176000	177000	How you doing Shane?
177000	182000	I'm okay, my old co-worker needs some contact information for work.
182000	188000	Wait, so you're having to work during the show, you haven't come to the show in five years and you want to work during the show?
188000	189000	The mic is really fuzzy.
189000	192000	Yeah, because I have a cat, I don't know what to tell you.
192000	196000	Yeah, just real quick, you can keep talking, I'll pretend I'm listening.
196000	203000	Alright, so what brings you out here to California? You're visiting from Kansas, why do you live in Kansas?
203000	204000	Because it's where I live.
204000	207000	Alright, well you're out here in California, why?
207000	208000	An airplane took me here.
208000	210000	Okay, that's a very good answer.
211000	216000	What are you here to plug or promote these days? Do you have like a Twitter or something? I don't know.
216000	221000	What egotistical way should you promote yourself today?
221000	229000	I don't know. I don't plug anything. I plug my ears when I'm listening to this show or Horde House.
229000	231000	Hey, hey, watch it, watch it.
231000	232000	He plugs in his charger.
232000	234000	Fine, then you know what, we're going to move on.
234000	241000	Shane, believe it or not, I don't know how, but has fans in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
241000	249000	SJ100matt says, yay Shane. Tigerclaw says, well Shane's got to pay them bills so he has to work no matter what.
249000	252000	So, alright, fine, we'll check back in with you later.
252000	257000	I do have some other guests here in studio tonight, this is very exciting.
257000	266000	I promised some big stunts for Puppy Bowl Sunday and I can't think of a bigger stunt than this guy I'm about to introduce.
266000	273000	Everybody say hello to, from the Horde House podcast, Extafur is here live in studio.
273000	275000	Oh hello there Rob.
275000	277000	Hello Extafur.
277000	279000	Hello.
279000	280000	How are you doing?
280000	283000	I'm doing fantastic. How are you doing?
283000	287000	I'm better now that you're here and that you're a part of Orange Lawns Radio officially.
287000	291000	You haven't been on this show in a very long time. I know we've lived together.
291000	295000	It's been perhaps seven years?
295000	296000	It's been about that long.
296000	297000	Yeah, it's been a long time.
297000	301000	Ever since Orange Lawns Radio was its own network and we had Extafur's case of the Mondays.
301000	302000	Right.
302000	305000	So, what have you been up to for the last seven years?
306000	315000	Oh, you know, getting fat, getting skinny, then getting fat again, then getting skinny again. You know, I'm Oprah. That's what I'm saying.
315000	321000	Well, for the listeners who don't know, you did lose a lot of weight. You lost what, like 120 some odd pounds?
321000	323000	She lost a supermodel.
324000	333000	I was at 1.335 pounds and I was down to 195 at one point.
333000	339000	And it all happened because my doctor said I was high cholesterol.
339000	346000	And because my liver enzymes are too high, I had to do it by myself. I had to diet by myself.
346000	350000	I couldn't rely on any gimmicks or medications or anything like that.
350000	359000	So I just kicked my ass and I went to the gym and I grew this passion for the gym.
359000	369000	So now I regularly go. I try to go at least five times a week. And I love it. Are you guys hearing me?
369000	371000	No, no, you're fine. The gym is the best thing ever.
371000	372000	Yes.
372000	375000	Once you get hooked on going, then you really get hooked on going.
375000	385000	Yes, and it's good to have a habit. Build the habit of going. And I'm just loving it. So that's my...
385000	395000	Now, since this is a program about video games and video gaming and all that stuff, did you use any of the Wii Fit or any of the technology stuff?
395000	397000	No, but I do have a Fitbit.
397000	398000	Do you?
398000	399000	Yeah.
399000	400000	Me too.
401000	404000	I have the Fitbit Flex, the one that you wear on your wrist.
404000	407000	I have the one that you put on your pants.
407000	410000	Yeah, my sister has that one. She puts it in her bra.
410000	415000	Me too, when you guys aren't here.
415000	424000	I believe you. I really enjoy the Fitbit. I haven't worn it in a little while because after the move I think I misplaced it.
425000	427000	We just moved into our own house.
427000	435000	And so anyways, yeah, but it's good. I don't rely on gimmicks like that though. I didn't use Wii Fit.
435000	450000	I train with a trainer and I actually last year, like in September, decided that I wanted to do a program to learn to become a personal trainer myself.
450000	468000	So I tried to stick with that. I kind of fell off the bandwagon about October and it's taken me a lot of energy to try and get back on that.
468000	478000	But I'm hoping that once I regain my focus and everything that I can pick that right back up again and finish it.
478000	480000	Well, you look like you're doing fine to me.
480000	482000	Thank you.
482000	484000	You're welcome. So let's talk about video games a little bit.
484000	485000	Okay.
485000	491000	You obviously, I'm sure a lot of our listeners know, you are one of the hosts of Horde House. Hordehouse.com if you want to check that out.
491000	499000	And do you have any other internet projects going on these days? Like Twitters to Pimp or Facebooks or other ego promotion things?
500000	509000	Well, I stream regularly at Twitch.com. Twitch.tv slash E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.
509000	511000	Why do you have to spell it all weird?
511000	521000	Well, the way I usually spell Extrofer was taken so I had to kind of improvise. So, E-X-T-O-P-H-E-R.
521000	523000	And what types of games do you stream?
523000	526000	I stream a lot of Rayman Legends.
526000	528000	Are you a fan?
528000	534000	If you like Rayman Legends then my channel is what you want to watch. I love that game so much.
534000	544000	It's kind of funny because our show, Horde House, is online games and I tend to talk about console games every single time we have a show.
544000	546000	Well, console games are an online experience.
546000	555000	Yeah, there are many console games that have online experiences but I've just been in a very big console gaming phase.
555000	564000	And so a lot of the games I stream are very single player games that are very limited with their online connectivity.
564000	569000	I stream the entirety of Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.
569000	573000	Which I still haven't finished but it's good. I've played that. You were hyping that up on Horde.
573000	575000	Yeah, I cried on my stream.
575000	576000	Baby.
576000	581000	I know. It was pretty pathetic. You can call me a pussy if you want. It's fine.
582000	585000	Although I don't have a vagina. Rob does.
585000	589000	Lies. And girl bits should never be used as an insult.
589000	593000	No, no, no. I think that his vagina is very empowering.
593000	601000	It makes me feel like a butterfly in springtime is what I want to say.
601000	603000	So it makes you feel douchely fresh?
603000	604000	Just stop.
604000	608000	Yes. I feel like I'm in touch with Summer's Eve.
608000	610000	Just stop.
611000	619000	And you guys expect this from me by the way because I coined bleach asshole on this.
619000	620000	At my house.
620000	621000	You invented them.
621000	622000	At my house.
622000	623000	Let's see.
623000	625000	Anyways, so yeah.
625000	628000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks,
628000	631000	Do you think they'll make a follow-up to Brothers called Sisters?
631000	634000	Isn't that a Lifetime show?
634000	636000	No, I think you're thinking Sister, Sister.
636000	638000	Well, there might have been a Lifetime show called Sisters.
638000	642000	No, I don't think they will. I think this one was pretty contained in itself.
642000	646000	You should play it. It's really good. It's only a three hour game.
646000	647000	It's really good.
647000	651000	Codeman's in our chat saying he was watching the stream and he cried watching it.
651000	654000	That doesn't surprise me.
654000	657000	I haven't cried yet, but I'm only in chapter four.
657000	659000	You haven't gotten to the crying bits yet.
659000	660000	Excuse me.
660000	661000	Alright.
661000	667000	We'll get to your gaming week a little later, but let's talk about how did you get into video games?
667000	670000	I mean, you are a bit more of a nerd than you lead on sometimes.
670000	672000	How did you get into video gaming and all that?
672000	677000	Well, when I was growing up, I mean, I grew up with video games.
677000	680000	We had an Atari growing up.
680000	688000	I wasn't that much into it, but when it was Easter and it was like 1985 or something,
688000	696000	and my parents came home with a Nintendo Entertainment System for my brother and I,
696000	699000	and it was really aimed at my brother more than me,
699000	704000	but it really ended up being me that played it most of the time.
704000	706000	And I absolutely loved it.
706000	711000	I played all of the trademark Nintendo games,
711000	717000	Super Mario Brothers, Zelda, Kid Icarus, all of those things.
717000	721000	And I just really loved all of them.
722000	727000	My favorite one was Metroid, and that started it all.
727000	730000	And then we got a Sega Genesis.
730000	732000	We were the first family on the block to have a Sega Genesis.
732000	733000	So, of course, all the kids.
733000	734000	So you're the most popular kid on the block.
734000	738000	Well, when it came to video games, I was kind of a wuss and got made fun of a lot in school.
738000	745000	But when it came to, yeah, yes, they called me a girl and I was bullied in school quite a bit.
745000	747000	What's wrong with being a girl?
747000	750000	Nothing, but they used it as an insult to me.
750000	752000	Which we can all blame the patriarchy for.
752000	759000	They used it as an insult to me, and I was very much bullied in school.
759000	763000	But video games were my way of just escaping,
763000	767000	and a lot of kids on my block would come over and watch me play Sonic,
767000	770000	and I loved that. It was my element.
770000	774000	And then when we got a Super Nintendo, we got a Sega CD,
774000	778000	we got the Game Gear, we got Game Boys.
778000	785000	We had pretty much every system you could think of except for Neo Geo, those really niche systems.
785000	787000	Only the really rich kids could afford that.
787000	791000	My friend had a Neo Geo and a Turbo Graphics CD or whatever, PC Engine.
791000	792000	The Duo.
792000	799000	Yeah, and he was awesome because whenever I got to go to his house, it was like Christmas,
799000	802000	because I got to see the games that I couldn't normally play.
802000	806000	But that was what ruled my life when I was younger, was video games.
806000	810000	I got two more questions for you, and then I want to move on because we have one more guest here in the studio.
810000	812000	I don't want to make him sit there quietly much longer.
812000	814000	But I got two questions for you.
814000	818000	The first, since you brought up Nintendo, this kind of got me thinking that on Hoard House,
818000	823000	you've often been quite a defender of the Wii U on the show,
823000	828000	and that you're a big fan of the Wii U console, and Nintendo's been a lot in the news lately.
828000	834000	We're going to get into some of the recent developments tonight with their latest investors meeting.
834000	840000	Obviously, I'm sure you saw all the news out there about Wii U flopped and all this stuff that was out there.
840000	843000	A, what do you think about all that news as a Nintendo fan?
843000	847000	And B, what do you think people are missing about Wii U?
847000	853000	Well, I don't consider myself a huge proponent of Nintendo.
853000	858000	I don't feel like I'm a big Nintendo fanboy, but I do really like the Wii U.
858000	860000	I feel like it's a fine system.
860000	865000	I think that people write it off because of its name and the fact that it's Nintendo,
865000	871000	and we're not used to having Nintendo consoles really put out a lot of good third-party titles and stuff like that.
871000	876000	And that's all understandable, but I don't know.
876000	879000	I think that Nintendo has a pretty tough job.
879000	887000	They need to sell people on this system, and I don't really have anything to say other than that, really.
888000	893000	What do you think people are missing about the Wii U?
893000	903000	Well, I don't know. You're missing some good, exclusive games that Nintendo has brought out.
903000	911000	Obviously, Rayman Legends was brought out for every platform, really, but it's the definitive experience on the Wii U.
911000	918000	And if you haven't played it on the Wii U, then you're really missing out on a really great co-op experience.
918000	923000	And I say this, I have that game on three different platforms.
923000	927000	So I really feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to that experience.
927000	932000	And there's other games that share the experience.
932000	939000	I know that a lot of people don't like Nintendo for their gimmicks and stuff like that.
939000	946000	I go back and forth on it, but I feel that if you have a gimmick, you can do it right.
946000	950000	And I think that with a lot of their games, they have done it right.
950000	952000	And I think that's really important.
952000	955000	It is possible to have a gimmick.
955000	959000	A lot of people wrote off the DS when it first came out, right?
959000	962000	People thought that was going to be a gimmick. Look at that now.
962000	964000	No comment.
964000	967000	She's playing hers right now, just for the record.
968000	970000	I'd probably have bred with people.
970000	972000	Going to our chatroom for some comments on those questions too.
972000	976000	Locopoco says, just give me Bayonetta 2 soon and no one gets hurt. Right?
976000	981000	Tech2030 says, Wii U is so great. I play it in bed on the gamepad before I go to sleep.
981000	984000	Dartitsuya says, oh yeah, I love mine. Mario 3D World, freaking great.
984000	986000	So we got a lot of Wii U supporters in the chatroom.
986000	988000	We'll talk a little more about the Nintendo stuff later.
988000	990000	I'm very curious to hear what you have to say about that.
990000	993000	Alright, totally different direction, but I have a second question for you.
993000	999000	Since you do this show, Horde House, with me, the online games show, right?
999000	1002000	What's been your favorite experience with online games?
1002000	1005000	Because I figure you've played a lot of them. And why?
1005000	1007000	What's been your favorite online gaming experience and why?
1007000	1013000	My favorite online gaming experience was probably World of Warcraft.
1013000	1020000	Back when the Wrath of the Lich King expansion was the big deal.
1020000	1029000	And the reason why is because it's when I got into a real hardcore gaming type mode, I guess.
1029000	1033000	And I got accepted into a really high-end guild on a server.
1033000	1037000	And I got to beat a lot of endgame content with that guild.
1037000	1040000	And it was just really fun. It was like a rush.
1040000	1046000	And the thing is, it was very brief lasting.
1046000	1053000	I only was doing the hardcore gaming rating thing for just maybe about six months.
1053000	1057000	Compared to the six years that I played WoW.
1057000	1062000	And yet it was one of the best experiences I ever had.
1062000	1067000	Ulduar, that dungeon in particular, that was my favorite dungeon experience.
1067000	1073000	And I think that I'll always hold that as probably my favorite online gaming experience.
1073000	1076000	You made friends with that that you still talk to pretty regularly.
1076000	1079000	Yeah, I do. And they're all good people.
1079000	1090000	And I like that. As much as I don't like WoW now, I still hold that as a very good, solid experience.
1090000	1094000	MMOs are really kind of unique in that.
1094000	1100000	Well, Shane's sitting right here. And Shane and I met on LiveJournal over Animal Crossing.
1100000	1107000	I remember that. But I kind of feel like we really got to know each other and kind of got closer because of Final Fantasy XI.
1107000	1109000	Yeah, I think so. That sounds right.
1109000	1111000	Kind of interesting how MMOs work like that.
1111000	1116000	Before I move on to Matt, since it looks like you're wrapped up with your work stuff, what's been your favorite online gaming experience?
1116000	1119000	I'm playing Phoenix Wright, so no, I'm not wrapped up with my work stuff.
1119000	1121000	Oh, excuse me. Objection!
1121000	1123000	What's been your favorite online gaming experience?
1123000	1125000	Fantasy Star Online.
1125000	1126000	Oh, that's a good answer. Why?
1126000	1133000	It is. Because I almost failed a semester of high school because of it. Because it was so good. That's how amazing to me it was.
1133000	1134000	Are you playing too?
1134000	1137000	I did for a little bit, and then I decided not to.
1137000	1138000	It was fun, I think.
1138000	1140000	It was okay. I just...
1140000	1142000	It's weird that they won't release it here.
1142000	1144000	Sega, they're dumb.
1144000	1150000	Well, let's move on. I want to introduce our other guest who's been sitting there very patiently waiting.
1150000	1154000	Say hello, everybody, to Matt, who's here joining us in studio as well.
1154000	1155000	Hello.
1155000	1157000	Hi. Not to be confused with Loki.
1157000	1164000	Just so you know, you're going to want to get that mic nice and close to you when you talk, because Xtrfer is really loud, so you've got to be about the same.
1164000	1165000	How are you, Matt?
1165000	1167000	I am pretty good. Good to be here.
1167000	1169000	Yeah, I know. We're happy to have you.
1169000	1171000	You play a lot of online games, too. Let's start with that.
1171000	1181000	Because I really feel like, since I've known you, I've probably known you for about a year and a half, since you and Xtrfer have been friends.
1181000	1187000	I've known you for about a year and a half, and I feel like every online game I've played in that time, I've played with you at some point.
1187000	1194000	We played Path of Exile for two days. You played League of Legends. We played Final Fantasy XIV extensively, obviously.
1194000	1198000	What's been an online game you've really enjoyed and liked a lot?
1198000	1203000	The game I like the most is League of Legends. I'm really hardcore with that. I play it all the time.
1204000	1214000	I go into phases, actually. Depending on the MMO that's coming up, usually I'm playing that. Like right now, we're in Final Fantasy XIV.
1214000	1222000	I took a break from League of Legends when I started Final Fantasy XIV, and then I went home for Christmas, and all my cousins are like,
1222000	1230000	Matt, play League of Legends. And so I play League of Legends. I like a lot of board games, too, actually. I played Dominion a lot.
1230000	1234000	Oh, right. You introduced Alan and I to some really cool board games. Dominion's fun.
1234000	1239000	Dominion's a lot of fun. I bet we have a lot of board game geeks out there listening. What are some of your favorite board games you've played?
1239000	1249000	Dominion's definitely one of my favorites. I like Race for the Galaxy. The same designer for Dominion also made a game called Kingdom Builder, which is really fun.
1250000	1260000	I've tried a game similar to the Dominion style. It's called Marvel Legendary, but it's with a Marvel theme, and that's a lot of fun.
1260000	1268000	I like playing more strategic games. I played Le Havre over Christmas, and that was a lot of fun. I don't know if you know any of those games.
1268000	1277000	No, but I'll smile and nod. I like board games, too, though, and every time my friends that are really into them introduce me to them,
1277000	1285000	I never have a bad time. The ones you've introduced me to were great. Tim, who was on the show a while ago, he was into some board games, too.
1285000	1289000	We played The House on the Haunted Hill or something like that. That was a lot of fun. I love that one.
1289000	1294000	Dan's still trying to work on completing our dungeon quest.
1294000	1303000	I have some friends here locally that are into some games. One of my friends here had a night at the comic book shop where we all went and played Sentinels of the Multiverse, and that was a lot of fun.
1303000	1305000	I have not tried that one.
1305000	1307000	That was a lot of fun. That was a fun card game.
1307000	1319000	Let me get this out there, because this is pretty cool. You actually work in the games industry, and it's important to say you're here as yourself tonight, not representing your company.
1319000	1327000	I can't go too far down this rabbit hole asking about the game, but you worked on a game that I'm sure a lot of our music game fans know, right?
1327000	1328000	Rocksmith 2014?
1328000	1333000	Yep, and Rocksmith, the first one, and Rocksmith 2014. I'm our game designer for it.
1333000	1336000	Awesome, and everybody should go buy it and check it out, right?
1336000	1338000	Yes, they should. It's a lot of fun.
1338000	1341000	Available on Amazon.com.
1341000	1343000	And retailers near you, right?
1343000	1347000	Yeah, Exover is the greatest, my greatest cheerleader.
1347000	1357000	So even though I can't go too far down that path asking you questions of that tonight, I can say that if you look at some of the Rocksmith trailers that are out there and some of the behind-the-scenes video, you can see Matt in them.
1357000	1366000	Yeah, you can see me a little bit. I'm not in a lot of them, but I'm the Asian guy with yellow glasses.
1366000	1370000	By the way, Shane got to play a little bit of Rocksmith 2014.
1370000	1372000	I did. It's fantastic.
1372000	1384000	I haven't played it. I'm such a bad friend, but I don't have the guitar and all that, and I've never really had the drive to learn to play, but everybody tells me Rocksmith is so good.
1385000	1387000	This is before I met you.
1387000	1390000	We actually have people in my training class who are totally into it.
1390000	1391000	Yeah.
1391000	1396000	See, I want to be able to ask him questions like, how does it feel to have killed Rock Band, but I can't go down that path.
1396000	1400000	I would love to play it, but I legitimately can't because of my hand.
1400000	1412000	All right, let me go to the questions I can. So everybody check out Rocksmith 2014, but let me ask you the questions I can't ask you, and that is, what made you want to get into game design? Why did you choose that path in life?
1412000	1423000	I've always loved games growing up. I grew up with a Nintendo and a Super Nintendo, and my childhood friends would always be like, oh, let's start a video game company.
1423000	1433000	In my spare time, I'd write new spells for Final Fantasy. Just because I was really into it, I wanted to make a game.
1433000	1438000	Okay, I love that you fess up to this stuff because so many people did nerdy shit like that but won't fess up to it.
1438000	1445000	And I remember being in grade school, we would draw those dungeon games on pencil and paper. Like, did anybody else do this in their school?
1445000	1452000	And it'd be like, have the pits and the dragons. You'd have that like item shop that you draw and everything. Like people, like that's how people get, you play them on lunch.
1452000	1461000	When I was in high school, my friend Ashley and I, my senior year of high school, sat in the back room during our study hall and made up our own RPG.
1461000	1464000	With maps, everything, you name it. We did our own role play game.
1464000	1468000	That's awesome, that's awesome. So did you do all that too? You designed your own levels?
1468000	1471000	Yes, I think every child.
1471000	1476000	He designed games on his calculator, like those graphing calculators.
1476000	1480000	Oh, were you that guy trying to get Tetris on your TI-81 and all that?
1480000	1489000	Yeah, my TI-82, I remember. I was sick of all these bad poker games on there so I was like, I'm going to create something better.
1489000	1499000	But I didn't make anything original. I remember learning how to program. I created the game Mastermind. I don't know if you know that one.
1499000	1502000	Oh yeah, that's like the old, with all the pigs?
1502000	1504000	The guessing one, yes.
1504000	1512000	Well, is it true that, like, because I know I've talked, like Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us here at the voice games network, he's done a lot of game design stuff too.
1512000	1518000	And I know it's always interesting. He talks about that when you first design a game, you actually should make a game you know.
1518000	1525000	That's why you see a lot of people make Breakout clones. I remember when he was learning XNA, he did Crazy Eights, you know, like a card game.
1525000	1530000	So a lot of people always start with something they know. So is that kind of why, you know, Mastermind is a game a lot of people know?
1530000	1536000	Yeah, I mean, I think, well, I think it's different between trying to learn how to program something versus trying to create something on your own.
1536000	1544000	Because I think as a game designer, it's really easy to come up with your, I mean, it's really easy to not use programming.
1544000	1548000	You really don't want to say, like, programming's my crutch when you're trying to create a game.
1548000	1559000	Try to create a card game or a board game and just put all your ideas out on paper and then put them on cards, make a fake board, you know.
1559000	1564000	Just draw on pencil and, you know, stick figures or even less of that.
1564000	1572000	What I like to do sometimes, like, take magic cards and I put them in sleeves and then I print out stuff, paper, and put them in the sleeves.
1572000	1577000	And then you can make your own little card game that way and, you know, have friends try it out and play.
1577000	1579000	And, you know, you guys might just have a lot of fun.
1579000	1585000	Yeah, that's awesome. So you knew pretty early on game design was what you wanted to do.
1585000	1593000	Like, you never, like, oh, maybe I want to do, I don't know, I want to be a teacher or an actor instead or something.
1593000	1594000	You kind of always knew that?
1594000	1603000	No, my life actually was, well, as a kid, I thought that was just kind of a thing you dream of but you never really actually aspire to go towards.
1603000	1611000	Like a porn actor. Would you say it's similar? I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
1611000	1619000	So, I mean, and I had other dreams like that, you know, I wanted to design roller coasters too when I was like, maybe I'll be an engineer or something of that sort.
1619000	1629000	And so I just kind of went into computer science because I was interested in programming and I went through that.
1629000	1634000	And I didn't really think actually that I would really go into games at first.
1634000	1636000	I was like, well, maybe I could try to get into a game company.
1636000	1641000	And I actually, when I was in college, I had an internship at a company called Wild Tangent.
1642000	1649000	Oh, I remember that. That was the stuff that installed its crap. That wasn't you that did that, did you?
1649000	1655000	No, I probably was because that was back in 2000, 2001. So that was those time of years.
1655000	1662000	But I actually hated the job environment there. And so I was like, I have no idea what I'm going to do.
1662000	1666000	So I decided like, well, I really like the math side of computer science.
1666000	1672000	So I actually went, I spent like the next eight years in academia and that ended up not panning out.
1672000	1675000	And I was like, well, what I'm going to do? And I was like, well, what did I want to do when I was little?
1675000	1677000	I was like, I wanted to design games.
1677000	1685000	So I at that point of time, I was really into a game called Hellgate London at that point of time.
1685000	1686000	Yeah, that game.
1686000	1690000	Yeah, it's a fun game. It's made from the old Diablo 2 team.
1690000	1695000	And I played it a lot and I contributed on their forums a lot.
1695000	1702000	And I just kept on contributing and contributing that the developers started talking to me a lot.
1702000	1707000	And then there came the point of time during my academic career, it's like I ran out of funding.
1707000	1710000	Because most of my academia life, I was under a grant or something.
1710000	1713000	But then my grant ran out and my research wasn't being published.
1713000	1715000	So I was like, what am I going to do?
1715000	1721000	And I talked to the developers and they said, oh, we're going to have a game design open up pretty soon.
1721000	1725000	And I was like, awesome, I want to try it. And they're like, okay.
1725000	1732000	And so I applied for it and they liked me when I interviewed with them and that's where I started.
1732000	1735000	Wow, that's awesome. That's a great story, though. That's really cool.
1735000	1739000	It's funny because I interned when I was in college.
1739000	1742000	I was originally wanting to be started as a weatherman.
1742000	1746000	And then I was going to be a broadcast journalist, right? I was going to be that guy on the news.
1746000	1751000	And I actually interned at a news station up where I went to school and I really hated it.
1751000	1758000	Well, actually, I take that back. It was a lot of fun. I had fun, but everybody else seemed really miserable.
1758000	1762000	And it was kind of really a wake up call that like, wow, this isn't as glamorous as it looks.
1762000	1765000	A lot of people here really are not having fun. I don't know if I want to do this.
1765000	1770000	But it kind of turned into like if I didn't go through that, I might not have this radio show I have now,
1770000	1777000	you know, with my friends on kind of our own terms. So, you know, it's interesting how what you learn can kind of turn into something else.
1777000	1788000	Anyway. Yeah. What's great about I feel the game design field is that if you if you work forward towards it, you can get a game design job.
1788000	1793000	I've met a lot of other game designers. They don't have a formal education or anything of that sort.
1793000	1798000	But what they do is they have passion and usually the most important aspect.
1798000	1807000	And when I interview other prospectus for game designers is they have to be they have to be excited about games that be playing games.
1807000	1814000	They have to. And then and then hopefully they have one more step above that where they start analyzing like, well, this is what makes a good game.
1814000	1817000	This is what makes a bad game. But how do you know that in general?
1817000	1822000	It's just what you do and don't like. And you you know, you start from that from that point.
1822000	1828000	And and then usually I mean, you'll have a lot of people that have that same skill set,
1828000	1833000	but you would want someone who's then taking the next step of trying to create something on their own.
1833000	1839000	I've had friends that, you know, she created she worked on her own webcomic for a couple of years,
1839000	1848000	and that's really what got her in the in the game industry and, you know, helped her helped her get a more narrative game design type position.
1848000	1856000	And me, my Wow. Why are we still trapped in my spare room for after 12 years doing this little dog and pony show?
1856000	1861000	No, I'm kidding. We love it. We love it. All right. No, I mean, a lot.
1861000	1866000	I mean, and that's the thing is that, you know, and that's why I was saying earlier, you can anyone could create a game.
1866000	1871000	You could create games out of paper just from, you know, make your own card game, make your own board game.
1871000	1877000	And just that itself and just showing your passion for creating and trying to, you know, entertain other people.
1877000	1884000	That that that is really the most important thing when we when when when people are looking for game designers.
1884000	1889000	That's great advice. I love that. And that's straight from somebody who knows what they're talking about.
1889000	1895000	I'm going to our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com Dungeon Buster says Hellgate London had a lot of promise to it.
1895000	1899000	Wish it had a better chance to actually accomplish what it wanted to sit out to do.
1899000	1904000	So definitely the game had a lot of fans there. Yeah. That coming from live dot vog network dot com.
1904000	1907000	Well, anything I know we plugged down the Rocksmith series.
1907000	1912000	Is there anything else you want to plug out there? Personal projects or anything while you're here tonight?
1912000	1917000	Just Rocksmith 2014 play it. Yeah. You're welcome to give me your feedback.
1917000	1925000	I'll take it by Rayman legends. This is still Matt talking, by the way.
1925000	1933000	Yeah. A lot of my spare time playing games is watching Christopher play Rayman legends on three different platforms.
1933000	1937000	Also, our chats are a little distracted right now because Loki joined the chat room.
1937000	1942000	Loki is in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com. And Loki says, I'm hoping to be back on next week.
1942000	1947000	So be great. We miss Loki, but totally understand why he's got to take the time to be with the additions to the family.
1947000	1951000	And Loki is probably just kind of mad he's missing all you guys here in studio tonight.
1951000	1957000	So we have a pretty packed house tonight. I really wish we could see Loki and Miss Loki and their baby.
1957000	1961000	Wish we had more time. You should go there right now. I'm sure they're not trying to sleep or anything.
1961000	1964000	Just go right now. All right. No, stay here on the show. Darn it.
1964000	1968000	Shane, I want to go back to you for like just a minute because you blew me off earlier.
1968000	1973000	But now you're not doing anything important. You're just playing Phoenix, right? Trying to save my client's life.
1973000	1978000	All right. But when it will, because we were talking, we were just talking with Matt and Matt, you know, has a lot of experience in the game industry.
1978000	1984000	And I know you've told a little bit about this on the show before, but since, you know, we do gain and lose listeners every so often,
1984000	1989000	there's probably people out there that don't know that you at one time worked in the industry as well, right?
1989000	1996000	Yes. And where did you work? Konami. And what did you do? I made DDR. You yourself made the whole game?
1996000	2003000	Just me. Just you? With a piece of paper and a dream.
2003000	2009000	Oh, so your story is kind of like grassroots. How did you get into it?
2009000	2014000	Was it really a piece of paper and a dream or what? It was connections. Connections.
2014000	2019000	That's that's true. That's how it went. I guess. I guess so. Yes.
2019000	2023000	But you you were really passionate about music games though, right? Yeah. And I still am. Yeah.
2023000	2028000	It's just they don't have to. They have to be good. They can't be crap. What's what's good and what's crap?
2028000	2032000	See, he can't say, but you can. You don't work in the industry anymore.
2032000	2038000	D.J. Maxx is awesome. Uh-huh. DDR is kind of crap.
2038000	2049000	Pump It Up is awesome. And what else is crap? Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero is crap. Glad it died.
2049000	2055000	D.J. Hero was awesome though. So what what why don't why don't you work there anymore?
2056000	2061000	Because they moved and they weren't. Can I even talk about that? Probably not.
2061000	2067000	All right. I guess I can. All right. Just in that sense, they moved.
2067000	2075000	And oh, God, I don't know what else to ask you. How's life? Yeah.
2075000	2080000	It's full of courtroom drama right now. Why do you love Phoenix Wright so much?
2080000	2083000	It's full of courtroom drama. That's true. You do.
2083000	2087000	And now that I think about it, you you your favorite TV show is Law and Order SVU, right?
2087000	2093000	Oh, Power Rangers. Do you want to talk about Mass Effect?
2093000	2098000	Would that make you feel better? No, I can talk about Power Rangers. I don't care.
2098000	2102000	I would like to hear more about Power Rangers. So only the Japanese ones.
2102000	2106000	OK. My favorite one for a while was the one where there were cops.
2106000	2111000	So I guess it kind of makes sense. That one was interesting. But now now they're going to be trains.
2111000	2116000	And it's awesome. Really? Yeah. I mean, I understand why the train ones like popular,
2116000	2121000	but still. Yes. And they switched their costumes, which is awesome.
2121000	2126000	I still think that nothing is as awesome as Mega Ranger was. I didn't watch the Japanese
2126000	2131000	version, but it kind of sucked in America. I'm watching Japanese
2131000	2136000	one of Time Ranger Time Rangers. Awesome. The intro sounds like a
2136000	2141000	90s sci fi show. And it's amazing.
2141000	2146000	I still think Mega Ranger was best. All right. Well, congrats, Shane. You succeeded in bringing Power Rangers chat to the show.
2146000	2151000	I hope I'll bring more than that way. There's going to be some Pokemon.
2151000	2156000	Well, that kind of works. Well, we got it. We got to keep it moving and get into a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
2156000	2160000	Yes, we usually do a kickoff topic, but we talk to everybody for a little while. That was our kickoff topic.
2160000	2165000	So let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.
2165000	2170000	So we know Shane has been playing Phoenix Wright, so we can skip him. How about you,
2170000	2175000	DarkSocker? We'll go back to him. I'm kidding. I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now, am I?
2175000	2180000	That bitch, Ed, won't leave my town. Seriously, he's fucking creepy. You need the right to be able to evict people.
2180000	2185000	But I guess Nintendo will. Blue horse with purple eyeshadow. That's just so to clash. Anyway,
2185000	2193000	I am playing Animal Crossing. I finally deleted Julian's character now that he has my old wild world.
2193000	2204000	So I played Mass Effect 3 because I finally figured out how to seamlessly change out hair textures in the actual game files.
2204000	2211000	So I have completely modded my game. And the only problem is that I can't get custom textures replaced.
2211000	2217000	So I'm using text mod for that. Does your hair look as good as Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition now?
2217000	2225000	I don't want to say anything bad about it, but it still doesn't move like real hair does. No.
2225000	2233000	But one of my shepherds has a really neat looking ponytail that doesn't look like the crappy ponytail that comes in the game.
2233000	2244000	With the little, what is that thing in her face? It's actually really good. So I played, I've been playing some more of my characters and customizing them because it's also The Sims for me.
2244000	2255000	And I finally beat that stupid dungeon in Zelda. After passing my week exam at work and then I go and just say,
2255000	2267000	I'll try that dungeon again. Beat it. So it's very happy. And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that I'm sure have hit a wall in a video game.
2267000	2273000	And then they come back to it like weeks later and it's like, beat it in one hit. Like, I know I've totally done that on a game before.
2273000	2279000	Well, yeah. And I knew that that's what it was going to take is that's what it took back in on that same boss in Link to the Past.
2279000	2289000	Because it's a stupid, whatever the circle thing is that knocks you off the platform. Or as I call it, God damn you bitch when I'm playing it.
2289000	2290000	How classy.
2290000	2303000	Well, because I'm a classy bitch. So anyway, I think that's really about it. I mean, I've kind of put off my Japanese coach because I found my Kanji book. So I'm trying to study on paper.
2303000	2305000	You've been learning enough lately.
2305000	2311000	My brain is full. I know how to do so many things on non-PC computers now.
2311000	2322000	Good times. All right. We're going to go over to Shane and ask Shane about his gaming week. But before I get to that, I have some comments for Shane from our chatroom at live.mognetwork.com
2322000	2328000	Tiger Claw says, you ever watch the Power Rangers that had that crossover with Ninja Turtles, the next mutation?
2328000	2330000	Try to forget it.
2330000	2338000	S2100 Matt says, the other question is, will Shane convince Rob to buy a game live on air tonight? He always convinces him to buy something.
2338000	2339000	Oh, Lord.
2339000	2345000	I'll figure out something. I was going to bring Skylanders. Apparently it's supposed to be Rocksmith.
2345000	2347000	Rocksmith.
2347000	2351000	Dartitsuya says, Mighty Morphin Power Voggers. Possibly.
2351000	2356000	By the way, remind me and I'm going to have to show you the Mega Ranger versus Car Ranger movie.
2356000	2358000	I don't like Car Ranger.
2359000	2361000	But it's better Japanese.
2361000	2364000	All right, Shane. How was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
2364000	2374000	I played, well, I've been mostly in California for this week, so I played a lot of Vita and 3DS stuff.
2374000	2382000	I've played Phoenix Wright. I've been playing Pokemon and Zelda. I've played DJ Maxx and a little bit of The Walking Dead.
2382000	2390000	And if I were at home, I could have been playing my copy of Bravely Default, and it makes me mad that I'm not home for that.
2390000	2392000	Kind of sucks.
2392000	2396000	Why are you tapping your fingers at me? You like to hurry up.
2396000	2398000	No, I'm not.
2398000	2400000	Well, now I'm done.
2400000	2406000	All right. Let's see. Loki in our chat room says, seriously, fuck Skylanders.
2406000	2410000	No, they're amazing, and I don't think they're attractive, so I'm not going to.
2410000	2413000	Why do you like Skylanders so much?
2413000	2420000	Because it's a fun, stupid game with neat characters, and the newest one's really fun because you can jump.
2420000	2422000	Why do you like Pokemon so much?
2422000	2426000	Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.
2426000	2428000	And why do you like Mass Effect so much?
2428000	2431000	Because they're adorable, and you can collect so many.
2431000	2433000	That sounds like me in all of my saves.
2433000	2436000	Did I miss anything? Did I miss any big games?
2436000	2438000	Why do you love Final Fantasy XIV so much?
2438000	2443000	Because they have minions, and you can collect so many, and it's fun to play.
2443000	2446000	And I'm very sad I haven't got to play it this week, really.
2446000	2448000	Aw, I could boot it up on the PlayStation 3.
2448000	2452000	Yeah, and then I could not play it because that's a crappy way to play it.
2452000	2454000	Shade. All right.
2454000	2456000	Extover, how was your gaming week?
2456000	2461000	It was fine. What did I play? I played some Don't Starve.
2461000	2465000	I played a lot of Rayman Legends, of course,
2466000	2468000	because I'm trying to get my last trophy in that game.
2468000	2470000	I only have one left to go.
2470000	2472000	Wait, wait. We also played Mario.
2472000	2473000	We did. We played...
2473000	2475000	And I kept getting the crown.
2475000	2478000	We played Mario 3D World 4-player. It was fun.
2478000	2484000	That's the only way I can enjoy that game, I figured out this week.
2484000	2486000	Actually, I figured it out a while back.
2486000	2492000	I was reminded of how much better it is with multiple people as opposed to single player.
2492000	2495000	I don't know. I just don't enjoy it as much on single player.
2495000	2497000	So sue me.
2497000	2507000	But I actually got to see Tomb Raider today briefly at Rob's tonight on PS4.
2507000	2511000	I've already completed it on PC, but it looks excellent on PS4.
2511000	2516000	And yeah, I think that's it.
2516000	2518000	I don't think I've played anything.
2518000	2520000	Oh, I played Android Cactus, too.
2520000	2525000	Assault Android Cactus. Great, great, great, great indie game event.
2525000	2526000	You've been livestreaming that one a lot lately, too.
2526000	2527000	Oh, yes.
2527000	2530000	Again, I'm on Twitch.tv.
2530000	2533000	Thank you, Rob, for the opportunity to plug my Twitch.
2533000	2535000	You're so welcome.
2535000	2538000	Slash e-x-t-o-p-h-e-r.
2538000	2540000	Also, you can add me on Twitter.
2540000	2543000	My handle is...
2543000	2545000	What is it? It's X-to-fer-c.
2545000	2549000	It's X-t-o-f-e-r-c, as in cat.
2549000	2554000	But anyways, I got to see Tomb Raider, and that was cool.
2554000	2556000	And Android Cactus.
2556000	2558000	It's called Assault Android Cactus.
2558000	2560000	It's a weird name, but it's a shoot-'em-up.
2560000	2567000	It's a twin-stick shooter, kind of in the style of Smash TV.
2567000	2572000	And it's really fun, and it's available on Steam.
2572000	2575000	It was only made by three people.
2575000	2578000	And I can't stress that enough, because when you see the game...
2578000	2580000	With a piece of paper and a dream.
2580000	2583000	Yeah, it started with a piece of paper and a dream.
2583000	2586000	Much like how Shane started with DDR.
2586000	2590000	So yeah, you should check it out.
2590000	2593000	There's a demo on Steam.
2593000	2595000	I mean, it's a gorgeous game, and it's really fun.
2595000	2598000	It's very addictive, and it's kind of challenging.
2598000	2599000	So there you go.
2599000	2600000	Excellent.
2600000	2602000	Matt, what does a week in playing games look like for you?
2602000	2603000	What have you been up to?
2603000	2607000	With Shane being here, I was, I guess, introducing him to other games.
2607000	2610000	Dominion and Rocksmith, of course.
2610000	2611000	Also fun.
2611000	2615000	And playing Mario with what Exo said.
2615000	2618000	And we also played Cards Against Humanity.
2618000	2620000	That was really good.
2620000	2622000	Oh god, that was an epic...
2622000	2625000	How many hours? Like, four hour cards.
2625000	2627000	We played through every single card.
2627000	2629000	Every single white card.
2629000	2633000	Yeah, our friend Tim, who you've had on the show before, right?
2633000	2642000	He has every single expansion, and he brought him over, and we played the crap out of that game.
2642000	2645000	He must have played that a lot, because that was like New Year's Eve, too.
2645000	2647000	It was like going through the entire deck.
2647000	2649000	But yeah, I had a great time.
2649000	2651000	Definitely a great time.
2651000	2653000	And then, of course, Final Fantasy XIV.
2653000	2654000	Yay.
2654000	2655000	And League of Legends.
2655000	2656000	Boo.
2656000	2658000	Why the League of Legends thing?
2658000	2659000	Because it sucks.
2659000	2661000	Why? You gotta have a reason.
2661000	2662000	Because it's not fun.
2662000	2664000	You haven't played with me yet.
2664000	2665000	Counterpoint.
2665000	2668000	That will make it less fun. I don't want to get yelled at.
2668000	2670000	I'm not going to yell at him.
2670000	2671000	It's a lie.
2671000	2674000	Does Matt yell at you when he's playing games with you?
2674000	2676000	No, but I hear stories.
2676000	2680000	Matt is notorious for pulling out the bitch side on League of Legends.
2680000	2684000	Is he? Because I've heard him playing Final Fantasy XIV.
2684000	2686000	Sometimes I hear his tone.
2686000	2693000	No, you know what? He's awesome because he can separate games from real life.
2693000	2695000	Shane totally can't.
2695000	2698000	If Shane doesn't like you in a video game, he doesn't like you in real life.
2698000	2700000	Oh yeah, I've laid you off completely.
2700000	2702000	It's a good thing you already like him in real life.
2702000	2704000	Occasionally.
2704000	2708000	No, he's actually very professional when it comes to that.
2708000	2711000	He doesn't do it personally.
2711000	2715000	He's not there for personal insults. To his defense.
2715000	2717000	But yeah, he does yell at you.
2717000	2719000	Well, I've never heard him go like,
2719000	2720000	Rob, you're a fucking idiot.
2720000	2722000	But I definitely hear that tone.
2722000	2728000	Like, you know, you've got to not get hit with the plumes again.
2728000	2730000	I can't do it like he does it.
2730000	2733000	But you know, the whole clenched, like,
2733000	2740000	Gosh, Rob, you sure have a problem dodging those landslides.
2741000	2743000	Sorry, I can't stop laughing.
2743000	2746000	No, that's fine. It's because it's true. No, no, it's great.
2746000	2754000	Alright, let's see, I'm trying to look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2754000	2758000	Segg says, when I get on the show, how about I do a cardboard game segment?
2758000	2761000	You know what? I know it's a video game show, but...
2761000	2762000	Like a cardboard game?
2762000	2764000	No, card slash board.
2764000	2765000	Well, you didn't specify.
2765000	2766000	Card or board.
2766000	2771000	I didn't know if there was, like, a game with a refrigerator box that I was unaware of.
2773000	2777000	Alright, I think a lot of folks like card and board games, too.
2777000	2779000	So, why not? Games are games.
2779000	2782000	Let me talk quickly about my gaming week.
2782000	2785000	I haven't been playing a whole lot besides Final Fantasy XIV, honestly,
2785000	2787000	because, you know, I've got problems.
2787000	2792000	But I have been playing the new Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4.
2792000	2795000	Now, I did play Tomb Raider before on Xbox 360,
2795000	2797000	so this is really the second time I'm playing it.
2797000	2799000	And I don't...
2799000	2802000	You alright over there? Your phone just blew up.
2802000	2804000	It's vognetwork on my phone.
2804000	2808000	It did a fanfare for me playing Tomb Raider this week.
2808000	2810000	So, yeah, I've been playing it on the PlayStation 4,
2810000	2814000	and I noticed that they definitely did a lot more to the game than just,
2814000	2816000	ooh, it's prettier and more high-res textures.
2816000	2819000	I mean, obviously it has all the DLC stuff in there, too.
2819000	2821000	So, ooh, all the outfits.
2821000	2824000	But I thought it was interesting, like, just the really subtle things,
2824000	2828000	like that little light that's on the back of the PlayStation 4 controller,
2828000	2830000	like, they actually use that, like...
2830000	2832000	So if you're playing in the dark or whatever,
2832000	2835000	like, let's say you have Laura get a torch,
2835000	2837000	and she lights it up in a dark cave.
2837000	2840000	The light on the back of the PlayStation 4 will actually glow,
2840000	2843000	like, red and yellow and, like, flicker on those colors,
2843000	2845000	like a flame would.
2845000	2847000	And just little subtle things like that are really cool.
2847000	2852000	And then it uses the speaker inside the controller quite a bit, too.
2852000	2856000	So there are... there's more than just, like, the prettier graphics.
2856000	2858000	So I thought that was good, because, you know,
2858000	2861000	I'm paying $60 to play a game I've already played before.
2861000	2867000	But it's cool, because the neat thing about where the PlayStation 4 is at right now
2867000	2869000	is that there's really not... and the Xbox One, really,
2869000	2872000	is that there's not really a whole lot of games on either one.
2872000	2875000	I mean, yeah, you've got, you know what, Need for Speed, Knack, the sports games,
2875000	2878000	but I think there's, like, kind of a lull right now
2878000	2880000	as systems tend to get to in this time of year.
2880000	2882000	So I actually think the repackaging of Tomb Raider,
2882000	2887000	which was, you know, one of the best from the end of the last generation of games,
2887000	2889000	I think that was kind of a smart idea. I think it really was.
2889000	2891000	You know what else is getting repackaged?
2891000	2892000	What?
2892000	2893000	Rayman Legends.
2893000	2894000	Is it really? Oh, that's right, it is.
2894000	2895000	It's coming out in, like, two weeks, right?
2895000	2899000	Yep, and I... you should get it. Everybody should get it.
2899000	2900000	You're gonna play it again, right?
2900000	2902000	You know what? I think I will.
2904000	2907000	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
2907000	2908000	Locopoco says,
2908000	2910000	Tomb Raider Definitive Edition is so, so pretty.
2910000	2913000	Yeah, it's really not just the hair, it's just you can...
2913000	2915000	you just noticed it in the textures and everything,
2915000	2917000	and the smoothness is really...
2917000	2920000	and I know there's a lot of that controversy
2920000	2922000	between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
2922000	2925000	I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the Xbox One version,
2925000	2926000	I've only played the PlayStation 4 version,
2926000	2929000	but it's really smooth, and the framerate's great, and yeah.
2929000	2931000	It's really cool.
2932000	2934000	And Tech2030 says,
2934000	2936000	That game is worth playing more than two times.
2936000	2938000	There you go.
2938000	2940000	So that was... I mean, I didn't really play an awful lot
2940000	2942000	besides those games, honestly.
2942000	2944000	I spent a lot of time... I did some livestreaming.
2944000	2946000	Oh, I did play Pinball Arcade,
2946000	2949000	because I did some livestreaming of that on PlayStation 4.
2949000	2952000	I bought the entire Season 1 worth of tables,
2952000	2955000	and I died a lot on the Star Trek Next Generation table,
2955000	2957000	because that table is an asshole.
2957000	2958000	But it's Star Trek.
2958000	2959000	It is in real life, too.
2959000	2962000	It is. Like, the gutters on the left and right eat your ball,
2962000	2964000	like, all the time. There's nothing you can do about it.
2964000	2966000	Did your balls get eaten?
2966000	2968000	I hate you.
2968000	2969000	Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
2969000	2971000	All right. Let's move on.
2971000	2972000	That's it for our gaming week.
2972000	2973000	So, quickly, some housekeeping.
2973000	2975000	I don't have a lot, so I'm just gonna say follow us on Facebook.
2975000	2977000	Facebook.com slash Orange Laundry Dale.
2977000	2978000	We're also on Twitter.
2978000	2980000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2980000	2982000	We should be here for most of the coming weeks.
2982000	2985000	We may miss a show in early March,
2985000	2987000	but I'll keep you guys posted on that
2987000	2989000	as we get a little closer to that date.
2989000	2991000	Have we missed a week since, like, last year?
2991000	2992000	I don't think we have.
2992000	2993000	I did.
2993000	2994000	You did, but...
2994000	2996000	Because I had the plague.
2996000	2997000	The show is still going on.
2997000	2999000	So, yeah, we might have a week off in March,
2999000	3000000	but we'll keep you posted on that.
3000000	3002000	All right. In the meantime, I guess we'll get into some news,
3002000	3005000	and I'm actually gonna start us off tonight with some gaming news,
3005000	3008000	since Loki and Jason's both not here to start us off.
3008000	3009000	I'll start us off.
3009000	3011000	And we're gonna talk Nintendo, like I promised.
3011000	3016000	There was a lot of chatter this week with what's going on with Nintendo.
3016000	3019000	As I mentioned earlier in the show when I was talking to Extifer,
3019000	3021000	we all saw the news stories about,
3021000	3025000	Wii U is flopping and Wii U's not making expectations.
3025000	3026000	What's gonna happen?
3026000	3028000	What are they gonna do when they have the investor meeting?
3028000	3030000	Are they gonna put Mario on cell phones?
3030000	3032000	Well, that investor meeting happened this week,
3032000	3035000	and quite a bit kind of came out of that meeting.
3035000	3037000	Let's touch on some of the bullet points.
3037000	3039000	Mario Kart 8 officially dated.
3039000	3042000	Mario Kart 8 will be out in May at this point.
3042000	3045000	I don't want to be that guy,
3045000	3048000	but I kind of thought this was gonna be the case
3048000	3051000	when they delayed Donkey Kong Country Freeze.
3051000	3054000	What the heck's the name of that game, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze?
3054000	3056000	Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.
3056000	3058000	Thank you, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.
3058000	3060000	I kind of had the feeling when they delayed that game
3060000	3062000	that it meant that Mario Kart 8 was getting delayed.
3062000	3064000	So the push to May doesn't really surprise me.
3064000	3067000	Sure, it's sad, I want the game now,
3067000	3069000	but I would rather they wait till May to make it good
3069000	3071000	than release it before it's really ready.
3071000	3074000	And who knows, maybe the release in May is strategical too.
3074000	3076000	Maybe they need to space things out for the end of the year.
3076000	3077000	I don't know.
3077000	3079000	Other big news that came out of the investor meeting.
3079000	3083000	Wii U Virtual Console will be getting Nintendo DS games.
3083000	3085000	And there's a lot of people out there going,
3085000	3086000	I called it.
3086000	3088000	One of them being Loki, the other one being Alan,
3088000	3090000	because when we did our silly little list list
3090000	3092000	at the end of the year last year,
3092000	3093000	they both, in one way or another,
3093000	3095000	said that that was the type of thing that was gonna happen.
3095000	3098000	So we are gonna get the DS games on the Wii U Virtual Console.
3098000	3100000	No, we don't know which games.
3100000	3101000	No, we don't know when.
3101000	3103000	We do know that they showed Brain Age
3103000	3105000	in a conceptual type of thing,
3105000	3107000	and that would be an obvious choice.
3107000	3110000	I mean, most of those Nintendo first-party games
3110000	3112000	are gonna be the obvious things that come out on Wii U
3112000	3114000	pretty quickly.
3114000	3117000	Another very interesting comment that came out of that is that
3117000	3120000	we've got over a technical hurdle with Virtual Console
3120000	3123000	and expect to get the games out quick.
3123000	3125000	And I think that was in regards to the Nintendo DS games,
3125000	3127000	but some people have been interpreting it as
3127000	3130000	there's gonna be more Virtual Console games.
3130000	3131000	That's not a bad thing, I don't think.
3131000	3133000	They've really been trickling out.
3133000	3139000	But, again, I wish there was more to Virtual Console.
3139000	3140000	I don't know.
3140000	3142000	I get the whole concept that people just wanna have
3142000	3144000	the emulated games, but it just seems like
3144000	3147000	there would be value in online play,
3147000	3150000	leaderboards, trophies,
3150000	3152000	being able to see your friends play on the webcam
3152000	3154000	that's built into the gamepad,
3154000	3157000	just something like that.
3157000	3159000	They're gonna be building a Quick Start function
3159000	3161000	into the Nintendo Wii U gamepad.
3161000	3165000	They say it still takes too long to play Wii U games,
3165000	3167000	that they're gonna do a Quick Start function,
3167000	3169000	that you're gonna be able to get the game right up,
3169000	3171000	and that's something that's supposed to come later this year.
3171000	3173000	I think that's a good thing.
3173000	3176000	It's a good thing, but I don't understand...
3176000	3179000	I don't quite understand why people feel like
3179000	3181000	it takes too long to boot up and play a game.
3181000	3185000	It literally takes two inputs.
3185000	3187000	You click your user, me,
3187000	3189000	and then you click the game that you wanna play.
3189000	3192000	That's it. It doesn't take too long to boot it up.
3192000	3195000	People... I think I read on Kotaku...
3195000	3198000	You know how sensationalist they can be?
3198000	3199000	Well, first off, you shouldn't have read that.
3199000	3200000	I know, I know, I know.
3200000	3203000	But on Kotaku, they were talking about how
3203000	3206000	you go through a myriad of menu screens
3206000	3208000	to get to the game you need to get to.
3208000	3210000	That is complete bullshit.
3210000	3212000	That is not true.
3212000	3217000	You don't go through a myriad of video game menus.
3217000	3219000	You go through two screens.
3219000	3222000	Like, you know, get over it.
3222000	3226000	And so I don't feel like it's absolutely needful
3226000	3228000	that you have to have a quick boot.
3228000	3229000	But I mean, it is fine.
3229000	3231000	It's fine for what it is, I guess.
3231000	3232000	Brad from Pod Culture says,
3232000	3236000	If you can't get your game up, you might need Wiagra.
3236000	3238000	Oh, I see what you did there.
3238000	3241000	To be fair, I don't think the process
3241000	3243000	is really any slower on Wii U
3243000	3245000	than it is on any of the other consoles.
3245000	3248000	It's actually faster on Wii U than it is PS3
3248000	3250000	to get to your game.
3250000	3253000	It's just I don't understand why people are...
3253000	3255000	But I can also understand the allure
3255000	3258000	in being able to maybe just turn on the gamepad
3258000	3260000	and you have your virtual console game
3260000	3262000	right up on the gamepad without maybe even
3262000	3264000	necessarily having to navigate menus.
3264000	3266000	Yeah, I mean, I can see the draw for it.
3266000	3268000	I'm certainly not against it.
3268000	3272000	But I don't know where the controversy is.
3272000	3274000	I can't see where the controversy is.
3274000	3276000	Nintendo is talking about tying an ID
3276000	3278000	across all hardware platforms,
3278000	3280000	which I guess they've kind of already been doing
3280000	3282000	as they've merged Nintendo Network into 3DS.
3282000	3284000	But now we're talking about future systems
3284000	3286000	and I think whatever they're going to plan
3286000	3289000	in the mobile space, which they've pretty much
3289000	3292000	come very clear and said it is not...
3292000	3294000	Like, we're not putting Mario on...
3294000	3297000	Like, we're not designing a Mario game for the iPhone.
3297000	3300000	But we're not opposed to new ideas.
3300000	3302000	So they are exploring some new ideas.
3302000	3305000	And some of those ideas have to do with fitness.
3305000	3307000	And that could be a place...
3307000	3310000	Non-wearable health monitoring tech
3310000	3312000	was something they were talking about,
3312000	3314000	which struck me as particularly interesting
3314000	3316000	because last week I talked about the whole...
3316000	3319000	And, you know, if you didn't listen to last week's show,
3319000	3321000	you really should because I feel like I made a good point
3321000	3323000	about how, you know, you talked about Fitbit,
3323000	3324000	I talked about Fitbit.
3324000	3326000	That should have been Nintendo.
3326000	3327000	Nintendo could have had that.
3327000	3329000	They could have hopped on that
3329000	3331000	and had Fitbit for themselves.
3331000	3332000	And I talked about that last week.
3332000	3334000	Well, plus, if they...
3334000	3337000	Because they have a monitor for the new Wii U Fit, right?
3337000	3338000	Yeah, right, yeah.
3338000	3341000	But it's crap compared to Fitbit and all those things.
3341000	3343000	If they invest a little bit of money to make it
3343000	3345000	a little bit more premium-feeling,
3345000	3347000	then, yeah, I see them.
3347000	3349000	So that's something they're going to.
3349000	3351000	Nintendo's also talking about flexible price points
3351000	3354000	on games for loyal consumers.
3354000	3357000	That that might be the trick is to make the games a lot cheaper.
3357000	3360000	So, I mean, cheaper is good news for us,
3360000	3362000	especially those that have been supporting.
3362000	3364000	Just a couple other tidbits here.
3364000	3368000	Legend of Zelda was listed on the Wii U's 2014 lineup
3368000	3369000	as To Be Determined.
3369000	3372000	That was some documents that came out of the investors meeting.
3372000	3373000	Okay, so what does that tell us?
3373000	3375000	They're working on a new Legend of Zelda game.
3375000	3377000	We already knew that.
3377000	3378000	Oh, shit.
3378000	3379000	No shit.
3379000	3381000	And that is not news, but it was on the list
3381000	3384000	and people have been reporting it as news, so there you go.
3384000	3385000	One of the other big pieces of news,
3385000	3388000	Iwata taking a big pay cut but not stepping down.
3388000	3392000	Iwata's going to take a 50% pay cut, which is pretty big.
3392000	3393000	He's still making bank.
3393000	3396000	He's still making bank, but not going to step down.
3396000	3400000	I'm certainly not one of those people that's thinking,
3400000	3401000	like, off with his head.
3401000	3403000	Yeah, I'm not either.
3403000	3406000	I don't think he needs to really take the fall,
3406000	3409000	but they all need to kind of, like,
3409000	3412000	this needs to be, like, the wake-up call.
3412000	3413000	I mean, it's a wake-up call,
3413000	3419000	but he's sitting on the success of the 3DS,
3419000	3421000	and he turned that system around.
3421000	3422000	You know what I mean?
3422000	3425000	So he's not all, like, bad,
3425000	3428000	and for people to call for his resignation,
3428000	3430000	I think, is just kind of silly.
3430000	3435000	Yeah, I think it's, no, I wouldn't agree with that either.
3435000	3437000	Possibly one of the most interesting things
3437000	3439000	to come out of all this, and I'll end on this,
3439000	3442000	Nintendo is considering mergers
3442000	3445000	and new game studio acquisitions,
3445000	3448000	which led to a lot of wank in comment sections
3448000	3450000	about Microsoft should buy Nintendo.
3450000	3451000	Yuck, yuck, yuck.
3451000	3452000	Don't think that's going to happen, kids,
3452000	3455000	because Nintendo still has a shitload of cash on hand,
3455000	3456000	so it's not like, you know,
3456000	3459000	it's not like going to the bargain bin at Walmart
3459000	3460000	and buying a new company.
3460000	3462000	You know, it's not really that easy,
3462000	3464000	but it could be interesting to see
3464000	3468000	if Nintendo makes a grab for somebody,
3468000	3471000	and my head can't help but go here.
3471000	3474000	I just had this weird feeling,
3474000	3476000	what if Nintendo buys Sega?
3476000	3481000	Like, that's the wank I'm coming up with in my head,
3481000	3483000	I mean, because it would make so much sense.
3483000	3485000	It would make absolutely a lot of sense.
3485000	3487000	It would make so much sense for Nintendo to buy Sega.
3487000	3490000	What if Nintendo bought Capcom or Konami?
3490000	3492000	I think that would be really cool.
3492000	3494000	A lot of people think it's platinum games
3494000	3496000	that they're eyeing, but...
3496000	3497000	Well, yeah, and again,
3497000	3498000	it's a company they kind of work with.
3498000	3501000	Yeah, like Wonderful 101 or whatever.
3501000	3502000	But it's going to be very interesting to see,
3502000	3505000	because, yeah, I bet Nintendo would snatch up a company
3505000	3507000	and get a whole lot of exclusives that way.
3507000	3509000	Sega's kind of a company that's already been
3509000	3510000	very supportive of the Wii U,
3510000	3514000	but, you know, obviously my 12-year-old self can't help
3514000	3516000	but go, God, it was weird enough
3516000	3518000	when Sega started putting Sonic games
3518000	3519000	on the Nintendo platform.
3519000	3521000	We can go back in time
3521000	3523000	and tell everybody that Nintendo won.
3523000	3524000	Right?
3524000	3526000	Seriously, you know, I would love, actually,
3526000	3530000	to see what Nintendo would do with Sega,
3530000	3534000	with any Segas, you know, like Sonic or whatever.
3534000	3536000	Yeah, it would just be so weird.
3536000	3538000	My mind would be blown.
3538000	3539000	Right?
3539000	3541000	So, SSJ100Matt says,
3541000	3543000	That's some 1990s wank.
3543000	3545000	I know, I can't help it.
3545000	3547000	It's the only one in my mind that I go,
3547000	3549000	wow, that would make a lot of sense for that to happen.
3549000	3553000	So, OrangeRight in chat says,
3553000	3556000	Konami won't happen because they'd have to cancel all their games.
3556000	3557000	That's a good point.
3557000	3560000	Konami's really developing a lot of stuff on other platforms.
3560000	3561000	Nintendo buys them.
3561000	3564000	It's not as easy as like, oh, put Castlevania on Wii U.
3564000	3566000	Are they really relevant anymore, anyway?
3566000	3567000	Ooh.
3567000	3568000	I mean, let's just be honest.
3568000	3569000	What do they do?
3569000	3571000	They make a Metal Gear every once in a while.
3571000	3572000	Castlevania.
3572000	3573000	And yeah, at Castlevania, that's kind of...
3573000	3574000	What does the chat think is really taking off?
3574000	3576000	I don't think it's really taking off.
3576000	3577000	I think they're trying to make it take off.
3577000	3580000	No, Silent Hill's really gonna get successful this time, Shane.
3580000	3582000	That's a lie.
3582000	3585000	Maybe they'll buy up some of their IPs.
3585000	3588000	Or, you know, I'm not talking about just Konami,
3588000	3590000	but other companies like Mega Man,
3590000	3595000	you know how everybody's really, really butthurt about Capcom
3595000	3596000	pushing them to the curb.
3596000	3597000	Capcom wouldn't let it go.
3597000	3598000	Yeah.
3598000	3600000	Oh yeah, I wouldn't see Capcom...
3600000	3602000	Nintendo would have to buy Capcom for that to happen.
3602000	3603000	But see...
3603000	3606000	But then the fighting game world would just poop itself.
3606000	3608000	Yeah, they would.
3608000	3610000	The fighting game world would literally shit itself
3610000	3612000	if Nintendo bought Capcom.
3612000	3614000	No kidding, that would be great.
3614000	3617000	I'd love to see that happen, honestly.
3617000	3619000	Have you tried playing a fighting game on the Wii?
3619000	3623000	No, because all you do is try to play the fighting game on a Wii.
3623000	3625000	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was...
3625000	3628000	I love it, but it's just not great.
3628000	3631000	You have to have the classic controller to play it.
3631000	3635000	And you know me, I'm probably one of the world's biggest
3635000	3636000	Tatsunoko fans.
3637000	3638000	No.
3638000	3641000	Even Gatchaman was not enough to make me love it.
3641000	3645000	Alright, so enough wank and all this stuff.
3645000	3647000	Obviously we're going crazy here.
3647000	3649000	Chatters, I ask you this.
3649000	3651000	People in the room, I ask you this.
3651000	3654000	Live.vog.network.com if you want to chat with us.
3654000	3658000	After what you heard come out of this Nintendo event,
3658000	3662000	do you think they're on the right path at this point?
3663000	3666000	It's hard to say, because Nintendo,
3666000	3669000	I feel like with every step forward they take,
3669000	3671000	it feels like they take a couple back.
3671000	3678000	And I just don't feel like it got to the point of excitement for me
3678000	3680000	in anything they came out with.
3680000	3684000	But I don't know, they've never been a company
3684000	3686000	that wants to be very aggressive.
3686000	3690000	They don't ever give me that impression.
3690000	3693000	So, I don't know. What do you say, Matt?
3695000	3698000	Well, I think for Nintendo,
3698000	3701000	I think they just want to make sure they take it slow
3701000	3706000	and they actually know they will make it big on their own IPs
3706000	3709000	and everyone loves their properties and their games.
3709000	3713000	So if they're spreading it out, they're spreading it out.
3713000	3719000	But I think we could take a look at Take-Two and GTA V
3719000	3724000	and all of a sudden one game can put you on top.
3727000	3730000	Unfortunately, I guess the game industry is kind of that way now.
3730000	3733000	There's a lot more blockbusters and hit or miss type of things.
3733000	3736000	But I don't think Nintendo has that much to worry about
3736000	3738000	because they have a lot of strong IP.
3738000	3741000	And they have a lot of cash on hand.
3741000	3743000	And we know they have patience.
3743000	3747000	And they do turn out the quality games.
3747000	3750000	And they make the next GTA V.
3750000	3753000	This is coming from a Microsoft fanboy.
3754000	3757000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,
3757000	3759000	Loki giving his opinion with the show tonight saying,
3759000	3761000	I could see them acquiring Atlus or Tecmo Koe,
3761000	3764000	a smaller third-party company maybe.
3764000	3767000	And, let's see, Bochikawa says,
3767000	3769000	I use the Classic Controller for everything. Nothing wrong with it.
3769000	3772000	Yeah, but that is, I mean, the problem with the Classic Controller,
3772000	3775000	it's optional. And when you have an optional piece of hardware,
3775000	3777000	games don't necessarily have to support it.
3777000	3782000	That is kind of why the Xbox One included the Kinect,
3782000	3785000	for better or worse, because they wanted designers to know
3785000	3787000	the Kinect will be on every Xbox One.
3787000	3791000	So you can design for it and not have to worry if somebody has it or not.
3791000	3793000	When you design a game for the Classic Controller,
3793000	3794000	not everybody's going to have it.
3794000	3797000	A lot of people who owned a Wii didn't have a Classic Controller.
3797000	3799000	So something to think about with that.
3799000	3802000	Tech 2030 says, if they're really thinking of buying companies
3802000	3805000	to get more first-party titles and IPs, then yes.
3805000	3807000	And I think that's in response to the Atlus and Tecmo Koe thing.
3807000	3813000	So, Dar Tetsuya says, if they announce even more than one bombshell title at E3,
3813000	3815000	they might be able to turn things around, I think.
3815000	3817000	You know, and I kind of agree with that answer.
3817000	3821000	That's where I'm going, is that E3, I mean, E3's always important,
3821000	3823000	and I feel like we say this every freaking year.
3823000	3827000	But this is, the stakes are like super fucking high for Nintendo this year.
3827000	3829000	Super, super high.
3830000	3835000	And the weird thing is, I still don't, I would see that they're not going to get on stage again.
3835000	3837000	I think we're going to have another year of Nintendo Direct.
3837000	3840000	Why should they get on stage? Why should they?
3840000	3842000	Honestly, I liked the Nintendo Direct thing.
3842000	3845000	Well, the only thing I hated about it was that Ustream was full of fail.
3845000	3848000	I liked the theory behind it, but it didn't work.
3848000	3852000	And that thing was crashing every five seconds, so they better fix that shit.
3852000	3856000	But otherwise, yes, in theory, I think there's nothing wrong with what they did with Nintendo Direct.
3856000	3858000	It's very interesting how they're changing the landscape that way.
3858000	3861000	But I would fully anticipate we have another E3 where they do that.
3861000	3864000	Gonna be very, very, very make or break this year.
3864000	3867000	All right, let's move on. We got a lot of other companies to talk about.
3867000	3868000	So, Dark Saga.
3868000	3871000	Speaking of other companies, we have some Sony news.
3871000	3875000	Well, more like a rumor, which, you know how I feel about rumors, but this could be a good one.
3875000	3887000	Basically, there was a source close to Sony was saying that there is going to be a backwards compatible PS1 and PS2 emulator.
3887000	3889000	For the PS4.
3889000	3900000	And they say that the theory is that, from what I can tell in here, it's supposed to be able to let you play the games you already have.
3900000	3909000	Which is actually sort of opposite of what Sony was saying about having the PS1 and PS2 games available through PlayStation Now.
3909000	3915000	So, it would be interesting if they did that, but I don't see it.
3916000	3921000	Well, I mean, there's PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 emulators on PC.
3921000	3924000	And isn't the PlayStation 4 just kind of like a PC in a box?
3924000	3927000	I mean, we're getting closer and closer to that.
3927000	3930000	So, I like that idea as opposed to streaming.
3930000	3933000	I mean, as cool as a lot of the stuff they were talking about was streaming sounds.
3933000	3938000	Like, I really worry about the lag and the bandwidth and all that that goes with it.
3938000	3941000	So, I really like this as an approach. I hope they can do it.
3941000	3951000	The thing I like about it is that it actually would add more value to the system itself so that people who already have their older games would be willing to upgrade to the next level of hardware.
3951000	3957000	I would be so flippin' happy if they implement this and they do the right thing, which would be...
3957000	3959000	Remove region locking?
3959000	3970000	That and, well, if I could play the games I already bought on PlayStation 3 for PS1, if I could play those on PS4 as well because they're already in my catalog.
3970000	3973000	That would be the right thing to do and I really hope that's what they do.
3973000	3974000	I hope so, too.
3974000	3977000	Which, by the way, would include... Those were region-free because they release Japanese games all the time.
3977000	3981000	The Japanese Mega Man releases were out and I bought one of those and, like, Castlevania Chronicles.
3981000	3986000	I bought a... Sweet Coding 2. There's a series that Shane didn't get to fanboy over yet.
3986000	3989000	I bought... No, Sweet Coding 1, not 2. Sorry.
3989000	3990000	Yeah, 2 will never be on there.
3990000	3993000	Why won't they release 2? Jerks.
3993000	3996000	I don't know. Maybe.
3996000	3999000	Or maybe they would have this as something that you can subscribe to.
3999000	4006000	You know, beyond their whole PlayStation Now thing, they have an emulator subscription service.
4006000	4009000	Or maybe it has to be licensed per game.
4009000	4015000	Tech2030 in chat says, I think because of PlayStation Now, I'm gonna say backwards compatibility won't happen.
4015000	4018000	It would almost be hindering their sales potential with PlayStation Now.
4018000	4020000	Why can't they be together?
4020000	4024000	Is it giving people an opportunity to get games that they don't have access to anymore?
4024000	4027000	Why can't PlayStation Now be both emulator and streaming?
4027000	4028000	It could easily be.
4028000	4029000	Yeah.
4029000	4033000	And, again, it's the whole concept of added value to make the hardware more attractive.
4033000	4036000	Absolutely. So we'll see what develops with that.
4036000	4040000	I'm hoping that it does turn out to be true.
4040000	4045000	And, again, I'd love to see the library of PlayStation 1 stuff I already bought open up on PlayStation 4.
4045000	4046000	That would be fantastic.
4046000	4049000	Alright. Well, let's move on to some Microsoft news.
4049000	4052000	So, Matt, if you're a Microsoft fanboy, pay attention. Although I'm sure...
4052000	4055000	I was just being kind of facetious when I said that.
4055000	4060000	But, honestly, he had an Xbox only when I moved in with him.
4060000	4064000	Oh, did you force him to go buy console?
4064000	4067000	No, no. I didn't force him to buy anything.
4067000	4071000	I forced him to get the newest console for free, though.
4071000	4077000	Alright. Moving on to some big news out of Microsoft.
4077000	4079000	Microsoft, I'm sure many of you heard this week,
4079000	4084000	Microsoft Studios purchased the rights to the Gears of War franchise from Epic Games.
4084000	4088000	They will be taking over the existing games that are already out there,
4088000	4091000	as well as development of future games.
4091000	4095000	Development of future games will be handed over to Black Tusk Studios,
4095000	4097000	which at one time was Microsoft Vancouver.
4097000	4101000	But Black Tusk will now be working on future Gears of War games.
4101000	4105000	So, hmm. We'll see.
4105000	4110000	Rod Ferguson, who is the director of production at Epic Games and on the Gears of War franchise,
4110000	4114000	is now going to be going over to Microsoft and will play a key studio leadership role.
4114000	4117000	We don't know what that is all about.
4117000	4120000	2K did put out a statement that says,
4120000	4123000	We can confirm that Rod Ferguson is no longer with 2K.
4123000	4127000	Any projects the new studio is working on are unaffected by his departure.
4127000	4130000	We wish him the best of luck in future endeavors. Blah de blah de blah. All that stuff.
4130000	4134000	So, not a lot of surprise here, honestly.
4134000	4137000	I mean, of course, Gears of War has been a great franchise for Microsoft.
4137000	4139000	Of course they want to keep it going.
4139000	4143000	It's interesting that it's going to end up getting the Halo treatment of sorts.
4143000	4146000	Now that Epic Games isn't doing them anymore, they'll go to a new developer.
4146000	4150000	But you know what? Halo 4 was way better than Halo 3, in my opinion.
4150000	4152000	Or any of the Halos that came out after 2. It wasn't as good as Halo 2.
4152000	4154000	I've never played a Halo.
4154000	4159000	Really? Halo 2 is really the best out of all those if you're going to play one.
4159000	4163000	Well, speaking of all that, in other Microsoft news,
4163000	4165000	take this with a huge grain of salt,
4165000	4171000	I would really be not talking about what everybody's talking about
4171000	4175000	if I didn't talk about this story, which is the Xbox leaks.
4175000	4181000	Apparently there's been some Xbox One rumors or leaks that are posted out there on NeoGaf.
4181000	4185000	And, you know, we take a lot of those posts with a grain of salt,
4185000	4191000	but the problem is this guy, N-T-K-R-N-L, not Colonel or whatever his name is,
4191000	4197000	this guy apparently he's been a source before,
4197000	4200000	and people have verified yes he is with Microsoft or what have you.
4200000	4204000	Here's a summary of what he said was going to be coming from Xbox One this year.
4204000	4210000	Halo 2 anniversary on Xbox One. November 11th even gave a date.
4210000	4214000	Halo 2 anniversary. Crackdown 3 coming in 2016.
4214000	4218000	Halo 5 possibly delayed. Not going to come out as soon as we thought.
4218000	4223000	Forza Horizon 2 for the Xbox One in September at 1080p.
4223000	4230000	And a white Xbox One that's diskless, meaning there will be no disk drive.
4230000	4233000	And perhaps that's how they're going to cut down the cost a little bit.
4233000	4235000	They're not going to cut out the Kinect, they're going to cut out the disk drive,
4235000	4238000	which is a very interesting way of, you know,
4238000	4241000	when we talked about all that digital distribution
4241000	4244000	and some of the stuff that Microsoft was considering at one point,
4244000	4247000	it's very interesting that they might end up going down that road
4247000	4249000	where it would be all digital after all.
4249000	4254000	Just if you get that, make sure you have no bandwidth caps.
4254000	4261000	Right? So, let me do some quick comments from our chatroom
4261000	4263000	on the Gears of War thing that I just talked about,
4263000	4266000	and then we'll talk about these rumors a little more over at live.vognetwork.com.
4266000	4269000	Tech 2030 says they really need to sit on Gears for a while,
4269000	4274000	give people a break, and come back with an awesome sequel or maybe even a reboot.
4275000	4278000	SSG100Matt says, to be fair, as a long time Gears of War fan,
4278000	4281000	the series has been hoarded out a little too much.
4281000	4286000	Dungeonbuster says 343 Industries didn't do a half bad job with a new Halo,
4286000	4290000	but Blast Tusk really needs to shake up the Gears formula.
4290000	4293000	Back to these rumors, here's the thing.
4295000	4298000	I don't, I mean, rumors are rumors, whatever.
4298000	4300000	We'll find out what's true or not at E3,
4300000	4305000	but here's my thing, is that pretty much everything this guy revealed,
4305000	4309000	these are like the safest fucking bets you could make with Microsoft, right?
4309000	4314000	This is like the whole, Nintendo is working on a new Zelda game that'll come out in a year.
4314000	4320000	Well, no shit. And if it doesn't come out in a year, oh, it got delayed, it wasn't ready, and you still look right.
4320000	4324000	Am I right? Like, if Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,
4324000	4327000	we're working on a new Zelda game, and I see people going,
4327000	4334000	I called it, I'm gonna be like, did you also call that the Pope was Catholic and that bears shit in woods, because no shit.
4334000	4341000	And so when I hear news like, you know, Forza Horizon 2 coming to the Xbox One, no shit.
4341000	4347000	Forza Horizon was great. That was a great game. It sold well. It's gonna get a sequel.
4347000	4351000	I will buy an Xbox One for Forza Horizon 2. No shit that's happening.
4351000	4356000	Crackdown 3, okay, maybe a little more risky, whatever.
4356000	4360000	Halo 2 Anniversary. Again, I think that's a safe bet.
4360000	4366000	Especially if it's true that Halo 5 is getting pushed back a little bit, you want a Halo to bridge the gap in there a little bit.
4366000	4367000	Halo 2 Anniversary?
4367000	4370000	It's like what they did with Wind Waker HD on Nintendo.
4370000	4376000	Which, by the way, when they announced Wind Waker, they already said they were working on another Zelda.
4376000	4378000	So I don't understand how this is like...
4378000	4382000	I'm just, I'm comparing. But here's the thing.
4382000	4389000	Only one of these where I go, okay, well now that's a little bit ballsy is the white Xbox One that happens to be diskless.
4389000	4394000	Now, again, it's not... I mean, we knew that Microsoft was thinking about going down this path at some point anyway.
4394000	4397000	It's not like that's new information, right?
4397000	4403000	But for them to actually do it would really be something to see.
4403000	4406000	Matt thinks they should do it.
4406000	4408000	They should be digital only, right?
4409000	4412000	Don't put words in my mouth.
4412000	4415000	Come on, don't be shy.
4415000	4420000	Well, I mean, just X for an I. We like everything being digital, so it's easier.
4420000	4423000	I don't go to the store. Just order something.
4423000	4427000	Let me ask this question. People are very hostile about that.
4427000	4434000	What would you tell people that are very hostile and don't want to see people that are really attached to their disk-based games?
4434000	4436000	What would you say to them? What are they missing?
4436000	4441000	I don't think they're missing anything. I mean, everyone's allowed to kind of prefer to play games how they like to,
4441000	4445000	but, I mean, at the same time, you should be open up to how other people like to play.
4445000	4450000	And so we like to play without having to put a disk in. That's annoying.
4450000	4458000	I'm a graphic designer who is in love with print media, so I miss disks, and I miss manuals,
4458000	4462000	and I miss everything that gives you something to hold and to possess,
4462000	4467000	because some people are just attached to things, and some people like to have something tactile,
4467000	4471000	and I think that that shouldn't be abandoned,
4471000	4475000	especially since you're going to be putting a whole bunch of designers out of business in print shops.
4475000	4482000	Sadly, I hate to say it, but too late. I mean, already, I don't see games really coming with manuals anymore.
4482000	4487000	In fact, Tomb Raider I just bought this week doesn't have a manual. It says, for the online manual, go to this website.
4487000	4489000	That's sad.
4489000	4493000	Granted, somebody still has to design the online manual, so there's that.
4493000	4503000	Yeah, PDFs aren't hard, but, for example, Dan and I have this box. We have an Atari 5200 Frogger box.
4503000	4512000	You know what it's full of? Manuals that we go back and look at, especially when we are playing said games that we have those manuals for.
4513000	4525000	One of my favorite things as a gamer from the old Nintendo days was to, when I got a new game,
4525000	4530000	was to pop open that manual and look through it like it was a new book, you know what I mean?
4530000	4540000	I don't think that actually is ever going to be replicated by an online manual or a manual that you can access through the video game itself.
4540000	4550000	I just feel like there's a certain joy as a little kid that I had looking through the Legend of Zelda manual.
4550000	4552000	And reading the story of the game because it might tell you.
4552000	4555000	Exactly. And my mom would always joke, she would always be like,
4555000	4563000	I don't know how he masters these games, but he opens them up and he reads that manual from cover to cover and then he beats the game!
4564000	4570000	And I felt like, I was no childhood prodigy, but my mom sure made me feel like I was.
4570000	4574000	She would brag to her friends about that and I was just like, I love the manuals.
4574000	4576000	That's how I knew the evil mushrooms were called goombas.
4576000	4580000	Sometimes there would be hints in those manuals and everything.
4580000	4584000	I've heard in Japan that they still really treasure the instruction manual.
4584000	4591000	Oh yeah. Now that's one thing I've seen, especially because there's a big thing for collector's editions that come with a bunch of stuff.
4591000	4598000	It's the manuals and art books coming with things are really, that's half the reason why my husband and I have imported stuff.
4598000	4605000	Yeah. So I wonder why there's this big cultural difference between Japan and I guess the Western world.
4605000	4612000	I remember when I was younger, I would get the manuals and I would color them because they were always a black and white and I had markers.
4612000	4624000	Well, I'm trying to think of an example of something. Okay, here, now it's a Dreamcast game, but it came with, it was a Cardcaptor Sakura game.
4624000	4630000	That came with, and the game was kind of crap, but it was cute because it was Cardcaptor Sakura, but it came with a pillowcase.
4630000	4635000	It came with a clock, a fork and a spoon. You remember this?
4635000	4637000	What's this? Sorry, I left the room for a minute.
4637000	4638000	My Cardcaptor Sakura game.
4638000	4639000	Oh God, that was so hilarious.
4639000	4644000	And they did a Sakura Taisen game that came with all that same stuff too.
4644000	4653000	But it's like, we see, you know, Collectors editions that come with postcards and things and companies just passing out postcards.
4653000	4663000	You know, I've got a whole bunch of postcards thanks to Ikuma JP who sent me some Phoenix Wright ones and some other Capcom game ones.
4663000	4673000	It's just a whole lot more of a Collectors audience to have just things that go with your game that enrich the game itself without actually being in the game.
4673000	4681000	Well, I do feel there is kind of, there is a boom in the US with different varying Collectors editions. You see like every game now has a Collectors edition.
4681000	4684000	I'm going to our chat room for some feedback.
4684000	4692000	Live.vognetwork.com. Segg says, my hope with the move to going full digital on consoles will put pressure into network neutrality and a better investment in broadband.
4692000	4699000	And Segg continues that saying, because you tell me with a straight face that Microsoft would like to pay for better access to every ISP in the US.
4699000	4709000	And Drew in the chat says, I just like manuals, but oh well, I honestly don't have time for them now. I do all the reading I used to now before the game comes out.
4709000	4712000	We didn't have the internet when manuals were big. That's a good point.
4712000	4718000	I mean, Extifer would read the manual cover to cover when he bought the game, but now you have the internet.
4718000	4720000	You already know everything about the game before you buy it.
4720000	4730000	Yeah, but you know what's funny is that I still like, when I opened, for instance, when I opened the new console, and I used to do this when I was a little kid too.
4730000	4740000	When I opened the PS4, I love looking at all the little inserts. I like looking at all the little advertisements. I like looking through all of that stuff.
4740000	4743000	I seriously, it's like bathroom reading.
4744000	4752000	Here's what I ran to get in the back room for a minute here is that I was going to say all hope is not lost, because here's Retro Magazine.
4752000	4753000	Watch your gamers better.
4753000	4759000	Well, how mean, because Retro Video Game Magazine, this is where we had the guy on the show not that long ago.
4759000	4760000	I know, I know, I'm kidding.
4760000	4761000	All right, yeah, sure.
4761000	4764000	Actually, Dan and I picked up the issue.
4764000	4765000	Did you?
4765000	4767000	At Fry's.
4767000	4768000	Nice.
4768000	4769000	Yeah.
4769000	4777000	This magazine came out, and I was going to say, people are going to Kickstarter now. There's a lot of people that are really upset about, you know, I wish I had the magazine and so forth.
4777000	4780000	And maybe they want things that they can read in the bathroom or what have you.
4780000	4785000	But yeah, they got this whole little magazine, and this is what was really cool is that if you go to the very back page, look at that, supporters.
4785000	4788000	Look at the number one right there. Yeah, orangelunchreader.com.
4788000	4789000	Yep.
4789000	4791000	After you went and said something nasty.
4791000	4792000	You know what?
4792000	4793000	You said nasty mouth.
4793000	4795000	You know what? I didn't mean it.
4796000	4797000	That's pretty awesome.
4797000	4800000	No, like I said, we actually picked it up because we saw it at Fry's.
4800000	4801000	Nice.
4801000	4803000	And I remembered it. But yeah, it was very good.
4803000	4809000	I was going to say, all hope's not lost. Like, there's still communities that are like, you know, hey, we missed this, so let's make it.
4809000	4813000	Yeah, I miss the old days where I'd pick up the new EGM or GamePro or whatever.
4813000	4814000	They got what, Nintendo?
4814000	4822000	You'd flip through that thing, like, over and over and over again, and even when you thought you read the whole thing from cover to cover, you'd still look through it, you know?
4822000	4833000	Why do you think I kept issues of EGM, like, for years? We actually ended up having to throw them away because they were just decaying.
4833000	4842000	I think I was reading up on Twitter or the internet somewhere that Nintendo Force is another magazine that's kind of run off Kickstarter and stuff, and they're gearing up for their second year.
4842000	4848000	So, kind of, it's not dying. There's going to be an audience for it that appreciates it, so there you go.
4848000	4862000	It's becoming more of a specialty market, and I really wish that it was more the norm then. Well, it's like, I was even having a conversation with Becky, my best friend, a while back, about how whenever she gets DVDs, she just throws the cases away and puts them in a binder.
4862000	4873000	And I'm like, but you realize that someone put work into this design and that, you know, it's as much a part of the experience as having the disk, right?
4873000	4883000	And she's like, oh, I didn't think about it that way. But, I mean, I don't know. Some don't. Some don't. It's sad.
4883000	4891000	All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you have another story for us? I do, and it's about how pissed off I am that print media is dying, and I'm kidding.
4891000	4900000	This is about the Ouya. Well, it's getting makeover. It was kind of crap before, and it's still kind of crap, but we still like it.
4901000	4916000	What? It's just the way you phrased, that's really funny. I'm sorry. No, well, okay, a lot of people will say it's kind of crap, and then there's people like our Brad from Pod Culture, who likes his Ouya and plays retro games on it.
4916000	4936000	But the Ouya is going to have better Wi-Fi connectivity, or as they say in Quebec, Wi-Fi. It will have more storage. It's going to be going to a 16GB flash storage, and I wonder if anyone will need it.
4936000	4948000	Better controller, better analog, it's supposed to be better everything, and it's all black and sleek, and I still am not buying one.
4948000	4956000	I was just saying, you just pre-ordered one today, didn't you? Just kidding. No, because you can't pre-order, you can only order, and it will be delivered when it's ready.
4957000	4964000	You're so mean. I am not. I have a personal grudge against unnecessary prefixes.
4964000	4978000	Alright, so I have to admit, I'm also still not really big on the whole Ouya thing. I think it's a pile of shit. Sorry, I'm sorry to crap on your parade.
4979000	4988000	I don't think I'd go that far, but... It has untapped potential, meaning its potential is really hard to tap, I guess?
4988000	4998000	It's a fucking Android phone on your TV. I just feel like it's having a hard time finding its audience. What am I really getting out of that thing I can't get on my PC?
4998000	5005000	Absolutely nothing. You're getting one exclusive, that Soulfjord? That's it?
5005000	5014000	To be fair, other people might say, well then why do you get a PlayStation 4, Rob? Because all those games are on your PC, but I'll tell you what, they run a lot better on the PlayStation 4 than they do on my PC.
5014000	5020000	They're dedicated gaming consoles with all that power, whereas an Ouya is not really about the power.
5020000	5022000	Plus there's going to be exclusives on this.
5022000	5029000	If you look at this, I'm sorry. Buying a PS4 is basically cheaper than buying a graphics card.
5029000	5039000	Ooh, interesting thought here from Sega in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. If the Ouya would drop its requirement for having a demo or free version for every title, they would have a lot more buy-in.
5039000	5047000	Brad from PodCulture says, it is a neat bit of kit to tinker with, but it sure as hell isn't mainstream.
5047000	5053000	Well, let's talk about what is coming to the mainstream as we go over release dates and the types of things that are coming out around the world this week.
5053000	5056000	I'm going to start with the US release dates. We have a few things coming out.
5056000	5065000	Earth Defense Force 2025. If Loki does come back next week, I think we're going to hear a lot about this, because this game is out on February 4th on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
5065000	5072000	Fable Anniversary also out this week on the Xbox 360. I think that's just the one, two, three games all out together.
5073000	5082000	The Lego Movie Video Game is out on pretty much all consoles. Windows 360, PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Lego Movie Video Game.
5082000	5087000	And, let's see, Outlast making its way to the PlayStation 4 this week as well.
5087000	5091000	And the Windows version of Double Dragon Neon makes its way to Steam this week as well.
5091000	5097000	And then lastly, I think this is another, this is a Friday release. Did Nintendo move their things to Friday?
5098000	5103000	Bravely Default comes out on February 7th. And I know a lot of people are excited about that.
5103000	5106000	I still need to play the stinkin' demo, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about that.
5106000	5108000	Did you get your four swords, by the way?
5108000	5110000	I already had four swords.
5110000	5112000	This is special.
5112000	5114000	It's the same one they gave away at E3 a while ago.
5114000	5119000	Yeah, when the 3DS was first, first out, they gave it away before, and I got it then.
5119000	5121000	Well, I didn't have one then.
5121000	5125000	Oh yeah, for all the new 3DS owners, it's great. But yeah, I had it from before.
5127000	5129000	Was it part of the ambassador thing?
5129000	5131000	Why don't you buy it again, Rob?
5131000	5133000	It's free, Rob. Get it again.
5133000	5135000	Why is everybody picking on me?
5135000	5137000	Because you're here.
5137000	5139000	I already own the fucking game. Leave me alone.
5139000	5141000	Alright.
5141000	5143000	Moving on.
5143000	5145000	Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says,
5145000	5149000	No, it's a remastered version of the game a la Halo. Looks good too.
5149000	5151000	Shoot, I don't know which game he's talking about, but alright.
5151000	5153000	Oh, he's talking about Fable? Oh.
5153000	5155000	Well, that's pretty cool then.
5155000	5157000	A Fable 2 was good.
5157000	5159000	This is not Fable 3.
5167000	5169000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
5169000	5171000	On the PlayStation 4 this week.
5171000	5175000	Gotcha, it's not out in Japan until the 22nd of February.
5175000	5177000	Just seeing if you were paying attention.
5177000	5181000	Going over to the consoles that are out in Japan on the PlayStation 3.
5181000	5185000	Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge goes into the Best Hits collection.
5185000	5189000	I'm sure Dark Sakura will be excited to play Puyo Puyo Tetris.
5189000	5191000	Puyo Puyo.
5191000	5193000	I guess they just combined the two.
5193000	5197000	It's both. It literally is both at the same time.
5197000	5199000	Holy shit.
5199000	5201000	Are you really excited?
5201000	5203000	Why the crap do I not have this?
5203000	5205000	PlayStation 3 is region free. You can do it.
5205000	5207000	Hey, I have brand new news.
5207000	5209000	What?
5209000	5215000	Did you know what it's called when a brony masturbates to ponies?
5215000	5217000	I just want to tell you, we have bronies that listen to this show.
5217000	5219000	I don't care. Don't be offensive. Alright, what?
5219000	5221000	It's called clopping.
5221000	5223000	Where's that from?
5223000	5231000	It's true. And so somewhere in the United States, somewhere, somebody is clopping right now.
5231000	5233000	I'm clopping listening to you talk.
5233000	5235000	So nasty.
5235000	5237000	Moving on.
5237000	5239000	Bronies are disgusting.
5239000	5241000	No they're not.
5241000	5243000	You probably like things that are stupid too.
5243000	5245000	Actually, if I may.
5245000	5247000	You like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
5247000	5249000	I like Buffy.
5249000	5251000	That is amazing.
5251000	5253000	I don't understand you right now.
5253000	5261000	I do need to actually set aside and make a statement because there's a little boy who is 11 years old who is a brony and got picked on and tried to hang himself and he's in critical condition.
5262000	5268000	So I just like to say, don't mock anybody's fandoms because they may be very seriously affected by it.
5268000	5270000	Are you listening to her?
5270000	5274000	I'm listening to her. I'm not trying to get people not to commit suicide.
5274000	5277000	I'm not trying to people.
5277000	5281000	I'm sorry, that came out completely.
5281000	5283000	That completely.
5283000	5290000	I did not intend that to be interpreted the way that it did because I didn't mean to say it like that.
5290000	5294000	I'm talking about all the other guys that are the creeps.
5294000	5299000	You know, if you're creepy about it, just keep your creepy in your closet.
5299000	5306000	And the thing that's cracking me up most of all is that Rama, who I know is a brony, is in our chat room saying, really Shane? Really?
5306000	5310000	That was extra for talking.
5310000	5314000	No, but I said something. I said that terrible because I'm not going to lie, they're terrible.
5314000	5316000	You guys are too mean.
5316000	5323000	But if you like something, shout it from the mountains and don't let anybody hate on you.
5323000	5327000	And also follow your dreams and don't kill yourself.
5327000	5334000	And I think the point here is rainbows and gummy bears.
5334000	5336000	I'm allergic to gummy bears.
5336000	5339000	Well, non-allergic.
5339000	5342000	They make you shit.
5342000	5344000	They make you shit rainbows.
5344000	5346000	No, they just make you shit for hours.
5346000	5348000	Didn't you see the Amazon review?
5348000	5352000	Where was I? Talking about Japanese release dates.
5352000	5354000	Which somehow led to clopping.
5354000	5356000	And poop.
5356000	5360000	Fable Anniversary Limited Edition comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.
5360000	5364000	Going over to the Playstation Vita in Japan this week.
5364000	5366000	Puyo Puyo Tetris.
5366000	5370000	Terraria comes out on the Vita this week. I didn't even know that was a Vita release.
5370000	5372000	And Super Heroine Chronicle.
5372000	5376000	That means a female hero, not a drug warlord type game.
5376000	5378000	Especially since that guy just died.
5378000	5380000	Yeah, it would be in poor taste, wouldn't it?
5380000	5382000	It would be in poor taste.
5382000	5384000	On the Wii U, hey guess what's out on the Wii U?
5384000	5387000	Puyo Puyo Tetris. This game is getting around.
5387000	5389000	I love Puyo Puyo.
5389000	5392000	And Monster Hunter Frontier G Memorial Package.
5392000	5396000	They need to have a re-release of Monster Hunter every week in Japan.
5396000	5400000	Well, that's just because they want to set up permanent residents outside of the Capcom headquarters.
5400000	5404000	Lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS.
5404000	5406000	This is important because this is a big title for some people.
5406000	5410000	Dragon Quest Monsters 2 is out this week in Japan.
5410000	5412000	I know some people like that little spin-off series.
5412000	5415000	There's a lot of slime accessories to go with that.
5415000	5417000	The iconic Dragon Quest character.
5417000	5420000	You know, we had a slime that used to wear Dan's wedding ring as its crown.
5420000	5421000	That's awesome.
5421000	5422000	And then Midna found it.
5422000	5424000	I was like, can I play with this?
5425000	5428000	And lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
5428000	5429000	Dar Sakura.
5429000	5430000	Clopping.
5430000	5432000	Puyo Puyo Tetris!
5433000	5435000	Alright, let's go to the UK.
5435000	5436000	Kind of off topic.
5436000	5437000	Kind of.
5437000	5441000	From Valentine's Day, Dan and I are going to bust out our Dreamcasts.
5441000	5443000	So I can play Puyo Puyo Da.
5443000	5445000	And Blue Stinger.
5445000	5448000	With a really motion sick camera.
5448000	5450000	Just saying that that's our idea of romantic.
5450000	5453000	Okay, so in February in the UK, we have a few things.
5453000	5457000	On the 4th, we have The Sun at Night on PC.
5457000	5460000	We have on the 5th, Outlast for PS4.
5460000	5464000	And on the 7th, we have Fable Trilogy on the Xbox 360.
5464000	5467000	And Jazzpunk for Mac and PC.
5467000	5468000	Jazzpunk.
5468000	5470000	That sounds interesting.
5470000	5472000	What is jazzpunk?
5472000	5474000	It's jazz and punk.
5474000	5478000	Oh, it's like an indie game sort of thing with...
5478000	5480000	It has a neat art style to it.
5480000	5481000	That's kind of cool.
5481000	5483000	Okay, I'll have to get that.
5484000	5485000	Alright.
5485000	5487000	By Necrophone Games.
5487000	5489000	Necrophilia Games? What?
5489000	5490000	Necrophone.
5490000	5491000	Oh, okay.
5491000	5493000	Sounds like a company Extrovert might work for.
5493000	5496000	And it looks like they had a big thing at PAX Prime.
5496000	5498000	So, that's cool.
5498000	5503000	Alright, moving on to one more story before we get to our classic game of the week.
5503000	5505000	And this talks about a newer game.
5505000	5508000	And it's an MMO that some people are very excited about.
5508000	5510000	We talked a lot about this game a couple weeks ago on Hoard House.
5510000	5512000	And it made me excited for it.
5512000	5515000	EverQuest Next is going to be released on the PlayStation 4.
5515000	5516000	It was confirmed.
5516000	5518000	It's coming to PlayStation 4.
5518000	5523000	This came from an AMA over on Reddit, which is how we break news now.
5523000	5527000	But John Smedley, who's the CEO of SOE,
5527000	5530000	was really talking about the closures of those games there.
5530000	5532000	But he also took some questions on other titles.
5532000	5535000	And one of the things he talked about, EverQuest Next.
5535000	5538000	And it will be available on the PlayStation 4.
5538000	5541000	He almost confirmed this last November.
5541000	5543000	But kind of stopped short of actually confirming it.
5543000	5546000	But now it went out on Twitter.
5546000	5547000	It went out on the official Twitter.
5547000	5549000	And that's how we break news now.
5549000	5550000	AMAs and Twitters.
5550000	5551000	Gotcha.
5551000	5552000	So, there you go.
5552000	5555000	Is it going to be cross-platform between PC and...
5555000	5557000	I don't think they've said that yet.
5557000	5561000	I would sure hope so, considering it's an SOE, Sony online entertainment game.
5561000	5562000	No kidding.
5562000	5563000	No kidding.
5563000	5564000	Anything is possible.
5564000	5565000	Yeah, that's really interesting.
5565000	5568000	I mean, you're looking at the PlayStation 4, it's getting a lot of MMOs now.
5568000	5572000	Between Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls Online, and now EverQuest Next.
5572000	5573000	And I mean, these are not...
5573000	5576000	They also have Warframe, which is, I mean, kind of MMO-lite.
5576000	5577000	Yeah, some of those free-to-play games.
5577000	5578000	It's very interesting.
5578000	5579000	And we're not, like...
5579000	5582000	In the PlayStation 3 days, we had some cool MMOs.
5582000	5583000	But there was a lot of shit, too.
5583000	5584000	Like, Free Realms.
5584000	5586000	Sorry, that's one of the ones that's closing.
5586000	5588000	So, it's kind of neat to see that, like...
5588000	5591000	Oh, and PlayStation 4's got DC Universe, which is pretty cool, too.
5591000	5592000	Like, it's very different.
5592000	5596000	So, it's kind of neat that, you know, we're seeing, like, a lot of MMOs.
5596000	5599000	EverQuest Next is free-to-play, isn't it?
5599000	5600000	Oh, I have no idea.
5600000	5602000	I have been really following it.
5602000	5604000	All the other EverQuest games are.
5604000	5607000	I know there was Landmark and there was Next, so...
5607000	5609000	Hey, I'm all for more free games.
5609000	5610000	How about it?
5610000	5611000	All right.
5611000	5613000	Well, let's move on to...
5613000	5617000	We're gonna take a trip back down memory lane to a time when games definitely weren't free.
5618000	5620000	They cost you at least a quarter.
5620000	5621000	Or, who are we kidding?
5621000	5623000	Two tokens, 50 cents per credit.
5623000	5628000	We're gonna walk down the aisle of memory lane where Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault
5628000	5629000	and finds a game that she thinks,
5629000	5633000	Hey, you, brat, play this game.
5633000	5635000	Or I'm gonna, you know what?
5635000	5637000	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5637000	5638000	All right.
5638000	5640000	Get inside from the outside.
5640000	5644000	Or, play this game where I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.
5644000	5645000	Ew.
5645000	5646000	Ew.
5646000	5651000	Let's take off this game where I'm just gonna pull your head off with your spine attached
5651000	5653000	to it and set the rest of you on ice.
5653000	5655000	There's gonna be a babality, right, Dark Sakura?
5655000	5657000	And then I'm gonna take a shit in your mouth.
5657000	5658000	What?
5658000	5659000	You're obsessed with shitting.
5659000	5660000	I don't know.
5660000	5661000	I'm not obsessed with shit.
5661000	5662000	I take my fiber.
5662000	5665000	Let's get to the classic game of the week.
5665000	5668000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week already?
5668000	5669000	Are you watching porn?
5669000	5670000	No, it's got an ad here.
5670000	5671000	Okay.
5671000	5672000	Is it pony porn?
5672000	5673000	What is the classic game of the week?
5673000	5675000	Are you copping?
5675000	5678000	It's Mortal Kombat.
5678000	5684000	Sorry, X versus Mortal Klop bat.
5684000	5695000	So, Mortal Kombat was put out by Midway and later on Acclaim for the home consoles.
5695000	5703000	And, it was done by Ed Boon and John Tobias and this has spawned quite a lot of wank over
5703000	5708000	the years and crossovers and all kinds of things.
5708000	5716000	And is now the franchise owned by Warner Brothers since 2009 after Midway went bankrupt.
5716000	5722000	So basically it is, it was supposed to be an original game that was starring Jean-Claude
5722000	5725500	Van Damme, but it fell through.
5725500	5727600	And like I said, it has all kinds of shit around it.
5727600	5732320	Even a TV show, I tried to watch some of the TV show and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't
5732320	5734320	Tara bad, but it was terrible.
5734320	5741520	So, it's bloody violent, has fatalities where you just kill them at the end of the round
5741520	5752280	and this was the game of my high school experience, actually Mortal Kombat 2 was more of the game
5752280	5757120	of my experience, but you can't talk about Mortal Kombat 2 without going to its roots.
5757120	5774800	So anyway, all of the games, well up through the third game they were digitized actors
5774800	5779160	and sometimes it would just be palette swaps depending on the different characters, like
5779160	5785360	for example Scorpion and Sub-Zero, same dude, different colors.
5785360	5792320	And I remember back in EGM actually having interviews with some of the actors and showing
5792320	5796640	them the costume and behind the scenes filming, so it was really neat.
5796640	5808620	So yeah, the first three were 2D style with digitized actors and you had a high punch,
5808620	5810720	low punch, high kick, low kick and block.
5810720	5813960	Mortal Kombat 3 added a run button.
5813960	5820400	So basically it was just kick everybody's ass, try to make it to the end of the game
5820400	5825880	and if you have your timing perfectly and know where to do it, where to stand to do
5825880	5834160	your moves, you get a fatality where you can rip someone's neck out or all kinds of things,
5834160	5839400	set them on fire if you're Scorpion, blow the kiss of death if you're Sonya.
5839400	5844800	And it had, starting with, I think it was really with Mortal Kombat 2, it started having
5844800	5854520	more of the people would start going into like the game menus and start reading things
5854520	5860760	and that's where they got the noobs I bought from and a bunch of different rumors and then
5860760	5866200	a little easter eggs hidden in the game and it really just sort of, it seemed that basically
5866200	5872240	if someone made up a theory about game A, then by the time game B came out, the theory
5872240	5874760	would actually be in the new game.
5874760	5878480	So it seemed like a lot of feedback was actually listened to, the fan community was really
5878480	5881560	paid attention to.
5881560	5885560	Yes you can drop an arcade machine on somebody, I think that was Mortal Kombat 2.
5885560	5890520	Or you could, see Mortal Kombat 2 just really started putting in, Mortal Kombat 3 started
5890520	5898120	putting in the funny stuff like the, the, what was it, the fableties and the animalities.
5898120	5900120	Those were in 2 I think.
5900120	5907920	No, 2 had the fableties and the friendships, friendships were great, friendships were great.
5907920	5916780	Which honestly, it's just that this was really kind of a shift in fighting games at the time
5916780	5922340	because you were going from the, I would say a good number of the popular fighting
5922340	5924620	games at the time were out of Japan.
5924620	5930300	You know we had our Street Fighter at the time, we had our, I think, you know KOF started
5930300	5941300	after that because this actually was first out in 1992 so yeah this was before King of
5941300	5942300	Fighters.
5942300	5947980	By the time you had like Fatal Fury and World Heroes and you know all of those games and
5947980	5954740	this was something that was new, it was supposed to be more of a realistic kind of, of, I mean
5954740	5960660	at least by just having actual human looking people and the violence, you had all the blood
5960660	5968300	which oh my god they're just, everybody's freaking out over fake skeletons and red pixels.
5968300	5971700	It was something else though that it was like, I mean it's one thing to have the violence
5971700	5975220	of cartoons but this was really one of the first circumstances where you had that kind
5975220	5981380	of extreme violence, as I say as Raiden gets impaled on a spike there in the video, using
5981380	5983620	like digitized real people.
5983620	5986620	That was a real eye opener for some people, you know what I mean?
5986620	5987620	It was.
5987620	5991980	And then there was, they also had the stage based fatalities, remember the pit?
5991980	5993940	Yeah we just saw that in the video, yeah yeah.
5993940	5999020	Yeah and they really played on that in Mortal Kombat too with having the acid bath and the
5999020	6000020	pit for that one.
6000020	6003420	I think every Mortal Kombat game has had a pit stage now.
6003420	6005420	Yeah now.
6005420	6010980	But you just, you have those, and the storyline in the game, you know, the first one was like
6010980	6016340	oh you have to go to the outer world and fight to save Earth, blah blah blah, cliche, but
6016340	6025860	as it's gone forward, the series itself has really developed its own rich type of mythology,
6025860	6029180	you know, really vast character base, I mean.
6029180	6033900	Yeah when you play the new one, it's like there's a lot of story in it, which is really
6033900	6038500	weird for such a dumb fighting game, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Mortal Kombat,
6038500	6041300	but it's kind of dumb.
6041300	6044660	And I also thought it was funny that some of the influence for this game actually came
6044660	6046940	from Big Trouble in Little China.
6046940	6047940	I can see that.
6047940	6055340	Well especially in, what was the character, Kung Lao, and Raiden, which I hate how people
6055340	6058060	mispronounce that name, but anyway.
6058060	6063940	So yeah, now the other thing about this, and this is actually where one of my pinball heroes,
6063940	6069700	Steve Ritchie, comes into play, who I have met, he's a lovely guy, he autographed a couple
6069700	6076140	of our pinball tables, but he's the one that suggested the K instead of the C for Mortal
6076140	6079220	Kombat.
6079220	6083060	And that, it just sort of stuck.
6083060	6085900	So there you go.
6085900	6092860	It was, like I said, it was with Mortal Kombat 4 that it really went to the 3D and then moved
6092860	6101140	on from there, but I think that really this was just the big thing to stick.
6101140	6105420	And then when you had the home copies come out, like for example, the Sega version, the
6105420	6111220	Genesis Mega Drive, had different Easter eggs in it, like for example, Mortal Kombat 2 had
6111220	6112580	Pong in it, remember?
6112580	6113860	Yeah, I do.
6114180	6116500	For record, that does not work on the Super Nintendo version.
6116500	6120900	My brother and I stayed up all night playing 250 versus matches to try to get that to work,
6120900	6123700	but I have done it in the arcade.
6123700	6132900	There were the Fergalities for the Genesis version, the Sega CD had the D.A.D.D.S code
6132900	6139620	that changed all the fighters to the characters from a show called D.A.D.D.S Army.
6139620	6143700	Reptile and Jade were included as hidden characters and they finally came out in the later ones.
6143700	6145940	So there's the toasty thing around here.
6145940	6146940	I do.
6146940	6156580	But again, we can't really go into any of the other ones without it.
6156580	6157580	Absolutely.
6157580	6161020	So, how about the list?
6161020	6163020	Or I won't go through the whole list.
6163020	6164020	Can I ask about this?
6164020	6165660	Because I'm seeing comments on it in chat too.
6165660	6171100	You said you are bothered when people say Raiden, but I thought that's what the announcer
6171100	6172100	said.
6172100	6175740	That's how it's pronounced in the game, but the actual legit way to pronounce that name
6175740	6176740	is Raiden.
6176740	6180300	Well, because I'm thinking like obviously there was that other game that was called
6180300	6184060	Raiden that, you know, was out in the arcades and I'm sure we think of that, but then I'm
6184060	6185060	thinking...
6185060	6186060	No, that's people being Americans.
6186060	6189500	But wasn't, well, wasn't his name at one point spelled R-A-Y-D-E-N?
6189500	6194340	Yeah, but if they're trying to name someone after a legit thunder god and just misspell
6194340	6198140	it because that's how they think it's supposed to be, that doesn't necessarily make it right.
6198140	6199140	Alright, alright.
6199140	6200140	I had to ask.
6200140	6201140	I'm sorry.
6201140	6205340	It's my little uppity internal Japanese major.
6205340	6206460	At least you can admit it.
6206460	6207460	I can admit it.
6207460	6215060	So we started in 1992 and the franchise is still going on 20 years later.
6215060	6216740	So that's to say something.
6216740	6220980	We have the first Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate, Mortal Kombat
6220980	6224300	3, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Mortal Kombat 4, Mortal Kombat mythology sub-zero, Mortal Kombat
6224300	6228220	2, Mortal Kombat Gold, Mortal Kombat Special Forces, Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance, Tournament
6228220	6233540	Edition, Deception, Shaolin Monks, Unchained, Armageddon, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, Mortal
6233540	6238140	Kombat Collection, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which was kind of amusing but they took out,
6238140	6241900	they changed Joker's fatality, but they put it in with another character in a later one
6241900	6243460	where he just comes out and shoots them.
6243460	6244460	That's pretty funny.
6244460	6250840	Mortal Kombat, which was the 2011 release, which is the reboot game, Mortal Kombat Arcade
6250840	6254400	Collection and Mortal Kombat Complete Edition.
6254400	6256400	So yeah.
6256400	6261040	And then we had one good movie and a bunch of crap after that.
6261040	6263480	And Utah Saints remix.
6263480	6264480	That's right.
6264480	6265480	Good stuff.
6265480	6266480	The first movie was so good.
6266480	6269280	How could the second movie be so bad?
6269280	6274180	An interesting kind of like FYI from Dark Tetsuya in the chat room saying again back
6274180	6278200	on the Raiden thing or Raiden, but I have to go here because Dark Tetsuya says, I think
6278200	6281240	that was because of Fatal Furies Raiden at the time.
6281240	6282240	That's right.
6282240	6286120	I think that's why they had ended up in later games, they had changed the spelling was because
6286120	6287480	of the Fatal Fury character.
6287480	6288920	I don't know.
6288920	6289920	All right.
6289920	6291120	We're done with that topic.
6291120	6293820	I just, I had, I thought I kind of went, Oh yeah.
6293820	6294820	When I read that comment.
6294820	6298600	The TV show was actually kind of okay.
6298600	6299600	It was...
6299600	6300600	They also had a cartoon.
6300600	6302600	Well, they had the web series on YouTube not that long ago.
6302600	6303600	Cartoon was awful.
6303600	6304600	What, the cartoon?
6304600	6305600	The cartoon was awful.
6305600	6306600	The web series was kind of neat.
6306600	6308040	They had some big actors in it.
6308880	6309880	I'm surprised about that.
6309880	6310880	All right.
6310880	6311880	All right.
6311880	6312880	I have a Mortal Kombat story.
6312880	6313880	All right.
6313880	6314880	Yeah.
6314880	6322840	Did you guys see that there, the subway or the 12 minute YouTube subway ad that this
6322840	6323840	band did?
6323840	6324840	No.
6324840	6325840	What?
6325840	6329080	Where they, they sing $5 foot long for like 12 minutes.
6329080	6331660	They're all in Mortal Kombat cosplay.
6331660	6337320	Actually it starts with like Sub-Zero in Scorpion and Scorpion on the mic, you know, Sub-Zero
6337320	6338320	on the drums.
6338320	6339320	Wait.
6339320	6340320	Is that on YouTube?
6340320	6341320	It's on YouTube.
6341320	6342320	It's called...
6342320	6343320	I don't know.
6343320	6344320	12 minutes, $5 foot long.
6344320	6346520	And they're like $5 foot long.
6346520	6347520	And then as the...
6347520	6348520	There it is.
6348520	6349520	Your classic game of the week, Mortal Kombat.
6349520	6350840	Now I gotta find this $5 foot long.
6350840	6356200	As it's going on, more and more cosplay, you know, like Molina and like all kinds of other
6356200	6360600	characters come in with their subways and they're like eating as he's singing $5 foot
6360600	6361600	long.
6361600	6363600	Oh my God.
6363600	6364600	I think this is it.
6364680	6372080	It's uh, it says 12 minute, $5 foot long cover by Mortal Komband.
6372080	6373080	Is it?
6373080	6376200	You know, I was going to end this with a really profound statement.
6376200	6378800	Is $5 foot long the statement?
6378800	6379800	No.
6379800	6382800	I have to hear this.
6382800	6384800	There's smoke.
6388800	6391800	Are they going to sing the song or not?
6391800	6393800	Scorpion on drums.
6394000	6397000	Dar Sakura, let's get to your statement while we wait for them to actually sing something.
6397000	6400000	It's going to sound awful if it is.
6407000	6412000	This sounds like a Wesley Willis song.
6412000	6418100	So Time Magazine in 2012 had a quote that Mortal Kombat had become the boogeyman for
6418100	6421320	anti-games activists and politicians.
6421320	6426400	But the reason the 1992 classic remains seminal is because it broke the implicit taboo about
6426400	6429000	what was okay to put in a game.
6429000	6430000	And there you have it.
6430000	6432080	All right, there it is.
6432080	6434200	Your classic game of the week, $5 foot long.
6434200	6436600	Oh, they're not even paying us to advertise.
6436600	6437800	Look at that stealth marketing.
6437800	6440480	I don't eat at Subway because of bread.
6440480	6443400	The classic game of the week was $5 foot long.
6443400	6444400	That's what you just said.
6444400	6446400	That's what I just said.
6446400	6450400	The classic game is Jamie kicking Rob's ass during the break.
6450480	6452480	There might be a fatality.
6452480	6455480	But stay tuned, guys, because we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come,
6455480	6457480	including some rapid-fire news.
6457480	6461480	The FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,
6461480	6462480	Orange Launch Radio.
6462480	6463480	We've got more show to come.
6463480	6466480	More Matt, more Exfer, more Shane.
6466480	6470480	Maybe more Shane if he's not too busy playing Phoenix Wright.
6470480	6474480	Plenty more of that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
6480400	6488400	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio live on this Sunday evening.
6488400	6493400	Happy Groundhog Day because there's not any other bowl type of games going on today.
6493400	6497400	Actually, we were talking during the break, and I think Matt, who is one of our guests tonight,
6497400	6503400	was mentioning that one of the teams got annihilated in the Super Bowl or something.
6503400	6505400	Do we want to spoil that?
6505400	6506400	Okay.
6506400	6508400	We're going to download this tomorrow.
6508400	6510400	Watch it live or you didn't.
6510400	6513400	I don't know people that DVR the Super Bowl game, but...
6513400	6516400	Yeah, well, I actually don't know anything about football, but...
6516400	6517400	Tough titty.
6517400	6518400	I'm from Seattle.
6518400	6520400	I'm happy the Seahawks won.
6520400	6522400	So Seahawks won their first Super Bowl, right?
6522400	6523400	Their first Super Bowl.
6523400	6524400	All right.
6524400	6525400	Congratulations.
6525400	6528400	Now, that led to a topic we were talking about just briefly during the break.
6528400	6531400	Speaking of Seattle, and I didn't bring this up earlier, you guys went to PAX last year.
6531400	6533400	You guys go, like, a lot, don't you?
6533400	6534400	Yeah, we love it.
6534400	6535400	Since you're from Seattle?
6535400	6540400	Yeah, Christopher and I have gone the last two years and I've gone probably six or seven times since then.
6540400	6541400	Yeah.
6541400	6544400	I remember the first time I went, it was super small.
6544400	6554400	You can buy a ticket at the door and the expo hall would be one small room and there'd be...
6554400	6558400	You could play anything, but now it's like super long line.
6558400	6559400	Yeah.
6559400	6561400	It's really long, but it's really great.
6561400	6563400	I was going to say, how does it feel though?
6563400	6567400	Now that it's this big thing that everybody's into, do you kind of miss the old days?
6567400	6575400	I do miss the old days, but I like how it is now because now there's so much excitement and it feels like a giant party almost.
6575400	6580400	You see the enthusiasm of everyone and everyone's there.
6580400	6583400	You know it's into things like me.
6583400	6586400	You can probably smell the enthusiasm too.
6586400	6591400	What does enthusiasm smell like?
6591400	6593400	Probably B.O.
6593400	6596400	All right, you guys are going back to PAX again this year, I imagine?
6596400	6597400	Most definitely.
6597400	6599400	As long as you can get a ticket.
6599400	6601400	What are you most looking forward to out of this year's PAX?
6601400	6603400	I guess it's too early to ask maybe, but...
6603400	6604400	Yeah, I don't know.
6604400	6608400	I mean, the thing I like the most actually is back to board games.
6608400	6610400	At PAX, they have a huge board game.
6610400	6612400	They always have a huge board game library.
6612400	6614400	I was going to ask about that, yeah.
6614400	6619400	We're always, my friends and I, we're just like, let's find something that we've never played before and check it out.
6619400	6620400	Board games are expensive.
6620400	6623400	I just remember Wil Wheaton signed my iPhone.
6623400	6624400	That did happen at PAX.
6624400	6626400	It wore off by the end of the day.
6626400	6630400	Shane, are you going to try to go to one of these expos this year?
6630400	6636400	It would be cool, especially now that it's not associated with Penny Arcade anymore, so it's tolerable.
6636400	6641400	Do they have any big gaming shows in Kansas?
6641400	6642400	I guess...
6642400	6645400	Is there like a Wichita anime slash video game?
6645400	6649400	I don't know if there's an anime thing, but no.
6649400	6652400	I thought I'd ask.
6652400	6653400	All right.
6653400	6654400	Let's get back into the news.
6654400	6662400	We're running a little long tonight with all these great people in the studio, but we want to just run through the news here so we can get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6662400	6664400	Not yet, because we've got plenty of news first.
6664400	6667400	Rapid fire news, and I'm actually going to start us off.
6667400	6673400	We were talking about online games earlier, and one online game that hasn't come up was The Secret World.
6673400	6676400	But I know there's some people that are really into The Secret World.
6676400	6679400	Well, some very interesting news regarding The Secret World this week.
6679400	6685400	Funcom's offices, Funcom is the group that made The Secret World, they got raided.
6685400	6687400	And this is coming out of Norwegian.
6687400	6691400	Was it like a 20-man raid?
6691400	6696400	I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway.
6696400	6701400	I almost said Norwegian, but I corrected myself and said Norway.
6701400	6706400	I don't know how many people are on the police force in Norway who went to where these guys are located in Oslo.
6706400	6712400	But yeah, they went to get boxes of seized documents.
6712400	6718400	And yeah, apparently the reason why, infringement of the provisions of the Securities Trading Act.
6718400	6725400	Now, of course, Funcom came out later and said, move along, everything's fine, nothing happened, the game's still being made, we're good, y'all.
6725400	6730400	But certainly it made a lot of people raise their eyebrows if they got raided.
6730400	6735400	All right, moving on to news on Pac-Man Museum.
6735400	6740400	If you were looking forward to getting Pac-Man Museum, yes, yet another repackaging of various Pac-Man games.
6740400	6744400	Does anybody even want this game? Because I think the answer is no.
6744400	6747400	Dark Sakura, you like Namco stuff. Do you want Pac-Man Museum?
6747400	6750400	I do. How many freaking versions of Pac-Man do I have to own?
6750400	6751400	Exactly.
6751400	6753400	Don't you want Pac and Pal again?
6754400	6756400	All right, well here's the thing.
6756400	6758400	I want baby Pac-Man, okay? That's it.
6758400	6765400	If you were looking forward to this on the 3DS or Wii U, tough titty, because the games are no longer coming out. It was cancelled.
6765400	6772400	The game was announced last summer and it was supposed to come out on Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and then Wii U and 3DS eShops.
6772400	6777400	But then it was updated to remove the references to Wii U and 3DS.
6777400	6783400	And the reason why they got cancelled? Quote, a result of delayed development.
6783400	6785400	Hmmm.
6785400	6786400	Made sense.
6786400	6787400	Hmmm.
6787400	6789400	All right, so there you go.
6789400	6793400	Also, one quick story here on The Wolf Among Us.
6793400	6798400	This was a game from Telltale that they did last year that a lot of people were talking about.
6798400	6800400	It's like one of their favorite games of the year.
6800400	6804400	I have yet to play it sadly, but I'm really excited to check it out.
6805400	6813400	Episode 2, Smoke and Mirrors, has been announced that it is coming out for PC, Mac, and PlayStation 3 on February 4th.
6813400	6816400	Xbox 360 the very next day.
6816400	6820400	Telltale announced that news and I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear about that.
6820400	6822400	The Wolf Among Us.
6822400	6827400	Okay, there's giggling going on because of something that you brought up earlier about JCPenney being drunk.
6827400	6829400	Wasn't that really funny, the tweets you're making?
6829400	6831400	Yeah, but Kia.
6831400	6832400	I love Kia.
6832400	6834400	Kia came and said do you need a Disney dress?
6834400	6840400	They came out, JCPenney came out later and said they were typing with mittens that are available at JCPenney.
6840400	6845400	Yeah, were those mittens soaked in alcohol that they were spilling all over themselves?
6845400	6849400	You know what? I call it a brilliant viral marketing move.
6849400	6851400	Like, okay, everybody's talking about it.
6851400	6855400	I didn't even watch the damn Super Bowl, but I heard about that Radio Shack commercial, which was awesome.
6855400	6856400	I didn't hear about that.
6856400	6862400	The Radio Shack commercial was, hey, we're that store from the 1980s.
6862400	6869400	And then all these 1980s icons run into the store like Alf and Mary Lou Retton and all this stuff.
6869400	6872400	And then they say, you know, we're not just that store from the 80s anymore.
6872400	6874400	So it was very, very like, tongue in cheek.
6874400	6878400	What's the assurance when I keep seeing hashtags for on Twitter all over the place?
6878400	6879400	I don't know.
6879400	6884400	Somebody tell me because it looks like it might be a contest.
6884400	6889400	You can tell Shane in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, although he'll have to look over my shoulder to see it, I guess.
6889400	6890400	I can't see it.
6890400	6891400	Go home, JCPenney. You're drunk.
6891400	6893400	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for rapid fire news?
6893400	6900400	Well, in other news, it's stupid machinery that I actually really love, the Apple technology.
6900400	6905400	There is sad news in the gaming world, and that has to deal with cave.
6905400	6909400	You know, we have lots of listeners who are totally cave shooter fans.
6910400	6922400	Well, and if this gives you an idea of, you know, just what cave's done, it was DeathSmiles, Dodonpachi, Espagaluda, Espagaluda 2.
6922400	6928400	But they basically are closing their western offices. They've closed their English blog.
6928400	6935400	And I think the last thing that they've done was the DeathSmiles 2X, which was untranslated.
6935400	6937400	They just published it over here.
6937400	6941400	So, that's sadness, but we will still be importing them.
6941400	6945400	Were they found in their apartment with a needle in their arm, too, like Philip Seymour Hoffman?
6945400	6949400	Stop it! Why would you say that?
6949400	6953400	What even provoked you to say such an awful thing?
6953400	6955400	Is your name Extafirm?
6955400	6957400	He's laughing at it.
6957400	6958400	I am laughing.
6958400	6959400	Your fans are awful.
6959400	6961400	Here's my thing. Here's my thing. Okay, okay.
6961400	6964400	I'm gonna make one little political comment, and then I'm gonna move on to the rest of this.
6964400	6968400	Oh, boy. When she says one little political comment, brace yourself.
6968400	6973400	Why is it that everybody is all like, oh, he's going to be so missed, and it's such a shame he was battling drugs,
6973400	6979400	when if it was just a regular person on the street that died of a heroin overdose, you'd call him a fucking junkie?
6979400	6981400	What's up with that?
6981400	6983400	He was a fucking junkie. I'm sorry.
6983400	6985400	Yeah, he was. Well, stop with that!
6985400	6989400	They found him with a needle hanging out of his body.
6989400	6991400	Look what you did! Look what you did!
6991400	6994400	That had nothing to do with video games!
6994400	6999400	Are you just mad that nobody answered your question about dumbass insurance or whatever it was you were asking about?
6999400	7001400	Yes, that's what they get punished for.
7001400	7005400	Apparently it's too soon, because that's all I'm seeing in the chat room.
7005400	7011400	Video games, people. Video games.
7011400	7015400	He is about to be a Cards Against Humanity card pretty soon.
7015400	7016400	He is.
7016400	7018400	May I go back to my serious thing?
7018400	7019400	Yes.
7019400	7026400	Why is it that celebrities are held to a higher standard for doing the same fuckery that we belittle other people for?
7026400	7029400	God damn it, I thought serious thing meant video game news.
7029400	7033400	Just think about your double standards, people.
7033400	7035400	Okay, so moving forward.
7035400	7037400	Don't nod.
7037400	7046400	There was a rumor, and I actually read the rumor on Eurogamer myself, that they filed for bankruptcy, but they actually did not file for bankruptcy.
7046400	7056400	They did something in France called judicial reorganization that allows them to basically reorganize the company without having to file for bankruptcy.
7056400	7060400	And by the way, this is the company that did Remember Me for Capcom.
7060400	7064400	And then last, but not least, but very unsurprising news.
7064400	7070400	Zynga bought another company, they bought Natural Motion, and then they fired 15% of their global workforce.
7070400	7073400	So fuck you, Zynga.
7073400	7078400	No, Jamie, tell us how you really feel.
7078400	7081400	Alright.
7081400	7082400	Moving on.
7082400	7084400	I'm gonna make a bad joke.
7084400	7085400	Oh no.
7085400	7087400	I don't know if you're allowed to talk anymore.
7087400	7099400	I wonder if King is gonna rip them off and fire 15% of their global workforce and repackage it as firing global workforce saga.
7099400	7108400	This is why I don't visit often.
7108400	7113400	This is why it'll be another five years before Shane's invited back on the show.
7113400	7115400	Hey, it's the Fubo Question of the Week.
7115400	7117400	Oh, what, Jamie?
7117400	7123400	I'm just saying, people need to get their priorities straight and not live in, you know, the brave new world.
7123400	7131400	I'm just saying Fubo Question of the Week, y'all.
7131400	7135400	You take Facebook and Google Plus and you slam them together, you get Fubo.
7135400	7137400	It's the Fubo Question of the Week.
7137400	7139400	This week's question, very easy.
7139400	7141400	Whatever could have inspired a question like this.
7141400	7146400	What is your favorite sports game ever made and why?
7146400	7149400	And I clearly said, by the way, at Facebook and Google, I said,
7149400	7156400	Don't be a party pooper with the I hate all sports answer because there's more sports than those that involve balls.
7156400	7158400	Yes, I said balls.
7158400	7160400	How many people said that they hate all sports?
7160400	7162400	You shouldn't read them.
7162400	7163400	I'm not going to read them.
7163400	7165400	But we can make fun of them. Read their names.
7165400	7167400	Okay, I will.
7167400	7169400	Osfer says, NFL Blitz.
7169400	7173400	That series was just plain silly and I loved playing as a bald eagle that caught on fire.
7173400	7177400	It would be all kinds of need if that's actually how Super Bowl games win.
7177400	7180400	Unfolded Raptor says, Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup.
7180400	7183400	You know, that's a creative answer. Great answer.
7183400	7189400	It's the closest thing you get to playing real Quidditch without actually going outside on a broom beating balls into vertical hoops with a stick.
7189400	7191400	It plays a lot like soccer and is a lot of fun.
7191400	7196400	The game was fairly overlooked, but as a sports game, I find it to be an underrated gem.
7196400	7199400	Andy R. replied and said, Blizz Ball.
7199400	7203400	I think you meant to say Blitz Ball and I'm assuming that's from Final Fantasy X.
7203400	7207400	Rob H. says, California games on the Sega Master System 2.
7207400	7211400	But I've always loved the WWE SmackDown games since PlayStation 1.
7211400	7216400	But I've gone off of them since the 360 and PlayStation 3 era.
7216400	7220400	I also have a soft spot for Sensible Soccer on the Amiga.
7220400	7225400	It's one of those games that's fun, simple multiplayer and I spent a lot of time on that with my brother and friends in the early 90s.
7225400	7229400	Sly Red Panda says, Beach Spikers for the GameCube.
7229400	7234400	Great mechanics and design and you can do four player versus, two versus two co-op matches.
7234400	7237400	It's one of the few games my non-gamer cousins love to play.
7237400	7243400	There's nothing better than throwing shade at your opponents by smashing their faces in via a full powered volleyball spike.
7243400	7245400	And that's followed by a heart.
7245400	7249400	Monty Boggs says, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.
7249400	7251400	I've never had an interest in hockey but that game is great.
7251400	7255400	Delvin, our buddy from Video Game Realness.
7255400	7257400	That's a really hilarious show, by the way.
7257400	7259400	Check that out, Video Game Realness.
7259400	7261400	Delvin says, Skate or Die is pretty rad.
7261400	7263400	And also, Paperboy.
7263400	7265400	Yes, that's right, Paperboy.
7265400	7270400	Because dodging bitches with bats and people exercising in the street and assholes who back out randomly is a sport.
7270400	7273400	Of course, there's the bonus round that's actually more sports-like.
7273400	7277400	Tech 2030 says, SSX Tricky on PlayStation 2.
7277400	7280400	It was insane, unrealistic and I loved it.
7280400	7283400	Renji221 says, NBA 2K11.
7283400	7285400	That was the first basketball I played in years.
7285400	7289400	Eddie K says, always been a fan of most NHL games.
7289400	7291400	Being Canadian and all.
7291400	7294400	Also, the most recent UFC games were really good.
7294400	7298400	And although it's not technically a sport, I've always had a soft spot for pro wrestling games.
7298400	7302400	Strudels89 says, I was a huge fan of NBA Street on the GameCube.
7302400	7304400	Basketball is my favorite sport.
7304400	7308400	I loved getting my meters up and just breaking the backboards doing those crazy tricks.
7308400	7310400	Tim Tripp says, Bushido Blade.
7310400	7312400	Kendo is totally a sport.
7313400	7319400	Tiara says, if poker counts as a sport, since they show it on ESPN, sure it counts.
7319400	7323400	Then my favorite sports game ever created is Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII.
7323400	7328400	It's probably one of the most fun minigames in the Final Fantasy series other than Chocobo Hot and Cold.
7328400	7333400	But it wasn't nearly as good as Chocobo Racers, just saying that game was the bomb.
7333400	7337400	AZHP said, I just recently discovered a Neo Geo gem called Windjammers.
7337400	7339400	I think it came out in America as Flying Power Disc.
7340400	7342400	Dark Soccer is probably the only person who heard of it though.
7342400	7345400	I've heard of Windjammers actually. I haven't heard of the US one.
7345400	7349400	Codeman says, my favorite sports game is and always will be NBA Jam.
7349400	7353400	I always played a lot of it in arcades and console and well, best catch phrases ever.
7353400	7355400	Boom Shakalaka.
7355400	7359400	CyberJudge says, I have to say that I love hockey and soccer games in general.
7359400	7363400	But the one game that sticks in my mind when I think of sports games is the very first sport game I owned on NES.
7363400	7365400	Blades of Steel.
7365400	7371400	The joys of 8-bit graphics, blue and red, nameless guys skating around in fights out in the yin yang.
7371400	7373400	The best.
7373400	7376400	Generate Johnny says, I'm going with Mutant League Hockey.
7376400	7381400	Why? What's not to love about robots, undead and trolls playing hockey together?
7381400	7385400	Besides, the only hockey game that turns a traditional hockey fight into a brutal deathmatch.
7385400	7391400	Ryan B. responds and says, here is the game that tops all sports games.
7391400	7393400	Tecmo Bowl or Super Tecmo Bowl.
7393400	7396400	It was way better than Madden, better than NFL Live or Blitz.
7396400	7399400	Hell, I'm shocked that nobody said Daytona USA.
7402400	7405400	Haseo Sumerugawa says, I'm going to just say Mirror's Edge.
7405400	7410400	Because Parker is technically a sport and the game is centered around using Parker to get around.
7410400	7415400	So yeah, otherwise NBA Jam on the Genesis because Boom Shakalaka.
7415400	7418400	Backwards Glance says, Super Monkey Boxing.
7418400	7421400	Beating up a friend as a cute monkey. I also love their billiards.
7421400	7425400	NFL Blitz is the answer from Matt Jay.
7425400	7429400	The only traditional sports game I ever got into.
7429400	7433400	Now if you're willing to step beyond anything really traditional, then I'd go with Mario Kart.
7433400	7438400	Have owned nearly every title in the series and loved every single one.
7438400	7442400	Going over to Google Plus real quick, we just have a few answers over there.
7442400	7445400	Rettertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.
7445400	7449400	I like golf games in general and Tiger Woods PGA Tour especially.
7449400	7453400	But the 2004 model of the game is the first Tiger Woods game I really sunk my teeth into.
7453400	7457400	The experience I had playing this game is what I compare other sports games to.
7457400	7464400	Sam H said, NFL 2K5 had 3, 5, and 7 step drops with actual play verbiage.
7464400	7468400	True pocket passing and offensive lineman and receivers blocking correctly in the run game.
7469400	7473400	And lastly, Jason. He's here tonight through the Fugu question who says,
7473400	7476400	The Mario sports games have been incredibly impressive.
7476400	7480400	I had a ton of fun with Mario Strikers, Tennis, Virtual Boy, and GameCube alike.
7480400	7483400	And really all the Mario universe party games.
7483400	7487400	I generally don't like golf games, but Mario Golf was fun and approachable.
7487400	7493400	With just enough charm and tweaks to the way the game played to make it really worth, sorry,
7493400	7497400	to make it a worthwhile and even legitimate golf game.
7497400	7500400	Really hotshots golf with a recognizable brand attached.
7501400	7506400	So I'd probably pick NFL Blitz as my favorite. After naming all those games.
7506400	7513400	Alright. There. I read all the answers because the last couple weeks I've been skipping some of the answers and I felt bad.
7513400	7516400	How about you guys? Quickly. Like favorite sports games.
7516400	7518400	Shane, do you have a sports game?
7518400	7521400	Yes, I played the crap out of Ken Griffey on Super Nintendo.
7521400	7526400	It was part of, I think, the Nintendo Power Fest one year and so I wanted to get good at it.
7526400	7529400	I played it non-stop and I ended up liking it a lot.
7530400	7535400	My favorite sports game, and I can't believe nobody named it, is Kirby's Dream Course on the Super Nintendo.
7535400	7537400	It's cause Act F didn't answer tonight.
7538400	7540400	It's miniature golf. What? It counts?
7540400	7542400	He was too busy clopping.
7542400	7549400	I would also say, honestly, Wii Sports Bowling really changed everything in many ways.
7549400	7552400	So, I don't know. I kind of have to tip my hat to that too.
7552400	7554400	But of course I loved a lot of the stuff you guys named too.
7554400	7556400	Like NBA Jam and Blades of Steel. Of course, of course.
7556400	7557400	Extrovert?
7558400	7564400	I think the only sports game, besides fighting games if you consider that sports, I don't know.
7567400	7569400	Would boxing be considered?
7569400	7570400	Sure, why not?
7570400	7572400	I love Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
7572400	7575400	Fifth Dream just said that in the chat and I was like, that's a really good answer.
7575400	7578400	And Super Punch Out was one of my favorite games ever.
7578400	7579400	Sure, of course, boxing is sports.
7579400	7582400	Oh, and NBA Jam. I liked that a lot too when that was around.
7582400	7583400	Jamie?
7583400	7587400	Well, actually, you just named all of the ones that I liked too.
7587400	7593400	Also, the one football game that I have to really say I liked was Super High Impact on the Super Nintendo.
7593400	7595400	Last but not least, Matt?
7595400	7599400	Not sure if I'd call it a sports game, but I really liked Excitebike way back.
7599400	7600400	That game's awesome.
7600400	7601400	It's Motocross.
7601400	7602400	So why not? Why not?
7602400	7605400	There was a Game Boy version of that that was really good.
7605400	7606400	Or no one.
7606400	7608400	There was Motocross Maniacs, I think, was the Game Boy.
7608400	7612400	And then there was Uniracer on the Super Nintendo, which kind of reminded me of Excitebike.
7612400	7613400	Yeah, Uniracer was fun.
7613400	7616400	I don't know why that game really reminded me of Excitebike, and I really liked it.
7616400	7618400	I loved Excite Truck, though. You know that.
7618400	7620400	Actually, there is a game.
7620400	7623400	Hydro Thunder.
7623400	7626400	Hydro Thunder was super, super fun.
7626400	7628400	A lot of good racing games out there. A lot of good stuff.
7628400	7632400	Let's just say F-Zero. It's a racing game.
7632400	7637400	That's a very good way of looking at it. Why not? F-Zero's amazing.
7637400	7640400	Alright, let's do some more news here before we get to some calls.
7640400	7645400	Quickly, some updates on free games. Yay, free games.
7645400	7649400	If you are an Xbox Live Gold member, you've got some free games coming your way.
7649400	7653400	Dead Island is the free game right now. That's the original.
7653400	7657400	But I'm sure if you like Dead Island enough, they'll be happy to sell you.
7657400	7660400	Dead Island, the new one. Riptide? Is that the name of the new one?
7660400	7662400	They'll sell you the sequel happily.
7662400	7665400	But that's free right now if you want to experience Dead Island 1.
7665400	7670400	Free starting on February 16th will be Toy Soldiers Cold War.
7670400	7675400	I don't know anything about that game, but it's got a Rambo-looking guy and a Guile-looking guy on the front of it.
7675400	7680400	Man, Xbox Live games they get for free are such crappy games.
7680400	7685400	They must hate their customers. That's what I'm seeing off that picture.
7685400	7687400	Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.
7687400	7692400	And then going over to PlayStation Plus, here's the free games that are coming out on PlayStation Plus.
7692400	7694400	They just posted a February preview.
7694400	7697400	PlayStation 4 Outlast is going to be the free game on PlayStation 4.
7697400	7699400	Oh, that's so scary. I don't know if I can do that.
7699400	7700400	I know, right?
7700400	7706400	On PlayStation 3, Metro Last Light, Payday 2, and Remember Me.
7706400	7707400	Solid titles.
7707400	7708400	Those are all going to be pretty good.
7708400	7710400	And on the PlayStation Vita, this is pretty rad, too.
7710400	7714400	ModNation Racers Road Trip, which was an okay launch title.
7714400	7720400	But Street Fighter versus Tekken, which, you know, even though that game was kind of not the best fighting game,
7720400	7724400	it's still a pretty high-profile title to be going free on the Vita.
7724400	7726400	Again, with PlayStation Plus. Those are all coming in February.
7726400	7731400	But are they getting Dead Island, the first game from like five years ago?
7731400	7733400	No, they are not, actually.
7733400	7734400	Dang.
7734400	7735400	I know.
7735400	7736400	Really upsetting.
7736400	7737400	All right.
7737400	7740400	If only there was like a Humble Bundle I could have bought a while ago to have that in it.
7740400	7742400	Dude, I think I got that one.
7742400	7745400	But I did not get Dead Island because I did not install that.
7745400	7747400	All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.
7747400	7749400	Well, we do have other news.
7749400	7753400	And it's actually really, really good news.
7753400	7766400	There's been a study that came out that stated that playing relaxing video games actually will increase your positive social behavior.
7766400	7768400	And they weren't just saying like just casual games.
7768400	7774400	They included the Endless Ocean or the mini fishing game from Twilight Princess.
7774400	7776400	They had Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports Resort.
7776400	7784400	They even tested it against violent games and they said that they used the noise blast test.
7784400	7793400	And basically said that it was the relaxing games caused better social behavior.
7793400	7797400	Of course, it's not saying that violent games cause aggression.
7797400	7804400	Just saying that they were overall less relaxed than those who played the more calming games.
7804400	7807400	So, I mean, it's kind of a common sense duh thing.
7807400	7809400	But at least we have a study behind it.
7809400	7812400	Video games are good for you.
7812400	7816400	It's always nice to hear more positive news like that come out of studies.
7816400	7822400	See, and I find games where I kill lots of people to be highly relaxing so that makes me a much better person.
7822400	7824400	Ace Trainer Jelly Bean.
7824400	7826400	Which, by the way, I really like that name.
7826400	7828400	And our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7828400	7831400	I believe it. Flower, the game, makes me feel so happy.
7831400	7835400	Flower is a very like zen kind of game.
7835400	7842400	I put it to how I use fractal to calm myself down before I'm about to go melty.
7842400	7844400	I was talking about this last week, Minecraft.
7844400	7847400	And when I was playing Minecraft and I was building that tunnel, somebody said,
7847400	7849400	Oh, you want to use world edit to do it real quick?
7849400	7850400	I'm like, no.
7850400	7852400	It's like popping bubble wrap.
7852400	7853400	It's therapeutic.
7853400	7856400	I don't want to just click every little thing and make my own damn tunnel.
7856400	7858400	I don't want to have the help.
7858400	7860400	I mean, I appreciate it, but I don't want to do it myself.
7860400	7864400	Well, that's kind of how I feel about doing stuff in Minecraft as well.
7864400	7875400	But a friend of mine showed me another iOS game that is called Art of Glow.
7875400	7879400	And really, it's just like having a moving light bright on your phone.
7879400	7885400	But at the same time, it was just super relaxing and it gives another focus for,
7885400	7889400	I think, any type of emotion that happens to pop up.
7889400	7893400	Or, you know, like how we all felt after playing a music game.
7893400	7895400	You know, you have happy music.
7895400	7897400	You have the activity that goes with it.
7897400	7901400	And that really, I think, also changes the mental state.
7901400	7904400	Now, on the other end of the spectrum, I downloaded an iOS game this week
7904400	7906400	that everybody's been talking about.
7906400	7911400	An iOS game this week that everybody's been talking about called Flappy Bird.
7911400	7913400	Fucking hell.
7913400	7917400	This game is straight from the bowels of hell by Satan himself.
7917400	7918400	I refuse to play it.
7918400	7919400	Let me play it.
7919400	7920400	I have a void.
7920400	7921400	You want to play it?
7921400	7922400	I have a void.
7922400	7923400	Candy Crush.
7923400	7924400	Flappy Bird.
7924400	7925400	I have a void.
7925400	7927400	All you do is you tap the screen to flap the bird.
7927400	7929400	And you're going to fly through the pipes, okay?
7929400	7932400	And try not to hit Mario while you're at it.
7932400	7934400	Because it looks like...
7934400	7935400	No, it's nothing to do with Mario.
7935400	7937400	It's more techno kitten adventure than Mario.
7937400	7938400	Okay.
7938400	7939400	Shane's...
7939400	7941400	Oh, he died already before he even got to the first pipe.
7941400	7942400	Way to go.
7942400	7944400	You fly through the pipes.
7944400	7946400	You're supposed to not play it and play a good game.
7946400	7951400	All you do is you tap to flap, and you fly through the pipes.
7951400	7952400	Way to go.
7952400	7954400	Mom, did you say tap to flap?
7954400	7955400	Tap to flap.
7955400	7957400	This is the worst game.
7957400	7958400	Did you pay for this?
7958400	7959400	No, it's free.
7959400	7961400	You get your money back.
7961400	7962400	Too much.
7962400	7963400	Too much.
7963400	7964400	My best score is 11.
7964400	7968400	And then for the pony version, you bop to the crop.
7968400	7970400	Shut up.
7970400	7975400	Shane, do you have a zen game that you play to relax?
7975400	7976400	To relax?
7976400	7978400	And get yourself at peace?
7978400	7980400	Like maybe you should have played it before coming to the show tonight?
7980400	7982400	Super hexagon.
7982400	7984400	That game is stressful.
7984400	7985400	That game is awesome.
7985400	7988400	I can just play it for like an hour and not even care.
7988400	7989400	That's like me playing fractal.
7989400	7993400	I kind of get a little frustrated with it, but I have such a good time.
7993400	7997400	Ragenator in chat says, DarkSakura wants to flip Flappy Bird the bird?
7997400	8000400	No, I want to pretend it doesn't exist in my version of reality.
8000400	8003400	Who makes it so I know not to get their games ever?
8003400	8007400	Extifer or Matt, do you have a zen game that you?
8007400	8012400	I'm going to go with Rocksmith 2014.
8012400	8016400	I second that.
8017400	8023400	Well, that's perfectly legitimate. Music is an outlet for the soul.
8023400	8025400	Do not justify his answer.
8025400	8027400	I'm totally justifying your answer.
8027400	8030400	Rayman Legends, I just want to get that one in there.
8030400	8034400	Well, I play Mass Effect 3 still because it's got a great engine.
8034400	8037400	Even if I don't really care for the story in 3 as much as the first one.
8037400	8041400	It has a great engine and I get to shoot people and make my Shepard look pretty.
8041400	8043400	That's calming.
8043400	8047400	I don't know if these are zen-like relaxing games.
8047400	8050400	No, these are games also that make you want to scream.
8050400	8054400	These are awesome games. They're games by Treasure Games.
8054400	8057400	Which, you know, they recently did a green light campaign for Ikaruga.
8057400	8062400	Well, now Treasure is considering doing a new, original game for PC.
8062400	8068400	That's right, the makers of Gunstar Heroes and Bangayo and a lot of great classic shooter games.
8068400	8071400	They could be making other games for Steam.
8071400	8076400	This was from a comment from Treasure President Masato Megawa who said,
8076400	8079400	Ikaruga is the first one and we don't intend on stopping there.
8079400	8082400	There are some players who say, how about Radiant Silver Gun?
8082400	8084400	But we also don't intend to do only ports.
8084400	8088400	We're thinking of making a new, original title for the platform, Steam.
8091400	8096400	Well, and keep in mind Treasure, it's not just Radiant Silver Gun and Ikaruga.
8096400	8102400	They did Silhouette Mirage, which is one of the best Saturn games ever.
8102400	8105400	Have you literally done every Treasure game as a classic game of the week now at this point?
8105400	8109400	No, I have not. Because I don't think I did Miss Shiftmakers.
8109400	8116400	And I don't think I've done... I think I've done Bangayo. I've done...
8116400	8117400	Well, anyway.
8117400	8119400	I think I did Radiant Silver. You know, I forgot to play that in Arcade.
8119400	8122400	Do you want them to make a shooter? Do you want them to do something a little more outside the box?
8122400	8124400	I want another platformer.
8124400	8127400	And Gunstar Heroes is freaking amazing.
8127400	8132400	Which I'm still irritated at my husband because I bought him Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear.
8132400	8134400	He still has not opened the damn box.
8134400	8135400	Rude.
8135400	8136400	How rude.
8136400	8141400	Let's go to the mailbag. Dark Soccer's gonna open up the mailbag box right now.
8141400	8142400	No, I'm not.
8142400	8143400	Yes, you are.
8143400	8144400	The mailbag box?
8144400	8145400	Yes.
8145400	8146400	Is it a bag or a box?
8146400	8148400	It's both. It's a box made out of bag.
8148400	8151400	It's one of those bags with the hinged cover on it.
8151400	8152400	Yes, shaped like a box.
8152400	8154400	It's a bag.
8154400	8155400	It's like a Chinese takeout.
8155400	8156400	It's a Bax.
8156400	8157400	Alright, anyway.
8157400	8158400	It's a Bax.
8158400	8162400	Dark Soccer's gonna go to your emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8162400	8164400	and Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the mailbag head first
8164400	8166400	and hopefully she doesn't drown in all those spam emails.
8166400	8168400	But she's gonna find the legit ones and read them now.
8168400	8170400	I have no idea what you're talking about, Elliot B.
8170400	8173400	Um, hey O.L.R. I don't know if this will translate to radio
8173400	8177400	but I felt the need to share this inspired use of screenshots in the App Store.
8178400	8180400	I have no idea if this game is any good.
8180400	8183400	I'm gonna click it and it'll probably pull up my App Store.
8183400	8186400	If it pulls up Flappy Bird, I'm gonna poop my pants with laughter.
8186400	8187400	If it's Flap Prisma Drop.
8187400	8189400	Oh, bummer.
8189400	8194400	Um, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.
8194400	8198400	Is this stealth advertising for, I mean, it looks, it's all like rainbows and pretty things.
8198400	8199400	I like rainbows and pretty things.
8199400	8200400	Wait, keep going though.
8200400	8202400	Like, is there, I'm wondering, is there a joke in there?
8202400	8204400	Like, if you look at all the screenshots, can't you swipe?
8204400	8205400	I, no.
8205400	8206400	Oh, that's weird.
8206400	8208400	I don't see, oh, there we go.
8208400	8211400	No, that's just not very good.
8211400	8216400	I think maybe you're thinking of the PC App Store, so no, I, no.
8216400	8220400	Oh, it's trying to bring it up in my, in my iOS App Store and no.
8220400	8223400	We have to look at it on, on a computer.
8224400	8229400	This is from Imus, which I'm guessing is I, it's spelled E-Y-E-M-U-S,
8229400	8231400	so I'm guessing I-E-mus.
8231400	8233400	Or a-ye-mus, maybe?
8233400	8234400	Hello, OLR.
8234400	8236400	I'd first like to congratulate Loki on his new arrival
8236400	8238400	and hope he has a lot of sleep and rest in the coming months.
8238400	8240400	I'm writing because in the last week's show,
8240400	8242400	I think you misunderstood the issue that the majority of people had
8242400	8244400	with the Machinima debacle.
8244400	8247400	The problem wasn't that they were paying YouTubers to say good things
8247400	8249400	about Microsoft as part of an ad,
8249400	8252400	but the fact that part of the contract said they were not allowed to mention
8252400	8257400	that it was a paid ad in the first place, which is against FTC guidelines.
8257400	8260400	And, let me find where I was.
8260400	8263400	This is an issue because it would be like if it was revealed that
8263400	8266400	Dark Soccer was getting paid by EA to talk favorably about Mass Effect
8266400	8268400	all this time and not because she actually loved the game.
8268400	8270400	Well, that's not true.
8270400	8271400	You got us.
8271400	8274400	Or if Loki got money every time he mentioned GTA and how great it is.
8274400	8276400	That's not true either.
8276400	8279400	It would cause all listeners to take everything else that you say
8279400	8282400	with a skeptical eye in the future and your credibility would be shot,
8282400	8284400	if it's not already.
8284400	8288400	In every previous contract that Machinima and other outlets have,
8288400	8291400	they say that you must include the fact that this is a paid promotion,
8291400	8294400	but for some reason this deal with Microsoft said the exact opposite,
8294400	8296400	that you can't mention it's an ad.
8296400	8299400	Love the show and keep up the great work you guys do every week.
8299400	8300400	Thank you.
8300400	8301400	Thank you.
8301400	8303400	And I thought we had talked about that.
8303400	8304400	I mean, maybe we didn't.
8304400	8305400	We talked a lot about that.
8305400	8307400	I thought we had brought up that part of it was that, you know,
8307400	8309400	they weren't talking about it and mentioning it.
8309400	8311400	We kind of talked about how with product placement,
8311400	8313400	a lot of times they don't mention it.
8313400	8316400	But what that emailer did bring up that I don't think we really talked about
8316400	8320400	last week was that stark difference between usually you do say it's an ad
8320400	8322400	and this is very different.
8322400	8325400	But I still think a lot of the points that we brought up last week were still
8325400	8328400	kind of valid even considering what you're saying.
8328400	8331400	But thank you for clarifying because, yeah,
8331400	8334400	that is a very good point that it's very different from what they were doing
8334400	8335400	in the past.
8335400	8338400	Thank you for that email I miss.
8338400	8341400	Okay, this is another email.
8341400	8342400	This is the last one.
8342400	8344400	Hey, OLR, I've been listening to your podcast.
8344400	8346400	Now for about three years and while I'm a fan of the show,
8346400	8348400	I never take the time to write in.
8348400	8352400	I recently signed up on Vogue Network under their user name, Andrew.
8352400	8354400	Let me start off by saying congratulations to Loki on the new baby
8354400	8356400	and to Jamie on her new fun job.
8356400	8357400	That's right.
8357400	8359400	It's called fun job.
8359400	8361400	The reason for my email is because I recently started playing DC Universe
8361400	8363400	on my PS4 because I'm a noob.
8363400	8366400	Added it's really difficult to find a party to join up with.
8366400	8368400	Rob, I know you recently picked up a PS4
8368400	8371400	and if you or any listeners would like to make an OLR clan,
8371400	8372400	that would be great.
8372400	8376400	My PSN name is Andrew, as in A-N-D-R underscore capital U.
8376400	8378400	By the way, I typed this on my phone,
8378400	8381400	so if there are any typos, tough titties, Jamie, deal with it.
8381400	8385400	You did miss a comma, but I will let this pass.
8385400	8389400	You spelled everything correctly, so that spelling is, yeah.
8389400	8391400	Was there a question in there? Sorry.
8391400	8396400	No, I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.
8396400	8397400	Oh, okay.
8397400	8402400	I just wanted to say that he wanted to start an OLR clan on the PS4 DCU.
8402400	8407400	Oh, you know, I haven't played a lot on DCU, I have to be honest.
8407400	8408400	Not since the beta.
8408400	8411400	And I started a new character and I keep getting sidetracked
8411400	8413400	because Final Fantasy XIV is my MMO right now.
8413400	8416400	But I would be totally down with a VOG clan.
8416400	8418400	I would have to talk to Brad from Pod Culture.
8418400	8420400	He's the resident DC Universe expert at VOG
8420400	8423400	and I'll have to see where he's playing and try to figure that all out.
8423400	8431400	Our person, our reader here, Andrew, username is ANDR underscore U, Andrew.
8431400	8433400	So, thank you.
8433400	8436400	And that's it. I'm not reading any more, even if there were more.
8436400	8439400	I'm kidding. I would, but not.
8439400	8443400	So, Bobby Blackwolf, our good pal from VOGnetwork.com,
8443400	8446400	just joined our chat room and said,
8446400	8450400	the emailer with the iOS App Store link is referencing the iPhone screenshots,
8450400	8452400	not the iPad screenshots.
8452400	8455400	I never realized there was a difference. I guess that makes sense.
8455400	8457400	Well, since I'm on my iPad.
8457400	8459400	Yeah, so maybe that's why it didn't make sense.
8459400	8461400	Well, I'm going to bring it up right now.
8461400	8462400	You do that, Rob.
8462400	8465400	I'm working on it.
8465400	8468400	You know what, Raginator? I'm just going to boot you from the chat room right now.
8468400	8471400	I'm misspelling everything. I can do it too.
8471400	8472400	I'm not going to ban you.
8472400	8473400	Power trip.
8473400	8475400	But I'm going to boot you because I can and it's hilarious.
8475400	8478400	Okay, so that would explain why it made no sense to you.
8478400	8481400	Look at that. Two more spam messages came in just in the time it took you.
8481400	8484400	You know what? I'm about ready to offer up something different, so.
8484400	8486400	Right? Annoying.
8486400	8490400	Oh, my God. Okay, it is way funnier on the iPhone.
8490400	8494400	Now I get it. See, so there's like they play any time anywhere.
8494400	8500400	Play birthdays, play while parenting, play on your commute, play at your own funeral.
8500400	8502400	Okay, that's funny.
8502400	8506400	Why aren't the iPads, like Elliot's probably listening to the show going,
8506400	8509400	did they not see the same thing I saw?
8509400	8512400	No, we didn't. It's very different on iPad.
8512400	8516400	And lol kidding, Raginator.
8516400	8519400	By the way, Rob, I have a suggestion for you after the show.
8519400	8520400	Okay.
8520400	8521400	About our email situation.
8521400	8523400	Oh, yeah. Okay, great.
8523400	8525400	All right, you done looking at that? You want to see this too?
8525400	8527400	Since everybody's laughing at this, Shane?
8527400	8528400	That's hilarious, actually.
8528400	8531400	Shane's too busy reading like gossip websites.
8531400	8533400	What are you reading on your phone over there?
8533400	8534400	I'm reading about Harry Potter.
8534400	8535400	Reading about Harry Potter.
8535400	8539400	That's okay, because I used to read Harry Potter during the show.
8539400	8540400	All right.
8540400	8544400	Every time a new Harry Potter book would come out, I would just read the book on the show.
8544400	8547400	No, the one with the little baby crying.
8547400	8548400	All right.
8548400	8549400	Play on birthdays.
8549400	8551400	Let's get to the FUs. They can't hear you, expert.
8551400	8553400	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8565400	8570400	This is fucked up.
8570400	8572400	FUs of the week time.
8572400	8576400	I guess I really don't have any.
8576400	8577400	Well, okay.
8577400	8583400	FUs making a new friend at work just to have to have them move to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
8583400	8585400	That was a really fucked up situation.
8585400	8587400	Fuck you to his ex-remates.
8587400	8590400	And I hope that life treats you better in Tulsa.
8590400	8593400	Also...
8593400	8598400	Acceptance, Oklahoma. Sorry, code man.
8598400	8605400	I'm just really, I don't know, I'm a little bit just irritated at double standards.
8605400	8606400	I'll put it that way.
8606400	8609400	But I love my job and I wish I could tell everybody where it is that I'm working.
8609400	8613400	So cool job is super fucking cool.
8613400	8614400	All right.
8614400	8618400	Shane, do you have any FUs of the week or FUs of the past five years?
8618400	8622400	The past five years? No.
8622400	8626400	All right, then how about extrovert? Do you have any FUs of the week?
8626400	8628400	I don't have anything.
8628400	8631400	FU to life.
8631400	8635400	No, I'm generally good, Rob.
8635400	8638400	All right. Well, FU to being happy. You don't get the point.
8638400	8640400	No, I take it back. I got one.
8640400	8643400	So, FU to my car dealership.
8643400	8648400	I left my car there to get an oil change while I was gone and they're keeping it for like the week I'm gone.
8648400	8649400	Yeah.
8649400	8653400	And they ask for my phone number in case something goes wrong.
8653400	8656400	I'm like, okay, but you should already have it. So I give it to them.
8656400	8663400	And on Thursday morning, I get a call from them at 6 a.m. Pacific time.
8663400	8664400	Right.
8664400	8667400	They don't leave the message. I'm like, holy crap, what's wrong with my car?
8667400	8672400	I give them a call, call the wrong number.
8672400	8673400	That's scary.
8673400	8675400	Yeah. So they're jerks.
8675400	8677400	Matt, do you have any FUs of the week?
8677400	8679400	Nope. Pretty happy.
8679400	8681400	God, y'all make me sick.
8681400	8687400	I have an FU. FU to all the fuckers that keep texting me and calling me.
8687400	8689400	I keep getting freaking wrong.
8689400	8691400	Rebecca or something?
8691400	8692400	No, Rachel.
8692400	8693400	Rachel.
8693400	8698400	Everybody wants to talk to Rachel and she doesn't even bother telling anybody she dropped her phone.
8698400	8706400	Save a list of all of those people, send them a mass message, and then drop yourself from it so that they keep texting each other.
8706400	8708400	Oh, that's excellent.
8708400	8716400	So I think that the Gold's Gym in Valencia needs to stop fucking calling me.
8716400	8720400	I have called them and told them to take my number off their list.
8720400	8722400	You're blowing out people's speakers, Exeter. Calm down.
8722400	8730400	I have called them and politely asked them to change or drop my number and they won't stop calling me.
8730400	8734400	I'm like, I don't know who you guys are. Stop calling me.
8734400	8736400	Leave me alone, Rachel.
8736400	8737400	Yeah.
8737400	8742400	My FU of the week, actually things are fairly alright so I don't have a lot of angsty stuff.
8742400	8750400	FU to the fact that I missed all the fun this weekend when Shane got here because I had other real life commitments and stuff.
8750400	8752400	I got here in the middle of the week, not even this weekend.
8752400	8756400	I know, but you know. I missed Espeduce, Sniff, OL.
8756400	8757400	Yeah, it was really good.
8757400	8759400	Yeah, yeah, rub it in. That's fine. That's fine.
8759400	8761400	I had like 15 chicken hearts.
8761400	8763400	Did you demand everybody's chicken hearts?
8763400	8765400	No, me and Annie fought over them though.
8765400	8766400	Of course, of course.
8766400	8769400	I wanted to go but I'm poor.
8769400	8776400	Alright, one more story for you guys and then we're going to go to the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR.
8776400	8780400	This one's really quick. You know, everybody's talking about Google Glass.
8780400	8782400	Oh my God, y'all. Google Glass.
8782400	8784400	Are you interested in Google Glass, Matt?
8784400	8786400	Would you replace your glasses with Google Glass?
8786400	8790400	I don't know. It'd be fun.
8790400	8792400	Well, now they have games on it.
8792400	8800400	Some games you can download on Google Glass are Tennis, Balance, Clay Shooter, Matcher, and Shape Splitter.
8800400	8803400	Do you just like move your head and shake it to play?
8803400	8807400	So don't trust anybody driving with Google Glass on? Is that what we're saying?
8807400	8812400	Well, you probably shouldn't but you can play these games with your Google Glass.
8812400	8815400	I don't know where you would but I guess where do we play games today?
8815400	8818400	On the subway or something. You wouldn't look weird at all.
8818400	8824400	Balance has you using Glass's gyroscope to balance books on your head.
8824400	8825400	Sounds like fun.
8825400	8830400	Clay Shooter is like a first person shooter where you blast clay targets like Duck Hunt or something.
8830400	8833400	Matcher is memory. You know, the tile matching game.
8833400	8838400	And Shape Splitter is like Fruit Ninja. Can you imagine playing that game with your head?
8838400	8844400	Playing Fruit Ninja. You'd look like you have a tick or something. It'd be very interesting.
8844400	8850400	So, there you go. You can play those games on Google Glass if you like.
8850400	8855400	I guess it's just the start of what is to come.
8855400	8858400	Extrovert, would you get Google Glass?
8858400	8865400	I don't think so. I saw a person with Google Glass at the Bay Street Mall in Emeryville a while back.
8865400	8870400	That was kind of nifty. But they're like $1500.
8870400	8871400	They're very expensive.
8871400	8873400	I don't need it.
8873400	8877400	Think about all the world peace you could buy with $1500. It's a lot.
8877400	8882400	Screw world peace. I want a damn shiny new electronic.
8882400	8885400	That's what Google Glass is.
8885400	8886400	It's world peace?
8886400	8888400	No, it's a shiny new electronic.
8888400	8894400	Well, not in the form of Google Glass, is what I'm saying.
8894400	8897400	I want an Xbox One over Google Glass.
8897400	8901400	Alright, we're going to go and open up the Skype line, y'all.
8901400	8908400	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8908400	8910400	And the phone is already ringing.
8910400	8912400	Oh, they just disappeared.
8912400	8915400	Somebody else is calling, so let's go to the next call.
8915400	8918400	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8918400	8919400	Hello?
8919400	8923400	Hello? Bienvenidos a OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8923400	8925400	Yo soy Mateo.
8925400	8927400	Is this Grandpa?
8927400	8928400	Is this Hoard House?
8928400	8931400	No, this is not Hoard House. This is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8931400	8934400	Ah, shit. My bad. Where's the end call button?
8934400	8936400	Grandpa?
8936400	8937400	Rob Roberts.
8937400	8942400	What are you up to? Why aren't you here with everybody else?
8942400	8943400	I wasn't invited.
8943400	8944400	Yes, you were. You're always invited.
8944400	8945400	Why don't you ever come visit me?
8945400	8946400	Yeah, why do you hate me?
8946400	8947400	Why don't you ever come visit me?
8947400	8952400	You and Jamie were going to come down and visit me in San Francisco, but then you abandoned me.
8952400	8954400	I actually had my first day of work.
8954400	8956400	She started Cool Job.
8956400	8961400	Jamie, your excuse is acceptable. Rob Roberts, no.
8961400	8966400	Well, to what do we owe this phone call tonight? Do you want to talk about video games?
8966400	8968400	Is there something in the news you'd like to talk about?
8968400	8974400	Well, there was a major game that was played today that was a shit show for Denver Broncos.
8974400	8977400	Oh, was that the Puppy Bowl?
8977400	8980400	No, the Kitten Bowl.
8980400	8984400	Oh, Rob, my little kumquat. No, it was the Super Bowl and it was a very, very depressing game.
8984400	8987400	I was hoping that the Broncos would avenge the loss of the Niners to the Seahawks.
8987400	8992400	If you're going to lose, don't you want to lose to the best?
8992400	8997400	No, I just made Grandpa explode from logic, everybody. Look at that.
8997400	9000400	Mind blown. No, I just want to say hi. I'm a long time listener, first time caller.
9000400	9003400	You have never called O.L.R. before, have you?
9003400	9005400	No, you never invited me to.
9005400	9009400	I invite everybody to call. Did you not hear me? Just say, what are you drinking?
9009400	9014400	I was drinking vodka orange juice. It's the only thing I have left in the house.
9014400	9016400	You know what's at my house right now?
9016400	9018400	Free willow.
9018400	9020400	Home infused vanilla vodka.
9020400	9021400	Sounds good.
9021400	9025400	And mocha vodka that I also infused and Metaxa.
9025400	9027400	Why is your elixir not all inside my mouth?
9027400	9029400	Because you're not at my house.
9029400	9031400	Why don't you guys get a room?
9031400	9033400	Party at Darth Sockra's house after the show.
9033400	9036400	Totally. Except after work tomorrow.
9036400	9041400	Now, here's the best idea. Do you take your pinkberry and pour some of that vodka goodness on top?
9041400	9043400	That sounds good.
9043400	9054400	I just want to call and say hi. I'm looking forward to seeing Rob Roberts and his entourage Tuesday night as Shane departs back to the unforgettable, hospitable land of the Midwest.
9054400	9056400	Tell everyone my personal schedule, why don't you?
9056400	9065400	Well, you said your schedule is the homosexual agenda, which means what? Breakfast at 8. Democratic posturing at 10.30.
9065400	9067400	NPR for lunch.
9067400	9074400	Definitely. And then adopt a gaybee at 1.30pm. Head to Grandpa's at 5.30.
9074400	9080400	Alright. Do you want to plug your other little... I know you cannot leave this show until you plug your other little project.
9080400	9082400	It's like you know me.
9082400	9083400	I know.
9083400	9093400	Well, I wanted to. I wanted to make a continuous plug to my up and coming, well one episode anyway, project called the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.
9093400	9095400	It's a Star Trek podcast you hope doesn't fail.
9095400	9097400	There better be lots of DS9.
9097400	9098400	What's that?
9098400	9100400	There better be lots of DS9.
9101400	9113400	We were a little Star Trek Online Voyager heavy this last time, but all three hosts. We've got Lieutenant Commander Eddie who's been on Orange Lounge Radio in yesteryears and Dr. Ken who's been on Hoard House before.
9113400	9122400	We all have our different favorite series and we do talk about them, so check us out. We've only got one episode under our belt. It is a project. We're a little rough around the edges.
9122400	9128400	We're not as refined and Caviar-esque as Orange Lounge Radio after two decades.
9128400	9130400	I was like, this is episode 538.
9130400	9132400	We are totally whale eggs here.
9132400	9136400	If you listen to episode one, it was a hot ass mess. Episode one was a hot ass mess.
9136400	9138400	I had a migraine and passed out after the show.
9138400	9140400	Yeah, but...
9140400	9143400	Damn, and you're still going at it almost 12 years later.
9143400	9147400	I took two days off and lived in the Harry Potter closet in a gay frat house.
9147400	9156400	Before the other boys got here, I was just sitting here with Dark Sire before the show going, Dark Sire, that's 538 weeks we've been sitting here doing this show. It's so crazy.
9156400	9160400	Plus your vacations, plus or minus, all that. It might be more like 600.
9160400	9168400	Alright, Grandpa, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go so we can get more calls because I know there's other people trying to get through, but thanks for calling and everybody listen to Hoard House on Wednesday, alright?
9168400	9170400	Can I at least give the website where to go to?
9170400	9172400	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9172400	9174400	Jesus. I can't take you anywhere.
9174400	9176400	Sorry you're not on iTunes.
9176400	9178400	Jesus doesn't have internet.
9179400	9193400	Right now, before we get to iTunes, go to Facebook.com slash Starboard Power Coupling. You'll find questions and things to get involved with as well as the first episodes, so check us out and we look forward to your feedback and hopefully many, many more episodes on a podcast.
9193400	9197400	That's Starboard Power Coupling.
9197400	9199400	You say it so freaking fast.
9199400	9203400	Get on iTunes and all that crap.
9203400	9205400	It's my project tonight, actually.
9205400	9206400	Alright.
9206400	9207400	Fine, I'll get off your line now.
9207400	9208400	Great. Bye.
9208400	9209400	Bye.
9209400	9218400	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Tech2030 in the chatroom saying, is there anywhere to listen to really old episodes of OLR?
9218400	9221400	Uh, yes.
9221400	9224400	Let's go to the phones.
9224400	9234400	I don't like to give it out because it was such a different show. Ask Dart Tetsuya. He's in the chatroom and he has the link to the archive for the really die hard, but I just, I always get the footnote.
9234400	9241400	It was a mess in the beginning, but it was a good way. I'm proud of it, but it was just very different. Don't expect to hear what you hear now.
9241400	9244400	Alright, we're going to go to the phones and take another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9244400	9248400	Uh, Dave. Holy crap, I actually just got through.
9248400	9253400	Holy crap! I know it is kind of hard to get through the show sometimes. What's up, Dave?
9254400	9270400	Uh, not much. Just finished up dropping my brother off at UMass Amherst and I have told myself for probably the last like three months I would call in and say something and I just would always end up busy on Sunday nights.
9270400	9278400	Well, here you are, Puppy Bowl Sunday. You made it on what's actually a pretty crowded show. What do you want to talk about? What's up?
9278400	9290400	Uh, well, I want to start off with one question for you guys. I've kind of polled my friends who play video games and it seems like I'm alone on this. Do any of you guys ever get motion sick playing first person-
9290400	9294400	Yes. Here we go. Yes. Absolutely.
9294400	9307400	Because, like, I've got a PS4 and I've got Battlefield 4 with it and I can basically only play half the game. I have to play with a friend of mine and we sort of switch off where he does all the gunfights and I just fly jets. That's all I do.
9308400	9320400	I get super motion sick on a lot of games, not just first person games. Katamari Damacy makes me sick, which sucks because I love the game. Um, Mass Effect used to make me sick. Actually, all of the Mako missions make me really nauseous.
9320400	9330400	You have some interesting particulars about that, though. Like, if you, and I mean, it's just the way it is. I'm not trying to, like, make fun or make light of the situation, but it's just interesting how you've kind of learned what does and what doesn't trigger it.
9330400	9337400	Like, didn't you say that Mass Effect, part of the reason you're okay with that is because it's third person, not first person? Exactly. That's a big difference?
9337400	9346400	Exactly. If I have a character on the screen, then I'm not as likely to get motion sick because it gives me a different focus, but sometimes I get motion sick in multiplayer.
9346400	9356400	And you can play Doom and 3D games that were, like, sprite based, right? Yes, but sometimes they still make me motion sick, depending. Depending. But for the most part, I was fine with them.
9356400	9365400	Sonic Adventure made me motion sick. Dave, is it just these new games that are doing it to you? Like, are the games getting too real and that's the problem?
9365400	9385400	Yeah, it's like, you know, when I was in high school, me and my friends would play Counter-Strike all the time, and I never had a problem with that. But my friends tried to get me into Black Ops 2, and it's just something about the fact that they just want to try and simulate being a person in the game and having all that screen shake and the explosions and the suppression,
9385400	9391400	where my brain goes, this isn't real, this isn't happening, so I'm going to make you vomit now.
9391400	9394400	How big is the TV that you play on?
9394400	9402400	I play on anything from the 25-inch IPS monitor in my bedroom all the way up to a 60-inch plasma in my friend's place.
9402400	9411400	Do you think that might be part of the problem? Because when you play on a monitor, you're usually sitting up really close, so it's almost just as big as a 60-inch TV in some ways. Do you think that could be the issue?
9411400	9418400	I don't know, because usually I get more motion sick on the bigger TVs than I do on my own monitor.
9418400	9430400	I actually get more motion sick the lower the resolution is on the screen I'm using, like for example on our old 32-inch Toshiba, and it was a full CRT everything.
9430400	9444400	I would watch Dan play Goldeneye on Nintendo 64, and I've thrown up watching him play that game before, but I've gone back and watched emulated playthroughs from a computer and haven't been as sick.
9445400	9468400	The thing I've kind of settled on that I've accepted as an answer for myself is that something about gunfights in some of these games with all the screen movement that's going on, when things change really, really quickly in front of my eyes in some of these video games, it just doesn't seem to sit right with my head, whereas I can fly the jets around in Battlefield 4 no problem.
9468400	9475400	Let me ask you another question. When you see polygon clipping, does that make your head hurt?
9477400	9480400	Could you tell me what that actually is first?
9480400	9495400	It's when the collision doesn't hit for two items, and one polygon will go through another one, and I'm not talking about so much as like seeing someone's arm go through the wall, but when you actually see the other side of the polygon that your house looks to.
9495400	9499400	Oh, when you can see the other level or the other side of the level, stuff like that.
9499400	9502400	This happens in Minecraft a lot, I notice.
9502400	9504400	Yeah, okay, I know what you're talking about now.
9504400	9505400	Does that affect you?
9505400	9507400	That doesn't really bother me, no.
9507400	9522400	See, that affects me. That's why part of my problem is with the first Sonic Adventures, there was a lot of camera issues with the polygons, and it would be just for a moment like my head would shut down, and then when it was gone, I was better.
9522400	9527400	It's just a really weird thing, but I have issues with depth perception, too.
9527400	9539400	Well, sadly, Dave, I can't sit here and come up with solutions for you. I think that's something you might have to actually bring up with the doctor, and I think a lot of it could just be, you know, you gotta look away more often and take more breaks.
9539400	9544400	I know I cannot watch an entire 3D movie in the theater without looking away from the screen every few minutes.
9544400	9549400	Yeah, I have a problem with 3D. My problem is MS related, so maybe you have MS.
9549400	9550400	Don't say that.
9550400	9556400	I'm saying my problem is definitely related to that, so I can't do 3D.
9556400	9563400	Okay, that was like WebMD diagnosing you right now. WebMD always tells you, you got cancer, sorry. You got a cough? Oh, it's probably cancer.
9563400	9565400	And mine may be related to autism.
9565400	9576400	But just, you aren't alone, Dave. I see in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, 5th Dream says, I do. I do very much. Killzone kicked my ass. Some bother me more than others.
9577400	9583400	Chris109 says, Killzone was fun, but yeah, I had two or three dizziness. 5th Dream says, serious Sam was pretty bad.
9583400	9588400	5th Dream says, the odd thing is I've noticed I get really motion sick when I'm looking for something.
9588400	9594400	If I'm just running and shooting and stuff, I'm better than if I'm trying to find an objective or an item that searching makes me really sick.
9594400	9597400	Yeah, that happens to me too. But two more really quick things.
9597400	9598400	Yeah, of course.
9599400	9613400	One, to answer what Dark Soccer was saying earlier about why do celebrities kind of get the pass on doing stupid things or, you know, why are they put on this pedestal when they pass away.
9613400	9626400	I think that for a lot of people, it's that this person has contributed something to their life, whereas the random guy on the street who would otherwise just be a junkie really hasn't.
9628400	9633400	I still kind of see that, but I still believe there's a lot of double standard in place.
9633400	9638400	I think Dark Soccer comes from the place of why don't we show compassion the same.
9638400	9646400	I mean, I think you get why people might feel that connection with celebrities when we see them fall or whatever, but it's like, why don't we have that same compassion, I guess would be the same.
9646400	9654400	Yeah, I really think that's it. I think that society as a whole needs to stop being as judgmental and look at every individual life as something that's important.
9655400	9656400	You know, funny story.
9656400	9657400	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
9657400	9659400	Go ahead, X for real quick and then we'll let Dave finish.
9659400	9664400	Somebody back when I was going to school in college told me that I looked like Seymour Hoffman.
9664400	9666400	Oh, that's going to make you feel really good today.
9666400	9669400	Well, I wonder if he looked like me when he was killed over.
9669400	9670400	Stop it.
9670400	9672400	You are a bad person.
9672400	9674400	Okay, you were saying, Dave.
9674400	9675400	Dave, please finish your thought.
9675400	9686400	But the very last thing, this is just sort of a technical thing I've noticed because I started listening to this show probably like April of last year on the way back from a White Mountains camping trip.
9686400	9687400	Nice.
9688400	9696400	But I don't know kind of how you guys have the volume set up between the microphones, whether there's multiple or not.
9696400	9710400	But something I've noticed because I usually listen to this in my car or on my laptop is that Jamie's voice is, you know, compared to someone like, let's say, Jason, who has a bassier voice, it's much, much louder.
9710400	9713400	So I keep on doing this thing where I'm like, oh, Jason's talking, I have to turn the volume on.
9713400	9716400	And then Jamie comes on, I have to turn the volume down.
9716400	9718400	It might have to do with pitch.
9718400	9720400	We try to balance the mics best we can.
9720400	9722400	But unfortunately, we are using hand mics.
9722400	9724400	I don't have a studio set up.
9724400	9729400	We don't really have the finance to get the mics that are in place that pick up from where a person's sitting.
9729400	9736400	And with the hand mics, if somebody moves the hand to a different position, or I can mic balance for somebody before the show.
9736400	9744400	And not to pick on Loki because we love Loki, but Loki will give me a mic check before the show where he's talking like in his normal voice.
9744400	9747400	But then he gets really mad about Nintendo or some shit during the show.
9747400	9751400	And he gets really loud. It's like, God damn it. I didn't balance your mic for that.
9751400	9755400	So I have a friend tells me it's my Welsh blood when I get worked up, I get higher pitched.
9755400	9758400	Yeah. So sadly, it's not just you.
9758400	9764400	I am if there's sound engineers out there that have some tips, some ideas, I am I'm more than open to it.
9764400	9770400	So when you say hand mics, are you talking like the kind of microphones you would normally sing into it like karaoke?
9770400	9771400	Yeah.
9771400	9775400	I mean, I might end up donating like a blue mic to you guys.
9775400	9781400	Wow. I'm not going to have a blue mic in there. Pretty, pretty nice.
9781400	9783400	Those things are pretty neat.
9783400	9784400	All right.
9784400	9787400	I think it'll be worth it for my ears in the long run.
9787400	9789400	I'm trying not to be overly loud.
9789400	9790400	So all right.
9790400	9793400	We'll try to get our eye on it.
9793400	9795400	Thanks for taking my call. Hope you guys have a good one.
9795400	9796400	All right. Take care, buddy.
9796400	9797400	All right. Bye.
9797400	9798400	Bye.
9798400	9803400	Yeah, I do notice like if you're listening on headphones, usually it's whatever it works fine.
9803400	9808400	But if you listen in the car, I have listened to show in the car and it does kind of use notice the volume differences.
9808400	9811400	So I really try to adjust that stuff on the fly best I can.
9811400	9815400	But some things like extra first little fit he threw earlier where it got really loud.
9815400	9817400	Some things you can't foresee.
9817400	9822400	So but if there's anything we learned about that call, it's that that guy probably has MS.
9822400	9823400	Stop it.
9824400	9828400	Actually, I can I sort of get the same way with certain people's voices.
9828400	9832400	Like, for example, I can't listen to Sarah Brightman.
9832400	9833400	No, I'm serious.
9833400	9836400	Are you sure that's not just because it's it's bad or no.
9836400	9841400	Sarah Brightman's got a gorgeous voice, but she's too brassy of a soprano for me to listen to without being uncomfortable.
9841400	9845400	You know, I'm just saying as an example, sometimes pitch has a lot to do with it.
9845400	9847400	All right. Well, let's move on because we got another call on the line.
9847400	9849400	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
9849400	9850400	Hey, it's Sturlock.
9850400	9851400	Hey, Sturlock.
9851400	9852400	How are you doing?
9852400	9853400	Pretty good.
9853400	9854400	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9854400	9856400	A lot, actually.
9856400	9860400	I wanted to talk about something very, very cool that happened.
9860400	9863400	Please. You've been teasing me on Twitter all week.
9863400	9864400	Yes.
9864400	9866400	This is huge.
9866400	9874400	So Dark Sakura, as noticed, I'm sure because you added me.
9874400	9875400	Yes.
9875400	9879400	That I have taken the plunge and I am now on Steam.
9879400	9880400	Yes.
9880400	9887400	There is a very good reason for this, and it has to do with Skullgirls.
9887400	9889400	I love Skullgirls.
9889400	9890400	Isn't it great?
9890400	9891400	Yes, it is.
9892400	9903400	Well, the developer, Mike Z, has been very, very open in the community in general.
9903400	9920400	And just recently, a buddy of mine named Liren was talking to him about a lot of the text that's in the game.
9920400	9923400	Because he's blind like I am.
9923400	9932400	And he wanted to play online and get some enjoyment out of the story mode.
9933400	9953400	And basically, they came up with a method of doing this where if you set a certain option in the launcher properties or whatever it is through Steam,
9953400	9959400	that now all of the text will output directly to the clipboard.
9959400	9975400	With the end result, if you run a certain program, your screen reader will say any text that copies to the clipboard.
9975400	9986400	So now we actually have a mainstream game that is fully voiced with all of the text.
9986400	9988400	That's super useful.
9988400	9989400	Everything.
9989400	9990400	Everything.
9990400	10005400	Menu, story, like a group of us actually yesterday, we set up a Skullgirls team talk channel, and we're just hanging out.
10005400	10009400	Like five of us just doing Queen of the Hill is fucking awesome.
10009400	10014400	Wait, so this is really the first game on Steam that has that kind of accessibility option?
10014400	10016400	This is the first game, period.
10016400	10018400	That kind of shocks me.
10018400	10020400	And not in a good way.
10020400	10022400	Like, I'm really surprised that...
10022400	10023400	Sorry.
10023400	10026400	Uh oh, get the phone. Somebody knows you're on the line.
10026400	10030400	Is this just the first one that copies the clipboard?
10030400	10034400	Because I know there's other games that will talk through the subtitles for you, right?
10034400	10035400	And things like that.
10035400	10046400	But this is the first game where the developer has actively just gone out of their way to make things easier for us.
10046400	10048400	Well actually, that's not entirely true.
10048400	10057400	Because Injustice did something similar last year with the interactable objects.
10057400	10069400	But to this level, I now can do anything that anybody else would do.
10069400	10074400	I can go online, I can set up a lobby with no trouble whatsoever.
10074400	10076400	It's amazing.
10076400	10081400	That's awesome news. I'm really happy to hear it.
10081400	10084400	Especially a game that has such a following like Skullgirls does.
10084400	10090400	That's really neat that you can kind of be a part of that officially now, so to speak.
10090400	10092400	Yeah, so I immediately...
10092400	10097400	Oh, by the way, for blind, setting up Steam is a fucking pain in the ass.
10097400	10099400	So maybe Valve needs to take some cues, huh?
10099400	10102400	Oh my god. I mean, it's doable, but oh my god.
10102400	10105400	Let me ask this question. We're a little pressed for time, so I'm going to wrap up here in a minute.
10105400	10111400	But let me ask this question, because I've got at least one game developer here in the room, and I know we have others that listen.
10111400	10116400	What would you say to all the game developers out there of the world and so forth?
10116400	10122400	How can they best help you play or experience their stuff?
10122400	10126400	What can they do to help you out, to help you enjoy video games?
10126400	10128400	Sound design is a big thing.
10129400	10132400	Keeping up in mind, I guess, too.
10132400	10135400	Don't forget about me type of thing.
10135400	10139400	Not to say people do, just to be clear, but you know, just, you know.
10139400	10145400	Yeah, but like, I don't know. I think if you're going to...
10145400	10152400	I think it's really important to have, and I know this isn't really possible in a lot of cases, but...
10153400	10160400	With the Skullgirls thing, they were basically chatting on like IRC, and were having just an open dialogue.
10160400	10166400	It was like, how can we do this kind of thing? What would be the easiest way?
10166400	10169400	Right. Start a dialogue. Talk about it. Sounds good.
10169400	10174400	And it was really easy for him to set up, apparently, too. It only took like a couple days.
10174400	10176400	Oh, that's awesome.
10176400	10181400	Oh, by the way, is not... Oh, um...
10181400	10185400	I'll have to kick your ass in Skullgirls at some point, Jamie.
10185400	10186400	We'll see if that happens.
10186400	10189400	I don't know. Bring it. I think we'll bring it.
10189400	10195400	Also, I wanted to give you a link to a good Mortal Kombat video.
10195400	10196400	Okay.
10196400	10200400	If you search for Tato Salad, finish him.
10200400	10202400	I'm afraid of what I'm going to see.
10202400	10205400	Oh my god, it is the funniest shit ever.
10206400	10207400	Uh-oh.
10207400	10209400	I don't know. Five dollar foot long thing.
10209400	10210400	Five dollar foot long was pretty good.
10210400	10211400	Yeah.
10211400	10212400	Alright.
10212400	10213400	This is great.
10213400	10219400	Alright, let me... Tato Salad, finish him. I'm looking it up right now. Let's see what happens.
10219400	10220400	This looks scary.
10220400	10222400	It's by GoPotatoTV.
10222400	10225400	Yep, I see it. I see it. Let's see. I'm trying to see if there's an ad or something.
10225400	10229400	Okay, no. Here we go. I'm going to play a little bit. If this is awful, I'm holding you responsible.
10230400	10231400	It's epic.
10232400	10234400	It's like fake animation or something.
10237400	10238400	You've seen this game?
10238400	10239400	Finish him.
10239400	10240400	Wait.
10240400	10244400	Before you do that, massage him.
10246400	10247400	Massage him?
10247400	10250400	You dare defy the great Shao Kahn?
10250400	10251400	You gotta play this whole thing.
10251400	10254400	Oh, this is too long. It's three minutes. I can't play the whole thing.
10254400	10255400	I'll watch it when I get home.
10255400	10256400	Yeah, maybe.
10256400	10257400	We'll have to look at it later.
10257400	10258400	Massage him.
10258400	10260400	Alright. Alright, fine.
10260400	10263400	And then what? Then it's make out with him? Kiss him?
10263400	10264400	Is this good?
10264400	10265400	Yep.
10265400	10266400	Oh, gosh.
10266400	10268400	Loosen up those muscles. Oh, you're so tense.
10268400	10271400	Alright, alright, alright, alright. I gotta go wrap up the show.
10271400	10272400	Maybe we'll make this a fortune cookie later.
10272400	10273400	You're turning this into pornography.
10273400	10276400	Yes, that is definitely fortune cookie material.
10276400	10278400	Didn't even take Extrovert to do that.
10278400	10281400	Alright, take care, buddy. Thanks for letting us know about that. That's a really cool change.
10281400	10282400	Yeah, alright. Thanks.
10282400	10283400	Alright, take care.
10283400	10284400	Yeah, you too.
10284400	10285400	Bye.
10285400	10286400	Bye.
10286400	10289400	Alright, sadly, I think that is going to do it for calls tonight.
10289400	10295400	I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but we are trying to wrap up here about midnight, East Coast time, nine o'clock, West Coast tonight.
10295400	10300400	So, we're going to wrap up. That's about it for the show tonight.
10300400	10303400	I do want to ask real quick, are there any last minute stories?
10303400	10307400	I don't know if Dark Sakura has anything or... Oh, I know what I'll ask about.
10307400	10313400	Before the show, Matt, you were telling me something about EVE Online that we never brought up, and I thought it was really funny.
10313400	10320400	Well, I don't know the exact details, but I was just reading on through the news, and they apparently had a really huge epic battle.
10320400	10322400	I heard about this, yeah.
10322400	10339400	In EVE, and since EVE has an exchange rate where you could buy in-game currency with real dollars, you could actually calculate how much monies, how much real value worth of stuff have been destroyed in that gigantic war.
10339400	10342400	And I think it was like priced over $200,000.
10342400	10344400	Damn.
10344400	10351400	That's a lot. I can't believe there's that much money sunk into that game. I don't hear about a lot of people playing EVE, but I guess so.
10351400	10360400	Alright, quickly, I do want to mention this, because TigerClaud messaged me this, and I thought it was worth mentioning, because a lot of you guys like your Sony franchises.
10360400	10367400	There's a new Sly Cooper movie being made, and it's being directed by Kevin Munro, who made the TD Mutant Ninja Turtles CGI movie, for better or worse.
10367400	10369400	Hey, I like that.
10369400	10375400	Yeah, alright, well then maybe you'll like the Sly Cooper. They did announce that. They've got a little teaser trailer out there on the internet.
10375400	10380400	And yeah, it's being made, and it's slated for release in 2016, and in 3D.
10380400	10385400	So, very cool. There's a teaser trailer out there on Twitter, and all that if you want to check it out.
10385400	10392400	I'm gonna see real quick if we have Twitter topics.
10395400	10398400	I know this is really interesting radio.
10399400	10405400	Well, in the meanwhile, I will serenade our listeners with... actually, I'm not gonna.
10405400	10412400	That's actually really it. I don't really see a lot of tweets tonight, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up. That's it. No tweets.
10412400	10413400	Ribbons and bows?
10413400	10423400	Yeah. BlackWolf does want to clarify, though, there isn't that much money sunk into EVE. That's if you converted all the in-game money into how much it would cost to buy a Plex.
10423400	10428400	Not all that money that was lost was once real money. Some was earned in-game.
10428400	10432400	Anyhow, so we're gonna go ahead and wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
10432400	10435400	DarkSoccer, I know you're trying to leave because you've got work in the morning, but...
10435400	10437400	Yeah, but this will change in two weeks when I'm on my other schedule.
10437400	10440400	Woohoo! So, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10440400	10442400	I wish I could have ramen.
10442400	10444400	Ramen sounds good, doesn't it?
10444400	10445400	Yeah, but I can't.
10445400	10447400	We might not end up having that tonight anyway, so we'll see.
10447400	10448400	Okay.
10448400	10449400	We'll see.
10449400	10450400	Bye!
10451400	10456400	I'm gonna say, as always, thank you very much for downloading our show. Thank you for tuning in. Really appreciate it.
10456400	10463400	All we ask, you know, we don't charge for the show, so just tell a friend or five or twenty about the show. Help spread the word.
10463400	10473400	Reviews go a long way as well. If you wouldn't mind leaving us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio's website, those go an awful, awful long way and we really, really appreciate it.
10473400	10478400	Going around and saying goodbye to our guests. Shane, thanks for coming all the way from Kansas to be here.
10478400	10479400	You're welcome.
10479400	10482400	We didn't really say a whole lot besides one really tasteless thing, but that's okay.
10482400	10486400	What? There was nothing tasteless about talking about Power Rangers.
10486400	10488400	Um, we'll come back sometime.
10488400	10489400	Maybe.
10489400	10492400	Alright. And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
10492400	10493400	Go away.
10493400	10498400	Why would you s- How rude! You go away.
10498400	10500400	I'm about to once we end the show.
10500400	10501400	You go away for five years.
10501400	10502400	We can go eat.
10502400	10506400	Alright. Uh, Xtafer, I hope you had fun. You've been wanting to crush the show for a while.
10506400	10508400	I did. I had a lot of fun. It's been fun.
10508400	10511400	It's been a long time. Do you have final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10511400	10519400	Uh, I want to have raw men.
10519400	10521400	You're so weird.
10521400	10524400	That's great. That's great, Xtafer. I know, thanks.
10524400	10526400	Listen to Hoard House. Thank you, Shane.
10526400	10528400	Alright. Because Ra-Ma made that sticker.
10528400	10529400	What?
10529400	10531400	Because Ra-Ma made that sticker. I forget. Alright.
10531400	10534400	Alright. Uh, Matt, thank you very much for being here.
10534400	10539400	And, uh, I apologize for the behavior of the other two guests you had to be on the show with tonight.
10539400	10541400	I've just really been awful. I'm sorry.
10541400	10544400	He loves me no matter what.
10544400	10546400	But you were a lot of fun to have on the show.
10546400	10547400	Oh, thank you.
10547400	10552400	Thank you for, um, some of the, um, candid discussion earlier about development and everything. Appreciate it.
10552400	10554400	All you need is a piece of paper and a dream.
10554400	10559400	Yeah. I mean, I encourage anyone to continue to pursue game design if that's your dream.
10559400	10560400	Awesome.
10561400	10564400	I must be doing really well because I have a Moleskine book in my purse.
10564400	10566400	A big imagination. No, I'm kidding.
10566400	10569400	Alright, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10569400	10571400	Just play some Rocksmith 2014.
10571400	10574400	Sounds good. Will do.
10574400	10576400	Alright, that's gonna do it for our show tonight.
10576400	10578400	Thank you everybody for tuning in.
10578400	10580400	Uh, we're out of here until next week.
10580400	10582400	Loki's tentatively back next week.
10582400	10585400	Uh, Jason might be back for one more week next week.
10585400	10587400	So it'll be kind of the usual suspects.
10587400	10590400	And we'll have fun with whatever should come up in the news.
10590400	10594400	In the meantime, have a lot of fun gaming and, uh, don't be a jerk to each other.
10594400	10597400	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
10617400	10619400	See you next week.
10647400	10650400	Thanks for watching!
