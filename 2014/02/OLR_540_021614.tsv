0	17960	This week, Nintendo News continues as one highly anticipated title gets a release date.
17960	21840	Trademark news involving the creators of Candy Crush Saga continues with a recent accusation
21840	23000	of intellectual property theft.
23000	24760	If it's not one game, it's another.
24760	32000	All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32000	34920	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34920	36680	where every gamer has a voice.
36680	45600	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 540 for February the 16th, 2014.
45600	49540	My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games
49540	53980	and video gaming, the gamer culture, gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio
53980	54980	with me as always.
54980	57420	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57420	58420	Sup bitches.
58420	59700	Hey, how you doing?
59700	60700	That's going to be my thing now.
60700	61740	I'm just going to do sup bitches.
61740	62740	I think so.
62740	63740	I think so.
63740	67420	So I was admiring your shirt earlier because you have this really rad shirt and I know
67420	69460	it's a radio show so I was like, hey everybody, look at Jamie.
69460	70460	I'll put a picture up.
70460	71460	But I'll describe it.
71460	75540	It's basically like an old school NES cover, specifically like Excitebike.
75540	80620	You know, they all had the, but it's Pee Wee Herman riding his bicycle and it says Adventure
80620	81620	Bike.
81620	82620	I love it.
82660	84420	From the Loner Rebels series.
84420	85420	Yeah.
85420	86900	I loved Pee Wee's Big Adventure.
86900	89340	There was another one over here.
89340	91180	So instead of Nintendo, it's, you are, but what am I?
91180	92180	I know you are, but what am I?
92180	93180	Infinity.
93180	94180	I know you are, but what am I?
94180	95180	I know you are, but what am I?
95180	96180	Knock it off.
96180	97180	Cut it out.
97180	98180	I love it.
98180	99180	So instead of Nintendo, it says Infinity.
99180	101180	I know you are, but what am I?
101180	102180	I know you are, but what am I?
102180	103180	Infinity.
103180	104180	Yeah.
104180	105180	I need to watch that movie again.
105180	106180	No way.
106180	107180	Stop it.
107180	108180	Cut it out.
108180	110940	Um, uh, but you said that shirt's no longer available.
111140	114540	I don't remember where Dan got it from, but it was like one of those one day sale things.
114540	115900	I mean, it could come up again.
115900	120900	I don't know, but they do like a different, it's almost like shirt.woot except, um, they
120900	125340	don't bring them back that you can pay five bucks more and order them later.
125340	128060	So, um, here's, here's a random question.
128060	129340	It's well, oh, go ahead.
129340	133220	One thing it's fun that I work in a place with like mostly dudes and they're like looking
133220	138260	at my boobs to see Pee Wee Herman and I'm like, um, I feel uncomfortable now.
138260	143100	I'm going to go with my cubicle and hug my weighted companion cube until I feel better.
143100	146700	Here's my random question and I'll, I'll introduce of course, Loki in a minute here, but starting
146700	151140	with you for this and of course our live chatters at live.vog network.com where we do tape live
151140	155100	every Wednesday or every Sunday night, excuse me, at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
155100	156980	right after the Bobby black will show.
156980	162740	Um, my question, since we're talking about your, your top, um, do you have a favorite,
162740	167400	do you have a favorite piece of gaming clothing, like game related clothing?
167400	171560	Cause I'll tell you mine and it always gets comments too is that hoodie I have with the
171560	175720	tanuki Mario on it where with the hoodie actually has the little raccoon ears on it.
175720	179040	I always like, what is that 35 year old man doing wearing a hoodie?
179040	184520	Well, I super love my N seven hoodie just because like now if I wear it at work, people
184520	186720	get it.
186720	191080	And I've, I've actually finally hit the point where I stopped keeping count of all of the
191080	197640	shepherd references I get at work because it's like I hit 30 and then I stopped cause
197640	199600	there's that guy that I meet in the hallway every day.
199600	202160	He's like, sup shepherd.
202160	205280	And I'm like, this is my favorite hallway in the Citadel.
205280	206280	I want coffee.
206280	207280	Nice.
207280	213320	But yeah, that's the good thing about working at a, um, for, uh, at the land of cubicles
213320	214320	and tech.
214320	215320	There you go.
215320	219400	Well look, I, he's, he's been sitting there very patiently and I, I think that's the five
219400	222040	minutes of silence from this man's, uh, too many.
222040	228000	Say hello everybody to tech master Loki on the Skype line tonight.
228000	229000	Do we have a tech?
229000	230000	Are you muted Loki?
230000	231000	Or did he go?
231000	233920	No, my, my key, my, uh, my new, uh, touch pad's really sensitive.
233920	237800	So like I tap it and it's all unmute, mute, unmute, mute.
237800	239920	I was a little worried there for a minute.
239920	242120	I was like, well, this is going to be awkward.
242120	243760	No, no, no.
243760	247480	It's, it's, it's been a weekend, I guess.
247480	248480	It has been a weekend.
248560	252400	And all right, look, I'm, I'm dying because some of the listeners have seen your tweets.
252400	256600	You've got to tell us about why you're having technical issues tonight and so forth and,
256600	257600	and how this all started.
257600	258600	Loki.
258600	261520	Well, I tried to play Titanfall on Friday, right?
261520	264280	You know, I downloaded it at work and I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to totally play it.
264280	270320	So I played it at lunch and you know, my laptop, I've done a lot of modifications to it, you
270320	278200	know, because it was an old ACES gaming laptop and it was, they're basically infamous that
278200	283600	model of being very terrible as far as heat efficiency goes.
283600	287760	And so it got to the point from playing Titanfall, I only went through the tutorial, I didn't
287760	288760	even get into a match.
288760	295720	I started a match and then I could tell that the graphics card was overheating a lot.
295720	301520	And you know, I was actually, I touched the top of the laptop, I'm like, ow, that is really
301520	302520	hot.
302520	307220	And so I just, you know, shut the thing down and you know, I was like, okay, I really need
307240	312100	to play with my cooling pad and because I have a souped up cooling pad that I made.
312100	315020	And so I was like, okay, I'm not going to play this anymore until I get that cooling
315020	316020	pad.
316020	323340	So, you know, yesterday I was playing Titanfall a little bit and had my cooling pad and you
323340	326300	know, I was just checking to make sure it still got hot.
326300	331480	So I shut it off again, updated my graphics drivers and then put a temperature monitor
331480	334580	thing on there so I could see how hot it was getting and ran it again.
334580	338940	And it wasn't getting that hot anymore because, you know, it seemed like it would, the new
338940	340740	drivers kind of did the trick.
340740	345380	So I was like, okay, cool, done that, I'm going to shut my laptop down for the night.
345380	352100	And so I flipped the screen down, which would put it in sleep and 20 minutes later it still
352100	353100	hadn't shut off yet.
353100	358840	And I was like, okay, what the hell, you know, so I had to force it off and so I held down
358840	363980	the power button to force it off, tried to turn it back on again, doesn't see the hard
364020	367020	drive anymore.
367020	372100	And when I went to go load like, you know, okay, I'm going to load the windows disk and
372100	376860	see if I can maybe recover the drive and stuff, there's just all sorts of graphical glitches
376860	381380	like that, that GPU is toast, is just damaged.
381380	385700	So the Titanfall beta was so awesome it literally melted faces.
385700	391820	Yeah, or at least GPUs, but you know what, to be honest, it's, I'm not surprised, that
391820	399820	laptop, like I said, is very, it just wasn't meant for, you know, that awesome game, I
399820	400820	guess.
400820	403580	So I had to get a new laptop, so I have a new laptop now.
403580	407340	It's kind of funny to me though, because I'm really surprised, you kind of took it in good
407340	409420	stride with a good sense of humor.
409420	413060	But there was a lot of people on Twitter this week about that Titanfall beta that were like,
413060	418100	how could EA release such a like crappy, you know, like, I guess it's still, I don't know,
418100	420980	when I played it, I didn't notice a lot of bugs or anything like that.
421020	424020	Like it just, it seemed like the game was ready to go to me, but I guess other people
424020	425260	have been running into issues.
425260	427700	You had your laptop melt, literally.
427700	432020	And here's the thing, it's based off the source engine, and I had, it wasn't like I was running
432020	436620	like super ultra or something, it was all low, because it like, my GPU is so old and
436620	441860	that it's like a Nvidia 360M or something, it was like a really old one, and it couldn't
441860	442860	run crap.
442860	448300	So I was like, okay, all low settings, and it was fine, and when it ran, it just ran
448340	449340	really hot.
449340	453700	And it's really strange though, because I've run pretty graphically intensive games before,
453700	455500	and I've never had it overheat.
455500	460780	I mean, like I said, I built a custom, I've done so many cooling modifications to that,
460780	468780	I reset the, I put new thermal paste on everything, I literally have the bottom cut open to let
468780	476140	more air flow in, I built a, you know, a cooling pad that has two 120mm fans in there that
476140	477140	are running high.
477140	483820	I have the throttle on the fan that's in the actual laptop cut so that it runs high all
483820	484820	the time.
484820	491340	So, you know, the fact that it still overheated everything, and that's the weird thing is
491340	496660	when it locked up, it wasn't like it was overheating again, I think that's just that first time
496660	499740	that it got so hot that something got damaged in there.
499740	500740	Huh.
500740	506460	So now, did you submit that feedback to EA?
506460	512180	I haven't gotten a chance to, because like I said, my laptop's been down, but I got a
512180	519860	new Asus though, and now it's an AMD quad core with a, I guess it's a lot newer of a
519860	530300	graphics card, it's an 8670M with 2GB of dedicated graphics RAM, or video RAM, and it's a native
530340	534860	1080p screen, it's like a 15 inch I think.
534860	541020	So the only problem is, and why you didn't see me on Skype earlier, is it's running Windows
541020	542740	8.1.
542740	549720	I fucking hate Windows 8.1, because it's like, it's all, we're having trouble connecting
549720	550720	to the internet.
550720	555680	I'm like, why the fuck, okay, so I downloaded Firefox just fine, I'm like, how the hell
555680	559900	did it, I can't connect to the internet, yeah I downloaded Firefox.
559900	561900	How is that fucking possible?
561900	567940	And then I go into my settings, oh, we disabled your WiFi card, what the fuck are you doing?
567940	569740	It's just so messed up.
569740	572400	Yeah I hate Windows 8.1, so.
572400	575440	So what are you talking to us now from, if you don't have a laptop?
575440	581760	No I have a laptop, I got it working, I figured out that it disabled my WiFi, so I turned
581760	582760	it back on.
582760	583760	Okay, there you go.
583760	587460	Yeah, so I have my new laptop that I'm talking to you from right now.
588020	591020	You did end up having to buy a new laptop, it's not like you fixed the other one.
591020	592780	No there's no fixing that one.
592780	593780	Okay, fair enough.
593780	597100	Well I'm going to, you know what's funny is that right now, this particular portion's
597100	601140	only going to be heard on the podcast, because we cannot, we lost connection with the live
601140	607400	feed that broadcast our show, and it seems like Titanfall may have melted our host for
607400	611780	VOG Network as well, we're not able to broadcast right now, and a lot of our chatters are complaining
611780	612780	about it.
612780	616200	But some of the comments that did get through before it went down, Tigerclaw says, no matter
616200	621440	what they say, laptops are no, nor mentioned for high end gaming.
621440	625040	Laptops are so thin that there isn't room for cooling the GPU inside it.
625040	628000	It's got a little fan and that wouldn't be enough to cool it down.
628000	633460	Yeah, it's not, and that's why like I said, I literally had the bottom, I had drilled
633460	637640	holes in the bottom of the laptop to where the heat pipe was, and I had air blowing in
637640	640480	on it, but yeah, it was still toasty.
640480	644720	But I would think that they would have something built in place that like, okay it's getting
644720	652840	too hot, let's throttle the card back, because I've had that in my other, my PC had that,
652840	654840	so I don't know.
654840	658880	It might not have even been that, it could have been that the GPU's just, well the GPU's
658880	664540	not fine, but it, I don't know what exactly it damaged, and to figure it out I could buy
664540	669540	a new drive and put it in there and I might get Windows running again, but still that
669540	675620	graphics card's got damage to it, and even if I replaced that, it would just by that
675620	679900	time might as well buy a new laptop.
679900	682840	Do you use desktops at all, or do you only have laptops at home?
682840	687680	I only have a laptop because I've taken apart my desktop, it's so old now that I can't really
687680	693100	run anything on it, so I just run on my laptop now.
693100	697540	There you go, well at least we got our live listeners back, so that whole thing unmelted
697540	698540	there, that was really weird.
699540	703820	Usually if we had the live listeners get dropped, it's back in like literally 10 seconds, but
703820	705900	we lost them for almost a full two minutes.
705900	711320	That sucks, but that's just the joy of live radio, right?
711320	714860	Before we get into our quick kickoff topic tonight, Loki, I want to ask you the same
714860	717520	question I asked ARK Soccer a minute ago about clothes.
717520	722600	Do you have a favorite like gaming, you know, shirt or hoodie or something that you like
722600	723600	to wear?
723600	724600	The tingle costume?
724600	726600	No tingle costume.
727160	734240	No, I have a few different t-shirts, like I'm wearing my portal one right now from Woot.
734240	739320	I bought a lot of shirts from Woot, it's all about them being comfortable, and a lot of
739320	745520	the shirts, like I've bought some from Ripped and they shrank, which is annoying because
745520	746520	they keep shrinking.
746520	749560	The Woot ones for some reason though, they haven't shrunk, and that's why I kind of like
749560	750560	them.
750560	756040	My other one is my Video Game High School Season 1 Kickstarter shirt.
756040	757760	That one's super soft and comfortable.
757760	763440	But yeah, those are my favorite ones at least right now just because that's all I have.
763440	766040	I like that you're a little more practical when we talk about the favorite shirt.
766040	768200	You're like, oh well this one was the most comfortable, like it doesn't matter what was
768200	769200	on it.
769200	771240	In defense of my hoodie, it's super comfortable.
771240	776240	I had one from Ripped that was, you know, Lokeo's and stuff like that, and it shrank.
776240	779760	I was like, god damn it, now it's too damn small.
779760	783680	It looks really stupid when I wear it, but I don't know.
783720	784720	Alright.
784720	788040	Well hey, I want to do a quick kickoff topic tonight before we get into our gaming weeks
788040	793160	and everything, and maybe Lokeo in a Tingle costume will be future DLC for this.
793160	794160	This is pretty funny.
794160	797260	We just announced this on the Bobby Black Wolf show because again we tape live on Sunday
797260	802200	nights and immediately before our show, Bobby Black Wolf, he's one man over in Atlanta talking
802200	805640	about games, and if you don't know Bobby, I know many of you that listen to this show
805640	810100	listen to Bobby, but if for whatever reason you don't know Bobby, Bobby also is kind of
810100	811600	like an indie programmer.
811600	815800	He's dabbled in things in the past like doing, you know, creating music for games, and he
815800	817080	does a little bit of programming.
817080	821120	He did the VOG Network site, which is, if you've never visited, it's also kind of a
821120	825120	game in itself because you can check into shows, you know, there's a passphrase somewhere
825120	828600	in this show if you're listening on the podcast or you can actually check in live, and you
828600	830240	get points and loot.
830240	834080	It's kind of like, I think like Foursquare or Get Glue, one of those types of sites.
834080	838640	Like that whole little game is built into the website for fun, and sometimes for little,
838640	843880	just little prizes, little raffles, but because Bobby's in Atlanta, you know, they had that
843880	848960	whole lockdown this week with the snow and the ice on the roads and, you know, after
848960	852120	what had happened there a couple weeks ago, they said, everybody stay the hell home.
852120	855640	Do not, do not leave the house, do not try to drive.
855640	860600	So some people in the snow go all Jack Nicholson and The Shining and, you know, go crazy, but
860600	865280	Bobby gets programming, and what he programmed this week is a really fun little thing for
865280	866280	the site.
866920	873520	flappy.vognetwork.com, that's flappy.vognetwork.com, yes?
873520	879560	Bobby Blackwolf has unleashed flappy vog on the world, as if you weren't sick of flappy
879560	883480	bird clones, but you know what, no, this is really funny, and there are some really funny
883480	886700	flappy bird clones out there, you know, ever since they took that game down.
886700	887700	We had what?
887700	891480	We have Maverick Bird from Terry Cavana, the maker of VVVVV.
891480	892480	That one's amazing.
892480	894140	It's like very like Commodore 64 inspired.
894140	895140	It's great.
895140	899740	It might be, whatever it's called, that game is awesome.
899740	902940	And let's see, there was Flappy Burt from Sesame Street.
902940	904540	They did that.
904540	905540	Flappy Kaiden.
905540	907740	That's how, you just saw that on Tumblr, Flappy Kaiden.
907740	912820	So you know, hey, we wanted a little piece of the parody action as well and it was a
912820	916660	good way for Bobby to kind of mess around in making his first game in, I think it's
916660	920080	his first game in Unity, his first public game, anyway, over in Unity.
920080	922140	So that's really cool that Bobby did that.
922140	927820	And what's also kind of fun, you actually play the game as hosts of the various shows
927820	932580	on VoG that don't shut up because we're podcasters, we never stop talking.
932580	936340	Bobby's in there, I'm in there, Brad from PodCulture's in there, and Travis from Understation
936340	937340	Live's in there.
937340	940580	That's like the first set, but Bobby will be enhancing it in the coming days.
940580	944920	I mean, he literally did this on Wednesday until today.
944920	948060	So like those of us that couldn't get our voice samples in, because you know, like our
948060	951500	laptop's freaking melted or whatever, we're going to get in there a little later.
951500	953660	Like I know Dark Soccer's going to do some and so forth.
953660	957460	So Flappy VoG will only get bigger and better.
957460	960460	So Loki, have you been able to check out Flappy VoG yet?
960460	961900	Yeah, I did.
961900	966420	He wanted me to record some stuff for it and that was right before.
966420	967420	Right before the meltdown, right?
967420	968420	Yeah.
968420	969420	Yeah, what'd you think?
969420	973860	Pretty, I mean, it's obviously very basic, but it's cool that he whipped that together
973860	974860	in days.
974860	975860	Yeah.
975860	976860	Yeah.
976860	977860	Very cool.
978100	982260	Um, let's see, Akdeft is saying that I'm pronouncing Terry's last name wrong.
982260	983260	I apologize.
983260	984260	Kavana.
984260	985260	Kavana.
985260	986260	Kavanagh.
986260	987260	Kavanagh.
987260	988260	Kavanagh.
988260	990020	I could see pronouncing it either way.
990020	993180	Every last name needs a pronunciation guy with it there.
993180	997220	Akdeft also saying VoG's Flappy Bird will get bigger and better.
997220	1002120	GameGuru, in my response to the Jack Nicholson from The Shining response, said, Bobby did
1002120	1003120	go crazy.
1003120	1005180	He made a Flappy Bird clone.
1005500	1010180	Well, I know we're probably a little sick to death of talking about this game, but you
1010180	1011180	know what?
1011180	1015740	It's become this very strange phenomenon that a lot of people are talking about and I think
1015740	1019380	it is worth bringing up just a couple quick follow-up items here about Flappy Bird.
1019380	1023700	A, iTunes and Google Play are really starting to crack down on a lot of the clone apps that
1023700	1028980	are out there and if you look, actually if you look at the top 10 right now on iTunes
1028980	1033300	in the App Store for free stuff, like, in the top 10, three of them are Flappy Bird
1033300	1034300	clones.
1034420	1039820	The one is like the little swimmy, the cheep cheeps from Mario in their own game, so it's
1039820	1041240	very interesting there.
1041240	1046820	But why did Dong Nguyen take down Flappy Bird in the first place?
1046820	1047820	Why?
1047820	1052180	He said to an interview with Forbes, he pulled the game because, quote, it's an addictive
1052180	1053900	product.
1053900	1055540	It happened to become an addictive product.
1055540	1057740	I think it has become a problem.
1057740	1060160	My life has not been as comfortable as I was before.
1060160	1061900	I couldn't sleep.
1061900	1062900	So what do you think?
1062900	1066140	Is Flappy Bird too addicting, Loki?
1066140	1068140	Was addiction the problem?
1070140	1071140	Loki?
1072140	1073140	No idea why.
1073140	1077460	I mean, I guess he could think that people would be addicted to it, but, you know, to
1077460	1082780	be honest, I think it was just all the attention he was getting was too much for him.
1082780	1086240	He just wanted just to make a game, because if it was any other developer, they would
1086240	1090220	be happy with attention to a game like that.
1090540	1095740	DarkSakura, are we proud of the creator of Flappy Bird for having the social responsibility
1095740	1099940	to recognize that his game was too addicting and pull it down, or is this all a little
1099940	1100940	cray?
1100940	1101940	Sure.
1103940	1105940	What, you're telling me you have no opinion?
1105940	1106940	Sure.
1107940	1110820	In the end, it doesn't matter why the fuck he did it.
1110820	1111820	He did it.
1111820	1112820	He made a choice.
1112820	1113820	He did it.
1113820	1114820	Everyone else has to deal with it.
1114820	1115820	The end.
1115820	1118740	If you don't like it, tough titty.
1118740	1120220	That's a fair response.
1120220	1122420	Why do we keep trying to overanalyze this shit?
1122420	1123820	He did what he wanted to do.
1123820	1124820	Deal with it.
1124820	1125820	I know, right?
1125820	1132220	It's like, aren't there, you know, babies being abandoned in Russia and, you know, people
1132220	1133620	being shot on the street?
1133620	1135860	Yes, but we do a show about video games, DarkSakura.
1135860	1137860	I know, I know, I know.
1137860	1139940	People listen to us to escape those things.
1139940	1143820	Yeah, but in the end, does it really, really matter why he did it?
1143820	1145820	Does it?
1145900	1154500	Well, I could, one could argue that yes, because would future games possibly suffer a similar
1154500	1155500	fate?
1155500	1156500	And maybe ones that-
1156500	1157500	Maybe they should.
1157500	1160140	Maybe ones that have a little more depth than Flappy Bird.
1160140	1164220	What if Mass Effect, what if, what if the creators of Mass Effect, DarkSakura, decided
1164220	1167020	they have a social responsibility to stop-
1167020	1171220	Ha ha ha, EA social responsibility, ha ha ha ha ha.
1171220	1172220	Yeah.
1172220	1176900	EA recognized they have a social responsibility to stop Mass Effect fan fiction.
1176900	1178380	It needs to be stopped.
1178380	1180620	Nothing will stop the link.
1180620	1181700	Nothing will stop the link.
1181700	1183900	I do think it needs to be stopped.
1183900	1190180	Yeah, well, I think tacos need to be here at Rob's house.
1190180	1192180	But are they here?
1192180	1193180	No.
1193180	1196980	Alright, so there you go.
1196980	1199540	You have all caught me, by the way, in mood.
1199540	1200540	In mood?
1200540	1201540	In mood.
1201860	1203500	It will be a night of honesty.
1203500	1207500	Alright, oh, oh, you're having one of those nights like I was having a couple weeks ago.
1207500	1208500	I might be.
1208500	1211500	We're gonna do a special segment tonight, ask DarkSakura a question.
1211500	1212500	Okay, we'll do it.
1212500	1213500	Alright, maybe later, maybe later.
1213500	1214500	Alright.
1214500	1217260	Why did I get disconnected from chat?
1217260	1218980	Because, because it wanted to deal with it.
1218980	1219980	It wanted to kick you.
1219980	1220980	You know what?
1220980	1221980	It's because of your butt.
1221980	1228020	You farted or something, and it affected the internet, and it was like, you know what,
1228020	1230500	you don't get to be online.
1230500	1231500	Fuck you.
1231500	1232460	Really, internet?
1232460	1233460	Fuck you back.
1233460	1234460	Bitch.
1234460	1237540	Alright, look, DarkSakura, I am gonna ask you a question, and that question is, how
1237540	1238580	is your gaming week?
1238580	1241060	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1241060	1242060	It was really shitty.
1242060	1247140	All I've done is play Animal Crossing, and nothing else.
1247140	1249900	I really want tacos, by the way.
1249900	1251220	Are you Dunny Fire?
1251220	1252940	I just really want tacos, okay?
1252940	1255600	So don't judge me.
1255600	1262080	So yeah, I've, I played some Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, and I actually saved
1262080	1267980	a lot of the screen captures, and they're part of my desktop thing at work, at the land
1267980	1274080	of cubicles and tech, and, oh yeah, I need to go to Act Deaf's Animal Crossing town,
1274080	1277340	because I have one of those stupid petitions, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, this makes
1277340	1278340	me actually happy.
1278340	1280000	Like, for real happy.
1280000	1283040	In my village, that motherfucker, Ed, is gone.
1284040	1286280	He didn't even tell me.
1286280	1290080	Next thing I see, Isabelle's like, Ed's leaving, isn't that sad?
1290080	1292000	I'm like, no.
1292000	1293320	Fuck him.
1293320	1297640	So I planted black roses where his house was.
1297640	1300360	Did you throw a little party in town to celebrate that he finally left?
1300360	1302240	Throw a little party in my head.
1302240	1305560	Did you leave a little sign where his house used to be, going like, you know.
1305560	1306760	He's not worth leaving a sign.
1306760	1309400	I'm just planting the black roses there so that my grass will grow and I won't have to
1309400	1311360	remember he was ever there.
1311360	1312360	Fuck him.
1314040	1315040	Love it.
1315040	1316040	All right.
1316040	1318520	Alan Alchemy in chat says, you got Ed to move out.
1318520	1319520	That is huge.
1319520	1320520	Finally.
1320520	1322760	Well, I had to ignore him for what?
1322760	1323760	What was it?
1323760	1329520	Because I had him soon after I started my village and then I kept hitting him and beating
1329520	1333680	him and he apparently liked it because, you know, I guess he's a dirty horse.
1333680	1336400	So finally I just started ignoring him.
1336400	1337400	And actually-
1337400	1338760	You're a very dirty horse, Mr. Ed.
1338760	1341200	You name one, Politary, okay?
1341240	1345880	When we were playing this horse racing, at least it wasn't a horse humping game like
1345880	1346880	that other one.
1346880	1347880	For Final Furlong.
1347880	1348880	For Final Furlong.
1348880	1349880	For Furlong, yeah.
1349880	1352800	But like, fucking Ed.
1352800	1353800	I did salt the earth.
1353800	1356920	I salted and burned the bones.
1356920	1360400	And actually, oh, thank you for saying something, Queen Sumia, because she's the one who gave
1360400	1363720	me the idea to ignore him and it worked.
1363720	1370520	So thank you for, even though I'm still totally jealous that like she got rid of her Ed first.
1370560	1374760	Alan Alchemy in chat says, Dark Sakura salted the earth, quote, nothing can ever grow here
1374760	1375760	again, quote.
1375760	1377360	I think it's all a front.
1377360	1380880	I think you got Isabelle to lie for you and I think you somehow figured out how to-
1380880	1382080	I'm the mayor, fuck that.
1382080	1383880	You sent Ed to the glue factory.
1383880	1385240	You made him disappear.
1385240	1389840	I sent Ed to, um, I don't know.
1389840	1390840	All right.
1390840	1394520	No, you know why I wouldn't send Ed to the glue factory or to any type of factory?
1394520	1396120	Because he's useless.
1396120	1398320	No one's allowed to use that carcass.
1398320	1403200	Even the earth will not absorb the nutrients from this decayed corpse.
1403200	1410360	It will just lay there forever in a sludge of black decayed goo.
1410360	1411360	All right.
1411360	1416600	Next week on As the Animal Crossing Village Turns, who will Dark Sakura set her sights
1416600	1417600	on next?
1417600	1419040	No, cause I like everybody in my town now.
1419040	1425120	I have Groucho and Lobo and I have Margie and Whitney, the two that were from the anime.
1425120	1427880	I couldn't tell you shit about my Animal Crossing village.
1427880	1430920	That's because you abandoned your people when they needed you the most.
1430920	1433000	You are the worst mayor ever.
1433000	1434440	You should be ashamed of yourself.
1434440	1438640	I'm going to go hang out with that deaf now, bye.
1438640	1441800	But I'm playing Bravely Default.
1441800	1443580	You know what?
1443580	1446400	I'm mad because I want that game.
1446400	1448440	All right, Loki.
1448440	1449720	How was your- yeah, you okay over there?
1449720	1451020	We can hear all your movements.
1451020	1452200	Be careful.
1452200	1455600	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1456120	1466360	Okay, so I played Titanfall and well, that didn't work out too well.
1466360	1468800	I actually did get to check out another thing.
1468800	1474960	It was Jazzpunk and Jazzpunk is this game that's- I don't really know how to describe
1474960	1475960	it.
1475960	1479600	It's kind of like an adventure game, but it's just got a lot of really strange humor in
1479600	1480600	it.
1480600	1483720	It's kind of done like you're a secret agent and you're investigating all these different
1483720	1494960	missions that have you steal a kidney at one time and you know, find some carrier pigeons
1494960	1498240	and I don't know, it's just a really strange game.
1498240	1500480	It's got a lot of funny humor in it though.
1500480	1503840	So I got to check that out and play a couple hours of that.
1503840	1509480	And then I went in and played some Grand Theft Auto 5 online just because they had a new
1509480	1516800	weapon out for this week for Valentine's Day and also all the strip club lap dances
1516800	1517800	were free.
1517800	1520480	So, you know, why not?
1520480	1524720	And yeah, I think that was pretty much it.
1524720	1525720	Oh, Call of Duty 4.
1525720	1531000	I actually played a little bit of that online on Wednesday, but yeah.
1531000	1537160	Hopefully now that I've got a better gaming PC, I'm going to check out some of my Steam
1537160	1540200	Backlog maybe or try Titanfall again.
1540200	1542200	Hopefully it won't eat this one too.
1542200	1544400	Are you really trying to push your luck there?
1544400	1548320	Hey, you know what, they have a one year, no condition warranty.
1548320	1552440	So you know, if this thing gets set on fire by Titanfall, they'll replace it for free.
1552440	1553440	So I don't care.
1553440	1554440	There you go.
1554440	1555440	There you go.
1555440	1556440	All right.
1556440	1560560	My gaming week, my gaming week was pretty abbreviated as well because I had a big show
1560560	1561560	on Friday.
1561560	1564880	So like, you know, the few days before that I was literally like just stressed.
1565600	1569580	You were spending all night in high heels and pantyhose.
1569580	1571160	It was the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
1571160	1572160	That's what you're supposed to do.
1572160	1574160	But yes, that was Friday.
1574160	1576200	Yeah, I know, I know.
1576200	1580160	But well, we had a sold out show in the middle of February, which is which is on Valentine's
1580160	1581160	Day nonetheless.
1581160	1582160	So that was that was pretty awesome.
1582160	1583160	I got to say.
1583160	1584160	Oh, I almost forgot.
1584160	1586000	Dan and I did something really romantic for Valentine's Day.
1586000	1587000	What did you do?
1587000	1588000	Our taxes.
1588000	1590000	OK, you can go.
1590000	1591000	All right.
1591120	1596440	Well, I wore women's clothes in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and, you know, that was
1596440	1597440	in front of 500 people.
1597440	1598440	Never be embarrassed.
1598440	1599440	All right.
1599440	1604220	No, it's I've been doing it for years and years and I love the community and the environment
1604220	1605220	it creates.
1605220	1606960	I miss doing cast crew stuff.
1606960	1607960	Oh, yeah.
1607960	1608960	Crew is fun.
1608960	1609960	It's good.
1609960	1612400	We have a we have a lot of like just out of high school girls that kind of do our crew
1612400	1613680	and they have a lot of fun with it.
1613680	1615240	So they have a good time.
1615240	1618740	But anyway, this isn't the Rocky Horror podcast.
1618740	1619960	This is a podcast about video games.
1619960	1622680	So what have I been playing outside of that this week?
1622680	1624440	I've been because of the show Friday.
1624440	1626000	I've been really like this whole weekend.
1626000	1629760	It's just been like dead man walking like I'm just like my back hurts.
1629760	1633480	I want to sleep seriously.
1633480	1634880	Oh my God.
1634880	1635880	We have these little.
1635880	1636880	OK, sorry.
1636880	1638120	Not to talk about Rocky again, but you need to know it.
1638120	1639920	Now it's relevant to the story.
1639920	1643300	OK, you we have these stairs backstage.
1643300	1645420	It's like it's just like the movie Showgirls.
1645420	1648800	You have to run up and down these stairs all night.
1648800	1650480	When you want to go do a quick change.
1650480	1653640	So I was running down the stairs and no, nobody pushed me down them because I'm not a bitch
1653640	1654640	or whatever.
1654640	1656600	But only one person can fit in the staircase.
1656600	1659280	So you have to like kind of yell if you're going to go down the staircase because somebody
1659280	1660560	might be coming up.
1660560	1663800	So anyway, I had to go up and down this thing like a ton of times because there's all the
1663800	1664820	costume changes.
1664820	1670800	So by the time Saturday rolls around, I wake up and I'm like, my back hurts.
1670800	1672640	I hate being old.
1672640	1678760	I used to do this shit every week without a problem and now my back hurts so much.
1678760	1682720	So yeah, so Saturday I was like, I'm not going to do anything.
1682720	1684520	I'm going to sit around and play video games all day.
1684520	1690120	So I played Final Fantasy 14 and one other game that I played was Diablo 3 on PlayStation
1690120	1691120	3.
1691120	1696920	Diablo 3, of course, I played a long time ago on PC and I played the demo on PlayStation
1696920	1702200	3 a while ago and I decided I would put the game in my rental service queue and get it
1702200	1705040	at some point because I was like, I want to try it, but I don't really want to buy it.
1705040	1708520	Maybe I'll buy it on PlayStation 4, but I don't really want to buy it on PlayStation
1708520	1710380	3 if they're not going to do the upgrade.
1710380	1715360	So yeah, I got it on PlayStation 3 from the rental service and I was playing a lot of
1715360	1721280	that and it is really weird to get used to the controller at first because I can't like,
1721280	1726000	I hate that you can't specifically target things like you can kind of point the direction
1726000	1730860	and it sort of targets what it thinks you want to go for, but it's really weird that
1730860	1733880	I can't, like you don't have that precision from the mouse.
1733880	1739200	Now the game is tuned to that and you know, it works and I'm not saying it's a bad experience,
1739200	1742520	but it does take some real getting used to, especially having played through the game
1742520	1746960	once on the PC, but you know, it works on console.
1746960	1748280	I'm having fun.
1748280	1751380	I like the fact that there's no auction house.
1751380	1754840	It really does make a difference because you really have to work for the gear that you
1754840	1759840	want and it makes crafting more important and all that, so it changes the challenge
1759840	1760840	a little bit.
1760840	1766040	I have nobody to play multiplayer with yet, but maybe when the game is released for PlayStation
1766040	1773440	4, people will kind of rediscover it all over again, so that would be really cool.
1773440	1777880	That was Diablo 3 on the PlayStation 3, so yeah, I'm having enough fun with it.
1777880	1782440	I heard that your characters will get to transfer over to PlayStation 4 and that's more incentive
1782440	1784920	for me to get the PS4 version whenever it comes out.
1784920	1788760	I mean, they were saying it was like a launch window game and then it kind of disappeared.
1788760	1793580	My thought is they're going to sell it with the expansion, because I can't see them selling
1793580	1796600	the game alone and then trying to sell you an expansion right after.
1796600	1799720	I would kind of think they're going to time the release of the PlayStation 4 to be the
1799720	1802520	game plus expansion, but I think that's what they're doing.
1802520	1805240	Yeah, I mean, I don't know, but that's my guess.
1805240	1806240	That's my big guess.
1806240	1807240	That sounds reasonable.
1807240	1808240	Yeah, exactly.
1808240	1812480	So, yeah, other than that, some of the other same old stuff on DS, you know, lying in bed
1812480	1813480	with my back hurting.
1813480	1816380	I play a little more bravely default, but not a lot.
1816380	1819980	All my friends have run circles around me in that game, but I'm okay.
1819980	1824260	I had other things to do this week, so yeah, there you go.
1824260	1827660	So that was pretty much my gaming week, so I think that's all of us.
1827660	1829780	So quickly, some housekeeping.
1829780	1834860	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com
1834860	1841300	slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and our Google Plus page, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
1841300	1845020	We appreciate all you guys that follow us on the various social media, and you can keep
1845020	1848540	up with the latest and greatest of the show, answer our frugal question of the week, give
1848540	1850740	us your feedback, and so forth.
1850740	1855500	Also, we are definitely, definitely going to be closing the mailbag that we currently
1855500	1856500	have.
1856500	1861260	This week will be the last week to use that email address that we have, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1861260	1864660	It will no longer work after episode 541.
1864660	1868360	Don't want to discourage you from sending emails, but we have such a huge spam problem,
1868360	1871940	we do think we know what we're going to do to fix it, so that will happen next week.
1871940	1876180	So mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com will no longer work.
1876180	1878420	After how many years have we had that address?
1878420	1879420	Like 12 years?
1879420	1880420	After 12 years of using it.
1880420	1881420	Four Eves.
1881420	1884740	Yeah, it just has too many spammy problems, so we're just going to, we're going to burn
1884740	1891540	it down to the ground and plant black roses, just like Dark Soccer did with Ed's corpse.
1891540	1892660	All of Ed's house.
1892660	1894620	Everything having to do with Ed.
1894620	1895620	Amazing.
1895620	1896620	Amazing.
1896620	1900460	All right, let's get into some gaming news, and I believe Loki's going to start us off
1900460	1903740	talking about his favorite game of the week, right Loki?
1903740	1909460	It, you know, you joke, but I had a great time playing the two matches I did before
1909460	1911380	my computer exploded.
1911380	1916180	But Titanfall Beta is going to be open to all very soon.
1916180	1920940	In fact, it's actually already open for everybody as of the 15th on Xbox One, and it's supposed
1920940	1925220	to be through this Origin as well on the 16th.
1925220	1926220	Here's the weird thing though.
1926220	1930460	I've gotten like four or five beta invites, or not even invites, but codes.
1930460	1932340	They keep sending me codes for everything.
1932340	1937060	In fact, I checked my mail like right before the show started, and I had yet another set
1937060	1938060	of codes.
1938060	1939940	One for Xbox One, one for PC.
1939940	1943780	So I don't think it's that hard to get into the beta in the first place, but...
1943780	1947620	Hey, I didn't get in until you gave me the code, which by the way, I only really had
1947620	1952420	enough time to play the tutorial section, but I liked that it had like matrix elements
1952420	1953900	of running on the walls.
1954700	1958060	I liked that it was really doing some different stuff that we haven't really seen in first
1958060	1959620	person shooters.
1959620	1965060	I liked the idea that you could just summon this gigantic mech to fall from space onto
1965060	1966060	where you're at.
1966060	1967060	I mean, it's a little bit ridiculous.
1967060	1970100	It's pretty awesome, and even the whole six on six thing is not a big deal, because there
1970100	1974300	is a lot of AI guys running around, although the AI people are completely retarded.
1974300	1978820	I mean, you seriously can walk up right to them and punch them in the face, and that's
1978820	1979820	it.
1979820	1983660	I think it was Bobby was comparing it a little bit to League of Legends, and like the gruntlings
1983660	1988460	in that game, that they're supposed to be easy like that, but it's just if you get kind
1988460	1992860	of like, if the numbers of them become insurmountable, that's how you can lose.
1992860	1994820	That's kind of the idea I got.
1994820	1995820	I guess.
1995820	1996820	I mean, it was fun.
1996820	2003660	I had a lot of fun, so I'm definitely going to check it out some more, but yeah, so if
2003660	2006420	you haven't got in yet, you should be able to get in now.
2006420	2015540	So at least definitely on Xbox One and PC, I'm assuming it's open now, so go check it
2015540	2017620	out if you haven't, because it's pretty awesome.
2017620	2020780	Just be careful if you're playing on a laptop.
2020780	2025920	And then the other thing is, of course, they're going to be fixing the Xbox One controller,
2025920	2031820	and I guess this is by request from Respawn.
2031820	2036180	They were saying that they're fixing, I guess, some of the inputs in there.
2036180	2039100	They haven't really said what exactly it says.
2039100	2044500	It wasn't really, it didn't feel like it should be, it was a little overly twitchy with the
2044500	2049300	current controls, and they're saying now it's fixed and they're happy with it.
2049300	2053860	So I'm wondering if that means that they're just going to adjust the dead zone on the
2053860	2055500	controller or what.
2055500	2059820	I would think that's almost something that they could do with the actual game itself.
2059820	2062460	Like you wouldn't have to adjust the controller, just adjust the game.
2062460	2063460	But whatever.
2064460	2066740	As long as it works better, I'm all about better.
2066740	2071900	I wish EA or Activision would have complained about the D-pad on the 360 a long time ago,
2071900	2074020	and how awful it was.
2074020	2077640	Even like, they have that convertible D-pad now on some of those controllers, and that's
2077640	2080060	even more terrible from what I've seen.
2080060	2083420	It can break off real easy too.
2083420	2090260	I think what would be awesome is if they would put out the goddamn PC drivers for the Xbox
2090260	2091260	One controller.
2091580	2093740	That would be pretty awesome.
2093740	2096380	That's true, wasn't that supposed to happen like soon?
2096380	2097380	At some point.
2097380	2101620	I would think that maybe with Titanfall launching that would be a good, well I don't know, they
2101620	2104420	still want you to play on Xbox One I guess.
2104420	2109900	And I gotta say, playing Titanfall I was like, could I get an Xbox One?
2109900	2111900	Ah, here we go.
2111900	2113780	No, I'm not doing it.
2113780	2117460	Unfortunately you just had to buy a new laptop, so that kinda screwed that plan.
2118460	2123660	Alright, I didn't really want to spend that money, and my wife's gonna be a little mad,
2123660	2125900	but she said I could, so you know.
2125900	2127940	She said you could do it, you got permission, so you're good.
2127940	2134580	And to be honest, it's not as expensive, I mean, I don't know, I think it's reasonable,
2134580	2135580	whatever.
2135580	2136920	Alright, fair enough.
2136920	2141580	Other big gaming news this week, you know, since apparently I'm the show's resident Nintendo
2141580	2145900	fanboy, I'm gonna talk to you guys about a little bit of Nintendo news, why are you making
2145900	2146900	angry face?
2147340	2154500	I know you do, no I was going off that email from last week, but I like everybody, and
2154500	2159300	Nintendo had a big thing this week, they did their big Nintendo Direct, so let me quickly
2159300	2163020	review some of the news that came up in Nintendo Direct this week, and then we'll talk about
2163020	2164020	it a little bit.
2164020	2167700	So Nintendo Direct took place on February 13th, and we learned the following, Little
2167700	2170500	Mac will be a character in Super Smash Brothers.
2170500	2173500	That was the best trailer ever.
2173500	2176780	That is actually, kinda one of those things where I was like, oh yeah, like why the hell
2176780	2178260	wasn't he in the previous games?
2178260	2181780	We've really been missing this guy for a while, so, I know a lot of fans have been demanding
2181780	2183660	it for a while, so there you go.
2183660	2188900	Kirby Triple Deluxe, finally announced for North, well, sorry, it's been announced, but
2188900	2193100	now it's officially dated, and of course I don't have the date in front of me, Loki help
2193100	2194100	me out.
2194100	2195100	May 2nd.
2195100	2196100	Thank you.
2196100	2197100	What's that, May 2nd?
2197100	2198100	Yeah, May 2nd.
2198100	2199100	There it is.
2199100	2206240	Same as, what is it, it's same as Mario Golf World Tour, I think.
2206240	2212040	And then they also dated Mario Kart 8, which will be out on May 30th, and they announced
2212040	2215860	along with that that all of the Koopa Kids are going to be playable in that game, which
2215860	2217320	is pretty exciting.
2217320	2221400	That seemed not very exciting at all, in fact I was just like, man, you know, instead of
2221400	2225280	having like 8 Koopa Kids, why couldn't they have had like 8 interesting characters?
2225280	2230160	Actually, it's 7 Koopa Kids, not 8, because Bowser was World 8's boss, so it's 7 Koopa
2230160	2231160	Kids.
2231160	2236360	Okay, so 7 Koopa Kids, instead of 7 Koopa Kids, they could have had like 1 or 2 Koopa
2236360	2243840	Kids and, you know, Geno, or, you know, I don't know, maybe like a Shy Guy, or...
2243840	2247260	Well, I don't think they're necessarily cutting all these, I just get the sense that Mario
2247260	2252520	Kart 8's going to have a huge roster, which is pretty cool, so, you know, I'm okay.
2252520	2255640	I'm okay with that, some of the Koopa Kids are pretty cool and don't really get, like,
2255640	2258760	enough attention, so I think it's pretty cool.
2258760	2263960	Except, no one is ever going to get the reference for Morton Koopa Jr., unless they are old
2263960	2264960	like us.
2264960	2265960	I like Wendy O Koopa.
2265960	2266960	Yeah.
2266960	2267960	See, you know, punk rock school.
2267960	2271040	But anyway, NES Remix Volume 2 is announced.
2271040	2274920	It's going to come with Super Luigi Brothers, those are coming out on April 25th.
2274920	2279960	NES Remix Volume 2 is going to have the good NES games, or I should say the re- because,
2279960	2285040	to be fair, NES Remix did have some good games in it, but it also had a lot of filler crap,
2285040	2288600	so it looks like NES Remix Volume 2 is going to cut a lot of the filler crap in favor of
2288600	2291280	games that we actually remember, so that's pretty cool.
2291280	2295320	I'm kind of tempted, but we'll see.
2295320	2299680	Game Boy Advance games will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in April.
2299680	2300680	That is official.
2300680	2309440	Pokemon Battle Troizei is going to get a sequel on the 3DS eShop, and Steel Diver Sub Wars,
2309440	2313200	one of those It's Out Now announcements, the free-to-play version of Steel Diver that we've
2313200	2317800	been hearing about for some time, that is now available for download on the 3DS eShop.
2317800	2322560	I'll quote myself here, stop trying to make Steel Diver happen.
2322560	2324960	It's just not going to happen.
2324960	2328720	I downloaded it, I didn't get to play it yet, so I don't have an opinion on it really yet,
2328720	2333840	but hey, if it's free, I'll try it, especially with Nintendo jumping into this territory
2333840	2335080	themselves, you know?
2335080	2339920	Steel Diver I think is a good choice to test the waters with, no pun intended, so, you
2339920	2343080	know, because you're right, Loki, it didn't work on 3DS, so it'll be interesting to see
2343080	2348360	if this kind of revives it, or if it, not really, so we'll see.
2348360	2355280	Also on the eShop announced today, Inazuma 11, which is the soccer RPG that's been out
2355280	2358800	in Japan and Europe for some time, it was just, bam, it's going to be on the eShop right
2358800	2363680	now for North America, so I know some people are very excited about that, so.
2363680	2369440	There was also a new trailer for Bayonetta 2, so quite a bit of news for Nintendo in
2369440	2370840	that Nintendo Direct.
2370840	2376720	A little heavy on 3DS, which is of course Nintendo's money machine right now, I was
2376720	2381640	a little disappointed in how light it was on Wii U, I was hoping there might be a little
2381640	2386400	something else, but I suppose they did say it was only supposed to be spring type of
2386400	2391240	releases, but yet then they threw in Bayonetta 2, now I wasn't expecting the Bayonetta 2,
2391240	2396120	I'm still sitting here thinking that, oh, we ain't gonna see Bayonetta 2 until 2015,
2396120	2399720	but apparently, it's gonna be in Japan this summer.
2399720	2402320	Bayonetta 2 will be a game this year, apparently.
2402320	2405960	That is what Platinum Games and Nintendo announced, is that Bayonetta 2 is gonna be out in Japan
2405960	2413200	in the summer, and will be in the west sometime this year, so, color me a little bit surprised.
2413200	2418840	So they did talk about some non-spring releases, because there was that.
2418840	2424040	So I'll be very curious to see what E3 brings us as far as, you know, what other big, because
2424040	2426560	Bayonetta 2 is not gonna be enough, you know?
2426560	2432960	I mean, Bayonetta was great, but I do think Bayonetta 2 has a really limited audience,
2432960	2438480	and I'm a little worried about how it's gonna sell, because Bayonetta 2 is for those fans
2438480	2441160	that actually went and bought a Wii U.
2441160	2444360	I don't know if there's gonna be a lot of people that go buy a Wii U because of Bayonetta
2444360	2446720	2, but we'll see, I guess it really depends on how good the game is.
2446720	2450000	We actually had talk about getting a Wii U because of Super Smash Bros.
2450000	2451060	Oh, there you go.
2451060	2453680	And so if we do that, then I definitely want Bayonetta 2.
2453680	2456180	I wonder if Super Smash Bros. is gonna make the holiday this year.
2456180	2457780	They're sure acting like it.
2457780	2458780	That would be...
2458780	2459780	It looks fun.
2459780	2465140	I mean, if Wii U does get Bayonetta 2, Super Smash Bros., and maybe one other little Nintendo
2465140	2470720	secret that they're sitting on until E3 all this year, that's gonna be a nice little boost
2470720	2471720	for Nintendo.
2471720	2478300	Now, again, they still really need the third-party support, but, you know, it'll still, well,
2478300	2481780	if they could work a price cut in as well, I think they would really be competitive.
2481780	2483780	But we'll see.
2483780	2484780	We'll see.
2485780	2486780	There you go.
2486780	2487780	That's my news from Nintendo Direct.
2487780	2491780	Um, Loki, I don't know if you had some opinions on what you saw on Nintendo Direct.
2494780	2495780	Loki, did you mute yourself again?
2495780	2496780	You gotta watch that.
2496780	2499780	Or did he just go away for a minute?
2499780	2501780	I think Josh took over.
2501780	2502780	I guess so.
2502780	2503780	Decided to fill in for him, but he shouldn't.
2503780	2504780	Right.
2504780	2506780	Well, that is why he does the show on Skype right now.
2506780	2509780	He's taking kids' shoes off.
2509780	2510780	That's what we figured.
2510780	2511780	All right.
2511780	2513780	Anyways, um, so let's see here.
2513780	2514780	No, no, no.
2514780	2519780	We were asking you about the Nintendo Direct and what you thought of it.
2519780	2521780	It was boring.
2521780	2525780	I mean, they didn't really announce anything interesting, and they spent way too much time
2525780	2527780	on just, I don't know.
2527780	2532780	I mean, is any of that stuff really supposed to get me excited about a, you know, Wii U
2532780	2533780	or anything?
2533780	2535780	I mean, it was all 3DS news.
2535780	2539780	And, honestly, you know, with Bayonetta, even though they're kinda claiming that it's gonna
2539780	2542780	be out later this year, I just don't buy it.
2542780	2544780	I mean, and even...
2544780	2546780	You'll believe it when you see it?
2546780	2548780	Yeah, I guess.
2548780	2549780	I mean, here's the thing.
2549780	2553780	Even though Bayonetta 2 might be coming out later this year, is it really gonna sell any
2553780	2554780	systems?
2554780	2557780	I mean, some people, yeah, they're all, oh, I'm so excited about Bayonetta and, like,
2557780	2560780	the Wii U, but I don't know.
2560780	2563780	It's just, like, even, even, like, in the second quarter, I was talking about, like,
2563780	2569780	what titles are coming out, and they've only got, like, maybe two or three Wii U games.
2569780	2573780	I mean, it's literally, like, six Wii U games in the first half of the year.
2573780	2574780	Like, retail releases.
2574780	2575780	And that's kinda what I count.
2575780	2579780	I mean, yeah, you can go digital all day, but let's be honest.
2579780	2583780	Digital offerings even, you know, on other consoles are way better than what's being
2583780	2584780	offered on Wii U.
2584780	2588780	I mean, it's just not, like, a ton of digital releases on there.
2588780	2590780	I just...
2590780	2591780	They're hurting.
2591780	2594780	They really need, like, Mario Kart 8 better be...
2594780	2597780	I mean, it's gonna be awesome, but is it gonna be enough to...
2597780	2600780	Are they gonna start selling a ton more units than they were before?
2600780	2602780	I just don't think that they are.
2602780	2606780	I think it'll be a slight uptick, but it's just not...
2606780	2608780	They still haven't found a good hook.
2608780	2612780	I mean, we already know that there's gonna be great Wii U games from Nintendo,
2612780	2617780	but that's not enough to hook a lot of people to buy the system.
2617780	2618780	Alright, well, we'll see.
2618780	2620780	I think a price cut might be the trick, but we'll see.
2620780	2621780	I mean...
2621780	2622780	That would help.
2622780	2623780	That would definitely help.
2623780	2626780	Because right now, even selling Wii U to my customers and stuff,
2626780	2627780	no one wants to bring it in.
2627780	2630780	They have no interest in it at all.
2630780	2635780	And so now you're losing retailer interest, you're losing third-party interest,
2635780	2637780	you're losing consumer interest.
2637780	2640780	I don't know where they're gonna be able to make it up.
2640780	2643780	Alright, well, we'll see as the year continues.
2643780	2644780	In the meantime, DarkSakura.
2644780	2646780	Yeah, I got something.
2647780	2650780	So, as we might have teased,
2650780	2655780	there was talk going on about virtual purchases becoming regulated.
2655780	2658780	And this is, by the way, news out of Amsterdam.
2658780	2660780	You know, where...
2660780	2661780	Pot brownies.
2661780	2663780	Oh, no, they have other stuff than that.
2663780	2664780	Like history and art.
2664780	2665780	And Sil.
2665780	2666780	And Sil.
2666780	2667780	Oh, I miss Sil.
2667780	2669780	Hi, Sil, if you're listening.
2669780	2673780	Anyway, you know, there's been the whole thing with kids
2673780	2679780	that are basically spending all their parents' money on little transactions and games.
2679780	2689780	And so now, because of an investigation going on from the UK Office of Fair Trading,
2689780	2696780	they've got a lot more information about what kids are spending their parents' money on pretty much
2696780	2698780	in those little games.
2699780	2702780	They said they found a lack of, I'm gonna just quote this,
2702780	2707780	transparent, accurate, and clear up-front information about costs.
2707780	2713780	You know, saying that the costs may change as you hit levels.
2713780	2716780	And there's actually even a quote from Peter Mullineau,
2716780	2723780	who says that it was shameful that developers are exploiting their users that way.
2723780	2729780	So now there's talk, and they're actually talking about, in some countries,
2729780	2736780	of having these transactions be regulated and even taxable.
2736780	2741780	So I'm really, really interested in seeing how that plays out.
2745780	2746780	Yeah, I'd be curious.
2746780	2750780	I mean, it would seem so hard to regulate the internet.
2750780	2752780	Kind of arbitrary in a way.
2752780	2755780	I know. Yeah, yeah. That too. Anyway.
2755780	2761780	But coming into the situation that we've seen families finding themselves in,
2761780	2764780	because, of course, kids have no concept of money when it's virtual,
2764780	2769780	and a lot of adults don't have a concept of money when it's a card,
2769780	2771780	or just, oh, I get my points.
2771780	2775780	Why do you think we had, in the first place, things like Xbox Live Points,
2775780	2778780	and Nintendo Wii Points, and things like that?
2778780	2781780	I mean, it's to make it sound like...
2781780	2782780	Separate the concept of cost.
2782780	2786780	Exactly. Now, granted, Microsoft got rid of that.
2786780	2788780	Nintendo still has it, though.
2788780	2794780	Well, also, it means that they can charge a universal amount of points
2794780	2798780	and make the individual country cost of it different.
2798780	2803780	So, for example, what may be 400 Wii U points in Japan may be something completely different here.
2803780	2810780	So, that, again, is hiding that illusion of how much money you're actually spending on it.
2810780	2816780	So, I'd like to actually see some type of regulation come out, especially over here.
2816780	2819780	But then again, I don't know.
2819780	2826780	I don't know that we are, because people will pay off their attorneys, and judges, and everything,
2826780	2832780	and circumvent copyright law, and so...
2832780	2835780	I wish I could buy Nintendo Wii U games with Dogecoin.
2835780	2837780	Or whatever. However it's pronounced.
2837780	2838780	Doge.
2838780	2839780	Doge.
2839780	2840780	Doge.
2840780	2841780	Doge.
2841780	2843780	I think it's from Strongbad. The whole thing is from Strongbad.
2843780	2845780	So, it's however he said it, and I forget.
2845780	2850780	But, yeah, I wish I could use my Dogecoin to buy Wii U games.
2850780	2852780	Oh, virtual currency.
2852780	2853780	Well, it's gonna be...
2853780	2855780	That's a whole other thing.
2855780	2857780	I mean, this is opening a whole other can of worms.
2857780	2859780	That whole Bitcoin, and, you know, Doge, and all that.
2859780	2863780	It's very interesting that that stuff isn't really regulated yet.
2863780	2865780	I'll tell you what about the Bitcoin.
2865780	2869780	I had a very entertaining day about a month ago, month and a half ago,
2869780	2877780	of watching someone just completely take about, what was it, like, 9 million or something worth of Bitcoins.
2877780	2881780	Just completely taking it from right out in front of people, packing his way out of the money.
2881780	2882780	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard about that.
2882780	2884780	That was hilarious!
2884780	2887780	Well, that's kind of why I personally like the Dogecoin,
2887780	2891780	because it's not very valuable, and it's used in a much less serious manner.
2891780	2895780	Like, more about, like, what internet community is supposed to be about.
2895780	2897780	So, I think that currency is kind of fun.
2897780	2901780	But, yeah, all the rest of it is really volatile.
2901780	2905780	And you kind of are waiting, like, are they gonna try to clamp down on this?
2905780	2909780	But then again, how do you clamp down on something that's born of the internet?
2909780	2911780	That's a world thing.
2911780	2913780	Anyway, that's a whole other thing.
2913780	2918780	And I'm still of the opinion that I should form my own country, my own island nation,
2918780	2921780	where everyone rides, where we have a complete monorail system,
2921780	2927780	everyone else will ride a Vespa, and we don't have this fuckery going on.
2927780	2930780	We're supposed to get the shoes that tie their own laces next year, just like Back to the Future.
2930780	2931780	Oh!
2931780	2933780	Queen Simeon, in our chatroom, says,
2933780	2936780	It's Doge. Doge. Doge.
2936780	2940780	If you pronounce it like the actual word there, so, alright, fair enough.
2941780	2945780	Well, give me more of it. I will gladly accept donations in Doge.
2945780	2948780	For the record, I made one of those little memes to put in my cubicle.
2948780	2949780	Did you?
2949780	2950780	I did.
2950780	2951780	With the Shiba Inu?
2951780	2953780	Yeah, with Shiba Inu. It was awesome.
2953780	2955780	I can't say what it was because then I'd have to mention where I work.
2955780	2957780	Oh, I was like, I don't want to know what it is.
2957780	2960780	But I am gonna design a picture for the land of cubicles and tech.
2960780	2962780	Okay, fair enough.
2962780	2965780	Alright, moving on. Loki.
2965780	2977780	Alright, so we have some information about the brand new, was it, Japanese Arcade Expo coming in 2014.
2977780	2979780	Some of the games are gonna be showing off there.
2979780	2982780	Looks like some updates to just a bunch of games that I've seen before.
2982780	2988780	Like, you know, remember that old Alpine Racer game that they had, you know, with the downhill skiing game?
2988780	2993780	So they're gonna have a new one of that, Midnight Maximum Tune 5.
2993780	2997780	Hopefully some great new music coming from that as well.
2997780	3006780	Let's see, a game called Mock Storm, which is kind of like some sort of, looks like a dog fighting game.
3006780	3012780	And then Taiko no Tatujin Master White version is gonna be coming out as well.
3012780	3015780	So that looks kinda cool.
3015780	3020780	Taiko no Tatujin in the arcade is so fun. I played that in San Francisco.
3020780	3027780	It was when we had the Hoard House night, when Shane was visiting, and when we went to Japan Town with Grandpa and extra for everybody.
3027780	3034780	I played Taiko no Tatujin, and it's so much better in the arcade when you have that gigantic taiko drum to bang on.
3034780	3036780	But anyway, sorry, just random tangent.
3036780	3044780	No, and then of course, you know, being Japan, they've got a Gundam versus game coming out as well.
3044780	3046780	It looks kinda cool.
3047780	3049780	Is it like the older Gundam game?
3052780	3055780	It was like the first person Gundam game?
3055780	3060780	Yeah, I think it's like that. It's hard to tell. The screenshot's really small.
3060780	3069780	And then, what was I gonna say? There's a, I was gonna say, I saw like an AKB48 shooter game.
3069780	3070780	What?
3070780	3072780	It's a zombie shooter game.
3072780	3074780	Are the girls zombies?
3075780	3078780	Yes, I've seen this game. Yes, it's the pop idols as zombies.
3078780	3079780	I might need this.
3079780	3081780	Yeah, I've heard of this. Hilarious.
3085780	3086780	Awesome, awesome.
3086780	3090780	By the way, our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com say hi to Josh.
3090780	3094780	We can hear him in the background, which is fine. It's cute.
3095780	3102780	Alright, moving on. A lot of people, you might want to mute your speakers there, Loki, with the kids around,
3102780	3106780	because I'm gonna use some naughty language with this, because this really ticks me off.
3106780	3111780	And this is more, and there's really no better word for this, which is why I told Loki to mute it,
3111780	3116780	because it's really pure fuckery is what's going on there with Candy Crush Saga.
3116780	3120780	And I'm sure many of you have heard this, because this is a news story.
3120780	3126780	The interesting thing about it is that much like Candy Crush Saga, this news story has really caught wildfire through Facebook,
3126780	3129780	and there's all these people sharing, like people that I didn't even know really played games,
3129780	3134780	that share these things that say, here's why you should stop playing Candy Crush Saga.
3134780	3141780	And it's because of another game out there called Candy Swipe, which many, many, many people are confusing for Candy Crush Saga.
3141780	3149780	In fact, the creator, Albert Ransom, has put together quite the evidence that his game gets confused with Candy Crush Saga all of the time.
3149780	3154780	Well, what's the problem? Candy Swipe is a rip-off game, right? Wrong.
3154780	3161780	Candy Swipe was written in 2010. In fact, Candy Swipe was written by Albert Ransom as a tribute to his mom,
3161780	3163780	who had passed away at 62 because of leukemia.
3163780	3165780	And it has better graphics.
3165780	3171780	Yes, and Albert Ransom details this all in a letter that he wrote openly, that has gone viral,
3171780	3176780	to King, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, in a note over at candyswipe.com.
3176780	3181780	And he basically said to the makers of Candy Crush Saga, congrats, you win.
3181780	3187780	You're taking the food out of my family's mouth when Candy Swipe clearly existed well before Candy Crush Saga.
3187780	3190780	And this all boils down to trademark issues.
3190780	3201780	Because Albert Ransom, when he made Candy Swipe, he tried to actually get protection for his name, intellectual property protection.
3201780	3207780	But the makers of Candy Crush Saga are coming in and saying, nope, you've got to change your game,
3207780	3210780	because people are getting it confused with us, and we own the trademark.
3210780	3214780	We bought the name Candy as a trademark, because they didn't actually get that. They bought it.
3214780	3218780	And so your game is too confusing, even though it was out first.
3218780	3226780	So this guy who made the game is battling these trademark issues, and now Candy Crush Saga is trying to cancel the Candy Swipe trademark.
3226780	3229780	So the guy who made this game can't even use his own name.
3229780	3234780	And the way trademark issues work in this country, it doesn't necessarily matter that he's first.
3234780	3239780	It matters that Candy Crush Saga is kind of the well-known one, so to speak.
3239780	3241780	It's just completely stupid.
3241780	3246780	It's completely stupid, and it just keeps on going, like, why we need reform of these laws in this country.
3246780	3254780	But unfortunately, our Congress, which can't get a fucking thing done, like, not a single fucking thing done, will never get around to this.
3255780	3260780	Because I'm sure, as many of you probably feel, there's far more important things that they need to be dealing with.
3260780	3272780	And, you know, certainly there are some other things too, but, I mean, this is the type of fuckery that these laws not being reformed, that were written well before the internet, are leading us to.
3272780	3279780	So anyhow, so basically, you know, this maker is saying, congrats, you win.
3279780	3282780	And it was very, very passive-aggressive there.
3282780	3288780	Congratulations on your success, is how it ended there, but I think we all know that was very tongue-in-cheek.
3288780	3299780	Anyhow, so, I mean, again, if you're still out there playing Candy Crush Saga, you know people that are out there playing Candy Crush Saga, I have no easy way to say this.
3299780	3301780	You're continuing to support this.
3301780	3302780	Now, it's important to note-
3302780	3304780	That makes them part of the problem.
3304780	3307780	It really does. Like, there's no nice way for me to say that.
3307780	3310780	You are part of the problem in letting King-
3310780	3312780	Literally, you're part of the problem.
3312780	3314780	Because, what did we just say?
3314780	3323780	In trademark laws, because Candy Crush Saga is more well-known, because it's more popular, because people continue to play it, they can stomp the little guy like this.
3323780	3332780	I think it's very important to note, Candy Swipe isn't really a replacement for Candy Crush Saga, because Candy Swipe, yes, it uses little pictures of candy too, but it plays like you connect lines.
3332780	3338780	It plays more like that- there's a puzzle game, like Puzzle Miner or something on iOS that's very similar, but not the same.
3338780	3339780	iOS.
3339780	3342780	Sorry, iOS, the puzzle- I can't think of the name of it.
3342780	3343780	I don't know.
3343780	3344780	But yeah, it's-
3344780	3345780	But I bought Candy Swipe.
3345780	3346780	Yeah.
3346780	3350780	I'm very proud to say that I've never, ever gotten Candy Crush.
3351780	3352780	So.
3352780	3359780	But yeah, there's that, and yeah, so please, if you're playing Candy Crush Saga, stop.
3359780	3365780	There's many, many other games out there that are very similar, like I would even say, play Bejeweled, which is now an EA game.
3365780	3371780	I would rather- much rather you be playing Bejeweled than Candy Crush Saga, which is a much better match 3 game.
3371780	3373780	So, just throwing that out there.
3373780	3376780	A little tough love from Rob Roberts.
3376780	3380780	Well, I fully condone that course of action, because I mean, seriously?
3380780	3381780	Mhm.
3381780	3382780	Fuck those guys.
3382780	3383780	Yeah.
3383780	3384780	Fuck them.
3384780	3385780	King needs to be put to an end.
3385780	3388780	King needs- King needs to be buried in the backyard and assaulted-
3388780	3389780	With Zynga.
3389780	3391780	And just like Ed was.
3391780	3393780	I'm just gonna call them Ed Corp.
3393780	3398780	Yeah, seriously, look, many of you listen to this show on your mobile phones.
3398780	3399780	Take a moment right now.
3399780	3400780	Do it.
3400780	3401780	This is peer pressure.
3401780	3402780	Do it.
3402780	3403780	Delete Candy Crush Saga.
3403780	3404780	Just do it.
3404780	3405780	I don't care if you're on level 250.
3405780	3407780	I don't care if you're on level 300.
3407780	3408780	These guys are evil.
3408780	3409780	Do it.
3409780	3410780	Right now.
3410780	3411780	Delete it off your phone.
3411780	3412780	Do it.
3412780	3413780	Peer pressure.
3413780	3415780	And if you don't, I'm very disappointed with you.
3415780	3416780	Mhm.
3416780	3417780	You make me-
3417780	3418780	I'm borderline angry.
3418780	3419780	I'm crying a little bit.
3419780	3420780	You're crying on the inside.
3420780	3421780	I am.
3421780	3422780	I'm just angry.
3422780	3425780	I'm not gonna buy Dark Soccer at a taco, because you won't delete that app.
3425780	3426780	I really want a fucking taco.
3426780	3433780	If you don't- if I don't get my taco, I'm going to kill another horse.
3433780	3434780	In my village.
3434780	3437780	And I don't even have another- I'm gonna import another fucking horse into my village,
3437780	3440780	and I'm gonna stab it with a shovel.
3440780	3441780	Because of you.
3441780	3444780	Because of you people playing that game.
3444780	3446780	You made me do it.
3446780	3449780	That's what all the mentally ill people say when they kill people, right?
3449780	3450780	You made me do it.
3450780	3451780	Alright.
3451780	3453780	ActDeftInChat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3453780	3457780	Sky, I won't do it, because I never installed it in the first place.
3457780	3459780	Well, that's fair.
3459780	3460780	That's fair.
3460780	3462780	See, that means that you and I are the very awesome people, because we don't ever have
3462780	3463780	to deal with that shit.
3463780	3470780	But make sure that- also, I will even give people three dollars to buy Candy Swipe.
3470780	3472780	Be careful what you offer.
3472780	3473780	One or two people.
3473780	3474780	One or- okay.
3474780	3477780	And I have to really like you.
3477780	3479780	Like, I'd buy it for you and Alan.
3479780	3480780	Okay, that's fair.
3480780	3481780	Thank you.
3481780	3482780	Appreciate that.
3482780	3485780	I would buy it for, maybe ActDeft.
3485780	3486780	Maybe.
3486780	3487780	I don't know.
3487780	3489780	You have to send me real tacos.
3489780	3492780	Because you're like where real tacos are.
3492780	3496780	Alright, anyway, full disclosure, I tried Candy Crush Taco because all my friends were
3496780	3497780	playing it.
3497780	3500780	I would never put a horse's head in someone's bed.
3500780	3501780	I would just- no.
3501780	3502780	That's disgusting.
3502780	3505780	What kind of a sicko are you?
3505780	3507780	Okay, so how about some other stuff?
3507780	3508780	How about it?
3508780	3515780	Well, we might have covered this before about Yasumi Matsuno, who directed Vagrant Story
3515780	3517780	and Final Fantasy Tactics.
3517780	3523780	Well, there's a partnership with PlayDeck that's a mobile developer to do a Kickstarter
3523780	3528780	campaign for a tactical RPG called Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians.
3528780	3531780	And it's turn-based, 3D map, all of that.
3531780	3535780	Well, it actually funded.
3535780	3540780	As of Valentine's Day, the Unsung Story, Tale of the Guardians Kickstarter fully funded.
3540780	3548780	The first 200,000 backers that pledged 20 bucks reserved a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android
3548780	3553780	copy of Unsung Story that's supposed to be out on July 15th.
3553780	3557780	And if you donated 50 bucks, there's digital versions of the strategy guide, the soundtrack,
3557780	3558780	and a poster.
3558780	3564780	So congrats to you, dude.
3564780	3568780	It looks neat, except I really, really hate turn-based RPGs.
3568780	3571780	So I'll let other people enjoy it for me.
3571780	3573780	Well, there's a lot of fans in that game, so.
3573780	3576780	Yeah, and I definitely would get soggy, so I don't want soggy tacos.
3576780	3578780	I'll just have to come hang out with you.
3578780	3579780	All right.
3579780	3581780	And ew, Nemesis, yuck.
3581780	3583780	Doritos tacos, ew.
3583780	3584780	That just made my stomach curdle.
3584780	3586780	I don't want tacos anymore now.
3586780	3587780	Those Loco Tacos?
3587780	3589780	The Dorito Taco, whatever the crap they are.
3589780	3591780	The Loco Tacos from Taco Bell.
3591780	3593780	I don't want tacos anymore, Rob.
3593780	3594780	I've just been completely-
3594780	3595780	They're not that bad, but here's the thing-
3595780	3596780	I hate Doritos.
3596780	3597780	Here's the thing.
3597780	3600780	There's Taco Bell Tacos, and then there's real tacos.
3600780	3603780	I want real tacos, but right now that just made me nauseous,
3603780	3605780	and I'm angry again.
3605780	3607780	I'm angry at the world.
3607780	3611780	Doritos Tacos make me hate people.
3611780	3612780	A lot.
3612780	3615780	All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.
3615780	3617780	Wow, okay.
3617780	3622780	So this week we've got a bunch of, well, a few good games coming out.
3622780	3627780	Starting off with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release of Rayman Legends.
3627780	3629780	They'll be coming out this week.
3629780	3633780	NASCAR 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3633780	3640780	Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze coming out on that Friday.
3640780	3645780	And then, of course, the biggest game of February, in my opinion,
3645780	3650780	Earth Defense Force 2025 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3650780	3653780	Finally.
3653780	3655780	Wow, all righty.
3655780	3657780	It's starting to pick up a little bit.
3657780	3658780	A little bit.
3658780	3659780	Well, moving on to Japan.
3659780	3660780	Guess what?
3660780	3663780	Japan actually has a really huge week this week because on February 22,
3663780	3664780	the PlayStation 4 is out.
3664780	3665780	Yay, Japan.
3665780	3668780	So Japan, we finally get to read PlayStation 4 release dates for Japan
3668780	3672780	because they are getting the PlayStation 4 on Saturday.
3672780	3673780	So there you go.
3673780	3676780	So, yes, coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.
3676780	3678780	The PlayStation 4.
3678780	3680780	And with that, you can get, like, a vertical stand.
3680780	3682780	You can get the camera, supposedly.
3682780	3688780	And I'm thinking you got all the inventory that they're not making in the U.S. right now.
3688780	3689780	So enjoy that.
3689780	3691780	And here are some of the games you can check out in Japan.
3691780	3694780	Drive Club is on the list, supposedly.
3694780	3697780	So I guess that's actually happening in Japan.
3697780	3699780	So I'm hoping we're getting it over here soon, too.
3699780	3700780	No, it's not happening.
3700780	3701780	Really? All right.
3701780	3704780	Because it's still on the list here for February 22.
3704780	3710780	But coming out as well in Japan, Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts,
3710780	3715780	DualShock controllers in black, red, blue, and a little charger stand for those two.
3715780	3720780	FIFA 14 World Class Soccer, Killzone Shadow Fall, NAC, NBA 2K4.
3720780	3721780	Now, wait a minute.
3721780	3723780	Aren't they getting NAC for free?
3723780	3725780	I wonder why they're having a separate release of NAC.
3725780	3726780	I thought NAC was being bundled in.
3726780	3728780	Maybe it's a PlayStation Plus thing.
3728780	3731780	NBA 2K14, Need for Speed Rivals.
3731780	3734780	Nobunaga no Yabu Sozu comes out as well.
3734780	3736780	And let's see, what else did they get?
3736780	3743780	Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out from Sega and Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.
3743780	3746780	And I don't know why Watch Dogs is on the list.
3746780	3747780	There's no way that's coming out.
3747780	3748780	But for some reason, that's on my list.
3748780	3750780	But I think that is a falsity.
3750780	3752780	I think that just hasn't been updated.
3752780	3757780	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Strider comes out in Japan.
3757780	3758780	Strider.
3758780	3759780	The new Strider game.
3759780	3760780	Strider.
3760780	3761780	Hiryu.
3761780	3763780	Hiryu is what they're calling it in Japan.
3763780	3764780	There's a regular and limited edition.
3764780	3766780	What?
3766780	3770780	Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin comes out there as well.
3770780	3772780	Far Cry 3 gets a price reduction.
3772780	3780780	And on the PlayStation 3, Shin Kohime Musou Otome Taisen Sangokushi Engi comes out this week.
3780780	3782780	So check that out on the PlayStation.
3782780	3783780	Little Princess what?
3783780	3787780	On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.
3787780	3790780	On the Vita this week, not a lot.
3790780	3797780	Chon no Doku Hana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.
3797780	3799780	I'm trying to see what game that might be.
3799780	3804780	Of course the website's not working for me right now, so I can't get any more on that game.
3804780	3806780	Let's see the Wii U.
3806780	3808780	Nothing on the Wii U this week.
3809780	3818780	And the 3DS gets Kuroko no Basuke Shoryu no Kisuke comes out from Bandai Namco.
3818780	3820780	So there you go, your Japanese release dates.
3820780	3822780	Enjoy your PS4, Japan.
3824780	3827780	There's some games coming out in the UK.
3827780	3832780	But my list has not decided to load for me, so...
3832780	3833780	Yeah, suddenly we're having a...
3833780	3834780	Are we still broadcasting?
3834780	3835780	Yeah, we are.
3835780	3836780	I suppose we are.
3836780	3840780	On the 19th we have Banished for PC and Ikaruga for PC.
3840780	3843780	On the 19th we have Strider!
3843780	3844780	Yay!
3844780	3849780	On everything, and I'm going to have every version of it ever and on the PC.
3849780	3856780	On the 20th we have Blue Eden for iPhone, which the name sounds cool, I don't know what it's about.
3856780	3863780	There's also Men of War Assault Squad 2, but I don't have to see why it has to be so patriarchy focused.
3863780	3867780	And Weapon Shop de Omas on the 21st.
3867780	3869780	Wow, this is a pretty busy week over in the UK.
3869780	3877780	We have Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Earth Defense Force 2025, Rayman Legends on various variouses.
3877780	3878780	That's it.
3880780	3884780	You know, Rob, women can be a war too.
3885780	3887780	Why does it have to be Men of War?
3887780	3889780	Maybe that'll be the sequel.
3890780	3892780	Alright, just like Ms. Pac-Man.
3892780	3897780	See, now I'm coming up with subtitles for it, it'd be Women of War, fuck shit up.
3898780	3900780	I'd make that game, I'd play that game.
3900780	3902780	Alright, moving on. Loki.
3903780	3909780	Alright, so there was another announcement this week, not necessarily from Nintendo, but Sony.
3909780	3914780	They had a press event where they showed off some Playstation 4 games coming out,
3914780	3923780	and also announced that, guess what, that redesigned Vita game is going to be coming over here as well in April, I believe.
3923780	3930780	They're going to have Borderlands 2 launching with that release, a special Borderlands 2 bundle.
3931780	3936780	So that'll be coming out for $1.99 as well as an 8GB memory card.
3937780	3938780	So that's kind of cool.
3938780	3947780	And then of course, with that, I want to say, oh yeah, it actually includes all the DLC too, so that's a pretty good deal.
3949780	3952780	And then I'm not sure how much the system is by itself.
3952780	3958780	I'm assuming that you can get it without buying Borderlands 2, but probably slightly cheaper than that.
3959780	3968780	But it's 20% slimmer, 15% lighter, and has just a LCD screen instead of an OLED screen.
3968780	3978780	So, kind of neat. I don't know if that's going to necessarily help drive the Vita, but I know that games like Borderlands 2 probably will help.
3980780	3986780	Alright, do you think folks are going to actually buy that new Vita model here?
3987780	3992780	Maybe. I don't know. If they're looking for something smaller, perhaps.
3992780	3999780	I'm not really sure. Probably if they put out the new version, maybe the old version will be dropping in price?
3999780	4004780	Yeah, I think certainly price is a big, big key driver of this stuff.
4004780	4012780	Borderlands 2 on Vita, I guess that's kind of cool, but I also sort of think that most people who wanted to play Borderlands probably have by now.
4013780	4018780	I mean, they gave it away for free on PlayStation Plus, or I think it's still there for free, so I'm just...
4018780	4023780	It seems like it's almost too late to put it out on the Vita. You know what I mean?
4024780	4029780	Maybe, but it's still a good handheld. I mean, if you want to take it with you, that's kind of cool.
4030780	4036780	Alright, well, added to Steam this week, tags. Tags came to the Steam store this week.
4036780	4042780	But here's what's interesting about it. It's actually a crowd-sourced tag system. They're not like official tags.
4042780	4044780	Oh, I'm sure that'll be effective then.
4044780	4051780	Well, it's had some very interesting effects, because people have tagged things with very interesting things, but yeah, it's all kind of like crowd-sourced.
4051780	4061780	So you can suggest tags, and you can tag things yourself, you know, that this is an action game or a hardcore game or whatever, or you can come up with your own inventive tag.
4061780	4071780	You can browse by popular tags. You can also look at tags that are recommended for you, I guess, based on some type of algorithm behind the scenes.
4071780	4083780	It is localized for various languages, so you can tag in, you know, I know Steam is very big in Russia, it's in big part thanks to Dota 2, and other languages as well, so you can tag in those languages.
4084780	4093780	And yeah, looking at it, what your friends have tagged things with and so forth. So it is in beta right now, but it's not like one of those invite-only things.
4093780	4098780	It's just kind of out there, and you can check that out, the Steam tags. So there you go.
4099780	4109780	All right. Well, you know, I'm going to go back to a day when we didn't really have a way to tag games. It was just like, which drawer are you going to put this in, or which bin are you going to throw this game in?
4109780	4112780	Tagging games meant that you took spray paint to a billboard.
4112780	4115780	Or you took masking tape and you put it on the NES cartridge.
4115780	4116780	And you wrote your name on it.
4116780	4119780	Exactly. It's the classic game of the week.
4122780	4130780	Dark Soccer's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking this game out, because if you don't, you like suck or something.
4130780	4133780	Seriously, what's up with you kids? Get off my lawn and play it.
4133780	4136780	Here it is, the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer. What would you pick?
4136780	4138780	I sure do like my compile games, don't I, Rob?
4138780	4140780	You sure do like your compile games.
4140780	4148780	This one is Golvelius, which, well, the technical name is Mao Golvelius, which is Devil Golvelius.
4148780	4154780	It was an action adventure game that was done for the MSX, developed by compile and released in 1987.
4154780	4163780	Then Sega licensed it in 88 and did a remake of it for the Sega Master System, which was the Mark 3 in Japan.
4163780	4167780	And that's the version that actually this music is coming from, because I couldn't find the MSX one.
4169780	4177780	And then later on, compile also did a remake for the MSX2 that was called Shin Mao Golvelius, which was True Devil Golvelius.
4177780	4180780	Although, is that true or new? I don't know.
4180780	4186780	Anyway, it looks like the Sega Master System version, but had different layouts.
4186780	4197780	Now the thing about this game is that it actually was announced that it would be coming out on the iOS platform.
4197780	4215780	In 2009. I actually haven't seen if it actually did, but there was a spin-off game that was called Super Cooks that was released in 1989 with the disc station Special Rokugo.
4215780	4218780	So yeah, it's kind of a neat little game.
4218780	4231780	Basically, this game, I have to say the American artwork is just another one of the sufferers of the really bad 80s style let's change the awesome artwork that it had into shit.
4234780	4241780	But anyway, the game has got some really interesting type of motion mechanics in it.
4241780	4251780	Can I just say this whole thing we're looking at right now in the video where the power bar and the gold and everything is scrolling on the screen repeatedly.
4251780	4253780	The whole level itself is scrolling.
4253780	4254780	Yeah, it's so weird.
4254780	4261780	And see, that's one of the things. When you're exploring your overworld, it's just the standard above ground thing.
4261780	4268780	Then you have these levels that are like this that Rob was describing, where it's almost like you're playing a scrolling shooter.
4268780	4271780	Yeah, it's like a shooter, but with a sword and shield type of thing.
4271780	4272780	It is compile. I mean, hello.
4272780	4273780	True.
4273780	4279780	But you're just walking around stabbing things and then killing gigantic, cute looking, weird bats.
4279780	4287780	The other types of levels that you have in here are side scrolling levels, platform style.
4287780	4296780	Where one of the first ones that you do is the one with the giant red snake in it and you shoot all the little cute baby snakes and the red snake just looks at you disapprovingly.
4296780	4300780	And then you stab him in the face and he dies, which is what you're supposed to do with snakes apparently.
4300780	4311780	Then, as you go through it, I mean, really the way to make it through this game is to grind, to grind, to grind.
4311780	4316780	And find your shopkeepers, buy stuff, you can get potions to extend your life meter.
4316780	4324780	You get bibles, and bibles increase the amount of gold you can carry, which is very apt of religion in the United States.
4324780	4326780	I wonder if that's the same all over the world.
4326780	4331780	You know, but it's just really a grind heavy game.
4331780	4336780	But it's got different, it's pretty straight forward in how you play it.
4336780	4339780	It doesn't really have a lot of the puzzle solving stuff.
4339780	4344780	It's just really, you know, you have the side scrolling stages, you have the overhead stages.
4344780	4346780	Sorry.
4346780	4351780	And also, once you scroll the screen, you can't backtrack, so you have to keep going forward.
4351780	4356780	And you can really get stuck in tight places, you know, if you've got your screen scrolled just the wrong way.
4356780	4361780	But you do have a big, huge world to explore.
4361780	4363780	And it's really detailed.
4363780	4370780	It really makes the most of the capabilities of the, definitely the Master System at the time.
4370780	4374780	And like I said, I tried to find some more of the MSX version.
4374780	4379780	The MSX2 Govellia sequel is actually really, really nice as well.
4379780	4383780	And I mean, some of the writing in it is like super, super funny.
4383780	4390780	There's even a place where, you know, you find a woman and she's mistranslated.
4390780	4394780	And it says, why, thou art but a moron of the first class, hit the road.
4394780	4397780	And, you know, it's just a fun little game.
4397780	4403780	And like even the levels have some fun type of things thrown in here and there.
4403780	4415780	And like in the snake level, for example, when you get to the end of it, there's actually like an arrow built into the ground when you get past the snake.
4415780	4418780	You're in the one with the big snakes.
4418780	4422780	But keep in mind, you know, the other stuff that Compile did, they did the Alest series.
4422780	4425780	They did Zanac, which I've covered. Puyo Puyo.
4425780	4431780	They did Maru Monogatari for, you know, if you're looking, again, to RPGs.
4431780	4442780	But really, Golvelius is, I'd even say it's probably got to be one of the unsung classics of the adventure RPG genre.
4442780	4447780	And yeah, it did actually come out on iOS.
4447780	4452780	So I knew about it, but I didn't get it.
4452780	4454780	So I actually didn't see if it did, if it was available.
4454780	4458780	But it's the Sega Master System version that has touch controls.
4458780	4462780	So definitely go get the game. It's pretty neat.
4462780	4464780	It's Golvelius.
4464780	4466780	Devil Golvelius.
4466780	4468780	There it is, your classic game of the week.
4468780	4475780	Golvelius for the Sega Master System is what we're looking at here in studio, but MSX sounds like probably the definitive version there.
4475780	4480780	Actually, for the one that most people would have seen would have been the Master System one.
4480780	4481780	Well, here anyway.
4481780	4488780	No, no, no. From what I understand, because it was the touched up graphical one, it ended up being one of the more notable ones.
4488780	4493780	But yeah, but I mean, you know, the MSX was also, of course, super popular.
4493780	4497780	But I've got the game. It's a fun little game.
4497780	4500780	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4500780	4503780	Not one I'm super familiar with, I've got to be honest.
4503780	4507780	So that was pretty cool to learn something new tonight in the classic game of the week statement.
4507780	4509780	I aim to educate.
4509780	4512780	Well, we've got plenty more show to come, some rapid fire news.
4512780	4517780	The Fookle Question of the Week, the mailbag, and plenty more to come.
4517780	4521780	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4527780	4530780	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4530780	4537780	Live here on February the 16th of 2014 with the 540th episode of our show.
4537780	4541780	And we've been talking a little bit about Flappy Vog and Dark Soccer.
4541780	4544780	She just don't give a fuck tonight.
4544780	4549780	No, not a single fuck has been, is being, or will be given.
4549780	4553780	Because she is taco-less and this is upsetting.
4553780	4557780	No, you know what it is? Is it like the last two days of completely carb-fested?
4557780	4560780	Oh, that sounds awesome.
4560780	4566780	It was awesome. I had Choco-Pon and Cream-Pon and On-Pon.
4567780	4571780	And chocolate, lots of chocolate. And beer, lots of beer. I love beer.
4571780	4575780	And I had a legit cheeseburger with a bun.
4575780	4578780	Did you see that Jelly Belly is doing a beer flavor?
4578780	4580780	Don't tell me these things.
4580780	4583780	They supported what's-as-fuck, so I'm not giving them.
4583780	4585780	Yeah, I know. They're kind of crappy.
4585780	4587780	They don't, douchey people don't get my money.
4587780	4589780	Jelly beans are really good though.
4589780	4592780	Jelly bellies are really good. Other jelly beans are made of gummy material.
4592780	4595780	They suck. I can't eat them because I'm allergic to them.
4595780	4598780	See, I'm not gonna lie. I used to love, like on Easter,
4598780	4601780	because that's like when you get all those types of jelly beans,
4601780	4603780	I used to love getting the licorice ones are my favorite.
4603780	4605780	And some people are like, ew!
4605780	4609780	You and Dan can go hide in licorice land and eat that shit far away from me.
4609780	4612780	It's the Dutch. It's got to be a Dutch thing. Is it? I don't know.
4612780	4616780	I need to ask Sil. I'm bringing her up for the second time on tonight's show, but that's okay.
4616780	4619780	I love Sil. I say that every time you mention Sil too.
4619780	4621780	I don't like licorice.
4621780	4623780	You don't like licorice? Are you Dutch, Loki?
4623780	4624780	But you're not Dutch.
4624780	4626780	Well, then maybe that's the thing.
4626780	4630780	I'm not Dutch, but I have a Dutch name because of Dan. Dang it.
4630780	4633780	I hate Starbursts a lot, Brad, from Pod Culture,
4633780	4636780	because they have the stuff in it I'm allergic to, so they make me vomit.
4636780	4639780	The jelly beans are really good though. He's right.
4639780	4642780	They're the same stuff. They make me vomit.
4642780	4646780	Well, I don't know. They don't taste like they don't have the texture of Starbursts at all.
4646780	4652780	But the only ones I can actually eat are the ones that are actually the crystallized, like the jelly bellies are.
4653780	4658780	They seem more like jelly bellies to me than regular jelly beans, but I don't know.
4658780	4661780	I wouldn't risk it. It's not worth risking it. They're not that good.
4661780	4663780	No, it's not worth risking it.
4663780	4669780	But, Dan, I do actually buy him licorice.
4669780	4676780	Even though I cannot stand the smell of it, he is respectful enough to be gracious
4676780	4682780	when I sacrifice my olfactory senses to bring him a treat.
4682780	4686780	He is kind enough to take it to work and not eat it in front of me.
4686780	4690780	Alan will say, I went to the store and I got you a surprise.
4690780	4696780	It's either good and plenty, which I really like, or the Australian licorice that they sell at the store.
4696780	4700780	But, to be fair, I will also buy him mayonnaise. That's love.
4700780	4705780	I bought Dan something awesome. You'll hate it, but I bought him cool because I love him.
4705780	4709780	I also can't be around sriracha because the smell makes my nose break out.
4709780	4710780	Oh, yeah.
4710780	4713780	I got him sriracha mayonnaise.
4714780	4717780	He is a happy, happy Dan.
4717780	4718780	No thanks.
4718780	4722780	I can't have Swedish Fish either because they totally just make me...
4722780	4724780	Swedish Fish are the bomb.
4724780	4725780	Yuck.
4725780	4726780	Alright, anyway.
4726780	4728780	And I hate absinthe.
4728780	4733780	We could talk about candy all night long. I did not have absinthe until...
4733780	4734780	You know what?
4734780	4735780	Dragon Con this year.
4735780	4737780	You know what I brought you last week?
4737780	4739780	And I don't know if you had any of it.
4739780	4740780	I haven't, but I think Alan did.
4740780	4744780	I made vanilla... I'm making a full bottle of vanilla vodka right now.
4744780	4745780	Nice.
4745780	4747780	Alright, look. We could talk about booze. We could talk about candy.
4747780	4750780	You're listening to Orange Booze Radio.
4750780	4752780	We're now CoinTrow Radio.
4752780	4754780	Cause it's orange liqueur.
4754780	4757780	Let's get back into games with the rapid fire news segment.
4757780	4759780	Loki, start us off.
4759780	4760780	Alright.
4760780	4761780	Alright.
4761780	4764780	So, first up, South Park.
4764780	4766780	You know, it's been pushed back and back and back and back.
4766780	4767780	It's finally gone gold.
4767780	4771780	So, South Park The Stick of Truth will actually be releasing on March 6th.
4771780	4773780	Which is only a few weeks away.
4773780	4778780	And they even teased about 13 minutes of gameplay and it looks fantastic.
4778780	4783780	So, that'll be coming out on current gen systems and on PC.
4783780	4785780	It looks like...
4786780	4788780	Was it the...
4788780	4791780	6th is also a European day.
4791780	4794780	I want to say maybe coming out on the 4th over here.
4794780	4798780	Yeah, I'm sorry. The 4th of March for North America.
4798780	4801780	The 6th for Europe.
4801780	4803780	And then, let's see.
4803780	4808780	Gearbox has announced their final DLC for Borderlands 2.
4808780	4812780	And Borderlands 2 is going to be getting two campaigns.
4812780	4816780	So, first, they was, let's see here.
4816780	4821780	featuring Sir Hamlock and it's...
4825780	4827780	Did we lose Loki? We lost you, Loki.
4827780	4830780	I don't know if it's your magic mute button.
4830780	4831780	Hello?
4831780	4832780	Hello?
4832780	4833780	Hi.
4833780	4834780	Welcome back.
4834780	4835780	That's weird.
4835780	4836780	This live thing is weird.
4836780	4839780	Okay, no. Keep going. We lost you for a minute. That was weird.
4839780	4840780	That's strange.
4840780	4847780	Okay, yeah. So, they have a couple new pieces of DLC.
4847780	4851780	One is Sir Hamlock versus the son of CrawlerMax.
4851780	4854780	That's supposed to be coming out, I think, later this year.
4854780	4857780	And then, let's see.
4857780	4863780	They had another one for Valentine's Day recently that was...
4863780	4866780	Oh, I'm sorry. That is the final Borderlands DLC.
4866780	4868780	I was going to say they had one more that just came out.
4868780	4877780	It was for Valentine's Day featuring Mad Moxie and the two rival clans that were in Borderlands 2.
4877780	4880780	I can't remember their names.
4880780	4882780	It's kind of like some hillbilly clans in there.
4882780	4887780	And so you had to kind of bring them together with some forbidden wedding thing.
4887780	4889780	It was pretty funny.
4889780	4892780	But they put that out for Valentine's Day.
4892780	4897780	But this one, I don't think they've given a date yet when this is supposed to be coming out.
4897780	4900780	But it's only supposed to be April 5th.
4900780	4905780	So, $2.99 on April 5th.
4905780	4906780	So, wow.
4906780	4908780	They've been really...
4908780	4912780	Considering that this game came out in 2012, they've really supported it with some DLC.
4912780	4915780	That's for sure.
4915780	4917780	Alright, and then...
4917780	4920780	Let's see, I was going to say last but not least.
4920780	4927780	We have The Witcher 3 is going to be a possibility on Linux.
4927780	4930780	That's suing how well SteamOS does.
4930780	4940780	If it ends up being popular enough, they will go ahead and create a version for SteamBoxes and SteamOS.
4940780	4944780	But their comment of course was,
4944780	4950780	First of all, we have a lot of respect for Steam and we think they are very, very good business guys and good gamer friendly guys.
4950780	4952780	And that's really, really important.
4952780	4959780	We like what they're doing with the SteamBox and if they're able to deliver a cool console, definitely we are interested in having a game there.
4959780	4965780	You know, one of the reasons we have not released Witcher on Linux is that the most...
4965780	4973780	Probably they have to address five different versions of Linux and this is always terrible, the support quality of the game afterwards.
4973780	4975780	The patches, the updates and everything.
4975780	4981780	If Steam will deliver a constant Linux environment and call it SteamOS or anything like that, we'd love to have our games there.
4981780	4984780	Because, you know, most of the people play our games.
4984780	4987780	The more people that play our games, the better for us.
4987780	4995780	So, cool, we'll have to see how that turns out and maybe we'll get Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk 2077 or something like that.
4995780	4997780	I wonder how some of the Linux fans feel about that though.
4997780	5004780	That like, you know, they're waiting for SteamOS to kind of unify it when maybe people are attracted to Linux because it's not that way.
5004780	5005780	You know what I mean?
5005780	5007780	So, hmm.
5007780	5009780	Alright, moving on with some more news.
5009780	5013780	A very interesting statement from Mutant Mudds Deluxe.
5013780	5015780	I don't know if you have played this game.
5015780	5018780	It's on like the 3DS and it's on the Wii U, it's on Steam and all this.
5019780	5026780	But the developer, Renegade Kid, says he has seen the best sales for Mutant Mudds Deluxe on Wii U.
5026780	5027780	Which might be surprising.
5027780	5030780	Better than PSN and Steam combined.
5030780	5032780	He mentioned this on Twitter.
5032780	5038780	And there was also a follow-up tweet that said the 3DS was undoubtedly the most popular platform for Mutant Mudds Deluxe.
5038780	5043780	Which was a free content download on the original Mutant Mudds game for the 3DS.
5043780	5045780	But, yeah.
5045780	5049780	Apparently it's doing very, very well on Wii U, so go figure.
5049780	5053780	I wonder if that's just because there's not a lot else available there.
5053780	5054780	I don't know.
5054780	5055780	Alright.
5055780	5056780	But, yeah.
5056780	5059780	Anyhow, going on to other games.
5059780	5063780	These are some real classics that are coming to Steam.
5063780	5065780	Descent. Do you remember Descent?
5065780	5067780	I had Descent on 14 disks.
5067780	5069780	Yeah.
5069780	5071780	Please insert disc one. Please insert disc two.
5071780	5072780	No, no, no, no.
5072780	5075780	I told you about my friend Avery in Alabama, right?
5075780	5076780	Probably a while ago, yeah.
5076780	5077780	Who built the chair.
5077780	5078780	Mm-hmm.
5078780	5083780	That had, like, two full-sized joysticks, extra things, and all this.
5083780	5085780	Just so he could play Descent.
5085780	5086780	That's awesome.
5086780	5087780	Yeah, I know Descent.
5087780	5089780	But, yeah. It goes full 360 degrees.
5089780	5091780	It's like Doom in 360. That's kind of what Descent is.
5091780	5092780	So, it's awesome.
5092780	5095780	It's actually now on Steam.
5095780	5097780	It's not coming to Steam. It is now on Steam.
5097780	5100780	350. So, no more 14 disks.
5100780	5101780	Have. Must have.
5101780	5102780	Digital download.
5102780	5103780	Must shoot everything.
5103780	5104780	There it is.
5104780	5105780	Descent, by the way.
5105780	5108780	Guess how old Descent is. Uh-oh.
5108780	5109780	Old as balls.
5109780	5111780	19 years old.
5111780	5114780	Older than this show, so, yes.
5114780	5115780	Older than some of our listeners.
5115780	5116780	All right, yeah.
5116780	5118780	Also coming to Steam, however.
5118780	5121780	See, Dark Soccer, I wouldn't hit the buy button on Descent just yet,
5121780	5126780	because then you may not have the money for Ikaruga is coming out on Steam.
5126780	5128780	Do you know how many freaking copies of Ikaruga I have?
5128780	5130780	Well, what's one more?
5130780	5132780	Dan will be the one getting that.
5132780	5134780	I actually already bought BlazBlue.
5134780	5137780	That will be coming out actually on February 18th.
5137780	5139780	So, you have a couple more days.
5139780	5140780	But, yeah.
5140780	5144780	As you might remember, Ikaruga, Dreamcast, GameCube, 360.
5144780	5147780	The Steam version, by the way, is based on the 360 release.
5147780	5151780	And you can just plug in a 360 controller via USB, and voila.
5151780	5153780	It'll magically work. Imagine that.
5153780	5154780	You know what's funny?
5154780	5158780	Dan needs to just put on playthroughs of Ikaruga so he can take a nap.
5158780	5160780	Because the music is so good.
5160780	5164780	Very interesting little experiment going on at Twitch TV.
5164780	5167780	Something called Twitch Plays Pokemon.
5167780	5170780	Yes, it's where you have this Twitch stream,
5170780	5177780	but you actually have the viewers can control the hero of Pokemon Red and Blue
5177780	5180780	by actually putting commands in the chat window.
5180780	5185780	And at one point, there was 10,000 viewers after two days of play,
5185780	5188780	and people just typing A, B, up, down, and so forth.
5188780	5193780	And the Pokemon Master, of course, he just runs around in circles a lot of the time
5193780	5196780	because people can't seem to coordinate how to do it.
5196780	5198780	But, yeah.
5198780	5203780	Apparently, though, viewers did get far enough to get past Misty, the second gym leader.
5203780	5205780	So, it's not all just running around in circles.
5205780	5208780	So, maybe late at night, people have been able to coordinate a little better
5208780	5210780	and be able to battle Misty.
5210780	5212780	I don't know if it's still going. I think it is.
5212780	5214780	You know what? I want to battle Misty for real.
5214780	5216780	We need to get her back on the show so we can battle.
5216780	5217780	October, I believe, is when.
5217780	5220780	Okay, you better come with all of your Pokemon.
5220780	5221780	I'm kidding.
5221780	5223780	I'm trying to see if the video will come up.
5223780	5226780	Oh, God, I probably broke our own stream trying to pull this up.
5226780	5227780	That was done.
5227780	5229780	Okay, yes, it's still going.
5229780	5230780	Good Lord.
5230780	5232780	That's all you get.
5232780	5234780	That slowed my computer to a crawl there.
5234780	5236780	I didn't want to lose our own feed.
5236780	5237780	All right.
5237780	5239780	So, an interesting little experiment.
5239780	5241780	Who knows what game will come next after that?
5241780	5245780	Act F says the update is they currently have four gym badges.
5245780	5248780	So, it might actually beat the game.
5248780	5249780	Who knows?
5249780	5251780	Dark Soccer, your turn.
5251780	5254780	There's some stuff.
5254780	5257780	First of all, this one makes me stupidly happy
5257780	5261780	because what is one game that I have always just gone completely off about?
5261780	5263780	It's Awesometasticness.
5263780	5265780	Fucking Drunken Robot Pornography.
5265780	5266780	Hell yeah.
5266780	5272780	So, on February 19th, it is going live.
5272780	5274780	I have been playing in the early access.
5274780	5278780	That game is fucking amazing, and it's fucking hard.
5278780	5284780	So, it was made by a company called Dejobaan, and it's just awesome.
5284780	5289780	I mean, you can basically just shoot them with everything.
5289780	5297780	It's really a lot of, like, maybe a cross between Oratorio Tengram,
5297780	5301780	Virtual On, and Jumping Flash, and games like that.
5301780	5304780	But it's crazy, and the music is amazing.
5304780	5310780	It's going to retail for 15 bucks, but it may have a Steam discount on launch day.
5310780	5313780	Everyone get this game.
5313780	5315780	It is awesome.
5316780	5322780	So, also, there is another game coming out for the Dreamcast.
5322780	5325780	It's Neo XYX.
5325780	5329780	That is another shooting game. Yay!
5329780	5332780	So, I mean, the Dreamcast is 15 years old.
5332780	5334780	Actually, it's Neo Xixu.
5334780	5337780	That's how it's pronounced, so I said it incorrectly.
5337780	5344780	And it's like Truxton and Batsugun, so it's like those other arcade games.
5344780	5345780	So, yay.
5345780	5347780	And, um, I won.
5347780	5350780	Also, Sonic Boom.
5350780	5355780	I don't know how I feel about this, because Royd Knuckles is just not attractive.
5355780	5362780	There is actually an interview out that has some details about it.
5362780	5363780	So, it's going to be...
5363780	5367780	They're going to be using the Wii U gamepad for map upgrades,
5367780	5372780	and some other functions that they have not completely unveiled.
5372780	5375780	And then, um, all the games...
5375780	5378780	All the levels are connected by story and location.
5378780	5381780	It's supposed to be more organically challenging.
5381780	5384780	It's an adventure style with currency and upgrades.
5384780	5388780	And, yeah, I still don't know how I feel about it, so...
5388780	5393780	But they are taking inspiration from Sonic 2, Sonic Adventure, and Sonic Generations.
5393780	5396780	And those were all good games, so maybe.
5396780	5398780	Maybe it'd be fun.
5398780	5401780	It could be crap, too, so...
5401780	5403780	I'm just being honest.
5403780	5406780	It's a night of honesty. It could be crap.
5406780	5408780	But it might not be.
5408780	5410780	It might be okay.
5410780	5411780	We'll see.
5411780	5413780	Um, are you looking more...
5413780	5414780	Are you looking...
5414780	5420780	Well, I guess the question would be are you looking less forward to the game or the cartoon?
5420780	5423780	I might just hide under my bed when the cartoon comes out.
5423780	5425780	The cartoon didn't look that bad.
5425780	5427780	I think the cartoon's probably getting better than the game.
5427780	5430780	I mean, because their games haven't really been that great to be in with.
5430780	5434780	Oh, and it's Nintendo exclusive, so I'm sure that'll sell somewhere we use systems, right?
5434780	5438780	Yeah, you never know. You never know. Kids. Kids.
5438780	5439780	Maybe.
5439780	5441780	Do kids even care about Sonic, though? That's the thing.
5441780	5444780	Does anyone care anymore about that series?
5444780	5447780	It looks like really bad fan art.
5447780	5449780	It's just...
5449780	5451780	Ugh. Okay, sorry.
5451780	5452780	No, it's fine. It happens.
5452780	5457780	I can't right now. I really have lost the ability to can, so let's continue.
5457780	5461780	Alright, um, I'm gonna get to the frugal question of the week, but for whatever reason I didn't have...
5461780	5464780	I was trying to buy myself a little time because I don't have my little bumper.
5464780	5468780	Well, you know what else I could say since we're having a night of honesty?
5468780	5469780	Sure. Why not?
5469780	5480780	I think that the best ever Sonic thing that has ever come out of anything in the newer era that they did something different with was Sonic Adventure.
5480780	5484780	And then Sonic Adventure 2 came out and it was kind of turd-like.
5484780	5489780	I mean, it had some fun parts, but it was kind of turd-like, but Sonic Generations was really good.
5489780	5495780	It's like, I don't know what's going on. Like, sometimes they smoke, like, something really good and have a great Sonic game.
5495780	5499780	And then sometimes you just get that bad batch of, like...
5499780	5500780	Sonic 2006.
5500780	5502780	Of, like, tainted heroin.
5502780	5504780	Sonic the Bad Batch?
5504780	5507780	Yeah, and they make Sonic the Bad Batch.
5507780	5510780	It's, like, tainted.
5514780	5518780	OrangeLunchRadio.com. Use the passphrase, Frost.
5518780	5521780	All right. I found bumper music, so let's get to the...
5521780	5522780	How was my buying time, Rob?
5522780	5523780	It was good.
5523780	5527780	Hey, it's not a show if we don't talk about tainted heroin.
5535780	5540780	You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together, you get FUGL.
5540780	5545780	It's the FUGL question of the week, and this week is a little more about classic games.
5545780	5548780	Inspired a little bit by our own classic game of the week segment.
5548780	5553780	Look, we have all heard of Super Mario Brothers and Alex Kidd, Legend of Zelda, Phantasy Star.
5553780	5561780	What do you think, however, is a game from the NES and Sega Master System era that has been grossly neglected by time?
5561780	5563780	Let's get to some of the answers here.
5563780	5570780	Ragenator says, most of the good ones haven't been neglected, but Mike Tyson's Punch-Out could have used more sequels.
5570780	5573780	There were two. There was the one on the Super Nintendo and then they did a Wii one.
5573780	5574780	Some people forget about the Wii one.
5574780	5577780	And you can't have Mike Tyson's name on it anymore because he's crazy.
5577780	5578780	That's right.
5578780	5579780	What?
5579780	5586780	Alternatively, T&C Surf Designs, while being somewhat mediocre, could have seen some more love.
5587780	5596780	Nemesis 47 says, it's a Japanese import game on the Genesis, but one that comes to mind is Pulseman on the system along with Ristar and Mutant League.
5596780	5601780	I said Master System, not Genesis, but I guess I'll accept it anyway because I just read it.
5601780	5605780	Awesome Unicorn says, Legend of the Ghost Lion.
5605780	5614780	It was an old NES RPG starring a female protagonist, and it could have created a much larger presence for serious games of the girly edge if others had followed his lead.
5614780	5621780	Kane IM says, Caveman Olympics for the NES. How else are you supposed to hit your friend with a stick?
5621780	5623780	With a stick?
5623780	5628780	But if he says, if we're just going by that time period in general, how about a Zork remake?
5628780	5631780	Dude, Zork was pretty awesome.
5631780	5634780	I wonder who owns the rights to that now. I'm sure it's on Wikipedia or something.
5634780	5639780	But then there was like the Zork, that first CD-ROM game, Zork Returns.
5639780	5642780	There was like Zork Grand Inquisition and all that stuff.
5642780	5649780	For the short time GameTap was really cool, like I played all those Zork games again on there because Zork is cool.
5649780	5656780	Emily C says, Marble Madness is due for a reboot. It could be enhanced with the capabilities of the Wii U or 3DS.
5656780	5661780	Check out a game on the Wii that would actually work on the Wii U called Koro Impa.
5661780	5667780	Because this came up on the show not that long ago. I think Marble Madness is the classic game of the week, but Koro Impa is very, very similar.
5667780	5671780	Well, Koro Impa is more like Super Monkey Ball, I think.
5671780	5675780	Oh, that's a good point too. Well, Super Monkey Ball in turn is very similar too.
5675780	5679780	But yes, Marble Madness was a good game.
5679780	5687780	Dart Tetsuya says, Crystallis, SNK should stop with the fighting game nonsense and give us a sequel.
5687780	5692780	Daniel S. replied and said, Where are my Lolo games at?
5692780	5697780	Where did Lolo go? Did Lolo and Lala get married and go to puzzle heaven?
5697780	5699780	They got stomped flat, now they're being used for Bingo.
5699780	5709780	Degenerate Johnny says, Bad News Baseball. There's something about having pink umpires in this game that made it so addicting.
5709780	5713780	Not to mention, I believe this was the only baseball game on which there were teams for both men and women.
5713780	5717780	If we had the Bad News series today, I would come back to the sports gaming genre.
5717780	5720780	I thought that was Baseball Stars. Maybe it was both.
5720780	5723780	Is it like the Bad News Bears?
5723780	5726780	I think it's inspired without copying, yes.
5727780	5732780	Let's see, Harold the Wonder Dog replied and said, Star Tropics.
5732780	5734780	Yes.
5734780	5736780	Wasn't Star Tropics 2 one of the very last NES games?
5736780	5738780	So was Revenge, yeah.
5738780	5741780	I'm surprised you haven't rebooted that franchise.
5741780	5744780	Ospurr with another Sega Genesis answer.
5744780	5747780	Steph said that Lolo and Lala are Kirby characters.
5747780	5750780	Are they really? I didn't realize that.
5750780	5754780	I guess they do because it's the same studio that ended up making them.
5754780	5757780	Aren't they like Lolo and Lala?
5757780	5762780	I guess that's true, yeah. They're like the king and the queen or something like that.
5762780	5766780	Anyway, moving on, we have...
5766780	5769780	Did I say Ospurr said Ristar?
5769780	5775780	Let's see, which by the way is another Genesis answer. Shame, shame.
5775780	5779780	Katsuhiko J says, Jackal and Iron Tank deserve a sequel or reboot.
5779780	5782780	That's not a real name so you can say the full thing.
5782780	5784780	Oh, well, I... Look.
5784780	5786780	It's after an anime.
5786780	5789780	Anyway, as Joe 100 Matt says, Blades of Steel.
5789780	5795780	It's probably the most important sports game of its time and still that one sports game that people don't mind playing.
5795780	5800780	The last Blades of Steel game was on the N64. I didn't even realize that on N64.
5800780	5802780	But a reboot of the classic will be well received.
5802780	5804780	Chigurh says, EVO.
5804780	5810780	I love that game and our Mormon friends weren't allowed to play it because it was promoting evolution.
5810780	5813780	Really? Really?
5813780	5815780	I think it was pretty awesome though.
5815780	5818780	Get this, get this, Arcadian42.
5818780	5819780	I miss him.
5819780	5823780	Well, get this, get this. He didn't, he was not, he does not know what was gonna be on the show tonight in advance.
5823780	5827780	You know what his answer was? Golvellius.
5827780	5829780	So there you go, Arcadian42.
5829780	5831780	You win some air.
5831780	5835780	You win. He did mention it has some pretty memorable music.
5835780	5836780	It does have good music.
5836780	5837780	There you go.
5837780	5838780	It's fucking weird.
5838780	5841780	B replied and said, I was also gonna say Star Tropics, but here's a few more.
5841780	5846780	Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Tailspin, Darkwing Duck, Adventures in the Magic Kingdom,
5846780	5850780	Battletoads, Casino Kid, Wall Street Kid, and River City Ransom.
5850780	5851780	That's a pretty lengthy list.
5851780	5854780	But yeah, those Capcom Disney games were the bomb.
5854780	5856780	Well, they did end up doing DuckTales.
5856780	5857780	DuckTales?
5857780	5860780	So if maybe, there's a chance, Ryan. There's a chance.
5860780	5864780	For the record, I'm actually looking to see if Golvellius is still in the store.
5864780	5869780	Dr. Noir says, the very first Western RPG I played was Sword and Sorcery,
5869780	5873780	and the character customization and the horribly difficult puzzles made for a very exciting challenge.
5873780	5876780	It is, and it's only two bucks.
5876780	5880780	Hitstun says, let's see a Sunsoft NES compilation.
5880780	5885780	Everybody knows Blaster Master and the Batman games, but more people should play Super Spy Hunter.
5885780	5892780	Known as Battle Formula in Japan, its aimable second gun pushed cross-country, excuse me, vehicular combat to its limits.
5892780	5898780	At the title screen, press A, B, select start to play a roulette game to decide how many lives you start with.
5898780	5901780	You might have up to 12 lives, but you might be stuck with just one life.
5901780	5906780	You know what was another Sunsoft NES game that came up on Twitter today in random conversation?
5906780	5907780	Adventure Island?
5907780	5911780	No, that wasn't Sunsoft. That was, uh, no, that was Hal.
5911780	5913780	Hal, the B, Hudson.
5913780	5914780	Hudson, yeah.
5915780	5924780	Fester's Quest, which was basically Blaster Master's overhead stuff without the car stuff, which kind of made it not as good, but yeah.
5924780	5927780	Dando said, I'd have to say River City Ransom and Marble Madness.
5927780	5931780	There was a great GBA remake of River City Ransom, but I need more.
5931780	5938780	Renee said, on the NES, Wampum, which is a Native American themed Mega Man clone.
5938780	5942780	I didn't realize, actually no, I think I have heard of that game.
5942780	5945780	And Amanda R. replied and said, the Lufia series.
5946780	5947780	So there you go.
5948780	5950780	Very good answers over on Facebook.
5950780	5955780	But wait, there's more, because we have to get to the Google Plus answers, of which we have just a handful here.
5955780	5959780	Flaco Jones, who was gonna be here tonight, but got sick.
5959780	5960780	So get better soon, Flaco.
5960780	5961780	Stop getting the plague.
5961780	5963780	Yeah, we will have him on the show in the future.
5963780	5965780	He was supposed to be here tonight, but sadly couldn't make it.
5965780	5969780	Flaco Jones said, I love the NES ports of the Mac Venture games,
5969780	5974780	but while most people liked Uninvited or Shadow Gate most, my favorite was Deja Vu.
5974780	5977780	Still one of my all-time favorite games, despite the cheap deaths.
5977780	5980780	Well, they are doing a Shadow Gate remake, for what it's worth.
5980780	5984780	I know Deja Vu is your favorite, but they have that Kickstarter for Shadow Gate.
5984780	5985780	So that's coming soon.
5985780	5989780	I was, I don't know, I kicked like 60 bucks to that game or something to get my name in the credits.
5989780	5991780	So, excited to see that.
5991780	5993780	Oh my god, it just occurred to me.
5993780	5995780	I can afford to kickstart now.
5995780	5996780	Awesome.
5996780	5998780	Well, change your password though, because you know.
5998780	5999780	Yeah, and all that.
5999780	6000780	Yeah, and all that fuckery.
6000780	6003780	I don't even think I've ever done, bought anything on there yet.
6003780	6004780	Mmm.
6004780	6006780	Retertainment says, Skate or Die.
6006780	6007780	Yeah, I'll call that game.
6007780	6009780	Didn't they have Ski or Die?
6009780	6010780	I thought they did.
6010780	6011780	Was like, kind of the sequel.
6011780	6012780	I think they did.
6012780	6014780	There was Ski or Die, I think came out later.
6014780	6015780	Mmm.
6015780	6018780	And lastly, Act F says, RC Pro-Am.
6018780	6019780	Ha ha.
6019780	6021780	That game doesn't get the love it deserves.
6021780	6025780	It's fun and challenging, and it could seriously use a new version.
6026780	6029780	I thought you were about to say it seriously needed a neutering.
6029780	6035780	Well, you guys, those were really good answers all around, but I'm going to express my disappointment with all of you.
6035780	6036780	None of them said the game.
6036780	6038780	None of them said the correct answer.
6038780	6039780	None of them.
6039780	6045780	Not a single one of them said the correct answer to this question, which is the Guardian Legend.
6048780	6051780	Fail. Fail. Fail.
6051780	6053780	Good lord.
6053780	6057780	Loki, would you answer the Guardian Legend as well, or do you have your own answer for that?
6057780	6060780	Oh, I think Guardian Legend is good.
6060780	6061780	There you go, that's the correct answer.
6061780	6063780	I would probably say, um...
6063780	6064780	The Guardian Legend.
6066780	6067780	Sure, because I can't remember.
6067780	6068780	More Space Harrier.
6068780	6069780	I like Breakthrough.
6069780	6070780	Breakthrough is kind of fun.
6070780	6071780	Okay.
6071780	6073780	I don't know if it was a really great game.
6073780	6074780	Buy it at Commando.
6075780	6078780	Oh, except that new one they did on the 360 and stuff was not that good.
6078780	6079780	You know what we need a new one of?
6079780	6080780	I don't care.
6080780	6082780	I got them on PC too during the Steam sale.
6082780	6084780	But the remakes were really good.
6084780	6085780	Yeah, Dark Saga?
6085780	6086780	A new Fantasy Zone.
6086780	6088780	Ah, that'd be fun.
6088780	6089780	Yep.
6089780	6090780	There you go.
6090780	6093780	And not just the re-releases like they did with the Sega Ages.
6093780	6095780	We need a new Fantasy Zone.
6095780	6096780	I would love to see...
6096780	6099780	A game I was randomly thinking about today was Life Force.
6099780	6101780	Or, you know, Salamander, if you will.
6101780	6103780	We haven't really seen that series in a while.
6103780	6105780	So, I'd like to see that.
6105780	6107780	But we're getting other Gradius stuff.
6107780	6108780	Have we?
6108780	6109780	When was the last time we had a Gradius game?
6109780	6111780	Gradius 5 was the last one.
6111780	6112780	Gradius 5 was the last one.
6112780	6113780	That was a while ago.
6113780	6114780	That was PlayStation 2, right?
6114780	6116780	That was a while ago.
6116780	6118780	That's what I want.
6118780	6122780	Anyhow, but Konami would rather make two-hour Metal Gear games.
6122780	6123780	Anyhow.
6123780	6124780	Two-hour?
6124780	6125780	No, two...
6125780	6128780	Metal Gear games with two-hour endings.
6128780	6130780	Well, no, there's that.
6130780	6132780	There was a whole controversy last week about the...
6132780	6134780	It's basically the prologue game.
6134780	6136780	But anyway, I'm not gonna go there.
6136780	6137780	It's old news.
6137780	6139780	They said it's like four hours now.
6139780	6142780	I think they had another playthrough that didn't do any of the side stuff.
6142780	6143780	And they said four hours.
6143780	6144780	Oh, wow.
6144780	6145780	Alright.
6145780	6146780	Yeah.
6146780	6147780	Let's move on with some other news.
6147780	6148780	This week's news, Loki.
6148780	6149780	This week's news.
6149780	6150780	This week's news?
6150780	6152780	Okay, I'll try.
6152780	6157780	So, we talked about, I think, before that there was some information leaked out about
6157780	6159780	a bunch of different things that were supposed to be coming out.
6159780	6161780	This is from NeoGaf and stuff.
6161780	6165780	And one of which was the Halo 2 Anniversary Edition.
6165780	6168780	Kind of like the HD remake that they did of Halo 1.
6168780	6172780	Well, now there's even more fuel to that that's supposed to be coming out this year.
6172780	6175780	I think they said November was the original leak.
6175780	6179780	And this is coming from the actual voice actor for Master Chief.
6179780	6184780	Saying that, yeah, there's gonna be a new game.
6184780	6189780	Something like, I wouldn't expect anything until 2015 for Halo 5.
6189780	6194780	He says, but what you can look forward to this year is an Anniversary Edition of Halo 2.
6195780	6196780	So.
6196780	6200780	Well, now you know what's interesting about this being pretty much confirmed?
6200780	6205780	Is that we had those rumors a few weeks ago from that, you know, the Xbox leak or whatever
6205780	6207780	that was posted on NeoGaf.
6207780	6208780	And it had all this other stuff.
6208780	6209780	Yeah.
6209780	6210780	Was it us?
6212780	6213780	It was all the other...
6213780	6214780	Is it in boat or...
6214780	6215780	Us boat or something like that.
6215780	6218780	The disc list, Xbox One and all this stuff.
6218780	6223780	And, you know, I mean, it does sort of make you go, hmm, you know, that's one.
6223780	6226780	But I did, I remember being a little bit critical of that post in the past
6226780	6229780	because I was like, these are all safe bets it's making.
6229780	6232780	So wouldn't Halo 2 Anniversary Edition be kind of a safe bet too?
6232780	6234780	Yeah, but it is, it's okay.
6234780	6235780	It's interesting.
6235780	6241780	So it gets that, that little post gets a little more credit, but I'm still a little, so.
6242780	6243780	Yeah.
6244780	6247780	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com said it was Seaboat.
6247780	6250780	And I think it turned out that Seaboat was a mod who hated Microsoft.
6250780	6253780	They unearthed all that crap a few weeks ago, I think.
6253780	6255780	Oh, internet drama.
6257780	6258780	Girl.
6258780	6259780	That's all I have to say.
6259780	6263780	The internet has more drama than Dark Soccer's Animal Crossing Village
6263780	6264780	and that's saying something right there.
6264780	6269780	My village is pretty, well, now that that bitch Ed's gone, then I don't have any more drama.
6269780	6271780	I don't know Dark Soccer, you've been...
6271780	6276780	Except for Isabel's crack habit because, you know, she never sleeps.
6277780	6278780	That too.
6278780	6279780	I love Isabel, I really do.
6280780	6285780	All right, well, there was a little exploit on PlayStation Network this week
6285780	6291780	where somebody was able to exploit the 14-day PlayStation Plus trial subscription
6291780	6294780	into about a 21-year subscription.
6294780	6301780	Basically, they signed in and they got the free 14-day PS Plus trial
6301780	6304780	and they spammed the offer over and over and over again.
6304780	6309780	They did this through the PlayStation 4 and, yeah, now this guy is a member until 2035.
6309780	6312780	There has not been really a comment from Sony on this yet.
6312780	6315780	I imagine they had to have closed this loophole up by now.
6315780	6318780	But, yeah, you can't already have a membership in order to see this.
6318780	6320780	So if you're already a PlayStation Plus member, you can't do this.
6320780	6324780	Plus, if a bunch of people jump in on this, then Sony's really going to crack down.
6324780	6326780	They're going to take away all those trials.
6326780	6333780	But it does beg the question, like, how the hell did something this easy get exploited like this?
6333780	6336780	I mean, this doesn't seem that hard that you could take a 14-day trial,
6336780	6339780	which I guess was specifically branded for Outlast,
6339780	6341780	and make it go on and on and on and on.
6341780	6344780	I mean, doesn't this get tested somewhere along the line?
6344780	6346780	Huh?
6346780	6349780	Loki, did you try to extend your...
6349780	6351780	Oh, you don't have PlayStation 4, though, yet, huh?
6351780	6353780	I didn't try it.
6353780	6355780	And, you know, I don't know.
6355780	6358780	It would be wrong. Stealing is wrong.
6358780	6361780	But it's an experiment for news.
6361780	6364780	That's true. I'm pretty sure it's closed up now.
6364780	6365780	We're doing it for the people.
6365780	6368780	I know. I know.
6368780	6369780	Just being honest.
6369780	6372780	I want to see what happens next week, though, if that guy got it all taken away,
6372780	6374780	or if he got the ban hammer.
6374780	6375780	Probably a combination.
6375780	6377780	We ban you. Although, I mean, he didn't hack it.
6377780	6380780	He just exploited it. There's a huge difference.
6380780	6385780	You know, if you just abused something that was there for the taking,
6385780	6388780	did he really steal anything?
6388780	6389780	It's an ethical question.
6389780	6390780	They will say yes.
6390780	6393780	They will say yes, but we'll see.
6393780	6396780	All right. Moving on. DarkSakura.
6396780	6399780	Oh, I've got stuff for you.
6399780	6403780	There is a guy in Oslo who killed a bunch of people once,
6403780	6405780	and so he's in prison now.
6405780	6408780	His name is Anders Breivik, which I'm just laughing because it's Anders
6408780	6412780	for anyone who's played Dragon Age 2.
6412780	6414780	Because of the character in there also went crazy.
6414780	6418780	Anyway, he killed 77 people in Oslo, Norway,
6418780	6421780	and he's calling himself a human rights activist now
6421780	6424780	because he's complaining that he only gets to play kids' video games
6424780	6427780	while the other inmates gets to play grown-up video games.
6427780	6428780	He's quoted as saying,
6428780	6430780	Other inmates have access to adult games
6430780	6433780	while I only have the right to play less interesting kids' games.
6433780	6437780	One example is Rayman Revolution, a game aimed at three-year-olds.
6437780	6439780	He says he behaves better than most prisoners
6439780	6442780	and deserves more liberties because of this,
6442780	6446780	and that he considers himself a human rights activist.
6446780	6450780	So you don't give people the right to kill people.
6450780	6451780	You don't give people the right to live.
6451780	6452780	You take that away from them,
6452780	6456780	but you think you get rights to play video games that you want to.
6456780	6458780	You want to know what's also shitty about this?
6458780	6462780	He's serving a 21-year sentence, which is the maximum in Norway.
6462780	6464780	Isn't this the guy that killed all those kids
6464780	6466780	that were at the leadership camp or something?
6466780	6467780	Isn't this that guy?
6467780	6469780	Fuck that guy.
6469780	6472780	Why is he getting to play a video game at all?
6472780	6474780	He should sit in the corner and think about what he's done
6474780	6477780	for a very, very, very long time, like eternity.
6477780	6479780	According to Norway, that's 21 years.
6479780	6480780	Oh my gosh.
6480780	6484780	But his other complaint is that the chair in his cell is not up to his standards,
6484780	6487780	and he would like to have access to a PC instead of a typewriter.
6487780	6489780	Guess what? Too bad.
6489780	6492780	Someone send this guy to prison in Korea, okay?
6492780	6493780	North Korea.
6493780	6495780	I'm sorry, specifically North Korea. My bad.
6495780	6498780	I'm going to look this guy up, so keep going,
6498780	6501780	and I'm going to look him up to make sure this is who I think it is.
6501780	6505780	I see the picture there. I'm pretty sure it's that guy.
6505780	6507780	What an ass.
6507780	6509780	So yeah, and the chat room is backing me up there.
6509780	6511780	SJ100Matt says, yes it is, Robin.
6511780	6516780	SJ100Matt also says, I'm sorry, but why are any of them playing games to begin with?
6516780	6520780	Marissa made a good point that they renew the sentences for five years at a time
6520780	6523780	if they're determined to be a dangerous society, which, yeah,
6523780	6525780	if you kill that many people.
6525780	6528780	He bombed government buildings in Oslo,
6528780	6531780	and then he had the mass shooting at the Workers' Youth League.
6531780	6534780	Yeah, no. This guy needs to not be playing video games at all.
6534780	6536780	That's a privilege.
6536780	6537780	Yeah.
6539780	6540780	Weird.
6540780	6545780	He also is opposed to feminism and is an extreme Zionist,
6545780	6548780	which gives all the rest of the people who are Zionists a bad name.
6548780	6551780	And is not somebody whose name should ever be uttered again.
6551780	6552780	He should be forgotten about.
6552780	6554780	Yeah, banned from OLR.
6554780	6555780	Yeah, I mean.
6555780	6557780	Banned from everything.
6557780	6558780	Gross.
6560780	6563780	Night of honesty, scorpions at the ass.
6563780	6570780	Let's talk about someone a bit more sane, Loki.
6570780	6572780	All right.
6572780	6578780	Peter Molyneux basically saying that, you know, talking,
6578780	6581780	I think this is probably coming from the fact that, you know,
6581780	6585780	he was looking at the Dungeon Keeper, you know, mobile game,
6585780	6589780	which is kind of like, yeah, what did they do to my game?
6589780	6593780	But basically saying that Goddess is going to be a,
6593780	6597780	not a free to play game, but an invest to play game.
6597780	6603780	Basically saying, you know, there cannot be a term that is less true.
6603780	6608780	What we want is a new term and that term is more like invest to play.
6608780	6612780	What we're really doing is we're tempting people, or what are we really doing?
6612780	6615780	We're attempting people to invest some of their money into the game.
6616780	6621780	And I guess it's kind of basically saying that they're incentivizing people
6621780	6626780	to want to get the in-app purchases or in-game purchases and that kind of stuff.
6628780	6634780	You know, to tempt people to think about being proud and to invest.
6634780	6637780	Before we even talk about monetization,
6637780	6641780	we want players to feel like Goddess is a hobby and not just a game.
6642780	6645780	And then of course commenting on Dungeon Keeper,
6645780	6649780	yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks,
6649780	6652780	talking about the free to play formula,
6652780	6654780	yeah, I'm worried about that, but the risks are worth taking.
6654780	6656780	We could layer it in.
6656780	6661780	It takes six days to build this house and maybe we would make a shitload of money,
6661780	6664780	but that's not my ambition for games.
6664780	6669780	Yeah, because it was completely broken, that Dungeon Keeper game,
6669780	6674780	and he's got to be disappointed what they did to his original IP.
6674780	6677780	I thought Goddess was supposed to be like $9.99.
6677780	6680780	Like, why are they now talking about invest to play or whatever?
6680780	6684780	Like, I didn't, I thought this was a game that always was supposed to be,
6684780	6686780	or are not enough people buying it or something.
6686780	6689780	I think maybe they want to make more money.
6689780	6693780	You know, maybe this is kind of like DLC or something.
6693780	6695780	Hmm, maybe.
6695780	6699780	All right, well, moving on to a story that never seems to die,
6699780	6702780	it's about 38 Studios, remember when they,
6702780	6705780	and you know, with all due respect,
6705780	6708780	because I do understand that Curt Schilling a couple weeks ago
6708780	6711780	had announced that he had cancer, you know, which sucks,
6711780	6713780	fuck cancer, period.
6713780	6715780	So I'm not saying all this to be mean,
6715780	6718780	I'm just saying this to be very matter of fact,
6718780	6720780	about the 38 Studios settlement bill,
6720780	6723780	because obviously 38 Studios,
6723780	6725780	there's not really a nice way for me to put it.
6725780	6728780	It failed spectacularly, and a lot of money, you know,
6728780	6729780	was put up by the state,
6729780	6731780	and it's kind of one of those tough lessons learned,
6731780	6733780	and you know, they didn't make it back.
6733780	6736780	So anyhow, the Rhode Island House of Representatives
6736780	6742780	actually passed this bill that's going to move on this out-of-court settlement.
6742780	6745780	The bill passed in a vote of 53 to 16.
6745780	6748780	It will protect the defendants who settle from lawsuits filed by codefendants
6748780	6751780	over the damages those codefendants are found liable for.
6751780	6754780	So in other words, the bill encourages settlements and so forth,
6754780	6757780	so if a 38 Studios person settles with the state,
6757780	6761780	they can't get those damages from any other 38 Studios official
6761780	6764780	tied up in proceedings, so that bill is going to be signed.
6764780	6771780	That bill goes along with the default on the $75 million loan
6771780	6778780	that they gave to 38 Studios, where the state, I guess,
6778780	6781780	they default on the loan, and Rhode Island gets off the hook
6781780	6784780	for $12.5 million of payment.
6784780	6787780	So I guess they basically just passed a bill that said,
6787780	6792780	we're not going to pay the bill.
6792780	6794780	That's kind of ironic.
6794780	6796780	Isn't it?
6796780	6797780	I want to do that.
6797780	6799780	Isn't that great when government finally does something,
6799780	6804780	and in this case it is, all right, we're going to vote majority
6804780	6807780	that we're not going to pay the bills.
6807780	6809780	That's just like the unemployment thing that happened.
6809780	6810780	I won't go there.
6810780	6812780	I thought that was federal government.
6812780	6814780	Well, that's state or federal.
6814780	6817780	Neither one of them is working.
6817780	6822780	So anyhow, it's all broken.
6822780	6824780	Fix it, Dark Sakura.
6824780	6825780	Fix it.
6825780	6827780	Oh, fuck.
6827780	6829780	How about I just do other stuff?
6829780	6830780	All right, how about you read some emails,
6830780	6832780	because every week you guys send us emails,
6832780	6834780	and for one more week you can send them to Mailbag
6834780	6837780	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6837780	6839780	Here we go, the emails.
6839780	6843780	So of note, if you want to be the very last email ever
6843780	6845780	at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
6845780	6846780	this is the week to do it.
6846780	6847780	Do not delay.
6847780	6848780	Yeah.
6848780	6850780	But we do have, what, one email tonight, two emails?
6850780	6851780	We have two.
6851780	6852780	Two?
6852780	6853780	There was only one earlier.
6853780	6855780	Yeah, well, someone got sneaky.
6855780	6856780	All right.
6856780	6859780	Sneaky, sneaky monkey.
6859780	6862780	Dear OLR, with another Valentine's Day coming,
6862780	6865780	I have heard many people discussing their favorite video game relationships.
6865780	6869780	While it's very easy to come up with examples of the types of relationships
6869780	6873780	that will go down in history, side note, Cecil and Rosa forever,
6873780	6877780	I am writing today about other types of relationships in video games,
6877780	6881780	the relationships that are either doomed or nonexistent.
6881780	6884780	Sorry.
6884780	6887780	Personally, my favorite depiction of unrequited love in a video game
6887780	6891780	is from Luthia to Rise of the Sinistrals.
6891780	6894780	The relationship between the characters of Maxim and Tia
6894780	6897780	has really touched me in the dozen or so times I've played the game.
6897780	6900780	Tia, a small-town crybaby, leaves her life behind
6900780	6902780	to follow the man of her dreams on his quest.
6902780	6905780	Over the first half of the game, Tia has to come to terms with the fact
6905780	6910780	that Maxim always is and always will be an adventurer with no plans of settling down.
6910780	6914780	Soon after Maxim falls for the first leotard-clad battle mage to join the party,
6914780	6917780	Tia decides to move on with her life and give up adventuring.
6917780	6920780	As a child, I've never paid much attention to the character of Tia,
6920780	6923780	but I've been impressed on subsequent playthroughs
6923780	6925780	by the frank depiction of Tia's feelings.
6925780	6927780	So I pose to you this question.
6927780	6930780	What are some of your favorite dysfunctional relationships in video games?
6930780	6934780	Thanks always for the excellent show, yours truly, Awesome Unicorn.
6934780	6938780	Well, thanks for being awesome, Awesome Unicorn.
6938780	6942780	Dysfunctional relationships in games, wow.
6942780	6944780	Um, um...
6944780	6945780	How about...
6945780	6946780	Chell and GLaDOS.
6946780	6947780	That's a pretty dysfunctional...
6947780	6949780	Hey, he said relationship.
6949780	6951780	And relationships can be friendships.
6951780	6952780	That's right.
6952780	6954780	They can be parental.
6954780	6956780	You did not say romantic.
6956780	6958780	So, Chell and GLaDOS.
6958780	6961780	Um, well, how about that whole story in Gone Home?
6961780	6963780	But that wasn't really dysfunctional.
6963780	6964780	It was just kinda, you know, sad.
6964780	6967780	Um, how about, um, no, for real though.
6967780	6969780	What about, like, Mario and Princess Peach?
6969780	6970780	For real.
6970780	6971780	For real.
6971780	6974780	What the heck kind of relationship is that going on there?
6974780	6977780	Like, is it, like, what is it even?
6977780	6980780	Like, you kinda think it's romantic between Mario and Peach,
6980780	6982780	but then it seems platonic in other games.
6982780	6985780	And wouldn't it, I mean, if the thing between Mario and Peach was romantic,
6985780	6989780	wouldn't it be weird that sometimes it's, like, his brother that comes in to save the day?
6989780	6990780	Like, is there a whole...
6990780	6994780	That's kinda, like, someone explain the relationship of the Marioverse to me,
6994780	6996780	because I think it's a little weird.
6997780	6998780	Just saying.
6998780	6999780	Yeah.
6999780	7000780	I shouldn't say weird.
7000780	7001780	It's modern.
7001780	7002780	It's very modern.
7002780	7003780	Yeah.
7004780	7012780	Well, in that, I honestly have a big problem with people expecting there to be romantic subplot in games.
7012780	7019780	And I just wanna see, you know, I wanna see people who are really close,
7019780	7022780	really tight friends without other people fucking shipping them.
7022780	7023780	And, no, no, no.
7023780	7025780	I don't have a problem with people shipping.
7025780	7026780	Okay?
7026780	7027780	That, it's gonna happen.
7027780	7028780	I'm fine with it.
7029780	7037780	But I would still like for the shippers out there to accept that some people would like a canonical response
7037780	7041780	that does not involve two characters fucking.
7041780	7044780	They could be romantic friendships, all of that.
7044780	7046780	I just don't want the fucking involved.
7046780	7049780	Sorry, the instant you said shipping, I was like,
7049780	7054780	you know, the shepherd, or the romance between shepherd and Jack is very interesting.
7054780	7056780	Oh, did you do that one with...
7056780	7057780	I've seen it.
7057780	7061780	I've watched all the YouTubes, and I'm like, that's a very interesting relationship in that game.
7061780	7063780	I mean, yes, it's romantic, but it is.
7063780	7069780	It's also kind of like, it's a very interesting depiction of like, it's not,
7069780	7072780	like, you get the sense that that relationship is really about the Nookie.
7072780	7073780	Yeah.
7073780	7074780	More than anything.
7074780	7075780	She's angry and likes to fuck.
7075780	7076780	Yeah, exactly.
7076780	7078780	It's very interesting to see that depicted in games.
7078780	7080780	Like, they just wanna hook up.
7080780	7082780	But it does get serious.
7082780	7084780	It does, depending on how you go with it, too.
7084780	7086780	But also, she kind of grows up a bit.
7086780	7091780	So, I do get weirded out by the dating tally thing,
7091780	7094780	because I always think of her as the little sister type, and no.
7094780	7098780	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
7098780	7101780	Bobby Blackwolf says, there is no romantic subplot in flappy vog.
7101780	7102780	Hallelujah.
7102780	7106780	Except for the love affair with the podcaster's face and the wall.
7106780	7108780	Yeah.
7108780	7113780	ST100Matt asks, are Mario and Peach even officially a couple?
7113780	7115780	I don't think so.
7115780	7117780	AwesomeUnicorn in our chat room.
7117780	7120780	He's actually there and says, it was a tough question for on the spot,
7120780	7122780	so I'll accept any relationships.
7122780	7124780	Mario's just in it for the cakes.
7124780	7125780	Yeah.
7125780	7131780	I honestly, I've never once seen a romantic relationship at all
7131780	7132780	between Mario and Peach.
7132780	7134780	I never saw it happen.
7134780	7139780	I think he is a loyal servant, deciding to relocate from, you know,
7139780	7143780	his beloved, somewhere in New York-ish place,
7143780	7148780	and living in the romantic, fantastical Mushroom Kingdom,
7148780	7151780	where he actually gets to do a really important job
7151780	7154780	instead of pull stuck shit out of people's pipes.
7154780	7159780	Loki, any relationships that you can think of that are strange in games?
7163780	7165780	No.
7165780	7167780	That's fair. It's a tough question.
7167780	7169780	It's not, you know, you gotta be a little more prepared for that one,
7169780	7171780	but that's a really good question.
7171780	7174780	I'd be curious if we get, like, follow-up emails with that.
7174780	7177780	I'm curious what some of your favorites are.
7177780	7178780	One more email, you said?
7178780	7180780	Yeah, there was one more.
7180780	7184780	By the way, Shepherd Garris. All the way.
7184780	7185780	That's not dysfunctional.
7185780	7188780	No, theirs is hot.
7188780	7189780	Okay.
7189780	7191780	Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican.
7191780	7192780	Act deft.
7192780	7193780	Hola.
7193780	7195780	I've had this question in my head since the Fugu question
7195780	7197780	for February 2nd, Bull Night,
7197780	7199780	and I thought I would share it with you.
7199780	7201780	A lot of gamers and geeks don't like sports,
7201780	7204780	whether they legitimately hate them or just don't give a puck.
7204780	7205780	Haha.
7205780	7208780	But we all have a favorite sports video game.
7208780	7211780	I hate export, but I love game about export, so why is that?
7211780	7213780	Why do people sometimes diss on sports,
7213780	7215780	but at the same time they love games like NBA Jam,
7215780	7218780	Blades of Steel, and Mario sports games, et cetera?
7218780	7221780	I could even include stuff like Wii Sports
7221780	7223780	and such that resemble traditional sports a bit more.
7223780	7224780	Well, that's all for now.
7224780	7226780	Hopefully you're having a great night, like always.
7226780	7227780	See you.
7227780	7228780	Deft as kabrown.
7228780	7231780	Sometimes it's not so much the sport,
7231780	7233780	but maybe the sport culture.
7233780	7235780	Yes, it is totally the sport culture.
7235780	7239780	Well, for me, it's like, you know how I get about when people hype movies
7239780	7241780	and it just makes me not want to see them?
7241780	7243780	I'm the same way about sports,
7243780	7245780	because the more I hear people just like,
7247780	7251780	I don't, and to be honest, I don't dislike a lot of sports.
7251780	7253780	I'm just kind of apathetic about a lot of them.
7253780	7255780	But yeah, there's some sports video games I enjoy.
7255780	7257780	But to be fair and to be complete,
7257780	7259780	I've been to some basketball games.
7259780	7261780	We do have a basketball team here in Sacramento.
7261780	7263780	It's the only professional sports team we have.
7263780	7267780	And they've gone ten ways to Sunday
7267780	7270780	to make sure they're going to keep them here for better or for worse.
7270780	7272780	It's a very controversial thing here, but I'm not going to get into it.
7272780	7276780	But I've been to a few Kings games, and I've had a good time.
7276780	7277780	I have a problem.
7277780	7278780	I've enjoyed myself.
7278780	7279780	With something Rage Nader just said.
7279780	7280780	What?
7280780	7281780	Mario gets a bum rap.
7281780	7283780	He saves Peach's ass.
7284780	7285780	God only knows how many times.
7285780	7286780	Oh no.
7286780	7287780	Yet he gets nowhere with her.
7287780	7288780	Not even a kiss.
7288780	7289780	Uh oh.
7289780	7290780	What does she owe him?
7290780	7292780	She owes him nothing.
7292780	7295780	She thanks him, yes, and gives him a fucking place to live.
7295780	7298780	Just because a guy does something nice for a woman
7298780	7300780	does not mean she has to put out.
7300780	7301780	Fuck you.
7303780	7305780	She does give him flowers.
7305780	7307780	Okay, she gave him something.
7307780	7311780	But it doesn't mean that any time a guy does something nice for a woman
7311780	7312780	that she has to put out.
7312780	7313780	No, she doesn't.
7313780	7315780	She only has to put out if she wants to put out.
7315780	7316780	The end.
7316780	7319780	Well, now, okay, to be fair, though, in his defense, he didn't say
7319780	7321780	why don't they ever have sex.
7321780	7322780	Just a little kiss.
7322780	7323780	Have a little kiss on the cheek.
7323780	7325780	No, she doesn't owe him any of that.
7325780	7327780	She does not owe him a damn thing.
7330780	7331780	All right.
7332780	7335780	That is what's wrong with guys.
7336780	7337780	Not all guys.
7337780	7338780	Not all guys.
7338780	7339780	You're cool.
7340780	7342780	Loki's okay, too.
7343780	7344780	I guess.
7345780	7346780	Loki, I think you're cool.
7346780	7348780	Loki, did you want to say anything on the sports game email?
7349780	7350780	No.
7350780	7351780	Fair enough.
7351780	7353780	Then let's get to the FUs of the week.
7353780	7354780	I don't know.
7354780	7356780	Dark Soccer has started a little early over there.
7356780	7359780	And I hate the term friend zone because it just makes it look like
7359780	7360780	being friends is bad.
7361780	7362780	Being friends is great.
7362780	7363780	I like having friends.
7363780	7365780	Unless all you're interested in is fucking someone
7365780	7367780	and then that's not a friendship.
7367780	7368780	You know what?
7368780	7370780	I love having women as just friends.
7370780	7372780	There's nothing wrong with that.
7372780	7375780	I love having everybody as just friends except for my husband.
7376780	7377780	And I love my husband.
7377780	7379780	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7394780	7396780	Fuck you to the patriarchy.
7398780	7401780	If you are for equality, you are for feminism.
7401780	7402780	That's why we need it.
7402780	7406780	Because of people saying that Pete should put out.
7406780	7408780	She doesn't have to put out.
7408780	7409780	She doesn't have to give a kiss.
7409780	7410780	She doesn't have to do anything.
7410780	7413780	She is a strong, independent woman who don't need no man.
7414780	7418780	Well, if she's that strong...
7418780	7420780	Hey, she was a main character in Mario 2.
7420780	7423780	Why does she keep getting kidnapped by Bowser?
7423780	7425780	I mean, surely she would have set a trap.
7425780	7428780	A strong woman would have set a trap for Bowser at this point.
7428780	7431780	Okay, she's moderately independent.
7431780	7434780	But she doesn't lift weights because she was raised in privilege.
7434780	7436780	She's a privileged white girl.
7437780	7441780	So she doesn't think anything bad will ever happen to her until it happens to her.
7443780	7444780	What?
7444780	7447780	Does Princess Peach have an Instagram?
7447780	7448780	Probably.
7448780	7450780	And wears glasses in her spare time.
7450780	7452780	She's a privileged white girl.
7453780	7454780	And?
7455780	7463780	She has to rely on poor Mario with his weight problem.
7465780	7467780	I can't do this with a straight face.
7468780	7473780	Just because he doesn't fit the standard of aesthetics for guys
7473780	7476780	does not make him any less valuable as a human being.
7477780	7480780	When he lands on someone, he lands on them.
7481780	7484780	Loki, what's your F.U. of the week?
7484780	7487780	Uh, F.U. of the things breaking.
7487780	7492780	Like, you know, my laptop and then knew it's even better.
7492780	7497780	So I decided to, you know, play some games during Josh's nap.
7497780	7500780	And my chair breaks.
7502780	7504780	You're not having a lot of luck, are you?
7504780	7506780	We'll get you some duct tape.
7506780	7507780	By the way...
7508780	7510780	The bolt's breaking out of it.
7511780	7513780	In chat? What'd he say?
7513780	7517780	Princess Peach shows up to her security detail ten minutes late holding a Starbucks.
7517780	7519780	That's why she always gets kidnapped.
7519780	7520780	Alright, look.
7520780	7523780	My F.U. of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.
7523780	7526780	F.U. to screwing up my sleep schedule.
7526780	7528780	Because you know what I really, really, really like?
7528780	7529780	Sleep.
7529780	7534780	Sleep, in fact, I would go so far to say, and I might piss Jamie off with this, but I don't care.
7534780	7536780	Sleep might be better than tacos.
7536780	7537780	Just saying.
7537780	7539780	No, I think sleep is better than tacos.
7539780	7540780	Okay, well good.
7540780	7543780	But you know what's even better, though, is combine the two, have a taco, take a nap.
7545780	7546780	Fair enough.
7546780	7549780	Because then you go to bed with tacos in your stomach.
7550780	7551780	And that's happy.
7552780	7554780	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
7554780	7557780	Then we're gonna open the Skype line at 1-877-GAMELR.
7557780	7559780	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7559780	7561780	We'll also get Twitter topics and last minute stories.
7561780	7563780	I'm in a feminist tizzy right now.
7563780	7565780	Did that, did that...
7565780	7567780	I was actually angered.
7567780	7569780	Alright, let's, let's move on.
7569780	7570780	I have Rage at Rageinator.
7570780	7573780	You know what, let's talk about a strong woman in games.
7573780	7574780	Loki.
7575780	7577780	Yes, Lightning.
7579780	7582780	She is basically done now.
7582780	7590780	The Lightning, they're saying Lightning Returns is the last part of the story for Lightning.
7590780	7598780	However, they're saying that Lightning may come back as a guest character in other games.
7598780	7602780	So, I don't know.
7602780	7606780	They could get cliche, or they should get like really cheesy with it.
7606780	7609780	Like, you know, Lightning strikes twice or something.
7609780	7612780	No, we're just gonna see her a bunch more in Final Fantasy XIV.
7612780	7617780	I was gonna say, they're doing the quest right now in XIV that has her in it that's very strange.
7618780	7622780	I don't know why she would return in other games.
7622780	7625780	I mean, I could see maybe like, you know, XIV.
7625780	7629780	I guess they can do like some fun stuff where they have like guest characters and stuff from other games.
7629780	7634780	But, it doesn't really make sense for Lightning to be in other games.
7634780	7637780	I guess then, then again, Cid is in all the games.
7637780	7639780	So, I don't know.
7639780	7642780	Thinking of Lightning in all the games is a different person.
7643780	7645780	That would be a little silly though.
7645780	7646780	Like, I don't know.
7646780	7650780	Like, her picture should just be hanging on the wall as a little cameo in the later games.
7650780	7654780	I mean, you don't really see characters from one Final Fantasy appear in the other.
7654780	7656780	I mean, even Cid, sure, okay, there's a dude named Cid.
7656780	7658780	But they're all different, you know.
7658780	7661780	In fact, I believe the one in XIII was more of a villain than a...
7661780	7662780	Well, it's mixed.
7662780	7665780	But, you know, they're always different.
7667780	7668780	Anyhow.
7670780	7672780	There's always an airship. There's always a Cid.
7672780	7674780	There's always a crystal.
7674780	7676780	There's always Moogles, at least in the later one.
7676780	7678780	Moogles didn't start until like 3, right?
7678780	7681780	Well, they'll just have her, you know, guest star.
7681780	7683780	Maybe she could be a summon or something.
7683780	7687780	Or, you know, they'll have her guest star in all the different thunder spells.
7687780	7691780	You would think that characters like Cloud would have been a little more iconic.
7691780	7695780	But then again, they did dress Lightning up in a cloud suit.
7695780	7697780	So, maybe that's the type of stuff we're looking for.
7697780	7700780	DLC Lightning crap in later games, right?
7701780	7704780	Act-Def says Final Fantasy XIII, too Lightning, too Furious.
7706780	7707780	Don't give them ideas.
7707780	7708780	All right.
7708780	7711780	Well, sadly, our last story is a bit of a sad note tonight.
7711780	7718780	And gives us a chance to reminisce, though, about some very classic PC and Sega CD and CD-based games.
7718780	7720780	I don't know if you ever played a game called...
7720780	7722780	That's not Microcosm, is it?
7722780	7724780	No, no. This is actually a clip from Sewer Shark.
7724780	7725780	Oh!
7726780	7732780	And, you know, full motion games were, like, a big thing, especially in the early 90s, like the CD-ROM games.
7732780	7736780	Ken Melville was one of the guys to thank for a lot of that.
7736780	7740780	Unfortunately, he passed away this week at age 65.
7740780	7748780	He produced Sewer Shark, and he also created other full motion video games like Make My Video in XS and Make My Video Criss Cross.
7748780	7749780	Excellent.
7749780	7751780	You know what? I have both of those games.
7751780	7761780	Also, and probably most infamously, Ken Melville helped create Night Trap, starring Dana Plato, which is a pretty epically remembered CD game.
7761780	7768780	Even though it really wasn't very good, people still remember it just because, you know, it was like Chicks and Horror Movie and all that stuff.
7768780	7770780	But yeah, there you go.
7770780	7772780	So Ken Melville, unfortunately, passed away.
7772780	7776780	But, you know, without him, we might not have some of the things we see.
7776780	7780780	I mean, yeah, sure, games can kind of render all this real time now, but, you know, I don't think we would have got there.
7780780	7786780	We would have certainly never had the SimCity version with the SimCity Action News Report, if it weren't for this.
7786780	7789780	So, for that, I'll be forever thankful.
7789780	7796780	Some folks in chat also saying, SSJ100Matt says, RIP John Henson, Jim Henson's son.
7796780	7798780	That also happened this week. That's very sad, too.
7798780	7802780	Lots of, what, Sid Caesar had passed away this week.
7802780	7805780	That made me so sad. And Shirley Temple.
7805780	7806780	Shirley Temple.
7806780	7815780	I mean, Caesar was like in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Silent Movie and History of the World Part 1 and Greece.
7815780	7818780	I had thought Shirley Temple was already dead. Like, I felt horrible.
7818780	7821780	But she disappeared from the public eye a long time ago.
7821780	7827780	Like, I think she came to one Oscars as a, I don't know, but then she became a diplomat of sorts, right?
7827780	7830780	Wasn't she like an ambassador or something at some point?
7830780	7834780	She's not really in the public eye like she used to be. So, sorry.
7834780	7838780	You know, you know what? When I was probably about 13, I read her autobiography.
7838780	7842780	Which was, oh my God, she went through some shit.
7842780	7843780	Oh, I bet.
7843780	7848780	But it's, if anyone can find her autobiography, though, it's definitely worth a read.
7848780	7849780	Her life was just so interesting.
7849780	7850780	Yeah.
7850780	7851780	So.
7851780	7853780	Excellent. All right. We are going to open up the Skype line right now.
7853780	7857780	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7857780	7863780	If you'd like to give the show a call and interact with us, participate, you can do that right now.
7864780	7867780	Once again, that's 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7867780	7869780	The Skype line is now open.
7869780	7872780	I'm going to go around for some last minute stories, though, first.
7872780	7874780	Loki, I don't know, do you have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?
7874780	7875780	No.
7875780	7876780	No?
7876780	7877780	I do not.
7877780	7879780	Sorry. No, I don't.
7879780	7881780	All right. Fine. Fair enough.
7881780	7885780	I also want to look and see if there's any, like, Twitter topics, but we'll see here.
7887780	7891780	Okay. The book, by the way, is called Child Star.
7891780	7893780	There you go. Child Star.
7893780	7894780	By Shirley Temple Black.
7894780	7900780	Well, that is what Shirley Temple was, was a child star, but we're going to go to the Skype line right now.
7900780	7902780	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
7902780	7908780	It's Ronma, and will you tell a brother next time you turn the cam on so I can have mine on, too?
7910780	7915780	Oh, there you go. Oh, we're on the cam tonight. Yay. How you doing?
7915780	7920780	Good, good. As you can see, I just got back from Catsicon 20.
7920780	7921780	You're wearing your VOG shirt.
7921780	7922780	What did you get me?
7923780	7924780	Love it. Great.
7924780	7927780	I got you a lot of Ronma would have cosplay pictures.
7927780	7931780	Yay! Did you take me any home stocks?
7931780	7933780	I got a couple.
7933780	7934780	Yay!
7934780	7937780	There you go. They didn't turn the pool gray this year, did they?
7937780	7948780	Uh, no, but let's just say the hotel and the convention were gunning more at professional photographers than anything else.
7948780	7949780	Really?
7949780	7963780	Yes. If it looked like you had more, if you had more attachments on your SLR, like big lights and this and that, they will tell you to leave the area because they assume that you're a professional photographer.
7963780	7970780	A friend of mine had an assistant with him, and they told him, you can't have your, you're a professional photographer.
7970780	7971780	Interesting.
7971780	7975780	It boiled down to, as long as it's attached to your camera, it's fair game.
7975780	7979780	Huh. I went to Katsucon a few years ago. I had a good time.
7979780	7984780	Yeah, but they're no longer in that area. We're in a different area.
7984780	7985780	Okay.
7985780	7989780	The hotel convention is bigger, and it's all about the gazebo.
7989780	7991780	I've heard about the gazebo.
7991780	7993780	Oh, I've seen the memes about the gazebo.
7993780	7998780	I'm in California for fuck's sake, and I've heard about the Katsucon gazebo, so I'm just saying. I'm just saying.
7998780	8001780	That's because you have West Coast cosplayers going to Katsucon.
8001780	8003780	There you go. There you go. Fair enough.
8004780	8016780	I was going to say this. There was all those stormy storms in the Northeast, and I was reading that the con, like, they were going to say a con is happening no matter what, but I imagine that led to some hilarious fuckery right there.
8016780	8025780	Yes, because they made an announcement that even though you can't make it to Katsucon, you are not getting a refund. The salt was strong on that.
8025780	8029780	Ooh, ouch. I can only imagine on that. Yikes.
8030780	8035780	So what gaming stuff did they have at Katsucon? Did they still have a game room down there? I know.
8035780	8039780	Yes, there was two pump it up machines and a DDR third mix.
8039780	8042780	Nice. Third mix. I fucking love third mix.
8042780	8043780	Vivid mode.
8043780	8044780	Erotic songs.
8044780	8050780	And I've never heard of this game. I don't know if you guys reviewed it, but it's a rhythm game by Sega.
8050780	8057780	It's two players, and it's five lines of colored lights, and you're bouncing lights back and forth.
8057780	8060780	You start from one, then three, then five.
8060780	8067780	I actually didn't know that was a Sega game. It looks like a giant table, like air hockey looking thing, right?
8067780	8070780	There was one of those at Arcade Infinity before it closed down.
8070780	8072780	I have video footage of that.
8072780	8075780	Nice. Yeah, that game looked interesting. I think I did play it once.
8075780	8086780	You know, I didn't talk about this on the show the week that Shane was here, but we had gone to Golf Land, the place where video games go to die, and we played a Pac-Man air hockey machine.
8086780	8087780	What?
8087780	8094780	Yeah, it was kind of like normal air hockey, but like at random parts, all these little pucks would just fly onto the table.
8094780	8100780	Like you'd have your normal puck, like air hockey, but then all of a sudden like 20 small pucks would fly on the table.
8100780	8106780	Like that was the whole little trick, and they were worth like half a point, whereas the other, the big pucks were worth like five points.
8106780	8113780	Sorry, random tangent, but you talking about the big table games in Arcade kind of made me think of that, so.
8114780	8116780	That's quite alright.
8116780	8120780	Alright, so we're gonna hear the full Katsukan wrap up, I imagine, this week on Anime Jam Session?
8120780	8138780	Yes, you will, and we'll have two of our cosplay guests on the show, Avalon Cosplay and Serafita Cosplay, because Serafita had a booth going selling patches and a lot of cool stuff, and it was pretty fun, especially since somebody cosplayed the gazebo.
8138780	8140780	Oh, I have to ask you.
8140780	8142780	That's like when somebody cosplayed the carpet at Dragon Con.
8142780	8145780	Did you get pictures of Kayla?
8145780	8147780	Yes, I got a couple.
8147780	8149780	Because I went in to see her Lilith costume.
8149780	8151780	I got one of her Lilith costume.
8151780	8153780	Yes! Awesome.
8153780	8155780	Alright, well Rama, anything else before we let you go?
8155780	8164780	I will say this much, when it comes to gaming cosplay at this convention, the most popular gaming cosplay was Danganronpa.
8164780	8167780	Oh yeah, that's not surprising.
8167780	8169780	Then Legend of Zelda.
8169780	8171780	Yeah, that's not surprising either.
8171780	8173780	You hear that the sequel's coming out this year as well, right?
8173780	8175780	Loki said the sequel's coming out this year.
8175780	8180780	I haven't played the game, but I've watched the anime, and holy shit, what a mindfuck.
8180780	8188780	Yeah, the first one just came out, I think, last week, and then the sequel, I think, is already announced for...gosh, I want to say it's this summer.
8188780	8190780	Did you hear what Loki said?
8190780	8192780	Yes, I did.
8192780	8194780	By the way, I'm working on something for you.
8194780	8195780	Ooh!
8195780	8197780	A Rama troll.
8197780	8198780	Oh no!
8198780	8200780	Yep, you're getting a Rama troll.
8200780	8201780	Sweet.
8201780	8205780	Alright, well Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls, but have a good one, buddy, thanks for calling.
8205780	8206780	Hey, no problem, you too.
8206780	8207780	Alright, take care, bye.
8207780	8208780	Oh, bye.
8208780	8212780	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8212780	8217780	I always thought that Ranshan should cosplay the Rama troll out of irony.
8217780	8220780	That would be hilarious.
8220780	8224780	Alright, I'm gonna try to pull up the OLR Twitter here.
8224780	8227780	A lot of activity on Twitter around FlappyVog, that's pretty exciting to see.
8227780	8229780	Yay.
8229780	8231780	Um, let's see.
8231780	8236780	DarkTetsuya says, I'm trying to start an OLR me for Monster Hunter 3.
8236780	8238780	God dammit, I forgot, sorry guys.
8238780	8243780	I'm routing Skype a different way, so I have to route it through the mixing board.
8243780	8245780	Little bit of faux pas there.
8245780	8249780	I'll go back to DarkTetsuya's tweet in a minute, but we are getting another call, so let's get to it.
8249780	8251780	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8251780	8256780	Hey there, guys, it's nemesis47, I'm from the chat, how you guys doing today?
8256780	8259780	Hey, good, nemesis47, what's up, buddy?
8259780	8267780	Nothing much, guys, I'm just getting ready for a convention here in a couple weeks as well, just like Rama said earlier.
8267780	8269780	Where's here?
8269780	8275780	In Colorado, he was in out east, I'm over here out in Rocky Mountains west.
8275780	8283780	I would bet Jason, our good buddy VXJ's next V, who just said goodbyes on the show last week for now,
8283780	8288780	he lives in Colorado, he's been living in San Francisco for the past couple months, he's usually in Colorado.
8288780	8290780	He'll probably be there, I would bet.
8290780	8294780	I guess he would, though, we have a lot of guests this year.
8294780	8299780	This is actually my first convention I'm going to be staffing for this year.
8299780	8301780	Nice, sounds like fun.
8301780	8302780	Yeah.
8302780	8310780	Yep, I'm mainly just the guy that's going to be doing the photoshoots.
8310780	8315780	I've actually got all the photoshoots already done with the posters and everything.
8315780	8318780	We just gotta get him hung up a lot of comments.
8318780	8323780	There we go, it's the Anime Land Wasabi convention I'm doing in a couple weeks.
8323780	8325780	Sounds like fun.
8325780	8326780	Yep.
8326780	8332780	So, are you trying to plug the convention here? Is there something else on your mind tonight?
8332780	8340780	That's one thing, and plus the whole thing with the Sega Genesis thing, my apologies about that.
8340780	8344780	I had brain fart earlier and stuff, so yeah.
8344780	8351780	That's fine, and to be fair, because the Sega Genesis did come out, I want to say it was a year or two before the Super Nintendo,
8351780	8357780	there was a little bit of overlap, especially in the late NES period, kind of overlapped with the beginnings of the Sega Genesis.
8357780	8363780	And I seem to remember, DarkSocker, correct me if I'm wrong, or Loki, Sonic the Hedgehog was a Genesis game,
8363780	8368780	but then they back-poured it to the Master System because it was kind of like the 8-bits was still going on.
8368780	8370780	Or was that one of those Chinese hacks?
8370780	8378780	No, no, no, there's actually quite a number of Genesis games that were sort of back-engineered for the Master System
8378780	8380780	because of countries where the Master System was the big thing.
8380780	8386780	Like, for example, Brazil. Brazil has a massive Master System following.
8386780	8388780	But they had a huge Genesis following.
8388780	8390780	But Master System was really big.
8390780	8392780	Yeah, I've heard that too.
8392780	8393780	Even to today.
8393780	8398780	So there's lots of games that you'll find those older versions.
8398780	8407780	I think the Sonic one had been released, don't quote me yet, but it was really, some of those countries where the Master System was huge,
8407780	8414780	so they took their most popular titles from Genesis because the Genesis ones weren't selling, the Master System ones were.
8414780	8416780	They were milking the money where they could.
8416780	8422780	Interesting. Well, there you go. I learned something. So yeah, don't feel too bad about the answer.
8422780	8427780	I actually still got my Genesis still to this day. I had that thing since I was a little kid.
8427780	8435780	Nice. I saw my Super Nintendo hooked up. I can play Super Metroid in its purest form.
8435780	8440780	I tripped over Super Nintendo today. We have three of them in the house.
8440780	8443780	I think you should always have a classic console hooked up for good measure.
8443780	8449780	Of course, of course. Have you guys ever heard of a game called Double Switch on the Sega CD?
8449780	8450780	Yes, I have it.
8450780	8454780	I have it too. It has late Corey Haim in the game.
8454780	8456780	Yes, it does.
8457780	8466780	It is not one of my favorite games, though. If I was going to sit down and play a Sega CD game that I would actually say was among my favorites, it would probably just be Sonic CD.
8466780	8480780	Oh, yeah. Sonic CD can never go wrong with Sonic CD. Another thing about Double Switch, Arlie Ermes is in the game. He knows the story of Simon Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He's in the game.
8480780	8483780	Yeah, that's right. It had actually a pretty decent cast, didn't it?
8483780	8493780	Yeah, he played while I was a handyman in the game. So, at first I was like, that doesn't look like I didn't know who it was after this thing.
8493780	8498780	It was Arlie Ermey and they pretty much put the voices two and two together and, hey, it matches!
8498780	8504780	Yeah, it's worth a lot. The GI.
8504780	8511780	Alright, well, Nemesis 47, enjoy the classic gaming on your classic consoles and thanks for calling us tonight, alright?
8511780	8514780	No problem, man. Good to see you guys.
8514780	8516780	Alright, take care, buddy.
8516780	8518780	Alright, bye bye.
8518780	8519780	Bye.
8519780	8534780	1877 game OLR, I wish I could disable the sounds. I'm actually using Skype on the iPad, so I wish I could disable the sounds. Maybe it's possible. I could disable all the sounds, but then I wouldn't be able to hear the callers and that would be a bad thing.
8534780	8545780	1877 game OLR, username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio. Before we took that call, I was talking about a tweet that Dark Tetsuya had sent us saying, I'm trying to start an OL army for Monster Hunter 3 on Wii U.
8545780	8559780	By the way, that's how you do online on Wii U. I gotta be honest, Dark Tetsuya, I wasn't able to get into Monster Hunter. That's my honest answer on that, but, hey, for those of you that are enjoying it, I definitely would support an OL army being created for that.
8559780	8563780	But we do have another call on the line, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?
8563780	8564780	Hey, it's Marissa.
8564780	8569780	Marissa! Oh my gosh. We haven't heard from you in forever, Marissa. How you doing?
8569780	8570780	I wonder how you need to call right now.
8570780	8578780	It's been too long. I feel like an old lady though, trying to figure out this Skype thing. I thought this was only for the kids doing the porn thing.
8578780	8581780	No, that would be Snapchat.
8581780	8582780	Yeah, that's Snapchat.
8582780	8583780	Oh, okay.
8583780	8586780	That's for the porn thing. What's on your mind, Marissa?
8586780	8593780	I was calling to say hello and check in. Oh, and fuck the new Thief game, but I guess, yeah, that would probably be it.
8593780	8596780	Oh, yeah. Is that, like, coming out finally?
8596780	8604780	I know! They put so much into it. They have so much on the line at Eidos Montreal, and it's coming out next week and nobody really seems to know or give a shit.
8604780	8606780	Oh, two weeks, says Logie.
8606780	8608780	The 25th.
8608780	8614780	Wow, they've got a great marketing push going on on that one. That's sure to do well. They must have a lot of faith in it.
8614780	8624780	It's funny, because of my interest, the voice acting is particularly bad. I mean, everybody is outraged that they got rid of Stephen Russell, who's just brilliant.
8624780	8641780	But I've been listening to it in general, and the direction itself is just... it's really bad, but there are laws with regard to casting and doing projects in Canada, and everyone suspects that they did that to keep funding.
8641780	8643780	Oh, like Canadian content?
8643780	8646780	Canadian content laws or something. Oh, that's an interesting theory.
8646780	8648780	Damn Canucks.
8648780	8651780	Damn it Canada, you do so many things right, but sometimes you get it wrong.
8651780	8656780	Damn it Canada, you gave us Rush, but you also gave us Bieber.
8656780	8661780	You know, I hate Justin Bieber too, but to be fair, we've exported a lot of shit to them too.
8661780	8667780	That is true. That is true. Fair's fair. I mean, they get like Miley Cyrus.
8667780	8672780	Thanks to a friend of mine, I actually did hear about a Canadian band that I've started liking a lot called Stars.
8672780	8673780	Okay.
8673780	8674780	They're really good.
8674780	8675780	Rock on.
8675780	8676780	Okay, I will.
8676780	8678780	I like Alanis Morissette. She's cool.
8678780	8683780	Hey, actually to be fair, they import a lot of comedians too. We get a lot of great comedians.
8683780	8688780	That is true. We get a lot of comedians from Canada. I feel like it's like Canada history 101 today.
8688780	8693780	As opposed to Canadians from Alaska? Or Canadians from Norway?
8694780	8703780	I remember when I was a little girl, actually, I had a friend that was from Peachland, and I was trying to explain Canadian bacon to her, and I had this exact reply.
8703780	8705780	You mean ham?
8707780	8711780	Although, isn't that also just what they call bacon in England?
8711780	8713780	You're not supposed to talk about bacon, Jamie.
8713780	8716780	You know what? I've seen you eat bacon.
8717780	8720780	See, I'm allowed to be a heathen. I don't give a shit.
8720780	8723780	It's not going to go away if you pretend it doesn't exist.
8723780	8726780	For the record, I had turkey bacon today, so I'm still being a good Jew.
8726780	8728780	Of course, there was cheese with it.
8728780	8734780	So Marissa, I know you're very disappointed about The New Thief, but is there any games you've been checking out lately?
8734780	8744780	Otherwise, I haven't had a chance to look into a lot of them. I've had the chance to record and rehearse in various studios with some interesting video game scripts.
8745780	8748780	Some of them haven't come out yet, so you can't talk about them.
8748780	8751780	Some of them was the interesting little tank commander bit I sent you.
8751780	8757780	I don't know what it's from, but they had me rehearse this thing about giant eyeballs are attacking the city.
8757780	8761780	That sounds like something out of Earth Defense Force or something. Who knows?
8763780	8765780	I can only hope.
8765780	8769780	Marissa, I know you haven't been on the show in a while, but it seems like since the last time you were here,
8769780	8772780	you've been really getting into studying voice acting and doing all that.
8772780	8776780	I know you sent me some of the demo reels that you did, and it was great.
8776780	8779780	I thought I was actually listening to commercials on FM radio. It was cool.
8779780	8782780	Oh, thank you. That shit that you skip over.
8782780	8789780	Well, you can't when you're in the car and waiting for the next Lady Gaga song to come on. You're kind of held hostage.
8789780	8796780	Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. That's actually what I've wanted to do my whole life, and I decided to go for it.
8796780	8798780	That's awesome. See, I always talk about...
8798780	8802780	You like the sexy sax, though? That's important if you like the sexy sax bit.
8802780	8809780	I always talk about wanting... I would love to be a voice actor in a video game just once in my life. That would be my dream.
8809780	8814780	But you're actually going and doing it. But you know what? I do have flappy vog.
8814780	8819780	I did get flappy vog, so I did get my game that I have a voice actor in.
8819780	8824780	Well, Rob Paulson, when he hosts his podcast, he sometimes brings it up north.
8824780	8831780	I suggest everyone to check that out, Talking Tunes. He brings Maurice LaMarche sometimes, and they do Pinky and the Brain live, and they've all done video games as well.
8831780	8832780	It's awesome.
8832780	8833780	It's a lot of fun.
8833780	8841780	Awesome. Awesome. All right. Well, you want to give us your best voiceover sign out for the night before we let you go?
8841780	8845780	Not to put you on the spot or anything.
8845780	8849780	Good night, everybody.
8849780	8856780	I don't always do that, but it's interesting how it's really incestuous when you go from this to...
8856780	8858780	Hi, how have you been?
8858780	8862780	That's a lot of anime work. You do a lot of that.
8862780	8865780	Oh, my God. I love it.
8865780	8866780	Have fun with that helium.
8866780	8870780	I accidentally did that with my answer machine message once. I was trying to be professional.
8870780	8876780	Your reception isn't very good, so I was trying to be, hey, this is Marissa. I hope to hear from you soon.
8876780	8881780	But this is how it turned out. Hey, it's Marissa. I'd love to hear from you.
8881780	8888780	I didn't realize until my doctor called me one day. She just left a message, and she said this exactly.
8888780	8895780	She said, Marissa, what a suggestive sounding answering machine you have.
8895780	8900780	Well, I think there's a lot of our listeners that would like to see you operating a 900 number or something along those lines.
8900780	8903780	Maybe I can get that gig. Call us now.
8903780	8905780	All right.
8905780	8912780	All right. Well, Marissa, when you're a super popular voice actress touring the country at anime cons up and down the coast, I'm going to say she started here.
8912780	8913780	We made her.
8913780	8915780	No. Her first role on Vogue.
8915780	8918780	I don't know some of the bits I've done on your show. I want to be known.
8918780	8925780	No, no, no, no. I know what your first fun voice was on Orange House Radio. It was Uso's Braziers.
8925780	8930780	Yes. I'm going to dig up those shows. You better watch out.
8930780	8934780	Actually, I'm just trying to get started, but I know lots of people are doing indie projects.
8934780	8939780	That's where a lot of people cut their chops, and if anybody's interested, I'm always happy to do indie projects.
8939780	8943780	Awesome. All right. Well, how can people get a hold of you?
8943780	8952780	Well, I have that sound cloud you can link to later, but my name is Marissa Meisel, so M-E-I-Z-E-L.
8952780	8959780	I can always send out demos that way, or you can contact me where the old people are on Facebook.
8959780	8963780	Awesome. Awesome. And if you email the show, we'll get you in touch with her, too. We'll forward it on over.
8963780	8964780	As long as we still have that email address.
8964780	8969780	Yes. All right. All right, Marissa, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much for the call.
8969780	8970780	It's so good to hear from you. Miss your face.
8970780	8973780	One time, I'll have to come up soon and have giggle time.
8973780	8974780	What's that?
8974780	8977780	I'll have to come up soon, and we can have Rob and Marissa's giggle time.
8977780	8981780	Yes. I cannot wait. All right. Bye.
8981780	8982780	Bye.
8982780	8985780	I always love hearing from Marissa. She is great.
8985780	8988780	All right. I can probably squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try to get through.
8988780	8992780	1877 Game O-L-R, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8992780	8996780	Trying to get to some more tweets beyond that.
8996780	8998780	S2100 Matt tweets us.
8998780	9002780	Old story, but the Kickstarter hack reminded me of it.
9002780	9006780	Best and worst online retailers password safeguards.
9006780	9008780	And he links us to this article from Ars Technica.
9009780	9017780	I don't believe I read this, but apparently, the headline on the site is this.
9017780	9020780	Apple.com does more to protect your passwords.
9020780	9022780	The study of the top 100 sites finds.
9022780	9027780	I guess some sites will allow you to have 123456 as a password.
9027780	9032780	Apple.com was the only site to receive a perfect score of 100 based on 24 criteria.
9033780	9039780	Amazingly, 55% of the sites allowed 123456 and password.
9039780	9046780	Sites like Toys R Us, 1-800-Flowers, and J Crew sent passwords as plain text in emails.
9046780	9050780	Interesting. So, yeah, Apple got a 100.
9050780	9053780	Microsoft and Chegg, C-H-Egg.
9053780	9057780	Chegg is a book rental for school book rentals.
9057780	9060780	And if you run from them, they actually plant a tree.
9060780	9063780	They were right behind that with a score of 65.
9063780	9065780	Of course, I want to see who's on the bottom.
9065780	9071780	MLB, the Major League Baseball website, negative 75 was their score.
9071780	9074780	Kind of surprised that somebody's in the bottom.
9074780	9078780	Hulu, negative 45. Disney Store, negative 45.
9078780	9080780	Interesting story there on ArsTechnica.com.
9080780	9082780	Thanks for that, SJ100Matt.
9082780	9086780	And don't use shitty passwords, people. Don't use shitty passwords.
9086780	9088780	And don't use the same ones for your financial institutions.
9088780	9094780	Never, never, never have your email password used anywhere else.
9094780	9096780	Same thing with your banking passwords.
9096780	9101780	At least those two should be unique and separate. For real.
9101780	9104780	Alright. Anyhow, let's see.
9104780	9108780	Going on, we have another tweet from SJ100Matt.
9108780	9112780	Someone made a Space Jam mod for NBA 2K14.
9112780	9116780	Now you can play with the Tune Squad or Monstars from the movie.
9116780	9120780	That's it. We've accomplished all we need to in gaming.
9120780	9124780	That's it. Done. Video games are over, everybody. Pack it up. Go home.
9124780	9130780	They put Space Jam in NBA 2K14. Wait. Somebody made that game good?
9130780	9133780	NBA 2K14 was apparently pretty good.
9133780	9136780	I thought it got like hazed and stuff in the video.
9136780	9138780	That's NBA Live 14.
9138780	9140780	Oh. Pardon me. Pardon me.
9140780	9142780	Yeah, Rob. I don't know how to play either.
9142780	9143780	Sorry.
9143780	9145780	No one's making any mods for that.
9145780	9149780	And Strudels89. It was a tweet to me as well.
9149780	9151780	But this is worthy of mention on the show for Dark Sakura.
9151780	9154780	OMG. I found a pink berry.
9154780	9156780	It's been so long. I missed it.
9156780	9159780	You would think this show is sponsored by that company.
9159780	9161780	But sadly, nope. No free yogurt here.
9161780	9165780	Well, it doesn't appear that anybody else is calling in.
9165780	9168780	So I guess we're gonna go ahead and close up ye olde Skype line.
9168780	9170780	Which means we don't have last minute stories.
9170780	9172780	I have one last minute story.
9172780	9174780	Oh, you got one. Alright. Well, Loki, what did you get?
9174780	9178780	It's kind of a little easter egg for Disney Infinity.
9178780	9182780	Apparently, once you've collected all of the characters,
9182780	9184780	say if you buy every single one of them,
9184780	9188780	you will unlock a lightsaber.
9188780	9192780	Like an actual lightsaber in the game as a weapon.
9192780	9196780	Of course, no one has figured this out yet.
9196780	9200780	Except for one person who got some of the toys early that haven't been released yet.
9200780	9204780	But that's what's gonna happen when you do collect all of them
9204780	9207780	if you happen to pay for all of those different characters.
9209780	9214780	Alright. Bobby Black Wolf has just sent me an update via private message
9214780	9216780	worthy of last minute story.
9216780	9222780	Per Bobby Black Wolf, over 1300 people have died in Flappy Vog during OLR.
9222780	9223780	So I don't know if that means...
9223780	9224780	Third place.
9224780	9226780	What? Does that mean 1300 plays?
9226780	9229780	Or like 1300 unique people have played the game in 3 hours?
9229780	9232780	I don't think we have those kind of numbers at VoG.
9232780	9235780	But I would imagine that's 1300 plays.
9235780	9237780	That's still pretty impressive.
9237780	9239780	I imagine a lot of you guys are just zoning out, listening to the show,
9239780	9242780	and playing Flappy Vog, and that's totally cool.
9242780	9244780	If that's the case.
9245780	9249780	Black Wolf says 1300 plays. Well, that's still impressive.
9249780	9253780	So, wow. God, how many times has my head crashed into a wall in the past 3 hours?
9253780	9254780	That's a little disturbing.
9254780	9255780	Mine hasn't at all yet.
9255780	9256780	Yet.
9256780	9257780	But we're doing my lines.
9257780	9258780	But you're gonna be in the first DLC.
9258780	9261780	I could give people a sample.
9261780	9264780	Okay. Give them one sample. Don't ruin it. Give them one sample.
9264780	9265780	Yarp.
9269780	9272780	Alright. That is about gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
9272780	9275780	Hey, I wanna thank you guys for listening to the show,
9275780	9278780	having fun with us, whether it be live or podcast.
9278780	9280780	I really appreciate your support of the show.
9280780	9282780	You know, all we ask here, we do ask it every week.
9282780	9285780	If you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two or five about the show.
9285780	9287780	Help spread the word. That's all we got.
9287780	9291780	We also could really use some nice reviews.
9291780	9296780	Five-star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio go a very, very long way in helping to promote the show.
9296780	9301780	And we thank you very, very much for all the nice words you guys have to say.
9301780	9304780	It is about that time where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9304780	9310780	Loki, hope to see you back soon, but I understand you gotta do what you gotta do there at home.
9310780	9313780	So, take care of yourself and say hi to Nellie.
9313780	9315780	Do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
9315780	9318780	Yes, I'm third place on Flappy Vogue.
9318780	9320780	Are you really? What's your score?
9320780	9324780	Forty-two, I think? I don't know.
9324780	9327780	That's pretty good. That's pretty good.
9327780	9332780	My final thought tonight is I wanna go to Disneyland.
9332780	9334780	I wanna go for my birthday.
9334780	9337780	Well, I kinda had an offer to go next week.
9337780	9338780	Jeez.
9338780	9339780	Jeez.
9339780	9346780	I might, but it would be literally Lee Friday to go Saturday to drive back Sunday in time for the show.
9346780	9350780	Which will probably kill me, but do you know what's on Saturday?
9350780	9354780	Like why I really gotta go? Dapper days.
9354780	9355780	Bring me back something, Duffy.
9355780	9358780	Oh, of course. How could I not? How could I not?
9358780	9359780	I know.
9359780	9360780	All right.
9360780	9363780	And last but not least, Lee, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
9363780	9369780	I start my new schedule at the land of cubicles and tech, Locat.
9369780	9373780	So I'm happy that I can actually stay up to a normal time tonight.
9373780	9375780	Huzzah.
9375780	9377780	That's it.
9377780	9380780	All right. That's it. We're done. We're out of here.
9380780	9382780	We'll be back to do it all again next week, though.
9382780	9384780	Thank you guys for staying with us and listening.
9384780	9388780	Oh, wait. Marissa says we have to go to Knott's to see the Billies.
9388780	9389780	Is that where they moved?
9389780	9390780	That's where they are.
9390780	9391780	Get out.
9391780	9392780	I've never been there either.
9392780	9394780	I thought they have really good fried chicken.
9394780	9395780	This is the record.
9395780	9398780	But I didn't I didn't I thought the Billies were like a part of Disney.
9398780	9401780	I thought there's like a bunch of Billies.
9401780	9403780	They do performances at various places.
9403780	9404780	And I love the Billies.
9404780	9406780	Well done to Knott's.
9406780	9407780	Well done on them.
9407780	9408780	All right. We're out of here.
9408780	9409780	Have a good night, everybody.
9409780	9413780	We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9413780	9414780	Good night.
9414780	9418780	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
