Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, a new challenger has arrived as Amazon enters the gaming arena and they're not coming alone.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Sonic has been rebooted again, but this time exclusively by the West for the West.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
We've heard the uproar from the internet, but we'll take your comments on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 539, February 9th, 2014.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you guys over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Sup bitches? How you doing? Is that your new tagline? You said that last week too.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I didn't say that last week, I said that week before. I said sup bitches in chat though.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
After 539 episodes, they start to blur together a little bit.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It's because you're old. Yeah, a little bit. And I'm older.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah, I had that realization. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
And I had the realization that I'm getting old listening to last week's Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
He had a great interview where they were talking about BBS door games.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
And they were talking about this whole tech history. And I'm just thinking in the back of my mind, like, I was there dude.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I called all those BBS's too. I played those door games dude.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
And it was so weird kind of hearing them talk about it. Like it was like, you know, this was the best.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
They described it, one of them, the guest he had was describing it like, well, it was kind of like Facebook but you dial into it.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
And I just did this thing where it's like, no, I mean, I get it. Like I wasn't, I wasn't like making fun of it or whatever.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
But it was just one of those things where I was just like, oh my God, like he's having to explain it.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
Because most of the listeners we have are, you know, teenagers and young 20-somethings that literally were too young to remember calling into BBS's.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
And I'm just thinking like, Rob, you're too old. You're never too old, dang it.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Mudds.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh yeah, Mudds were fun too. I got into those in college. Yeah, they are still around.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
No, no, no, no. It was all about AOL in 1994 and playing Gemstone.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
Shoot, somebody had said something about the, oh, there it is. Havoc978 said, old lounge radio.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Yes, that is, that is probably appropriate for tonight.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, speaking of old familiar faces, guess what? A face we've been missing for the past couple of weeks is back with us tonight.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, sadly I'm not there in the face to face, but over Skype still.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That's right. Loki is still joining us via the Skype line.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
And yes, I know, you know, we, part of our whole shtick is that we're all in the same room and we will get back to that soon.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
But Loki, obviously, you just, you know, your wife just had the baby, what, two weeks ago at this point.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
So there's still, there's still a lot of adjustment going on.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And so it'll be another couple weeks before you're back, right?

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, I wanted to come back this week, but you know, she's still not healed enough to be able to lift the car carrier and the baby at the same time, so.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I have to be here to lift the baby out of the car.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
So when we told Loki he needs to take all the time he needs for the baby, we meant it.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
So we will take Loki over Skype over no Loki at all.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And he can't see us make faces at him here in studio.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Making a face at Loki right now, say hello everybody to Jay, I'm just kidding, I'm just starting crap.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Say hello everybody to Jason.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm sitting in your chair.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
How you doing, Jason?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm doing pretty good.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
And you guys, actually, we say welcome back Loki, but this week we actually say goodbye for now, Jason.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I know, it's sad, right?

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
It's been, it's been a very interesting three and a half months or however long it's been, I can't even remember at this point.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, you've been out, so those of you guys that haven't been following, Jason has been out here for, he was, he was in San Francisco for work for about the past three months.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
But you are now going on your way back home to Colorado.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I have to go say hello to the snow.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, I figured.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
But I'd say this rain this week is a pretty proper send off.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, we finally got...

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
We've been so overcast this week.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Finally got some stinking rain, I'm glad you could see what it looks like when it rains here, because literally the entire time you've been here it has not rained.

04:31.000 --> 04:43.000
It's funny, it actually really reminds me of, I realized this on the drive up here, it's crazy to think that my first time coming back to California as an adult was in, for my interview in 2012.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
How old was I in 2004?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
What does adulthood count as, 18?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You know, when I first met you, you were only like 19 or 20.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Okay, so I guess, I guess I was just barely adult for E3.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Take your age now and subtract 10, that was 10 years ago.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Uh, 18, so yeah, just on the cusp.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, no, it was in June, so it was a month before my birthday.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
You were 17 when you were here the first time?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
That sounds really strange.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
That does sound really strange.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh, no, no, no, I was 18 turning 19.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
So anyways, the first time...

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
You don't even know your own age?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's a sign of getting old.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
I base it off, I base it for my birthday forward instead of my age backward, even though it literally was 10 years ago, whatever.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
So, I was out in California for 2004 for E3 and all the other festivities that happened that week.

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
I had not been back to California since then, of course, and so 2012 when I come back for my interview, the conditions that it was on the drive today was actually very, very similar.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
More intense, more intense, more rain, the entirety of, at least, you know, from San Francisco, from the Bay Area north.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
The quick version of the story, because I don't think I've ever told it on the show, is that I don't fly.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
So, not anymore, so I came to California via bus.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
The bus made it, we had a bunch of trouble getting over the Sierra Nevadas.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
We made it into Sacramento and on the way to San Francisco, the window on the door was flapping out of place.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Oh, yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
And so we got as far as Vacaville and they were going to turn the bus around and have us just be stuck in Sacramento, at least as far as our final destinations were concerned.

06:23.000 --> 06:38.000
My only regret is that since we stopped at a Home Depot to get duct tape and they taped up the window to the door in three places, my only, my only unfortunate coincidence there is that I did not get a picture of it.

06:39.000 --> 06:47.000
Because my phone was dying and I was keeping in touch with my now employers that I was going out there for an interview with, and yeah, that was a pretty crazy response.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
That was dying for a tweet to corporate.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
It was.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
We will get to video games in just a moment, but since it is a bit of a sentimental show of sorts with Jason saying goodbye for now.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, watch Jason be back for next week's OLR via Skype.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, I'll be driving this time next week, so not so much.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Syal says, Jason will get snowed in and have to stay. Well, it won't snow here, but maybe up the mountain.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
That's not an impossibility either.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
That happened to you once.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh, yes. It's happened a number of times.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, you are more than welcome to crash and co-host any time. I don't know about the Skype thing because we're actually trying to get away from that.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Babies are a special circumstance, but you are more than welcome to the studio any time.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I can always call in towards the end, and of course I will be back for any, for numerous occasions, I hope.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
So, Jason always has a place here at the table, and quite a huge compliment here from Tigerclaw.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
If there is enough demand, VX JasonXV should be a recurring co-host on OLR.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
I'd like that whole, if there is enough demand. No, you know you're always welcome here, so...

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
I have interesting ideas, and it's really just a matter of time and also being able to do it regularly, reliably, and correctly.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
Yes, ideally we would take Jason's very, you know, dulcet tones and have him head up a new show for potentially The Voice Geek Network.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Stop spoiling it, Rob!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I won't. Stop, I'll stop.

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
Alright, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. We gotta take it back to video games here, and we're gonna start off with a whopper.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And I'm gonna just give this disclaimer in advance. I know some of you guys out there are probably sick to death of hearing about this game.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
But it's very rare when a video game goes all the way to CNN and the national news and makes these types of headlines.

08:37.000 --> 08:47.000
And we've really gotta get into the what the heck is going on. Dark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind starting us off tonight with a little discussion on a mobile game that's gone insane.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap, fap.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Fappy bird. I mean, flappy bird. I mean, whatever the hell bird that is.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
So yeah. And I'm sure everyone already knows, but I don't care. I'm gonna tell you again.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
Basically the developer, Dong Nguyen, basically said that he's done no more. He can't take it anymore.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
And so, as of now, flappy bird is off of the iOS store. Off the app store. You can't get it anymore.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And so I got it before it went down, but I'm not gonna play it. I just happened to get it so that I could have it. In case.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And so you kinda contributed to the problem.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, but they're not getting any ad revenue off of me.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Fair enough.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
No ad revenue off of this girl.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay, before we get into the why did he stop, let's go back even further because flappy bird isn't a game that just came out last week.

09:40.000 --> 09:49.000
This game's been out for months and then all of a sudden for some unexplainable reason, I mean this is the going viral on the internet and the truest sense of the word.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
It's just people tell other people and so on and this game just catches wildfire. It is everywhere. Literally everywhere.

09:55.000 --> 10:05.000
And why? Flappy bird isn't exactly that great. I mean, but to be fair, to be fair, I've downloaded flappy bird. I've played it.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
It does have that certain addictive quality, that frustrating, just one more. I can go just one more.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
It is that nice little bite sized game that makes for a decent mobile experience.

10:16.000 --> 10:26.000
I see a lot of people razzing the heck out of flappy bird for its possible ripoff ideas and so forth and I'm not gonna try to defend that.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
But I will say this. But it doesn't even really play like Mario.

10:33.000 --> 10:42.000
But anyway, here's the thing. 98% of the things on iTunes and Google Play and all the stuff that's available for mobile phones, 98% of it's garbage.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
Most mobile phone games are garbage. There's very few games that are borderline decent, that are decent gaming experiences.

10:51.000 --> 11:02.000
And I think some of us are getting sick and tired of them trying to shove gaming experiences into the iPhone or the Android devices that aren't working like Final Fantasy 6.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Stop!

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
At least in the manner that you did it and not like Final Fantasy 4 DS which was, well, not a mobile phone game but done correctly in my opinion.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
So the only games that are really working for me as mobile phone games are little short bite sized games like this, I guess, even though its quality is questionable.

11:23.000 --> 11:31.000
And like social games. I think the DS and the Vita as far as portable gaming go, neither one of them do the social elements particularly well.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I mean they both have their things. DS has street passing that's getting more and more and so forth.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
But, you know, neither one has the behemoth that is word with friends or Quiz Up which I think is a fun little trivia app that's pretty dumbly simple.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
It's not bad. It's like a free little trivia app. It's trivia with friends basically.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You mean like what I go to the pub for?

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah. I mean don't take these things seriously. They're mobile phone games. There's very few creme de la creme games.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
For every Infinity Blade, there's a hundred million thousand needles. You know, like rip off types of things or something. You know what I mean?

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah. Loki, you're awfully quiet over there. Surely you have an opinion on Flappy Bird and this whole thing.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I just tried it this week just to see what the hell it was and I was like, okay, this is stupid.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
And, you know, just hearing about the ad revenue and stuff. I don't know if it's necessarily that people are getting on him.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Because, let me put it this way, even if he takes his game off flying, people are not going to stop bothering this guy.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
So that doesn't seem like the reason to me. It's more like, I guess we're going to go the conspiracy theory route that he's getting a cease and desist for some sort of copying of the game.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Or he's just taking it down for the whole sense that people are going to want it more because they can't have it.

12:56.000 --> 13:04.000
And so people will go seek it out in hell with an APK for Android. You can just go download that off the internet. You don't need to have it off of the Google Play Store.

13:05.000 --> 13:13.000
He's still going to collect ad revenue on every single copy that's out there for that. So, I don't know. It's just ridiculous, I think.

13:13.000 --> 13:22.000
Here's the thing about the whole, the pipes look like they're from Mario Brothers to me. Like, I'm not going to defend it. Like, yes, they look like they're from Mario Brothers.

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
But, again, on 98% of mobile phone games, something was stolen from something else. And the assets are very heavily inspired by other games.

13:31.000 --> 13:45.000
That's not news. And when a news website, like say a particular favorite gaming blog of mine that starts with a K, goes to write a big article about, did Flappy Bird steal its assets from Super Mario Brothers?

13:46.000 --> 13:56.000
What about the other, they showed another game, there's a Flash game that basically is the very same premise and almost the same, you know, not assets, but like the way they had everything laid out.

13:56.000 --> 14:09.000
Whether he did or not, like 98% of the mobile phone games do, and I feel like they're just stealing this guy's success for hits. Nothing abnormal for them.

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
So, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Wham! My game is popular. I'm taking my ball and going home.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
You know, again, if this was a big corporation like Zynga or something like that that was pulling this stunt, then I'd be like, yeah, it's all for publicity.

14:28.000 --> 14:42.000
But it's not. It's one guy who lives in Vietnam who probably was not expecting this to happen and maybe would even admit that the game is somewhat heavily inspired by all these other games.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
I mean, when people go to make games for the first time, they usually make games that are very, very similar to other games like board games, card games, and so on.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
Maybe the guy just, I mean, it's not that he probably doesn't like say no to the money, but I imagine his family's probably getting harassed by the media.

15:02.000 --> 15:12.000
Especially there in Vietnam, probably, because, you know, it's probably a pretty big deal that, hey, this guy in your backyard made this game that's all the rage in the U.S. right now.

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
Like, you know, and what's he going to be able to say about it? There's not a lot to say about it, right? It's a stupidly simple game.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
So, I don't know. I don't think, I don't really believe the conspiracy theories. I really think the guy is cracking under pressure, to be honest, for better or for worse.

15:29.000 --> 15:37.000
But again, I mean, you can haze on Flappy Bird all you want, but I just think most of the stuff on the mobile phones are just like it.

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
So, why are we picking on this even more so because it got popular, you know what I mean? Like, most stuff that's on iTunes is garbage.

15:47.000 --> 16:00.000
If you guys, if anybody thinks, like, the media alone, people that, you know, can find people's personal information, companies that can find people's personal information, they know the name, they look at the individual and get in touch,

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
that can be bad enough on its own if you're not a particularly public person, just dealing with media in general, locally, internationally, God knows from other fronts.

16:09.000 --> 16:22.000
But if you think that he's overreacting to this, go to Twitter, go to Twitter Search, and search for, I'll give one example, but feel free to substitute your own creative words because they probably all exist.

16:23.000 --> 16:32.000
But in Twitter Search, just plug in the individual's username, dongatory, at D-O-N-G-A-T-O-R-Y, and in this case, add the words, fuck you, and press enter.

16:32.000 --> 16:47.000
And look at all the Twitter search results. I'm not surprised at this amount of vitriol because that's the internet echo chamber at large, but it's kind of completely horrifying. And by kind of, I mean very much.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
I don't know what to say. I mean, this is such a weird situation.

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
It's funny because there's so many other details that add to this. Right as we started this topic, apparently people are thinking that they're going to lose the game or it's going to stop working.

17:07.000 --> 17:18.000
That's not going to happen. But until iOS compatibility breaks the game, it will still continue to work. I went to my purchased section, I played the game a little bit, I'm terrible at it, whatever, I don't care, I deleted it.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
I went back and redownloaded it at the start of the show. I have it again.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
Xbox Live, same thing you can do there. Even though they've delisted things like Mortal Kombat trilogy and things like that, you can still download those games if you bought them in the past.

17:31.000 --> 17:42.000
That will not always be the case, and also service shutdowns are a big one, but in terms of this kind of media, it's funny the people that play it and protest and also just hurl these insults at them.

17:42.000 --> 17:57.000
The other weird, sorry, I got train derailed there because I was trying to re-chat at the same time there. Yes, my thought derailed there. Anyway, alright, sorry, live radio.

17:58.000 --> 18:07.000
Dungeon Buster says, imagine the response the guy who came up with Pet Rocks a few decades ago and made millions off of it would get today if Twitter were around.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
Ooh, that is a good example. That's a really good analogy. That's a scary good example. That's why I got derailed, I was thinking one thing and then I read that and I was like, oh, that's a good thought.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, Pet Rocks, wow. Yeah, right? I'm already sure they have a Pet Rock app out there for that type of thing. Oh, they have a Chia Pet app, I'm sure.

18:24.000 --> 18:35.000
But yeah, people are really mean on the internet, and you know, another thing I was thinking of is that you could search Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and put fuck you after it and you'd probably get tons of tweets.

18:36.000 --> 18:49.000
That's that whole celebrity culture that we live in. Or in the case of Miley Cyrus offers. But it makes me think, Jimmy Kimmel does this hilarious segment on his show and it's all over YouTube, the whole celebrities reading me tweets.

18:50.000 --> 19:01.000
It's great. It's great. And yeah, they actually read the tweets and, you know, they'll respond back. Just depending on who the celebrity is, like, you know, I think there was one with Cate Blanchett, and you know, she's got that, you know, British voice, whatever.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And she reads the tweet and she goes, well, now that's not very nice.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
Some of them will find a way to turn it around and make it sound like a compliment. Those are really good.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, it's really funny. So I don't know. I said, but not, not everybody can let it roll off their back like that. Like not everybody's ready for that.

19:19.000 --> 19:28.000
And you know, if this is a pretty simple guy who just coded games in his spare time, whether it was inspired by heavily other stuff or not, he probably just wasn't ready for it.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
It's funny because it's one of those things where there is one good thing about the game. It reached critical acclaim for everybody to play it.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
But everything else, like nitpicking is a thing, but everything else people can complain about.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
The concept is stolen from previous games and there's the, the P.O.P.O., I want to say Chinese something or other game from 2010 that people said it was a ripoff of.

19:51.000 --> 19:59.000
The Super Mario Brothers assets ripoff, the extreme, like despite liking the game, people go crazy about the extreme difficulty of it.

19:59.000 --> 20:13.000
So you, you have this one good thing that brings things together well enough for it to take hold, but then everybody finds everything to complain about and it, it, it escalates dramatically.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, I guess this is good news because I put your theory to the test and I went to Twitter and I searched for orange lounge radio in quotes and I put sucks and I didn't get anything.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
So I'm hoping that just means we're not famous or something.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
There's probably just about me.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
We just haven't made it yet.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, it was funny that you mentioned this because, and I responded to him, although I didn't check for an answer, the guy who did Potter Puppet Pals, I'm following him on Tumblr.

20:38.000 --> 20:50.000
And he was, he's posted a whole bunch of really positive messages that he got and he said, yeah, I get a whole lot of, you know, crap from people too, you know, but I guess that's just the side part of being moderately famous on the internet.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And I was like, yeah.

20:52.000 --> 21:03.000
It's, you said that under your breath a minute ago, the whole like, well, I'm surprised you didn't see anything about me, but you know, in, in all seriousness, you have taken some heat being a host of the show before, because sometimes...

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Because I'm a woman.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Because I'm a woman.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Which, you know, possibly, and you do, you do have strong opinions, which is part of why we have you on the show.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
Strong opinions make for good discussions, right? But you take heat sometimes for that. And you had to learn in the beginning to let it roll off your back.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Because in the beginning it was hard, right?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah. It's, it's, and I keep bringing it up because...

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Not to put you on the spot, but...

21:28.000 --> 21:37.000
Because I think it's absolutely hilarious now being told on a, what was it? Dig response to, uh, get back in the, in the kitchen and stop talking.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Fuck you.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
You just need to have your tongue cut out and never talk again and your fingers cut off and never type again, because that type of behavior is unacceptable.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Your parents should be ashamed of you.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, I mean, let's, that was a dig comment. I mean, that dates it right there.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I know. Yeah. It was like in our second year.

21:58.000 --> 22:06.000
But yeah, but I mean, but in all seriousness, you know, you had to kind of like be able to let that roll off your back and this guy's probably still trying to get used to that too.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
So...

22:09.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah. After a while you just don't care. I mean, oh God, I hate to just put it that way, but it's like, if I see anything negative about me now, I'm just like, you don't know who I am. Fuck you.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Uh, and Loki, Loki's...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Who are you?

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Loki's got some of it too. Loki gets the heat too. I haven't taken as much, I mean, certainly there's been negative things written about me on the internet.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
I, I, I will say this. I get the emails in private. Uh, the I'm going to pray for you emails. I've gotten two of those in the past.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
So I'm going to pray for you, but I'm going to pray for an intervention.

22:40.000 --> 22:52.000
So, I mean, we all, and the first time I was kind of like, I was actually kind of flattered because I was like, wow, somebody really took the time out of their day to like put this, like they must, they must really believe in what they're saying.

22:53.000 --> 23:03.000
But then I was just like, Hmm, interesting. And then, you know, delete, you know, like, what can, what can you do? Like, I didn't really want to respond and engage in a dialogue or what have you, but it was just interesting as all so.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah. And, and by, by the way, guys, I don't really give a shit about whoever that asshole was before. I really don't care.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Fucking people.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Black Wolf found an account that I was going to bring up. There is a twitter.com slash OLR sucks.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Is there really? There is really.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
Get out. It hasn't been updated in three years and it's for a private, uh, religious school.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, I thought it was actually about the damn show.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
No, no, no, no, but I did search. I did, you did orange Laundrio sucks. I did at OLR sucks and a Ronnie Talbot said it.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Our good friend Ronnie from big brother.

23:43.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh, January 26th. And I quote, he's sending it to your, to yourself and OLR. The thing that the tweet that it matched says they never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
They expect auto awesomeness from the MMO from the MMO a couple of weeks ago.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Yeah. He was thinking about League of Legends.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And also tech 2030 would like to say orange Laundrio sucks.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
He just did that cause I opened my big mouth and now we're going to get like five tweets this week to say orange Laundrio sucks. Yeah.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
You know what? You know what sucks?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Your attitude sucks.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
No, no, no, no, no. You know what sucks?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
What?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Vacuum.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
That was like a dad joke.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
Um, so as far as flappy bird goes, uh, just to put, to bring this conversation.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Play the game or don't and stop, stop freaking out.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I give it as much clout as any mobile phone game.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And your 53 point high score speaks to that.

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, you know, if you're going to do something, be good at it. Um, do you think flappy bird will come back?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Jason?

24:46.000 --> 24:56.000
I have no idea. I don't know enough of the detail. I didn't keep up on the news enough to go all pundit on it.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
I have no idea. I hope, um, I hope he makes the correct, the right decisions for himself.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
And he does, he does what works out best for him. And otherwise I don't know. And I don't care.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Loki, will flappy bird be back?

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
It's never, it's not gone. At least on Android. You can just go download it on the internet.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That's true.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Except for episodes of, uh, being Bobby Brown, which I, I don't know about that.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Um, and my thought is it will absolutely come back in probably a few weeks time.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
He just updated it like two days ago before he had his breakdown. So I, it'll be back.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
Here's my response. Why do we care? It's a fucking game.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
There are much bigger things in the world going on to worry about than some guy having an emo fest and taking his game off of the iApp store.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Well, yet here we are with a video game podcast. It is relevant.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
But, but, but, I'm talking when you're seeing this shit on CNN, you know, isn't there, aren't there revolts going on in the Ukraine right now?

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
Don't we have people being abused in Russia right now because of something they were born, you know?

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
We have bigger things to worry about than CNN reporting on a fucking game.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
They have to pad those 24 hours somehow.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
Well, the CNN is just kind of like your grandparents going, hey, look, I found something cool on the internet that you guys have never heard of before.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Unless your grandparents are Southern, then it's all Fox News.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
Have you heard of this thing called Twitter? There are celebrities tweeting each other.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm sure like in a decade or so they'll figure out about, you know, they'll find out about Reddit and then, you know, we'll hear stories about that.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
It's just a little slow and that kind of stuff.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh God, I almost choked at the thought of grandparents on Reddit. That's scary.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
That would be hilarious.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
My television is for my PlayStation 4. I don't use it for television. Oh, unless, unless RuPaul's Drag Race is on. That's the only thing I watch. I swear.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
All right. Maybe Survivor once in a while.

26:55.000 --> 27:03.000
For the record, I don't see, you know what? BBC reported on it, so I am gravely disappointed with the BBC.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Your tax dollars at work. All right.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
That's BBC. They're not our tax dollars.

27:10.000 --> 27:18.000
Anyhow, let's move on. Let's talk about the games that maybe do deserve a little more attention. The types of games that we have been playing this week.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing?

27:22.000 --> 27:32.000
I played Final Fantasy 14 a couple of times this week. I actually finished my Summoner, whatever the crap it was.

27:33.000 --> 27:44.000
And I've been playing Animal Crossing and I've been playing with my work computer because that's fun. It's practically a game.

27:45.000 --> 27:54.000
For the record, I no longer, while it's still a cool job, I will be referring to it as low cat land of cubicles and technology.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Because that narrows it down. For all the homestucks. Which is the point, of course. Yes.

27:59.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah, I was playing a little bit more Zelda. Link Between Worlds. I'm thinking about buying a Triforce necklace. I'm also thinking about getting a Triforce tattoo. In white ink.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
So it will glow under a blacklight.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Is that just an inherent thing of tattoo ink or is it a special...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Anything that's white will glow under a blacklight.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh, of course. Disregard.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Is that it for your gaming week? Yes.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
I actually played a bunch of different stuff. Well, not entirely different stuff, but some different stuff.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
Let's see. I actually got to play a little big planet karting.

28:48.000 --> 28:58.000
Because I've had that from Playstation Plus for the longest time and my son was trying to... he wanted to play Mario Kart or something, but I was in the middle of playing Call of Duty at the time.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
So I was like, alright, let's see what other games are on here. I'm all, hey, you wanna play this one?

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
He's like, no, I'll watch you play. So I got to check that out and it's pretty cool.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
I like how you can reskin all the weapons and everything. So they have a bunch of Mario Kart maps that actually have Mario Kart weapons.

29:18.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't know. It's a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Because I heard ModNation racers have terrible load times and just everything was really buggy and slow.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
It actually turned out pretty cool. So I'm kind of digging that.

29:32.000 --> 29:43.000
And then I played Call of Duty 4 because it kind of went back to that. My friends got us all together on Playstation 3 to play that game.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
So I've been trying to level up because there's no real easy way to do that because we normally play private games.

29:51.000 --> 30:02.000
So I was doing that and then, what else? A little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of, very little bit of Super Mario Galaxy.

30:03.000 --> 30:11.000
I bust the Wii on and unfortunately my disc for Mario Kart doesn't work anymore because that was what we were originally gonna play.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
I was just gonna try to teach Josh how to play that game, but he didn't want to learn. It didn't matter because the disc didn't work.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
That's it. And actually I'm hoping to be able to play it this week. I just bought Jazzpunk, which looks hilarious.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
So I'm gonna try that and also have a copy of the Lego Movie Game waiting for me at my work.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
So I should be playing that later this week because I saw the movie and it's fucking awesome. It's seriously amazing.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Tons of people have been talking about the movie and I've been hearing a lot of really good reviews about it.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
So I'll have to see it at some point. This week is gonna be crazy for me because I have a show this weekend.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
But yeah, I want to check that out at some point. And then apparently the game is not half bad for a movie tie-in game anyway.

30:58.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, it's supposed to be pretty good. It's done by Traveler Tales and they've done all the Lego games, but this one's supposed to be a lot better because it doesn't really stick to a certain story.

31:07.000 --> 31:16.000
They kind of can do whatever they want. And I gotta say though, the movie, I knew it was gonna be good because I was really excited about the whole thing.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
But then, not to spoil anything, at the end it kind of takes a different tone and it's just kind of like, whoa, I was not expecting that.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
I had to go play Legos the day after. Seriously, I've been playing Legos this week and that's what I was doing with my son.

31:32.000 --> 31:39.000
Success. Tigerclaw says, Lego movie made a lot of money this weekend. $69 million. Wow, I didn't realize that.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
And it's Rotten Tomatoes rating is through the roof. 95 last night.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
Well, good for them. It wasn't really on my radar. And it's interesting we bring up the games too because those Lego games, they all do pretty well.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
And they're all pretty good. None of them are really great, but they're all good and most people seem satisfied with their purchases.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
So it's kind of been a long running game series. It's always kind of been there that a lot of people are playing, not a lot of people are talking about.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
They don't always get critically acclaimed, but it's kind of nice to see that they're still doing a good job with it.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
And the other thing, before the movie came out, I was over at Barnes and Noble and they had all the toy sets from the movie. Damn, do I want those toys.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
They had some really crazy sets and all that stuff was in the movie and I was like, oh man.

32:27.000 --> 32:42.000
And you would love, both Rob and Jamie would love Cuckoo Cloudland in there. Seriously, it's almost like straight out of Wreck-It Ralph with the whole...

32:43.000 --> 32:54.000
Well, you're being a super consumer whore, but I don't blame you. I love Legos too, so I have to see the movie at some point. Excellent.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Alright, well, Jason, why don't we go to you and I'll go last.

32:59.000 --> 33:09.000
I wanted to play something else this weekend, this week, other than Forza, last two weeks actually, other than Forza and FIFA, so I bought Peggle 2.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
Because that was the only thing in the Xbox One marketplace that looked remotely interesting and what can I say? Well, it's Peggle 2.

33:17.000 --> 33:28.000
If you've played Peggle, it's Peggle 2. It's cute. The art style is a little bit more zany, cartoony that kind of throws me off guard.

33:29.000 --> 33:40.000
And I was very, very... I had a shock reflex. So, let me change topics a little bit. I was playing a lot with the extra things of the Xbox One this weekend.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
Smart Glass for the Xbox One specifically, SkyDrive and Upload Studio, all of that kind of stuff.

33:46.000 --> 33:55.000
Can I say that I am so glad that the uploads export in MP4 and not WMV and it's kind of crazy how ubiquitous MP4 is everywhere.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
So anyways, I took all of my clips that were actually remotely interesting, uploaded them so I can do fancy things with them now, download them, all that kind of stuff.

34:03.000 --> 34:13.000
So, I was playing Peggle and the third level, the third scene, you know, the first is a unicorn whose name I always forget, the second one is a troll under a bridge.

34:14.000 --> 34:26.000
The third level is a winter wonderland with a sasquatch and, or yeti, I forget which one it is, and when you get the extreme fever, when the level wraps up, he turns around and his butt is censored.

34:27.000 --> 34:38.000
I was, I had a shock, it's like, did PopCap really just do that? Oh, it's a bare-ass joke. So, I saw that and I have video of it and I can upload it and it's silly.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
What puts the two in Peggle 2? Because I really don't know, like, what did they change?

34:46.000 --> 34:55.000
The abilities are different, the characters are, the three that I've gotten, two of the three that have been different, the unicorn is still there, but the troll and the sasquatch are new.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
Um, the game is still the same formula. Playability-wise, besides power-ups, like I said, there's nothing different to speak of.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I still like the owl, the zen owl best of everybody.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
I, yeah, they were all incredibly cute. I loved everything in the version of Peggle that I've played before, rather.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I like that one in which everyone gives you the pinball power.

35:17.000 --> 35:28.000
Um, it's not different. It's very much Peggle. A couple of coworkers and also people that have been visiting the office ask me what I'm playing, what the game is about, whatever it is like that.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
And I look at them and I go, you know The Price is Right? Do you remember Plinko? It's basically that. And I think that's a very accurate statement.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
It's more random and diverse for obvious gaming reasons, but I think it's a pretty good description.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
So I've played a lot of that, basically just kind of pick up and go and stop in between doing things, all that kind of stuff.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
While I was exporting the video last night, I went over and played Peggle. Like an hour and a half of it.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
I think I've come to the conclusion that my first system... I don't know exactly when I'm gonna get a Wii U.

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
Again, this is all financially dependent. But I think this generation, I'm gonna get a PS4 before an Xbox One.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
Again, as always, this has very much to do more with the library than anything else.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
But as it stands right now, there is nothing compelling for me to buy an Xbox One for.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
I have already played Dead Rising four times, and to do it a fifth time seems silly and excessive.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
Not to mention I'm still very jaded by that demo, like I was talking about before.

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
And I just, like, whatever. Don't get me wrong, I love Dead Rising, but a fifth time without actually having an investment in it yet.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Not to mention making a literally financial investment to be able to play it. Eh, whatever.

36:46.000 --> 36:53.000
And I was thinking about it, the more and more I thought about it about the last couple of years, I missed a lot of really good shit last generation.

36:54.000 --> 37:03.000
Because my PS3 library is all of five games. I missed Infamous. I missed Prototype. I missed Tomb Raider. I missed Uncharted. I missed Last of Us.

37:04.000 --> 37:13.000
My PS3 has been horribly completely neglected, which I will be correcting thanks to PlayStation Plus and the revolving door of excellent games.

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
But I missed a lot of really good games that I never played whatsoever. Not at friends' houses, not at anything like that.

37:22.000 --> 37:31.000
So this generation, I'm gonna change that. PS4 or Wii U will be my first console of choice probably sometime this year. I have to imagine sometime this year.

37:31.000 --> 37:42.000
Not to mention, I really like the PS4 camera abilities and just Playroom in general. The PS4 camera seems so much better than the Kinect.

37:43.000 --> 37:53.000
Because it has something more tactile and more controllable in the sense of the controller camera. The controller, did they even have a name for that?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
The move in the controller? Whatever.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Six axis? Still?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
That's probably true.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
The thing that does stuff.

38:02.000 --> 38:11.000
The glowy light in the back of the controller. The Kinect, I love the voice commands and it'll be interesting to see how the PS4 holds up against the Xbox One in that regard.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
But as far as interactivity is concerned, the Kinect control still really sucks.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
The other thing, I don't know if, I don't remember if this was a thing in the Xbox console or if you could only do it with games.

38:24.000 --> 38:32.000
But with the original Xbox 360, you could hold your hand in place to select an item. With the Kinect, with the Xbox One, you have to push forward.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
That's terrible. I don't know what it is, but I cannot do it. And so on some of those smaller pins on the Xbox One's interface, fucking impossible for me.

38:41.000 --> 38:49.000
I don't have the most steady hands in the first place, but the slowness to maintain smooth motion for the icon on screen, I just don't like it.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
I'm horribly inaccurate with it, which has been a complaint against Kinect the whole time.

38:55.000 --> 39:05.000
But yeah, it's unfortunate because I love what they, everything else that Microsoft has been doing, the fact that they have good online communities looks fun.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
But I missed a really good library in Sony, and so I think I'll change that this year.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
I think Xbox One's library is going to be very compelling at the end of the year.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Absolutely.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
It's going to be very interesting to see what it has versus Sony, but yeah. Right now I'm totally happy with my PlayStation 4.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
Xbox One will come eventually, especially if they get some of those games out this year.

39:30.000 --> 39:38.000
If it's true, some of the rumors we were talking about last week with Forza Horizon, that'll sell me a console right there, and Halo 2 Anniversary would be great.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Quantum Break looks great.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
A lot of it is more a reflection of the fact that my game plane really took a nosedive over the last five years.

39:47.000 --> 39:56.000
And so that's more, not that aspect of it, I'm not knocking one system or another, but I think there is already enough on the PlayStation 4 now to get started.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
And there will continue to be as will happen with any console.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
But, just saying, that's the direction right now that I'm leaning on, and if I can swing it in a couple of months, that's more than likely going to be my choice.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Alright, well anything else for your gaming week this week?

40:12.000 --> 40:18.000
I did play Flappy Bird, I got 15 or 16 I want to say. I deleted it, I don't give a shit.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Alright, fair enough.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
Okay, my gaming week has been almost predominantly one game. I did do a few other games together.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Final Fantasy XIV!

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Well, that's a given. That's every week.

40:32.000 --> 40:41.000
I did watch Extifer play a little bit of Outlast, which is on PlayStation 4, so I got to see a little bit of that, because I haven't played it in Steam, but I haven't played a whole, whole lot.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
And I definitely was having that whole, like I hear my mom in the back of my head,

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Rob, that is gross! Why are those corpses hanging? That is disgusting!

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Please tell me that you marked it for download, at least, on PlayStation Plus.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Oh yeah, I already have it on my PlayStation 4, I just, I keep looking at it going, should I play it?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
And then I go, no, I'm going to play more Tomb Raider.

40:59.000 --> 41:10.000
And despite, as we've said a number of times now, despite not having a PlayStation 4, if you have a PlayStation Plus account, buy those games from the website, so you have them as soon as you have the system.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
And Alan has trolled me at least three times this week, he goes, so, you should go play the scary game, and you should stream it for your people.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Yes.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
And I'm like, no.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yes! Do it!

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
When I finally get a stinking camera, maybe, but those things are still hard to find.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
October 31st, maybe? Anyway.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
Maybe. Here's the thing, here's the thing, I would love to play more Outlast and Tomb Raider and all that stuff, but my life has been consumed with a particular title on the 3DS this week.

41:35.000 --> 41:43.000
And, of course, this is Shane's fault, because y'all know he was here visiting last week, and Shane has this ability to really sell you on a video game.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
He's really, I don't know why-

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
He's like, I'm even trying.

41:48.000 --> 41:56.000
I don't know why he isn't like a video game salesman for like a major company trying to, well, in a way he kind of is, but he needs to be like even higher up in that.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
He needs to be selling like the big stuff towards, you know, big chains and stuff, because he's really good at selling that stuff.

42:01.000 --> 42:10.000
So, anyway, the game he convinced me to get the demo for was a game called Bravely Default, which is on the 3DS, and I know there's been a lot of chatter about the game this week.

42:11.000 --> 42:19.000
And, like, you know, Shane, one of my closest friends, first time I'd seen him in three years, he was here on the show Sunday, and then Monday, what do we do?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
We sat here and we just played the Bravely Default demo in the same room for like most of the day.

42:23.000 --> 42:35.000
I sunk five hours into the demo, and then the game itself was released on Friday, so I realized after a couple hours of the demo that I was going to buy this game, so I bought it so it would be delivered by Friday.

42:36.000 --> 42:46.000
And since Friday to now, I've already sunk eight hours into the game, which might not sound like a lot, but for somebody who has like gamer ADD as bad as I do and everything else that I have going on,

42:46.000 --> 42:53.000
pretty much every moment that I haven't been doing something for the show next week or what have you, I've been playing Stink and Bravely Default.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
If you don't know what the game is, it's basically the Final Fantasy 3DS remake.

43:03.000 --> 43:12.000
I mean, the art style is very similar, this one has all the voice acting though, but it is a classic Final Fantasy game.

43:12.000 --> 43:25.000
If people are pissed at the direction Final Fantasy has been taking with XIII and some of the more recent titles, then maybe this is the game that they really want, because this game takes a lot of its nods from a classic Final Fantasy game.

43:26.000 --> 43:37.000
Now obviously it's not Final Fantasy Bravely Default, it is a new series that Square Enix is trying, but they've come out and pretty much said this was originally going to be a sequel to the Warriors of Light, the original DS title.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
You know, we're doing some different things with it. I mean, the only thing, you know, it's not chocobos and mogs, it's some different stuff.

43:44.000 --> 43:53.000
A lot of the jobs are very similar, the job system is straight out of Final Fantasy V, so why do I like this game so much if I kind of have this whole been there, done that attitude about it?

43:53.000 --> 44:09.000
Because there's something very familiar yet inviting about the game, where yes, it's an all new story, but it feels kind of like I'm picking up this favorite TV series that was on 20 years ago that hasn't really been on in a very long time.

44:10.000 --> 44:18.000
It's like, oh, they're out with a new season, and it's a little bit different, or it's a spinoff, but it's kind of like that old show that you miss, and that's kind of where I'm at with Bravely Default.

44:18.000 --> 44:28.000
They do some interesting things with street passes and friends lists too, which they have this whole little like, rebuild the town, and you can open new shops and things like that.

44:29.000 --> 44:37.000
And you, kind of this very Facebook-y, apply the workers, and you can, you know, and if you street pass people, you get more workers. There's that whole thing in it.

44:38.000 --> 44:52.000
And also, the game does an interesting thing where you can actually send moves to friends. Like, let's say for whatever reason I have a friend who's not leveling a white mage in their party, but I have a white mage in mine.

44:53.000 --> 45:02.000
I could send a protect spell through the internet, and then my friend could actually use it in their game one time. And then if they need it again, I could send it again or whatever.

45:02.000 --> 45:15.000
And you can do street passes and send all those. That was kind of neat. It's something a little different for street passing, and it gives a certain competitive and cooperative element too to playing this game at the same time with your friends.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
Like, I have an awful lot of 3DS friends who are playing this game right now, and it makes it kind of fun.

45:22.000 --> 45:31.000
So, yeah, that's all great. Now, I do have to razz the game for at least one thing, and the game is infamous for this, and I know we've talked about it on this show in the past.

45:32.000 --> 45:42.000
The game has one, only one, but it's a microtransaction. And it's a microtransaction that some could argue makes it pay to win.

45:43.000 --> 45:52.000
I don't know why this is, well I know why it's in there, because some people are gonna buy it and it's gonna, you know, hey, it's more money in Square Enix's pocket.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
And Square Enix has done a lot of questionable things when it comes to microtransactions in the land of mobile lately.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
Like that Final Fantasy All, the bravest game from last year, that was utter garbage that came out.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
And then there was the, you know, the recent Final Fantasy VI remake that came out that has some questionable art choices in it.

46:09.000 --> 46:20.000
So they're doing some very weird things, and one of the things, what it is, the one microtransaction is, you can buy this thing called a, I think it's a second potion or a second default or something like that.

46:20.000 --> 46:27.000
It's a, it's a sleep potion, I don't know what it is, what it's called. But you use it in the middle of battle and you get to do an extra move.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
That's kind of like the big thing about it. And it can help you if you have a lot of them, because I think when you spend 99 cents you get three of them.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
So you could really turn the tide of a boss battle by using these.

46:39.000 --> 46:48.000
Now it is important to say, you do get these SP points on your own if you leave your DS sleeping, every eight hours you'll get one.

46:48.000 --> 46:59.000
Like a typical Facebook game. But this element is in there, and it, it, I, some people are going to question me for thinking this way, but I don't really care, it's my honest gut.

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
It puts a tarnish, it puts a little poo smear on the game. I mean literally, it's a little poo smear on what is otherwise a great game.

47:09.000 --> 47:15.000
You kind of look at that and go, that is fucking cheap, that is tacky, that is a tacky ass color they chose for that.

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
I, I can't help but feel that way. Is that I go, gosh this game is such a great, man I remember those classic Final Fantasy games.

47:25.000 --> 47:35.000
I was, I'm so excited to play another classic Final Fantasy game, but then oh, there's this poo stain of the modern, you know, microtransactions and how that has filth up some of our games.

47:35.000 --> 47:44.000
And so that to me, I didn't like that. But I'm just ignoring it. I'm just pretending it's not there and I'm not, I'm not accessing it. I'm not going to give them my money for that future.

47:45.000 --> 47:58.000
I hope you guys out there won't spend your money on it either, not even to check it out. We have to send the message that JRPGs in America, yes, microtransactions in them, no. Very important.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Bravely Default is not the game we want, but the game we need.

48:03.000 --> 48:16.000
I also just want to say quickly, now I see some folks in the chat, I see actdeft in chat at live.vognetware.com. Bravely Default's demo didn't solve me into the game, therefore I'm going to skip it.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
Granted, I need to, oh sorry, oh here it is, Skye, what you're saying about the game that sold you into it is what turned me off of it.

48:23.000 --> 48:33.000
Which is fine, but go check out, the demo is very robust, I will say this, the demo doesn't even scratch the surface of the story and doesn't have any of the voice acting or any of that.

48:34.000 --> 48:41.000
But as far as the mechanics go, it does a pretty good job teaching you the whole Brave and Default mechanics, which in a nutshell, I've talked too long about this game, I'm trying to wrap up.

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
But Default is like defend, but instead of just defending, you stock up an action point to use later.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
So you could defend for two rounds and then unleash three attacks in a certain round.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
But sometimes, as you know, you want to defend against big attacks, it's kind of like a battery, that's the whole Brave-Default system.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
You can get a sense for how that system works in the demo, and even the Streetpass feature and all that is in the demo.

49:05.000 --> 49:15.000
And the other one last cool thing, I thought that was pretty cool, if you play the demo and there's like seven different unlocks you can get, depending on how far you get, for things that carry over into the regular game.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
And it is quite a nice little kick in the pants boost to start the game.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.000
So they are particularly notable, and even if you buy the game before you play the demo, would it still be worth it to play the demo even if you bought the retail game to start with?

49:28.000 --> 49:38.000
Sure. Why not? I think so. All it's going to give you is it's going to give you very basic items that level one characters would have to start, that otherwise you'd just grind to get the money to buy it.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
Like it's going to give you a rod and a hat. It's going to give you two potions and a phoenix down.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Those are the types of things your basic Final Fantasy characters get in the beginning, right?

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
So it's not going to change the tide of the game, but it'll start you off a little better.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
It'll bump the bottom line a little bit higher.

49:55.000 --> 50:06.000
Exactly. There you go. That's interesting. I see a lot of comments in chat, not fans. Rama said, played Bravely default demo, thought it sucked.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
Tech 2030 says, yeah, I played it too, wasn't feeling it. So not everybody's into it.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
I have at least eight friends on 3DS who are playing this right now, which out of my list of 30 people is quite a bit.

50:18.000 --> 50:25.000
So I don't know. If you like the classic Final Fantasy games, at least check out the demo. If it's not up your alley, then more for me.

50:26.000 --> 50:35.000
But yeah, I do hope the game does well enough that they'll want to release more Japanese RPGs in America because I do feel like this is the type of game we keep asking for.

50:36.000 --> 50:45.000
And here it is. And so I really hope that whole micro transaction thing doesn't fuck it all up and then they're going to, people reject the game and then people go,

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
oh, well, Americans didn't want the JRPG. It's like, no, we didn't want this other bullshit that you put in there. Anyway.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
Um, Loki, do you, have you been following Bravely default at all? Do you have any opinions on this whole thing?

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
No, honestly, I mean, it looked like a Final Fantasy game, but other than that, I haven't really followed much of it.

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
Gotcha. All right. Well, we're going to get into some news stories here real quick. Some housekeeping. Um, I don't have a lot tonight.

51:12.000 --> 51:25.000
Just twitter.com slash O L R and facebook.com slash orange launch radio. If you want to follow us on social media, there's also google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is our, uh, uh, Google plus page, which we'll get to the, uh, question of the week there.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
We do get quite a few responses. So somebody's using Google plus there's at least a handful of people there.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
There's at least three.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
That's why I keep giving out the URL. There's somebody's on it. Plus the more Google kind of forces you on it. I think some people just kind of accept, all right, I might as well use this.

51:40.000 --> 51:46.000
All right. Um, let's get into some gaming news. We've got quite a bit tonight, so let's get into it. Loki.

51:47.000 --> 51:55.000
Okay. So, um, in March we're going to be having the first kind of installment of the Melger solid five series starting with ground zeros.

51:56.000 --> 52:12.000
And, uh, it is coming out at more of a budget price, kind of like, um, you know, 29 99 I think for, uh, the physical copies on, uh, uh, PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 and, uh, 49 99 and Xbox one, um, something like that.

52:12.000 --> 52:21.000
And, uh, the kind of bad thing about it though, aside from, you know, the fact that it's not the full Melger solid five game, it's only two hours long.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
And that's if you actually do the standalone, you know, campaign and everything, I guess there's some side stuff you can do, but it doesn't really add a whole ton of extra.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
So it's almost like you're paying for like a glorified demo, if you will, and, uh, kind of, um, you know, add insult to injury there.

52:38.000 --> 52:51.000
The full game might not even be out this year. In fact, the window right now for, uh, Melger solid five, the Phantom pain is anywhere between October, 2014 through December, 2015.

52:52.000 --> 53:00.000
So I guess maybe, you know, the incentive that, Oh, it's only two hours long as well. It may be the only two hours of the game you get to play this year.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
Didn't Gran Turismo five have something like this where before they released the game, there was the whole prologue or whatever that was.

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
They do that with Gran Turismo five. And even if you remember, um, like Dead Rising two had that kind of prologue Xbox live arcade game.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Yeah, but that was like a $10 game and it was more than two hours, wasn't it?

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Uh, it was about two hours.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
I was going to say it certainly wasn't longer. It certainly wasn't as much as four. I think I probably finished it close to the same time frame.

53:28.000 --> 53:35.000
But at least it was a lot cheaper. Whereas, you know, you're talking about now it was arcade priced instead of half, three fourths retail price.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
I love that whole, it's a budget price at $49 on Xbox one. What?

53:40.000 --> 53:45.000
Nope. It's $10 less than any normal game release. Ooh, that's a, that's a, that's a massive savings right there.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
I get that video games carry a bit of a premium for the, you know, type of entertainment they provide.

53:51.000 --> 54:00.000
And like, you know, it wouldn't be out of question to pay $30 for a Blu-ray movie that's only two hours, right? But this is, right? But this is starting to push it.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That's a funny comparison considering the movies are rarely longer than two hours.

54:03.000 --> 54:09.000
Well, some of them are epics though. Rarely. Rarely. Rarely.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
Okay. But anyway, my point is still that, you know, that's a lot of money to drop on a two hour experience.

54:16.000 --> 54:25.000
Yes. And it really does feel like this is something to try and boost Konami's bottom line because the game isn't coming out in a particular financial year that they need it to.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
So this is just a little like.

54:28.000 --> 54:47.000
Well, and Konami, I mean, they don't really have a whole ton of stuff coming out. I mean, they have Castlevania, Lords of Shadows 2, and I know Phantom Pains, and Ground Zeroes, and Pro Evo is really the only stuff I know on the slate so far aside from, you know, the rumored maybe reboot of Silent Hill or another entry into that.

54:48.000 --> 54:59.000
Konami's kind of lost me with a lot of that stuff too. Like, I used to love Castlevania and now this new one, I forgot. I just don't care. I didn't even really like the last one that was out on PlayStation 3 and stuff.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Talking about the Lords of Shadows.

55:02.000 --> 55:12.000
Yeah, I just don't like the direction those games have ended up going. They're not what they used to be, you know? So it's kind of like I'm just like, eh, don't care. Some people will disagree with me, but that's fine. That's opinion.

55:13.000 --> 55:27.000
I remember when I first saw this article that I thought the swing was from December this year to October next year, which a 10 month swing is pretty bad, but a 15, 14, 15 month swing is a little bit crazier.

55:28.000 --> 55:38.000
It could, it may come out at the end of this year or it could be out sometime in the entirety of next year. Yeah, that's a, that's a real good target date to provide anybody with.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
Anybody here planning on dropping the $40 on the Metal Gear Solid 2 hour side story demo-y thing?

55:47.000 --> 55:57.000
I might, to be honest, just because I really do love the Metal Gear series and I need to start playing more than just the core series, even though this is technically part of the core series.

55:58.000 --> 56:07.000
I'm assuming I have a PS4 by the time it comes out. That's a good milestone to be against. Get a PS4 before any part of Metal Gear Solid 5 drops.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
Or rather Phantom Pain, not any part of it. Anyways, I might, or we'll just wait for PlayStation Plus to give it to you in like five months after it comes out.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at. I'm gonna wait for the bargain bin or the PlayStation Plus.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
That's the steam sale mentality now, unfortunately.

56:22.000 --> 56:31.000
Well, I mean, well, I'll drop full price. I bought Bravely Default at full price and there's a lot of games I still buy at full price because I want to play them right away, but not this.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Dartetsuya says,

56:36.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah, I wasn't really feeling it with Lords of Shadow. The 3DS ones seem cool, but the PlayStation 3, 360 ones just seem like a God of War-ish ripoff.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Also, Shadow of the Colossus.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Dungeonbuster says,

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
Weird that they would do a release like this. It's not like fans wouldn't wait for a complete version of the game to get back into Metal Gear Solid again.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Alan Alchemy says,

56:54.000 --> 57:05.000
They need to keep Castlevania on handhelds and keep making clones of Symphony of the Night with slightly new mechanics to each game. If the art style and music keeps with the pedigree, they will sell. Don't give me that Castlevania God of War crap.

57:06.000 --> 57:18.000
Hey, real quick, since I'm about to put him down. Hey, since I normally don't get to see him and, you know, because I'm at the show normally, my son's right here next to me.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
I was wondering if you want to say hi. Josh, you want to say hi?

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
No.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Hi, Josh.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Say hi.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
What?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
He's tossing his pants up in the air.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
You're a silly boy.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Yeah.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
Josh, you're going to have to keep this show going into its 40th year when you're our age.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Are you going to do the radio show with Daddy when you get older?

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Can you get older?

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
No?

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
He'll have to stop being so shy.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Alright, he's being shy.

57:56.000 --> 58:02.000
That's fine, that's fine. I was shy at that age, too. Alright, let's move on with some more news, Jason.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
That is very strange to think about. A shy Rob.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
I know, right?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Scary thought.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
To rigid our participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, police.

58:16.000 --> 58:24.000
Amazon has entered into the gaming arena in a big way rather than just being a retailer and, you know, dealmaker and everything else.

58:25.000 --> 58:34.000
Amazon has acquired Double Helix, which you may know as the people that have most notably, most recently, been working on Killer Instinct for the Xbox One.

58:34.000 --> 58:45.000
It was an intellectual property and talent acquisition, so reportedly all 75 employees will continue working from home base in Orange County, I think it was?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Irvine? Orange County.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
75 people on staff all will be retained through the transition as Double Helix becomes under the wing of Amazon.

58:57.000 --> 59:03.000
This has furthered the theory that Amazon is going to expand their hardware division to include a gaming console.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
Obviously they already make Kindles, they already make the Kindle Fires more specifically, more interestingly.

59:10.000 --> 59:22.000
But there have been rumors with the fact that Amazon controls its own little Android ecosystem that should they decide to ramp up production of a lower-cost, competitive gaming console,

59:22.000 --> 59:41.000
that now they have somebody to presumably guarantee solid first-party titles in addition to being able to take up other retailers, other Android devs that want to sign on to the Amazon App Store and join in the ever-growing ecosystem that Amazon.com entails.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Didn't we have a rumor a few months ago that Amazon was doing an Ouya, basically?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
That Amazon was going to make their own Ouya console, like an Android console?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Probably at some point.

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
And I think Amazon is looking at, gee, where did Ouya fuck up? Oh yeah, Ouya, like they don't have any games.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So by having their own in-house to make exclusive titles for this device, they're going to guarantee a few more sales.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Plus, you know they're going to throw in some deals for Amazon Prime. They'll have a frickin' thing fly to your house and drop the console on your doorstep.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I mean, there was something last year, maybe late 2012, that long-time subscribers to Amazon Prime just, if they didn't already have a Kindle on their account, would just have a Kindle sent to them.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So yeah, Amazon's method for getting...

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That was weird.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Sorry, we lost Loki for a minute, but he's back. Sorry, Jason.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Amazon's method for making money, they sell everything at cost, and they make their money back in interest by paying vendors back well before license terms, well before payback terms, and accrue the interest from that.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
That's where all of most of their money comes from.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And then everything else, the fact that they're getting into same-day delivery, local delivery for vegetables is obviously a big deal, but as soon as they can be their own courier, get trucks to your house?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Amazon's gonna be a force to be reckoned with.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Or those frickin' drones! Not that I think that's actually gonna happen, because it'll get tied up in government red tape for 20 years.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And power lines, but that's a dumb joke.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But, I mean, that is literally what they're trying to do, is have little aliens drop them at your door. That is their dream.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Absolutely.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And I think most of us are like...

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I'm gonna order a car and have them drop a car off.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I think most of us are like, yes please, send the robot army over, I want my video game right now.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I'm... I... I know the amount of abuse, and it's kind of scary to think about the viability in metropolitans, like, oh, I don't know, New York and San Francisco and places with high-rises where navigating it may be a little bit more difficult.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
As if it's hard to avoid a solid object in, you know, a couple hundred feet up, but...

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
If they could drive around in the fifth element, they could figure out how to use that airspace.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
That's an apt comparison.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Just go look at future movies where they all drive around, and Star Wars, the planets, come on, they'll figure it out.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Something interesting that I didn't even realize was who Double Helix is actually composed of.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I did not... I forgot that they were born out of SHINee and the Collective, so these are the people that have Earthworm Jim, Sacrifice, MDK, Star Wars Episode III to the extent...

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I don't remember how good Episode III was. The prequel Star Wars games were really hit or miss in the various incarnations they had, but there's a lot of talent there.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And, like I've said a couple of times now over the last couple shows, Killer Instinct is fucking amazing!

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
It is a gorgeous game with detail for four fighting game buffs or not.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The game is incredibly attractive and so well built to the extent that I actually understand fighting games.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Terrible at it, but I understand it. There's a lot of talent there, and for Amazon to keep them all on board, anything they want to do to be able to provide a compelling product...

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000
This is a good choice. It's gonna be a pretty interesting one to two years to see what Amazon's gonna do with them.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
C. Allen in our chat room says, I for one welcome our robot Amazon overlords.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Let's see, Tech 2030 says, I got a really awesome deal from Amazon using my Amazon Visa and got a Kindle for $30. Did you get paid for that statement? Did I just read a commercial? I think I did.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I always, whenever I buy stuff, I see the $50 gift card thing for applying for an Amazon Visa.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Moving on to less commercially sponsored stories.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I don't know, this is pretty commercially crap.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Well, let's hear it.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:55.000
EA has a free to play game called Dungeon Keeper, and it's very heavy on the transactions. I refuse to call them microtransactions because a transaction is a transaction and everyone drop your damn prefixes.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But now there is new accusation coming out against Electronic Arts saying that they've been manipulating the ratings on the game.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But one of the, the guy who's behind the Dungeon Keeper studio, that's EA Mythic, said that basically it's people just remembering the original game with fondness and pulling the whole nostalgia thing.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But apparently it's going because of the way the Android works for giving a game less than five.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It asks you to leave feedback as a sort of misdirection thing. So that's where that's coming from.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I don't, I actually wouldn't put it past EA for this, but they're still, you don't manipulate a ratings of your game to make it look better because then that just makes you look like crap.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Well, this also goes back to the fact I said earlier that 98% of the stuff that you get on the mobile phone marketplaces are garbage.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And the reason why they're so highly rated is because of stuff like this. Or, you know, they give a little kickback to their five-star reviewers such as an in-game item or a, you know, something to, like a little average, like one game I play actually displays five-star reviews in the game with the names in them.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So it's like you're famous for, you know, for a minute. So it's just, I don't know, like this kind of stuff is ridiculous.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Well, this game was just ridiculous in the first place. I mean, I don't know if you saw like some of the coverage of it, but I mean, it's taking the whole, you know, free-to-play kind of structure and just really exploiting it.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
For example, you know, to break certain blocks to create dungeons literally takes hours if not days unless you want to pay real money to speed it up.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And I'm just gonna, I'm gonna keep it real here. This EA Mythic, like they did Warhammer Online, which was, that was a cool little MMO, you know, it was, it didn't ultimately end up working out because it just didn't work as a premium game in a very competitive marketplace.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But ever since then, EA Mythic's done this and they did Ultima Forever Quest for the Avatar, which was also a mobile phone game that I found to be offensive.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:31.000
As an Ultima fan, I was like, what garbage has this sunk into? Like, sorry, that's just my opinion, you know, as somebody who kind of grew up on the Ultima series on PC, I was like, oh my gosh, Lord British would like take a chainsaw to this if he could, which he's not in the game.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:45.000
What are you talking about, man? Lord British is making fucking crappy Facebook games. Remember the crappy YouTube shit? I had the yard sale thing that I had to play through for that stupid Ready Player One contest? Yeah, that was Lord British. Thank you!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I guess he hasn't fared much better, to be honest. He also made Tabula Rasa, which wasn't a very good MMO either, so I guess things like Ultima and Lord British were best in the 80s, sorry to say.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I do believe the meme is ratings fuckery. John Gruber, Daring Fireball. Wow, Daring Fireball. Way to go, Jason.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Daring Fireball, written by Gruber, had a big stint, and it's still a reasonably perpetual thing about people that will take examples of ratings nag screens and a bunch of other really nonsense stuff in-app and send it to them, and so he's pinned a couple articles about it.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:44.000
It's kind of like the Metacritic argument, that when ratings are everything because it's some aspect of something being quantifiable, people do whatever they can to make it as good as possible, because there is legitimate benefit tied to this kind of stuff, unfortunately.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Hey, I always ask people that enjoy this show to go give it a nice rating on the various websites.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
You know, I actually got feedback about that from somebody, that being suggested to rate something a certain way makes them not want to rate it at all.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Well, you say it once, you say it as a part of habit in the closing, you don't browbeat it.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I'm also very transparent in my reason for saying it. I'm just like, you know, we do this show, we don't ask for your money or any of this stuff, we just want you to help spread the word, so either tell a friend or two.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That's what I told him. He's like, oh, well, okay. Just some people, I don't know what it is.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
There's definitely that whole, no, I don't want to do something because somebody told me to do it. It's not an uncommon reaction.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And the third example was going to be, whenever we talk about things like this, it comes up a second time in the show.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Well, my other thought is, fine, don't do it. I'm not going to cry or I'm not going to come to your house and berate you. If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But I'm just kind of like, it would mean a lot if you would.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Please.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Alright, anyway, well, it's interesting that this story is out there, because now, I would say it's backfiring, but it's also giving the game publicity.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Because I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, well, now I just have to see how bad this game is, or now I want to download this game just so I can give it a one-star review.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So, I don't know. I'm sure it's, you know what they say, press is press and still exposure.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Well, just to kind of go back to what you were just saying, they were justifying the structure of the game and all the in-app purchases or we'll see all these five-star reviews. People like it.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah. Dungeon Buster, by the way, follows up saying, British is also working on Shroud of the Avatar, a spiritual successor to Ultimo with MMOish stuff.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh yes, I remember that Kickstarter. It was, because that's where a lot of those folks are now to fund their games is on Kickstarter.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Well, best of luck. I hope it doesn't suck like this Ultimo game on iPad did.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Yeah. Alright, so Call of Duty, you know, it's been coming out annually every November and so far they've had a few studios kind of juggling development on it with both Infinity Ward and Treyarch kind of putting out the games each year, although it's not necessarily just them.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:27.000
They have other studios working on different aspects including multiplayer and DLC and stuff. And one of those companies is actually Sledgehammer Games, which is now going to be taking up the main development of one of these games each three years now.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:36.000
They're going to have a three-year development cycle instead of, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, it's now going to be Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games and so on and so forth.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Hopefully they'll make them better because they've been kind of, I don't know, they definitely went down this year, I think, with Ghost. A lot of people were disappointed. Black Ops 2 was pretty great.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
To see that they were losing steam, right?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Well, it's just that the Ghost didn't have a really good hook to it. It was just kind of like, okay, something happened and now it's post-apocalyptic, yay!

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So I think just putting a little bit more effort into it is going to help in the extra development time. Hopefully it'll polish up the game a bit.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It'll be interesting to see what they do because each kind of studio brings a little different type of gameplay into it. You have a lot of the zombie stuff with Treyarch and they did some different things with multiplayer and things.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know, it'll be interesting. I mean, I think that they need to do something to kind of freshen up the series because, especially, you know, going out, they were like the number one franchise each year and now they're not.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And, you know, people are starting to realize it's getting stale. So it'll be interesting to see how next year turns out.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I'm going to say something crazy right now. I have never, ever played a Call of Duty game.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Me either.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Maybe not too crazy, but...

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Well, there's a lot of people out there who have never, ever played Dead Rising or Pagle 2 or the things you talk about. I mean, there's just, you know, there's people that don't watch certain movies. There's people that don't read certain books or watch certain TV stations.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
It just seems strange to me because there are so many of them and I have literally missed every single one of them.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So, there's so many things about the series that I don't know. And some of the things I'm curious about is how coherent, how, like, as a whole product are the games in a particular series?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
In the original, you know, like, unsubtitled Call of Duty, in the Ghost series, in the Modern Warfare series.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I know Modern Warfare has followed a storyline, but do the other series actually follow a coherent storyline from type to type?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:00.000
They do. At least I can speak for Modern Warfare, Black Ops, well, Ghost, I don't know because there's only one game in that franchise, but I know those two have had a storyline that's kind of progressed through the whole thing.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And what's, though, the inter-story relationship between the different types?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Well, as far as the campaign goes, it's literally just the events and the story tie into each other. Like, there's literally a narrative from one game to the next.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Although, you know, with, like, Black Ops 2, it's more of, like, flashbacks and stuff, but there is an actual narrative to it. And Modern Warfare, actually, it was just straight through, like, it was a progressive storyline through the whole series.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It is shocking to me that they could do this coherently enough with three overlapping studios with their own direction, but also, like, you guys know the thing about how Pixar always refers to an old series and a new series in a current movie.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It, that's proof that it can be done, but it's literally, like, the equivalent of name-dropping. You do it once and it's over. For anybody to be, for any studio to be able to do this coherently across multiple years, across multiple franchises, across multiple games, while overlapping things are happening, that's stunning.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
It sounds incredibly interesting, and I should play a game or two because I'm interested in them, but...

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I'm not sure on, like, Call of Duty 1, 2, and 3, if those were a World of War even, I guess, might tie into all that stuff. I don't know if those had actually, you know, a coherent storyline between them, but 2 and 3 were good. I don't know if it necessarily has a tie into each other, but they're fun.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Let me ask this ignorant question, too, since I don't really follow the series either.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Since we're all airing out our lack of Call of Duty experience on the show.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well, here's the thing, is that I understand, you know, they have to do this because the games haven't been selling as well or whatever, and I hear that there's been a lot of competition with the Battlefield series, but my understanding is that Battlefield 4 was kind of ass.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Or at least the, I mean, that's just my understanding. I could be completely off base, but all I see is bitching about how the online is just broken to hell and EA fucked it again and all this stuff.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Did you wind up following DICE? Because that'll, that'll, uh, that'll tilt your mental image of Battlefield 4 quite a bit.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Well, they're also a little bit different. I mean, like I'd say comparing Battlefield and, you know, Call of Duty is kind of like comparing, you know, Forza, or Gran Turismo and Forza Horizon.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I mean, definitely Call of Duty is a lot less realistic and more all about just like kind of scripted action events and stuff like that.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And Battlefield even kind of went that route, but they're also trying to be a little bit more realistic, although you watch any of the gameplay and multiplayer and you're just like, what?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You just bail out of an aircraft in air and just kill the other guy with a rocket launcher and then take over the plane that was pursuing you. Yeah, that's not exactly realistic in my book.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You know, I don't play a lot of first person shooters, but WhatUpG's comment here in the chat room makes me think of this. WhatUpG says, I am looking forward to Titanfall and I kind of go, me too.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Actually, I really want to play Titanfall and I really want to play Destiny. And those are usually...

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Well, Titanfall is pretty much just like Call of Duty, but with Max. I mean, it's literally...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
The gameplay is pretty much... Yeah.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I like Max. I'm on board.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Sign me up. I wasn't interested in your series until you put Max in it. Now I'm here. Yes. Sign me up, please.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I hate it. Remember, they tried that with Battlefield and that didn't turn out too well.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Battlefield 2142.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Let's not talk about that. All right, let's keep it moving. We got more stories to get to here.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Over this week, there was a bit of an interesting kerfuffle because Ubisoft made a request to the government, to the US Patent Office, Patent and Trademark Office, to drop the trademark on Watch Dogs.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The message was sent to the USPTO and signed by Yves Guillemont. I probably butchered that because my French, lol.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:02.000
But it was a request for express abandonment that was filed with application serial number 85642398, better known as Watch Dogs, the trademark.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And what I didn't realize was that it actually was passed. Ubisoft lost. They lost by nature of the fact that the trademark for Watch Dogs was ended, was released, was deleted, removed. Pick your word.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:31.000
This was a fraudulent request. I don't know enough about the application process to know if it was a mere spoofed email address, which is really trivially easy to do.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
That's why you get emails from CustomerCare at PayPal.com when it ain't.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Anyways, there was a period of time that Ubisoft still to this moment, Watch Dogs, the Watch Dogs trademark is not active.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:57.000
They responded saying that this was a fraudulent request. They will be reapplying for it. They will invariably get it because this is one of those special circumstances that is absolutely ridiculous.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:08.000
There was various wank about whether they did it wrong and they have to redo it because the logo style for the release cover art has an underscore between the words.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And part of the trademark application is in addition to the terms, you also come up with a mark, a visual representation, and that hadn't been included in the original trademark.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But this, I don't know that I can come up with any other example where somebody, you know, usually we hear about patent and trademark challenges and this kind of stuff.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But this was that somebody deliberately falsified documents and sent a, you know, certified request to the government to drop somebody's legal property.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.000
That's kind of unprecedented. And I'm not sure what to make of this. But Ubisoft will be working with the Patent and Trademark Office to get it back.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Any thoughts on this, guys? Anybody?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I don't even know what else to say. I mean, obviously, I don't want to just repeat what Bobby Blackwolf said. That said, for anybody who's listening to this and hasn't listened to Bobby Blackwolf, please check out vognetwork.com and listen to Bobby's show where he goes into a little bit more detail about this.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Various theories and other things, not to mention the hilarious tie-in for real life imitating art once again.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I, we'll see how this story develops. And that's really all I can say because I just don't, it happened. Everybody was shocked because this is also on the heels of the news two to three weeks ago about the Wii U port being canceled, which apparently they still didn't comment on this time, even with this trademark kerfuffle patent.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Yeah, trademark kerfuffle.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Do you think it could be angry Nintendo fans?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Oh, God. That would be...

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
There are some Nintendo fans that are not to be messed with out there. I'll tell you.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Anybody that wants to stand up for a cause, which I think might also be the story of Watch Dogs. Anyways, this is shocking. This is incredibly interesting. And I just, if this is a PR stunt, I don't get it. I get it, but I don't understand it. I understand it, but I don't. Words are really hard to pick correctly to describe what this may actually result in.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's an unfathomable action that's logically understood, but not emotionally, perhaps?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah. That's a, that's a good way of putting it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:39.000
My honest opinion on all this is that this is a whole lot of to do about nothing because I mean, and I get why people are talking about it, but it's one of those, we all know the trademark laws in this country are all screwed up anyway. So why is this such a big deal that this is such a fricking hassle, like surprise.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Because it's everybody saying, look, look, see, this is what we're talking about. This is what we mean. Everything's broken.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:21:04.000
People have been faking shit for many, many, many years. It's, it, it will be interesting to see if something else happens as a part of this. I can't imagine it did. I think somebody just straight up fucked with Ubisoft because the news has, people have been pissed at Ubisoft for a lot of things for, you know, at least a year and a half now.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Wii U not withstanding the Rayman situation, not withstanding, um, somebody, somebody tried to hassle them and completed to whatever extent it's actually going to make a lasting impact.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
All right. Uh, let's move on dark soccer and then we'll get to release dates.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, just in response to that, fuckery is afoot. That's it. It's all fuckery. But how about something that isn't quite fuckery? There is a game, a classic game, if you will, called Myst.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Who remembers playing Myst?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Me. I remember being pissed off at it and I have a parody of it called P.I.S.T.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I remember the parody too.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yep. Well, anyway, um, it was remade in 1990, actually in 2000, the original was in 1993, sorry. In 2000, it was remade as Real Myst, which was a 3D restoration that you could walk around however you want to.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It was, you know, fully explorable and, um, it got cleaned up for an iOS release and, uh, now the developer, uh, Cyan, um, actually is going to be doing the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition, uh, on PC and Mac via Steam.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It's, uh, well, for UK it's, uh, $12.99 and US it's $17.99, um, and if you already own Real Myst, uh, if you already own Real Myst, you get a, uh, discount of 33% and, um, it's going to basically enhance all the models, the textures, the lighting, everything.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So it's really just a beautiful cleanup of the original.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
That's a nice way to kind of modernize it for, you know, people that are the age we were when this game first came out.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Do we know Cyan is still responsible for this, aren't they?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Yeah.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
They're taking on for, you know, a release every couple of years, like they were doing post Myst, post Riven, post everything else.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Uh, it's really interesting that Cyan is taking on as much of this as they are, uh, not to mention their Kickstarter for, uh, Abduction, not Abduction, but Abduction.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
They're, they're really ramping up to do a lot of amazing things over the next couple of years.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Well, there's a little note here about the original creators. Robin Miller, um, is now a filmmaker, and, um, Augustus Gladstone is, uh, let's see.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Uh, the Immortal Augustus Gladstone is the movie, I'm sorry, that was just made by Robin Miller, and, uh, Cyan is being run by Rand Miller, who was the other co-creator.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And brother.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yes.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
CEO and co-founder of Cyan Worlds, originally near Lucianne, he and brother Robin Miller became famous due to Myst, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And they did stuff.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Yeah.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And stuff happened. The end.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Rageinator in chat says, so Dark Sakura played Myst but got pissed?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I, I didn't really get into it the first time I played it. I've played it since, you know, but...

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I played Myst online for a little bit. That game was kind of creepy.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I just got irritated, that's all.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You know, and then I, and then I discovered Phantasmagoria.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Oh yeah.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Which has been a classic game.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That game was rad.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That game was creepy as fuck.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Alright. Well, uh, we'll, uh, step away from classic PC games for a minute and talk about what is coming out soon. Maybe classics for a future generation, we'll see.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Uh, well this week I'm sure you're anticipating Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I'm not now because I'm too busy with this fucking Bravely default.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
It'll have to wait.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
But all the costumes, Rob. All the costumes.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I know, I know. We got another one coming up later in the show. I'm sure some of you heard about.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Uh, the Far Cry compilation on PlayStation 3 with, uh, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3, and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And they just announced, of course, that, you know, the HD Far Cry is supposed to be coming out at some point.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Which, in the European version, they get that for free. So I was like, well, thanks a lot, US.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Um, let's see, uh, Tokidin, The Age of Demons for Vita is gonna be coming out.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It's supposed to be, like, I think the number one Vita game right now in Japan.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Uh, Danganronpa, Trigger Happy Havoc on the Vita.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And, uh, also a re-release of The Witcher 2, Assassin of the Kings, the silver edition.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
That's on 360.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Um, Civ 5, the complete edition on PC.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And that's it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Alright, well, traveling to Japan, uh, looking at the releases there this week.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Things are pretty quiet on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
That's probably because of the impending release of the PlayStation 4 on the 22nd.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Uh, but as far as this week goes, there are some things to look forward to on other systems.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Um, such as the PlayStation Vita has Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds in a limited edition.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That is out this week.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Um, then you go to the Wii U actually has a release this week and it's kind of a big one.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze gets its release in Japan this week.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So look out for that.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Uh, on the 3DS this week, you get, uh, Magi.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Um, Aratanaru Sekai comes out this week from Bandai Namco.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
That is invariably Magi.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
As well as, uh, a Resha de Iku 3D comes out this week.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I was looking to see what this Magi game is.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
If it's a, uh, anime game or what.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It looks like, um,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
It's an RPG.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah, it looks a little RPG as maybe with some action elements because I see, like, six hits and stuff.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So, probably another action RPG.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Um, let me quickly look at the PSP because they still get releases once in a while.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Yes, um, Akaya Akashia Ayakashino comes out in regular and limited editions on the PSP this week.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I don't know if, is that a movie release?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
No? Just a very cartoony looking game.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Catboys or Foxboys?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Mm-hmm.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
There you go.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That's pretty much it for Japanese releases.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
PlayStation 4 is very soon so it's slowing down a little bit before that's out.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Everyone's pissing themselves.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
22nd?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Well, of course, not Nintendo though.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Things are, you know, with Donkey Kong is a pretty big deal, so.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Well, how about, how about the UK?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
How about it?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
On the 12th of February, there's Far Cry Classic for PC and PS3 and World of Tanks, Xbox 360.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And then on the 14th, we have Inazuma 11.3, Team Ogre Attacks, Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, Loco Cycle for PC, and Tolkien, Age of Demons for Vita.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
That's it.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Alright.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Just a few more stories for you guys.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And nothing happened there.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Just a few more new stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But first, Loki.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Alright, so real quick, Ubisoft, they're doing something kind of unique.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
They have this brand new game that's coming out.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Oh, sorry again.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Uh-oh.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Hi, baby.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Sorry.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
This is, this is why Loki's still at home, guys.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And now the debut of baby number two.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Okay, what I'm gonna do while Loki takes care of that, I'm gonna go ahead.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Oh, good, okay.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
We, uh, we plugged them up.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Alright, anyways, um, I'm sorry, Nellie plugged them up.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Uh, anyways, so, um, there's some devs, I guess, they have this game called, uh, Reroll, which is, um, this, I'm not sure if it's actually gonna be like middleware.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It's supposed to be in their game, they're using this thing called reality sync, which is basically they're scanning the landscape of Earth.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Um, and they're gonna take that, um, using, I guess, um, these, like, drones, um, to basically create really accurate maps of the world and landscape and stuff.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And then they're actually gonna put it into their game and sync it with, you know, real time environmental data and that kind of stuff.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So, sounds really cool, and the game itself, I have no clue what it is.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But, I mean, that kind of, uh, you know, data that they have in there and, you know, the environments that they kind of were showing off some of the 3D models and stuff were actually pretty cool.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Okay, it's supposed to be a survival action RPG.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:29.000
So basically, like every single other, um, roguelike type game, it sounds like.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Hmm.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But basically letting you play in the entire world, almost.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm trying to think if we've seen these types of games before. I feel like we have. Like, the things that try to kind of mix in the reality and so forth.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Maybe not something on the scale that Loki's talking about, but...

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I don't think it's ever able to be particularly as up to date as they're trying to do with this.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Um, this blurb, uh, where was it?

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000
If it's snowing in Chicago, Reroll's virtual rendition of the Windy City will likewise be blanketed in fluffy white flakes.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Um, certainly nothing. It's one of two things. If we've ever seen this in the past, it's one of two things.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.000
One, it's never been up to date and it's never actually taking advantage of true conditions in a region of the world.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Yeah, they can get the weather report, oh, it's snowing right now, and add snow and maybe a thin layer.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It's either not truly as live, as close to live as this will be, or it won't be a game.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It'll just be, hey, look at these characters dancing in a particular area that you can point your phone at and use the camera.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Um, this sounds interesting. I wonder why it can't scale because it costs a hell of a lot of money to get those drones in the air and get the data off of them like this.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And so they will have to fall back to generated conditions based off weather reports.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Um, give it a look as more information becomes available.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. There's really no comments on this article that Loki's talking about, but they are talking about the baby.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Act F says, plugging the baby, there's your next mobile game hit.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And Seattle wants to know, does the baby use standard USB or micro?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I said Thunderbolt. It's faster.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I was down in Cupertino for a work event at Apple, of course.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And we went to the Apple company store and all of the adult shirts were normal.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Just Apple logo in the middle.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But all of like the onesies and whatnot had cute little words that had cute little sentences inscriptions on them.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And the one that I remember, if I remember the wording correctly was, um, I'm, I'm like, I'm, I'm a Mac mini or I'm Mac compatible and a bunch of silly little stuff like that.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So the fact that they're making these jokes just kind of amuses me because I literally saw it a week ago.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:00.000
According to Loki's Twitter, he is on the hunt for the next big mobile hit because if the flappy bird guy can do it, Loki can do it, right?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Yeah, I should be able to. I mean, literally it looks like it takes 10 minutes to kind of make something like that.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated, but it's not that hard.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And I mean, even if you give fraction of that, like a 10th of what the guy's making, anything's better than nothing.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
All right, Loki. Well, we look forward to seeing what zany game you come up with. You have a whole OLR dream game list to start with. All right.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That's too big. That's too big concept. We need to think stupider.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
All right. Well, plugging the baby. There's a free one for Mac Devs. All right.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Just don't do shake the baby because Apple bans that stuff because it gets banned.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
All right. Going to our next story here is a story about Nintendo.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And it's some more comments from Iwata who's been doing a lot of talking lately since a lot of people are questioning if Nintendo is going to be profitable in the future.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:06.000
But anyway, some interesting comments from Satoru Iwata this week saying that the next already talk about the next cycle of what the next console and the next DS are going to look like.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Quote, Last year, Nintendo reorganizes R&D divisions and integrated the handheld device and home console development teams into one division under Mr. Takeda.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Also, as technological advances took place at such a dramatic rate and we were forced to choose the best technologies for video games under cost restriction,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
each time we developed a new platform, we always ended up developing a system that was completely different from its predecessor.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
The only exception was when we went from the GameCube to the Wii.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:38.000
In this perspective, while we're only going to be able to start this with the next system, it will become important for us to accurately take advantage of what we have done with the Wii U architecture.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It, of course, does not mean we are going to use exactly the same architecture as the Wii U, but we're going to create a system that can absorb the Wii U architecture adequately.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:54.000
When this happens, home consoles and handheld devices will no longer be completely different and they will become like brothers in a family of systems.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Now, why this quote is gaining some traction this week is think back to last week when we had that crazy rumor about that whole fusion thing, which talked about something.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So these these I mean, granted, you can read a person's comments 10 different ways, and especially if you are trying to look to make it fit in the puzzle a certain way, you can do it.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:22.000
But it's just an interesting statement in light of the fusion idea that came up as a rumor last week or the week before.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't find this particularly surprising at all, and the one and only reason for that is the Wii U gamepad.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It's finally, I say finally despite its limited nature, but it is a portable device for use with a fair amount of functions of the Wii U anywhere in your house.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It's limited to that. You can't, you can't take the gamepad away from the console, what, 300 feet and still be able to do it.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I actually don't know what the range is of that thing.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:05.000
But the fact that they're doing this middle ground where you have something that you can pick up and walk away from your TV with and that they'll take that and their portable knowledge and their console knowledge.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
This isn't that much of a surprise.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Well, and it's also worth noting that the technology in the pocket is getting closer and closer to what's available on the TV.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Like I when I played Bravely Default, I was like, oh, wow, there's like full voice acting in this game.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I didn't realize they crammed all that on carts now.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Are you kidding me? These, these things that, these things that line the table are even better than the 3DS already.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
That's been the case for like four years.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Well, no, no, and no, it was really, it was really one of those things where I was like, oh, yeah, duh, of course technology is there.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
They can fit gigabytes in those cartridges.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And if you think about it, Rob, that really isn't the first game that did that.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
But I just, it's been so long since I've really sat down with a 3DS game and most of the Nintendo games don't use voice acting.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So when I kind of was hearing all that, I was like, oh, wow, yeah, they can fit all that in the cartridge now.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So it's just interesting.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The fact that I can have 128 gigs in something that amounts to the size of my fingernail, that's, you know, that's even more capacity than a Blu-ray disc, a double layer for crying out loud.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Now, one other comment from Iwata this week that also is, you know, getting some notice is because it has to do with third parties, which is Nintendo's weak area right now, especially in the US.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
But, you know, Iwata had something to say about it.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And it goes like this, quote, finally, in terms of third party support, while many point out that Nintendo has traditionally been weak in terms of acquiring it, if you consider the Japanese market, it's fair to say that the number one dedicated video game system that Japanese third party publishers are focusing on is Nintendo 3DS.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So he sidesteps the Wii U and says, but we do have third party people with DS and talks about, you know, the 3DS has sold 10 million and so on.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Okay, so no real surprise there.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
The 3DS has the support, but he continues.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
As for Wii U, opinions significantly differ among third party publishers.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families, are still very active supporters of Wii U.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
I'm assuming that's a Sega compliment, but anyway.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And their enthusiasm for Wii U can also be seen from the fact that they have even reached out to us to help people upgrade from Wii to Wii U.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
On the other hand, software publishers are not necessarily keen on making games and genres that have weaker affinity with audiences that Nintendo has not been as strong with.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Where making a huge investment does not guarantee a sufficient return.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
With regard to Wii U, we first need to create a strong foundation in areas Nintendo excels at and achieve a sufficient sales volume.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:39.000
If we manage to do so, those publishers in the overseas market who are currently not interested in Wii U will be attracted to the Wii U platform as they were to Nintendo 3DS.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
This is going to be our approach in the near future.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
There's those words again.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Software publishers that develop content that has great affinity with audiences that Nintendo has historically been strong with, namely children and families.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Right. And the big budget shooter games don't do as well in Nintendo.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And that's the other half of the statement there is that they don't want to spend all the money to develop for our platform because we don't have those people.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
It's literally every argument that we make ever summed up by Iwata himself.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It's refreshing at the same time to actually see this.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
You made the argument about Nintendo's online communities need to be stronger.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Yes, I agree, but it's never going to happen because children and family.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I was going to say the only reason that they don't have those people on the platform is because they don't have those types of games.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:38.000
So you can't expect someone that's a fan of first person shooters that's going to buy a platform that doesn't have the type of games that they're looking for.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I would love to see Nintendo do something absolutely batshit crazy and make that game.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And thus begins Nintendo's chicken and the egg again. Somebody needs to take the first step and it's a huge investment.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It's a huge risk, but imagine if Nintendo put out Mario Killers on the Wii U, which is a first person shooter starring Mario and Luigi.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I can see more of Mario Paintball or something like that, but do it Call of Duty style.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No, that's not the game we need. Mario Paintball is too family friendly. I need blood, guts, gore, and all that stuff.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Obviously I'm being a little silly. Nintendo's not going to make that game. Loki's absolutely right. If they make that game, it's going to be Mario Paintball.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Pikachu fainted.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Exactly. Alright, anyhow, let's go back to a much simpler time. We could talk this topic to death, but let's go back to a much simpler time.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000
What do you mean? It's not like we've done that four times in the last month.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I don't want to talk Nintendo anymore. Is that so wrong? There's so much else going on in News this Week.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Alright, let's travel back to a different time. Let's talk about classics for a minute.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Perhaps Nintendo Classic. Perhaps not. Either way, Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you know, maybe you should consider playing this game.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I already told you what it was. You did? I did. By the way, just real quick before you do this, Seattle does have a good point.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Metroid first person shooter. There was that. And many people say those were like the best GameCube games too.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And F-Zero as well. Alright, I promise no more Nintendo. I'm sorry, Dark Soccer.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So the game is Myst, which is a graphic adventure puzzle video game that came out by Cyan, as I said in my last story that I read.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Deja vu. I feel like we've talked about this game already at some point.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
You know what, Rob? What?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It was originally released for Mac OS on September 24th, 1993, and has been ported and reported and ported some more and remade.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:01.000
We've had releases on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation 3DO, Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CDi, Amiga, OS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
So you play as The Stranger, who uses a book to travel to the island of Myst.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And then you find other books, and you basically just follow the clues and beat the game.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It was really kind of a weird game, and it's actually really neat of a game. Yes.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:34.000
So basically, it is a first-person wander, and although you click a location on the screen, and it drags you there, or it pulls you around, or certain things happen on the screen.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000
And then it had a zip feature. Do you remember the zip?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:49.000
What it's saying is that it's an option. Basically, when a lightning bolt cursor appears, you can click and skip frames to another location.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
So it lets you travel quickly, but you miss important items and clues.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Basically, imagine playing Mass Effect 3 in story mode, where you skip all the fighting scenes and you miss stuff.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Which is also something I can't do.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Okay.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Continue.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Okay.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:20.000
So you have to basically search the island, find the linking books to the ages, and each of them are their own little mini-worlds.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
They're named Solenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And you basically have to work on these little puzzles through each one, and solve the game.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000
So it started development in 1991, and as I said, it came out on Mac OS.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So people who say there aren't games on Mac, shut up. It came out on this first.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And basically, their whole point is that they wanted to have a very detailed environment, but with a basic terrain itself.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.000
The textures were painted onto color maps, and so it was the point that they were using the textures to add the depth.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Of course, now, actually, when it originally came out, it was on the Mac Quadras. Who remembers those?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.000
They were modeled and rendered in Stratovision 3D, and also used Macromodel.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And editing was done in Photoshop 1.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Ooh.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Wow.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Photoshop 1.0.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.000
The original version was constructed in HyperCard. Each age was a HyperCard stack.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So the game itself really, I think, took advantage of the technology at the time, and really, I think, pushed the envelope for something that came out in 1993.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
That was when anyone who was running Windows was still running 3.1 on a 486.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
So that gives you an idea of what the tech of the day was like.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And of course, it has lots of really gorgeous music.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It had really ambient sounds in the background. It just was...

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And they were also improvising a lot of the sounds so that it would sound more like what you expected it to.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
For example, I like this example here.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:23.000
The noise of fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:31.000
The Chime Clock Tower were used, were simulated using a wrench and lowered in pitch.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Which to me basically is what they do in movies anyway. So I think it was hilarious.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:51.000
The soundtrack was available over mail-in and then Virgin Records got the rights to release the soundtrack which was released on April 21st, 1998 after Riven was out.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:02.000
It was basically just a really, really great game. It was very popular, which was, as far as I understand, a really surprise popularity.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
So it did have sequels. It had Riven. They came out on October 29th, 1997.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And then Myst III Exile came out on Mac and PC on May 7th, 2001 and was later ported to the PS2 and Xbox.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Exile, however, was not done by Cyan. It was done by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So the fourth one was Myst IV Revelation. It came out September 10th, 2004 and was entirely done by Ubisoft.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
With music done by Jack Wall and Peter Gabriel.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And then we had Myst V End of Ages that was done by Cyan Worlds and it came out on September 19th, 2005.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:47.000
There were also other games that Cyan developed. There was Uru Ages Beyond Myst that came out in 2003.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And you could customize your avatar and render the graphics in real time.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
However, the multiplayer component was cancelled.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:00.000
But GameTap brought it back as Myst Online Uru Live on February 15th, 2007.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
And it went through some changes and it actually was shut down after 60 days.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But it has been since brought back up and it's free to play.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:18.000
We had the different novels. There was the book of Atrus Myst, the book of Tiana, the book of Denis.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So all kinds of stuff happened.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And it's also stated that Matt Damon wanted the Bourne Conspiracy video game to be like Myst.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Instead of a shooter.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
So yeah, there were the remakes.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Now we had the Real Myst Masterpiece Edition that came out in 2000 that had the graphics actually rendered.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:51.000
And then there was the Interactive 3D Edition that was the remake for PC and for Mac.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And then it was a free roaming real time 3D game.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And then now we've got the enhanced version that's going to be running on Unity Engine and has the graphics from the original Myst.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And that came out on Steam on February 5th.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
We also have, like I said, different console remakes that I mentioned at the beginning of the show.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's been on various handhelds.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So yeah, this game has a super crazy legacy.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And that's Myst.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And don't forget about the parody, P.I.S.T.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
AkumaJP in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
This is the game that all guys my age wanted to play so badly.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Some even buy the Saturn just for this game.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
There were better games to get the Saturn for.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But here in this area, everybody just kind of had it on PC or Mac.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
So it was just interesting.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
DungeonBuster says,

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
This is still during the golden age of adventure games.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
LucasArts was still at the height of its powers back then along with Sierra and Legend.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So yeah, this is definitely some of the gaming.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
That was a great sentence, but what a downer.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Well, I kind of truncated another thought he had there just for time.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Because it is about that time for us to take a break.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Here it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Missed everybody.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But now it's break time.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
We're going to take a quick break.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
And we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Including your Fugu Question of the Week.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Some news on Batman Arkham Origins.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And some other games as well, Disney Infinity.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And your calls at 1877 Game O.L.R.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Live on this Sunday evening.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
February the 9th of 2014 with episode number 539 of our show.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Jason's here with us in studio.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And sadly we're celebrating, though that doesn't seem like the right word to use.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
His last night for now on the show.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Before he heads back over to Colorado and so forth.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
But you're still going to be able to do the YouTubes and all that stuff, right?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Absolutely.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
And hopefully more, well.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
You alright over there?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Wrong pipe temporarily.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Happens. Live radio.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Hopefully minutely more timely just because since I've been out here my nights and everything else are just taken up.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Mostly by social events because I actually have co-workers in the vicinity out here.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
And I say more timely but it's still going to be released on Saturday for reasons we've already covered previously.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But it would still be nice to have it done early in the week.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Schedule it for Saturday and then not be like,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Fuck it's 9 o'clock on Saturday night! I didn't finish this off! I didn't upload it! I need to get it out before Sunday!

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Or at least before the show. I don't need to keep procrastinating.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So, you know.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And once I'm at home and I have my stuff, I have my setup, I have my, you know, I have the things that I'm used to.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I can get back into the groove and be able to just do that.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
It's a great way to check out the show.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Especially, you know, like old, excuse me, now I'm getting hiccups.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Especially like older episodes and like things you might have missed.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Like I'm sure a lot of you missed the Super Bowl episode last week because you all were, you know, occupied with all that stuff.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So, you know, and you made a really hilarious intro and all this stuff.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
So you kind of do, even though, yes, 98% of it is just the show over a static picture.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
You do kind of do some fun little things with it.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Make it worth like, I would really envision like somebody wanting to go back and listen to older episodes.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Like listening on their TV or listening on their Vita.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
You know, because YouTube is like super accessible to get the file.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
You know, kind of like and be able to stream it.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
So that's the nice thing about it.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
It's really easy as opposed to like having to go download the podcast or having it up in your browser.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
So, yeah, I would really recommend like just, you know, bring it up on your TV, check it out.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I admire Jason's work, what he does do to the show.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I add all of the episodes to a playlist.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
There's an episodes of Orange Lounge Radio playlist.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.000
You can start from 528 and go forward with all ten of them so far.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Eleven after I finish the show off.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Chapter'd, you know, I have more things in store and things that I want to be able to do when I have more time.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.000
More than just the, I don't know, I probably take, I probably take about five hours to do a show.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Because it's literally listening to the entire show for timing's sake.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And then also I do things like Skype line callers.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I grab an icon if available.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
If we talk about, oh, that looks interesting.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Sorry podcast listeners, sorry live show listeners.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000
But, you know, with video I can show what we're talking about.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
So when we were talking about Prism Drop, when you guys were talking about Prism Drop last week.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I threw up the iPad screenshots when Jamie was first looking at it.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Oh, right.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Well, this is a game picture, okay.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And then you said, oh god, the phone pictures.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
So I take those and started throwing them on.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Okay, cool.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's expressive and it's really, really interesting.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
It takes, it's a solid chunk of time.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
It might even be more than five hours.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
It's at least three because I re-listen to the entirety of the show.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
We really appreciate it and although I know there's not a huge audience on YouTube.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The nice thing about it, and this is what I told you would probably happen.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It's been kind of a slow burn because it's discoverability.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And we see that people are accessing the older episodes because they find it through, you know, other things and check out the show.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
So it works out.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
It's fun. I'm enjoying it.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And more and more I want to do.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
It's teaching me things I've wanted to learn for a long time.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
It's getting my mind running with things that I want to be able to do differently and do better.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I've gotten a lot of really good suggestions for things that I would love to be able to do regularly.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Here's hoping for the better.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
And here's hoping for a better routine, better workflow, and all of the improvements that come with.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Alrighty, we are going to move on with some rapid fire news here.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Loki, hopefully Loki's back.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Yeah.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Hooray! And he can lead us through some rapid fire news.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Alright, so, you know, Humble Bundles had some pretty good deals lately.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And this, I guess, week or so, they've had the Sid Meier's Bundle, which includes everything from Civ III Complete, Civ IV Complete, Civ V if you pay enough money, and then Ace Patrol, Ace Patrol Pacific Skies, and Railroads.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And so I believe if you beat the average, you can get a Civ V and the Civ V Gods and Kings DLC.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And if you pay more than $15, you get everything plus the Civ V Brave New World DLC.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
So it's a pretty good deal.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I haven't bought it yet because my backlog.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Yeah. You know what though? If you have any remote interest in Civ V at all, you really got to check out this pack.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I mean, y'all know I love Civilization.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Just get it for at least Civ IV, which is a really good entry into the series too.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Civ III, eh, not so much, but Civ IV and Civ V are great.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Civ III is probably the weakest out of the entire Civ series.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And then there's like other stuff too.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:04.000
But the funny thing is, I was looking at the bundle and I'm like, wow, I own everything in this except for one game already.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:12.000
But yet I still feel the need to support it because charity and good things and, you know, you want to support that.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
So I think this is great.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I'm just worried of how much of a time sink Civ V is going to be.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Huge. Huge.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Just have it in your library for a very, very, very rainy day.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I have a lot of stuff for rainy days.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
The average in the screenshot was about five and a half bucks.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:40.000
And right now the average, which again gets you Civ V base and Civ V Gods and Kings DLC, is $9.14.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And it runs for the next week or so. It's eight days right now.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000
A lot of people are dropping the 15 to get that extra expansion, which, you know, is still worth it for all those games.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
That expansion's not that old.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
15 bucks with a good split for charity and developer, if you so desire, and that's a whole bunch of good stuff.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
So in other words, you're going to get two rounds in.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Yeah, right. Just one more turn. One more turn.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Anyway.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And then this is kind of cool. This was actually a Kickstarter game that definitely passed.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And it was a game called 90s Arcade Racer.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And it's based off of, like, you know, Daytona and Super GT and all those games.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
It's really bright and colorful.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000
And he says he has it running at 60 frames per second, 720p, for the Wii U.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000
And it's supposed to be out later this year.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Also coming out on Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS and Android later this year as well.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And it's being published this time by Nintendo.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
The guys do Cave Story.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Looks sweet.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I can't wait to see some actual gameplay, though, of it. Like, actual moving gameplay.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And then last but not least, Pinball Arcade are actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
And they're actually looking to develop some original tables for their pinball games,

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
as opposed to all the licensed pinball games.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Some original tables for their pinball games, as opposed to all the licensed stuff.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And they have a hell of a lot of licensed stuff, that's for sure.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
It'll be interesting to see what kind of tables they have.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I'd be more interested to see them adapt some of the custom-made tables,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.000
like the Bill Paxton table from Ben Hecker.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Actually, even his Ghostbusters one he did.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Or, not Ghostbusters, it's like some sort of ghost-haunting table or something. That'd be pretty cool.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I'm really bummed out they're having licensing issues with the Addams Family table,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
because I know they were going after that, and they're running into some licensing issues.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
It's just...

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Because it was based on a movie, so there's a lot of actors whose pictures are in it.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Eh, someday.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I like Pinball Arcade, though. It's a fun little way to play some pinball games you remember from years ago,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
when there's not a lot of tables around.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Of course, if you're Dark Soccer, you have your favorite tables already.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:16.000
It would be fucking amazing to develop a digital pinball table that was also holographic.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I thought, at first, when I saw that the Attack from Mars table was in Pinball Arcade,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I was like, oh, it's that hologram table's in there.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
No, it's the original Attack from Mars from way back when.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Oh, lame.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Yeah, lame.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
All right, anyway, moving on to some other Nintendo news.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Nintendo UK has noted that Dr. Mario is one of the games that's headed to the Wii U Virtual Console at some point.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
They don't say when exactly, but it's just slated for release.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
What's interesting, though, is that even though it's coming out in Europe,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
the product description says it's the US version of the game.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But I suppose in this day and age, a high definition, where we don't have the different TV specs anymore,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I don't think that's as big of an issue, but whatevs.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Dr. Mario, of course, this is an interesting choice because we just had Dr. Luigi not that long ago come out.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Maybe you forgot, but that was out at the end of last year.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I forgot to buy it.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I did.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
That reminds me, maybe I should.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Something else you can do on the Wii U, which, by the way, you can also actually do on the Xbox One,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
or you can do on the PlayStation 4, is you can play browser games, HTML5 games,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:27.000
lots of them available thanks to a site called Playboxie, which, yeah, I guess this is helping them out with a little bit of a free ad.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.000
But they do have some games you might remember, like Pac-Man and some newer games like Cut the Rope and Doodle Jump.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000
And they call it Chris Mines, but it's just frickin' Minesweeper.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
So a lot of clones, a lot of cloney games in there.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And you all say Flappy Bird's a ripoff.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Look at that, Chris. That's just frickin' Minesweeper right there.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Anyway, you can check that out with Playboxie.com.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:56.000
And, yeah, it works on all those systems thanks to HTML5.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I will also note that is Playboxie, P-L-A-Y-B-O-X-I-E.com.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Thank you. Yes, not the other type of box.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
What is the other one, porn?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.000
There's Boxie, that's double E, that was a Roku-like, it was a TV-attached box.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I own one of those.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Wow.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Yeah, Boxie with a Y, with a double E, there's a whole bunch of them.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Playboxie.com.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
It's funny that we can only just now do that with console browsers.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I mean, the Xbox 360 didn't even have one.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
The PS3's was terrible.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Nice to see that finally exists this time around.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
And lastly but not leastly, earlier in the show,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
it was brought up that I'm gonna be really excited about all the costume changes

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
But I have to admit, my eyes did roll a little bit in the back of my head

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
where I could see my brain a little bit

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
when I saw the commercial for the Lara Croft costume

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
coming to Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Do you wanna see what this looks like, Dark Soccer?

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Have you not seen this?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
There's actually like a little preview video out there.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Well, here's the important question.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
What?

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Have I bothered?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Let me show you.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Because I didn't even finish the first one.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
You took yours back, remember?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Well, you just need to watch the little retrospective that's out there, too.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Okay, that's actually kinda cute.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Yeah, it's a little...

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the game.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Yeah, it's a little weird,

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
like the way she's like carrying the pickaxe and everything.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Like, her shield even has Tomb Raider written on it,

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
which is kinda funny.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
But...

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And then, of course, you can be in that outfit

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
for all the different cut scenes.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
So there you go.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I wanna see the DLC costume for Hitman,

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
where she's bald.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
But can she swan dive off a cliffside?

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
It is interesting seeing that whole little synergy within Square Enix,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
where they have all those different costumes,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
but I was just like, okay, whatever.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I just literally had that ready, whatever.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Or since, you know, Square Enix also happens to publish Deep Silver titles,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
we could have her holding a dildo bat.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Let's pray, let's pray.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Here's the thing.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Love Tomb Raider.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I'm excited about Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I wanna check it out.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I like the demo, but it's just kinda like the world's colliding.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I'm just like, no, they can be separate things that I enjoy.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Separately, separately, and not together for an extra cost.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I don't really need that.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I want the N7 armor.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
That was in 13, too, yes.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I know.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I need to actually play that.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
I need to play...

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Finish the first one,

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
because someone took it back before I was done with it.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
You make it sound like I...

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Sorry, I took my game back.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I'm such an asshole for wanting my borrowed copy of something back

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
so I could play it.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I was just giving you a hard time.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Mm-hmm.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Mm-hmm.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Especially since I can buy it for three bucks now.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
That's true.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
They were all really cheap on PlayStation recently.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Anyway, what do you have for us, DarkStalker and RapidFireNews?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I have a few things.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Actually, this one's very happy news about Strider.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
It's supposed to be on PS4 and PS3 on February 18th,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
and you know we're getting that one.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
But it's also coming out on Steam, and that makes me super happy.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
And it came out courtesy of Double Helix.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And also, there's going to be two challenge modes

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
in addition to the main story.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
There's Beacon Run that's the sort of hack and slash speed run,

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
and Survival that sends you harder and harder waves of enemies to beat.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And they both have leaderboards.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
So super excited.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I love Strider.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And then, you know, my husband,

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
for people who have been on the internet for a long time,

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
used to run Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Just saying.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
That was my damn.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:51.000
So now Assassin's Creed 4 has a Freedom Cry DLC

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
that's supposed to be standalone.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
However, it is not on Xbox.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
It's going to be released.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I mean, is your mic off? They're having a hard time.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
No, my mic isn't off.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Phew.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So basically, Freedom Cry is going to be released as a standalone.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:18.000
So you basically play as Edward Kenway's first mate, Adawale, I guess.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I don't know. I didn't play the game.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
But it's supposed to come out on February 18th in North America

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
and February 19th in Europe and worldwide on the 25th for PC.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Those 18th releases, by the way, are for PS4 and PS3.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And Valve.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Oh, Valve.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000
There was a lawsuit going on with a law firm, Osborne Clark,

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.000
regarding a German court case for Valve not allowing Steam accounts

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.000
to be transferred or the ability to sell used games via Steam.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I refuse to use pre-owned. They're used.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Sorry.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:10.000
The German Consumer Advocacy Group, VZBV, sued and then in 2012,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.000
there was ruling from the European opinion

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
said that the doctrine of exhaustion was applied to digitally distributed computer software.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000
They tried again and basically they lost.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.000
The German courts were like, dude, no.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
So yeah, they were shut down.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So Valve wins. Yay, Valve.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Well, depending on where your thoughts are with the issue,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
you may not necessarily be saying yay, Valve.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
I like the idea of being able to have to use games digitally,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000
but it would encourage me to buy more games digitally.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I think we've had this discussion before.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Where's the incentive to go to digital distribution?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
If the games are cheaper, then that's the incentive.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Hence why most of us are using Steam are those insane sales.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
That's why most of us use Steam, not everybody.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
But that's why a lot of people kind of get sucked into it

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
is because they're giving away a game for free or it's like $0.39.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
That's digital distribution.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.000
But asking me to pay $60 for something where I don't get that tangible everything,

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I don't really do that.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
It would be nice if those games I bought digital had a little equity.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That would be some incentive.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Tell me how many collector's editions of MMOs you've purchased digitally.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Oh, digitally? Collector's editions? Probably zero.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I bought 14 collector's editions.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Oh, no, because I didn't even buy Mists of Pandaria.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
I refused to get the collector's edition. I thought it was dumb.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I got the collector's edition, but I also managed to price match it fries.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
But I was like, tangible? There's my Final Fantasy XIV over there behind the Hello Kitty bag.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
But think about it in that way. There are people who are willing to buy collector's editions

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
who don't want to have to go to the store and get it.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
These people are also antisocial, and I know this for sure.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
No, I'm kidding.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
No, no, no, no, no.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.000
All right. If that's it for rapid fire news, then let's get to the Google Question of the Week.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
And every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000
You slam those words together, you get FOOGLE.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Well, not a lot of mention yet tonight of Valentine's Day, but that is a holiday.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I use that term like holiday with my little quotey fingers.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
It ain't no bank holiday.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Yeah, I know, right? But it's a day that a lot of people do things on.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000
So I thought in the spirit of Valentine's Day, I would ask a very simple question for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000
And the question is, what video game do you think would make a really great game to play on a date?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I'm not going to be able to read all the answers tonight, but I'm going to read some of these, especially some of the shorter ones here.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I encourage you to read all of the answers on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
But for time, I'm only going to read a handful of them.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Unfolded Raptor says, Flower, nuff said.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000
That's a nice, that's a nice peaceful game. Would you want to play Flower on a date, Dark Sakura?

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Fuck no, we're going to play Virtual On.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Nice. Fucking nice.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
I've got twin sticks. Why the fuck not?

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Let's see. Ian, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, says, four swords or any Mario platformers.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I don't know, dude. That new Mario game can get people very competitive, just saying. You might want to watch out for that.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Let's see. Liam C. replied and said, Outlast, you could be that scared that you're in the other person's arms within minutes.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Sin, I hope I'm saying that name right. It's S-I-N-H. I think it's Sin T.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Says, my boyfriend and I have murder dates on Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 or Ghosts.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:00.000
He's in St. Louis and I'm in Philadelphia. So for Valentine's Day, we're doing one versus ones on the new maps.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Those that slay together, stay together.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Would you go on a murder date with Dan, Dark Sakura?

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I think most of them might already feel that way.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:16.000
You know, the murder dates usually happen after we've been playing fighting games together.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:24.000
For the Fallen Dreams replies, it says, Ilo Milo, which is a neat little puzzle-y game that's on PlayStation 3.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:30.000
You can control it one, but it can also be a co-op game. So that's working together for puzzles.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Let's see. Strudels89 says, I think any fighting games are a great date game.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
My husband and I played Tekken 2 at a movie arcade on our first date.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Tekken 2, Dark Sakura. That's right up your alley.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.000
When I worked at my job at the arcade, Tekken 3 had just come out.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
All right. Let's see. And Degenerate Johnny replied and said,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Normally I would say Mass Effect, but Garrus would probably charm my date away from me.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Therefore, I would have to say Saints Road the Third or Four.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Nothing says I'm interesting like a dildo bat to the face.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
It also gives my date something to look forward to in the sack.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Dildos?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
A slow clap for you, sir, for that answer.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Jason, can you remove your palm from your face for a minute there?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Let's see. Eddie K says, Considering I met my last girlfriend playing Left 4 Dead on Xbox Live, I'll go for that one.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:44.000
What? You actually had a success story where you made a positive friendship via Xbox Live?

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
It's not League of Legends.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Most of my interactions on Xbox Live are negative. Did you buy a lottery ticket after that?

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Keep in mind, Rob, how did Dan and I meet?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000
AOL.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000
That's still different, though. Even the AOL chat rooms of yesterday year weren't as toxic as Xbox Live.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I would disagree with that in a big way.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
You didn't hang out in the same chat rooms I did.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I had Prodigy. I guess we were just smarter.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I used CompuServe.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Every so often, we'd just get a flock of us and troll some of the dating rooms.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Oh, boy. All right. Moving on. Some other answers here.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Awesome Unicorn replies and says, I'd probably sit the guy down, turn on Catherine, put the controller in his hand, and glare at him until he was finished playing.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Kidding. Probably something cute and low stress like Kirby's epic yarn.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Those that troll together roll together?

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Lastly, Xenolith on Facebook says, I think depending on your partner, but any Mario multiplayer game.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Also, if your date likes to be scared, then survival horror it is.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Yay.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
See, that's what I miss Shane being around for.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000
When we'd get a group of people in the room and say, okay, Shane, play Silent Hill.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Silent Hill 2.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Friend date.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Yeah, friend date. Friend dates are the best dates, I think.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
All right. We have six answers on Google+. Did you know there's six people?

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
There's six people?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
All right.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Shout out to Google+. All right. Again, I can't read all of these because I don't want to be unfair.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I only read about half the Facebook answers, so I'll read about half of these.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Colin M says, Portal 2 co-op. It shouldn't take long to find out how compatible you are and how well you two work together.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And how well you can put up with frustrations with each other.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Wow.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
No, move. Portal. No, the other one. No, you just lost it.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Wow.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Damn it, we have to start over.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Colin's going all in on that date. Either this is going to work or it's not.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
This is the true trust test.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.000
This is the test right here. Let's see. Travis H says, LittleBigPlanet.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Although funny enough, me and my fiance met four years ago and put many hours into heavy rain and got a platinum.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.000
She's been a gamer with me ever since. Since actdeft gave me a haiku, I can't resist.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Co-op and story. Make for a great gaming date. Kirby Superstar.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And no one's surprised.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
That's a really good answer.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
That is a good answer.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
There was more to it too, but haiku.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Well done.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
If you're going to give me a haiku, I'm sorry. I'm going to ignore the rest of it.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Actdeft wins one internet.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
All right. Here you go. Complimentary internet.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
All right.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Read the last one.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Last one from Flaco Jones. And I like this answer because it kind of touches me here too.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
In a special place?

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Well, no, it's just my answer is almost the exact same thing.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
But Flaco Jones says, When my wife and I were first starting off dating over a long distance,

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
World of Warcraft was a great way to spend time together while still gaming.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000
MMOs are great for dating couples who can't always go out together.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And I co-signed that answer. Alan and I were long distance.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
You know, we were about 100 miles apart for the first year, year and a half of our relationship.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And we played WoW a lot. And it was the same thing.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
And now we still play MMOs. It's just we moved on to a different one.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
And we don't always play together. He likes to stay up late and do all the different fights.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Whereas I'm like, I maxed out on tomes for the week. I'm over it.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
I'm going to go play more Bravely Default.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
That might have been a conversation that happened this week.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000
But anyway, anything anybody wants to add to the speaking is super nerdy.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Alan and I met for the first time, saw each other.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
We knew each other online for years and years, kind of like you and Nan a little bit.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000
But we met for the very first time at a video games live concert.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Oh, shut up.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Katamari.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Katamari? Really? Why that?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Because it's incredibly cute, has really good music, has drop dead cymbal controls.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
And just fun and attractive.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000
I think I want to be really angry at Dan, so maybe we'll play the Saturn instead and do X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Loki, I'm dying to know. What's a great date game for you and Nellie?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Plug the Baby.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.000
She doesn't like games, so I guess, let's see.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Excite Truck.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Yeah, Excite Truck's pretty good.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
See, I was just going to say the guy game, but you know, because she doesn't like trivia.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Oh God, that's right.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I remember when you got the guy game, when it was on, like, you had it on PlayStation 2 or GameCube or something,

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
and Nellie was laughing harder than anybody at that game.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
It was PlayStation 2.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
BMX Triple X.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
That's a fun game.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Alright, that's good. I love that Mrs. Loki is probably more into the porn games than Loki is.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
But that's awesome. That's why she's great. Part of why she's great.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Alright.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I made it sound like that's the only reason. That's not the only reason.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news. Back over to Loki.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Oh, by the way, just real quick again, I didn't read all the answers.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Thank you to everybody who did take the time to answer.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Please support everybody and go check out the answers in full over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Okay, now back to Loki.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Alright, so the first tweaks to the Xbox One are going to be happening in March,

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
just before the launch of Titanfall.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Of course, you know, they want everything to be nice and perfect before that, you know, game comes out.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.000
So there's going to be some updates to the party and multiplayer options,

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000
including, I guess, some significant overhauls on that.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:32.000
They didn't really say some of the specifics, but it's supposed to be pretty good.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And then, of course, some of the things that I'm like, why weren't these in there in the first place?

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000
But I guess a battery life indicator, you know, something that's just, I don't know, on every single other system out there.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And then also an indicator of showing how much space apps are taking up.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Why was that not in there in the first place?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
That doesn't make any sense.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And also, I guess, you're going to be able to use a USB keyboard to, you know, type for chat

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:07.000
or I would assume on the internet and Internet Explorer and that kind of stuff.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000
So all features that were, I don't know, part of the last generation of systems

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
that they're now adding as new to next gen systems.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Can we say rushed?

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Well, I think we kind of knew that that was the case is that, you know, especially when Microsoft reversed all of their policies after E3

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:36.000
and kind of had to quickly, you know, make their new OS or whatever you want to call it,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
the back end software that runs on the system.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Hence why there was a day one update, right?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.000
So this isn't really a huge surprise that they've got to still do all these different enhancements.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
And PlayStation is in a similar spot.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging to Microsoft because PlayStation keeps enhancing things too.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.000
They just put out a patch not that long ago that enabled...

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.000
I just don't understand why they're being added in now like a battery life indicator

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:08.000
or, hey, let's see how much storage is on the hard drive, how much apps are taking up.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
That was something that was in the original Xbox.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
I know. And that's true. Those are things that were silly and overlooked.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
But to be fair, like PlayStation, they finally patched in the ability to mute your camera.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
That's kind of a big one too.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I've been sitting on this for a while and it has to be said because this was brought up.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Software development is not progressive like that.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Just because it was in a previous version does not mean it's automatically going to be there the next time.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000
The tools improve, the libraries improve, the features improve, the power improves.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
But just because something was there in the past does not mean it will be there in the future.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.000
But that would imply that all those guys at Microsoft who sat there and developed it,

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
not one of them said, you know, it would be nice to know how much battery life is left in this controller.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000
You know what they spent their time on? Big, huge, time-consuming, meaningful shit.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
A battery indicator is not meaningful?

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
No, they spent their time trying to shoehorn Windows 8 into fucking Xbox One is what they did.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
That's a whole other argument that I'm not going to disagree with.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
But a battery indicator is a resolvable process.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Oh fuck, my controller's not on and it won't turn back on.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Let me switch the batteries out or plug the controller in.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000
It's totally cool that I don't know how much space I have left in my hard drive that I can't swap out.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:26.000
If you have a space problem with a hard drive in the first two months, you're a special kind of person.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I'm not going to say anything at all about that.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
I totally didn't buy a 3TB hard drive just for that.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I get where you're going with that because you're basically saying Microsoft had to pick and choose their battles.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.000
They had to work fast, they had to pick and choose what absolutely has to be there.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
As does every development studio ever.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.000
But you would think that if their original plan was that it was going to be where you have to install everything in the first place,

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.000
that the indicator of how much space you have left in your hard drive would have been something that would have been kind of top of their list.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
You know what though? I can actually, believe it or not, I actually really get Jason's point where it's like,

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
you're not going to be able to fill it up in the first two months.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
So that's something that can roll out in the next quarter.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Unless you have seen.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I can see that huge project.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
I can see that huge Microsoft project plan with everything that they want to put in.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
And some of these are like, do we absolutely need this right now?

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:19.000
No, we don't need a space indicator because it's not humanly possible to fill the thing up the first couple months.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But that's not true though because even their updates were like several gigs in size.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
And the games themselves are like, you know, 50 gigabytes.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But that doesn't, but the whole disk is not copied to disk.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Forza was only 11 gigs installed, 12 gigs installed.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And yeah, we heard, I reported on the Dead Rising 3 being 10 gigs out the gate and 13 gigs for the compatibility plus DLC, whatever the fuck preload update that they had two months ago.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
But that's if you bought it physical, not digital.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Sure, absolutely.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Good point. That's a very legitimate point.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000
If you buy everything through the store, you will have greater space use than if you have disk.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:10.000
But people, I doubt, unless something went really wrong with the hard drive space and you lost space to disk errors because it was a DOA drive or what have you.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You were not going to fill up 500 in the first two months of the system.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf brings up this point saying, Loki, the indicator isn't necessary because they're going to silently delete things you don't use to make room.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
You will never fill up your hard drive because it will automatically delete things you don't use.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
That's their excuse.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I think it's stupid myself, but that's their excuse.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
That's terrible.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:35.000
They'll delete, they delete old game DVR footage.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Not the porn, not the porn.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:42.000
They delete installed game data that you don't play.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
They delete apps that you downloaded that you didn't use.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:52.000
It's a fucking inconvenience and people are going to scream bloody murder when they have to redownload something or reinstall something.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000
But it's a recoverable problem.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Like I made the point with the controller.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Oh fuck, my controller's dead. Let me switch my batteries.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
And you stop caring.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:08.000
It's actually kind of funny that we say this because my controller was being kind of flaky a couple days ago.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And I wasn't sure if there was a battery indicator.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And I did hit the home button and think to myself, where the fuck is the indicator?

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
But I didn't care. You know what I did?

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I went and I grabbed my USB cable, I plugged it into the system and I was done.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Whatever.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Alright, well in the interest of time I'm going to move on to the next story.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Was there more for that?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Nope.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Okay, let me quickly move on to the next story which is about,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Oh, this is about a game that maybe many of you were playing and maybe your Xbox has already deleted it.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
But Batman Arkham Origins was one of the big titles at the end of last year.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And apparently the support page for the game is full of players who are complaining.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Because community manager Mercury wrote that Origins development team is going to focus on completing the story DLC instead of fixing the bugs that are breaking the game.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:10.000
So, the team is currently working hard on the upcoming story DLC and there are currently no plans for releasing another patch to address the issues that have been reported on the forums.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:18.000
If we do move forward with creating a new patch, it will try to address the progression blocking bugs for players, not the minor glitches that do not prevent one from continuing to play.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
The issues that are not progression blockers will unfortunately no longer be addressed.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Wow.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000
So again, there's that project plan and we have this much resources.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.000
This is going to make us money, this is going to shut people up, this is going to do nothing.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
And that's how it works, folks.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Resources are finite. Time is finite. Money is limited.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with it.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000
General sense, that's all I'm saying. There's a trade-off in everything.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Also of note, Warner Brothers Entertainment is going to adapt Batman Arkham, that whole series, which is now a trilogy.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
It should be an animated film and should be released later this year. That's according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Don't know what all the game will entail, but we do know the name is Batman, or excuse me, what the movie will entail from the games.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
But we do know the name of the movie is Batman Assault on Arkham.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:15.000
So they're not just like porting a game into a movie, but it's going to just basically be in the universe there.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:22.000
So, there you go. J. Olivia, who, sorry, Olivia, excuse me, I read that name too quick.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Olivia, who directed Justice League War is set to be the director of that film.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Mark Hamill will not be Joker, but Kevin Conroy will be Batman.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I imagine they're going to get, what's his name that does all the voice, Troy Baker.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Troy Baker, right, who does everything for video games. I imagine he's going to do it.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Could you imagine if EA stopped patching Battlefield 4 and focused on new content?

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I thought that's what they did.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
People still didn't shut up about it.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
That's what people still think.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Alright, moving on.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And Tigerclaw clarifies in the chat they are using the same voices from Origins in the movie, so that would imply new guy.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Dark Sakura.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I don't know how I feel about this.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
There's a lot of people on the internet saying that about this story.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Oh, they're not saying they don't know how they feel. They're making their feelings very well known.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
There's a lot of unhappy people.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Basically, there is going to be a starting over of the Sonic series.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:27.000
It was revealed by Sega in New York City on Thursday this past week.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Sonic Boom.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Which is the name of the new animated series debuting with the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games as a new franchise.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom. Sonic Boom.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000
It's supposed to be the modern Sonic.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
On top of that though, from what I understand, it's being completely US developed.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:59.000
So we don't have any original, or I would say the Japanese development behind it.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Who we've identified as the core Sonic team back in Japan.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
And the art style just looks completely wrong.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000
What is up with Knuckles looking roided out, please?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
This is just, no.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Sonic is wearing a scarf.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Why is Sonic wearing a scarf?

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Why not?

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Is he hipster Sonic now?

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Rama in chat says, you don't like Knuckles' new look? Go blame Cartoon Network.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Fine. I will blame Cartoon Network. I don't know.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000
At least he doesn't eat stuff with snot like a real echidna.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be completely blunt with this.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I have a huge sense of apathy about this.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000
I mean, really. I kinda look at this and I go, okay.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
My question is, are the games still gonna be good?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Because I don't really care. I never was into the cartoons or any of that stuff. I don't care.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
The litmus test for the new Sonic. Is it better than Sonic 06?

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Is it better than Sonic Unleashed?

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I should sure as fuck hope so. How can anything be worse than Sonic 06?

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
You'd be surprised.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Here's the thing. They said, I understand that they're making this exclusively for Nintendo.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
So is this what they're gonna try to sell systems with?

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Because the last Sonic game only sold about 600,000 units overall.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Well, go back to Awata's comment about where the install bases are.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Obviously this whole Sonic reboot on Cartoon Network is kinda geared towards kids and people that would gravitate towards Wii U.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
I mean, it's the reverse of what y'all were saying about first person shooters.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:43.000
The whole point is you wanna gravitate people that don't already have a Wii U to the Wii U.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Not kids that would probably already have a 3DS or Wii U.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Well, not that many kids have a Wii U or we wouldn't be having this problem that we're having.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Well, certainly a lot more that can join the ranks.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Are you excited about Sonic Boom, Loki?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I've been different about it because I honestly am not a big Sonic fan at all.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
So, I mean, it wasn't as terrible as the cartoon.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Like, I watched the little trailer for the cartoon and it didn't seem bad. I mean, it looked alright.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Knuckles is too big.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Who cares?

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I do.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000
It doesn't matter.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I think my favorite comment that I read about this is that both Tails and Amy are crotch height to Knuckles.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Sonic's friends were all a little dumb anyway.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Like, I mean...

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Well, that was supposed to be his girlfriend. Well, Sonic's girlfriend anyway.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
His robbing the cradle girlfriend.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Uh...

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
She's 8. No, she's 13. No, they're all underage anyways.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
They're animals. It doesn't matter.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Oh, so it's a dog ears argument?

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Yes, they're all actually 70.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Dark Sakura, the final word on Sonic Boom?

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Can I give the last word to SSJ100, Matt?

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
You sure.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Breaking news! Knuckles A-Rod Akinda has been suspended from Smash Brothers because he tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
That's nice. That's nice. I like that.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
That's a good joke.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Can we get a Commander Guile cameo in there somewhere?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Sonic Boom!

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:18.000
That's it. We need Sonic Boom set to Guile's music.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I'm sure it's already been done.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Alright, let's go to Loki with another story.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
You know, with the whole...

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
What is it? The Oculus Rift stuff?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000
They're actually now developing games exclusively for the Oculus Rift.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And this includes now a brand new game called E-Valkyrie, which looks like a space shooter game and looks pretty awesome.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
And it's going to be exclusively on the Oculus Rift in...

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I don't know.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Cool.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Is this the first MMO that supports Oculus Rift?

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I don't know.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Well, I think other MMOs, like Define Support, because I know they've got drivers for other MMOs, but like...

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:17.000
First party and designed for depth and not just bolted on with the existing engine.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
I believe so, although Bobby will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:25.000
But I believe so, although I think somebody else had said they were exploring it.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I want to say EverQuest with the giant question mark, the landmark and all that.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
That would make sense.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:37.000
But, yeah, the thing is though, I think you can play things like World of Warcraft and stuff in the Rift with drivers and all that, but...

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
You can play Metroid Prime with the Rift!

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:47.000
You can't read the text, because the way the development kits are right now, the resolution's not quite there.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
And even if it was there, it would still be really hard to read.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:56.000
So a game that they're going to do that could be MMO based or whatever is going to have to be designed with the Rift in mind.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:02.000
The text is going to have to be large and it probably shouldn't even really rely on that text experience to begin with.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Jamie's freaking out.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I just looked at something from one of the emails and oh my god.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Oh my god.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Don't get ahead of us.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I'm not.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Don't get ahead of yourself.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Black Wolf is saying too, it's not an MMO, this game, it's a Wing Commander clone in the Eve universe.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Oh.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
So it's like a side story type thing.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I seem to recall CCP Games tried something like this with the Playstation 3 arcade and that whole, like the dust or whatever, was sort of like a side game that wasn't an MMO, but it influenced the MMO, if you will.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:49.000
This is going to make a good precursor to Star Citizen because as one of the stretch goals, Star Citizen intends to include Oculus Rift support, whatever form that takes in the year as soon as that game is actually going to be out.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Which is going to be amazing because Star Citizen, oh god, that game looks so good.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I need to overhaul my joystick, flight stick setup arrangements.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:05.000
I'm very curious to see when the Oculus is a little more readily available commercially, when it's like finished and stuff.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I'm really curious to see how...

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Well, actually readily available commercially to be completely honest.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Right.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Dan mentioned he might want one.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Yeah, I'm very curious to see kind of where that goes.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.000
It would be pretty cool.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
I mean, I love the technology.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:23.000
I'm just very curious to see like, okay, what happens now when this isn't just like a niche dev thing now and it really starts to, you know, get out there commercially.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
It's going to be very interesting.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Alright, one more story and then we're going to go to the email bag.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
But until then, my turn.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:42.000
There was a game that I crossed paths with on Twitter that I thought was really interesting and would love to talk about for a minute.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
The game is not out. It is previewed.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:52.000
If you go to Necrodancer.com, you can see the teaser trailer that I believe is really the extent of their media that's out so far.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:59.000
It will be available this year on all computer platforms, PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Necrodancer, Curse of the Necro, Crypt, sorry, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike slash dungeon crawler that adds in rhythm elements.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:18.000
So whether that means for attacking or moving with bonuses, that remains to be seen.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
So it's a roguelike, it's a dungeon crawler, and it's a rhythm game.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:29.000
So if it was also an MMO, it would be my perfect game, right?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Somebody's trying to target the Rob market.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000
And if you could sing to the rhythm, it would be SingStar Abba Rogue.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:40.000
SingStar Rogue Abba Rogue Abba Rogue...

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Anyways...

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Yeah, you know I'm back on the show and I even take the words out of Rob's mouth.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Pretty standard affair game, simple graphics, but one of the kickers is that because it is rhythm oriented,

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:01.000
you have the ability of putting your own library, your own music library to use to influence...

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:07.000
I don't think it's randomly generated, but it is the movement structure of the game.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:13.000
So not only can you put your own library to use, but you can also use a DDR pad to play it.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:18.000
So not only did they take this concept, but they actually ran with it, they actually implemented it,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000
they actually know a way that, well, you can put an accessory that may not be getting enough love anymore to use.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:29.000
So dust off them DDR pads if they still work.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:36.000
It is available for pre-order now, $13... $14 pre-order in $15 when it releases.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Like I said, gonna be on Steam.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I already bought it, I got the soundtrack, I'm so looking forward to it.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I'm curious.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Watch the trailer, throw the trailer up.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Alright, I will look at this right now.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
This is from Necrodancer.com, let's take a little look-see.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
That's just an awesome name.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
They told me I was too young.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
They told me I needed more training.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
She looks like Link, but with a shovel.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I told them to drop dead.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
How ironic.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
She just dropped dead.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I don't know how I survived that fall.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
You know Lara Croft had a worse day.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Heck yes, cheesy techno music.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000
But my pulse is beating like a drum, but my blood is running cold.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.000
I'm not sure what's going on, but I came here with a question.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
And I'm gonna find the answer if it kills me.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Can I dance?

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Yes.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I swear I played a game like this on Ouya.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Yes, Ouya.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
It wasn't this same 8-bit graphic-y thing.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
It had more Ouya-style graphics.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
But it was something like you would move around and hit the buttons and attack to the beat.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I swear at Ouya's E3 booth I played something like that.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I'm a sucker for this stuff, I completely admit it.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
It looks so much fun.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Alright, I'll check it out.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I also have to dust off an old dance pad, so I fully intend to play it that way.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Quick, cash in. Just add 8-bit graphics.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Yay!

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Worked for Flappy Bird.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Alright.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Too soon, Rob. Too soon.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Rest in peace, Flappy. I miss you.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:25.000
No, I don't. I don't miss you.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
No, you keep hitting that pipe.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Well, Bobby did have episode 420 tonight.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Alright.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Alright, let's get to the email bag.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Although, we are going to change that email very soon.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Yes.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:52.000
So you can still email us, but this is probably about the last week you're going to be able to send us this email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
We will give you the new email address soon.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Yes, I have plans.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Alright, well maybe I have plans. Maybe Jason has plans.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I have planners.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
You know what? Read an email.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I'm a planist.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Are you a planist?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Planist Hollywood. No.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
So, that was stupid.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Wow.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.000
So, um, wow, um, Robert M. sent me an email.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
My recent mailings have been way too long. So, Duffy Bus.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
And it says Dark Soccer isn't off tonight, I hope.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
So, I had to look up Duffy Bus.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.000
And, oh my God, it's a furry bus that's all Duffy.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:34.000
And it has Duffy's face on the front and the seats have Duffy on them and there's Duffy.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
So much Duffy. Oh my fucking God.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.000
If you don't know Duffy, it's Disney's form of a Build-A-Bear.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
No, no, no, it's not like a Build-A-Bear.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000
It's, um, Dan calls it Focus Group Bear.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So, I am copying this and posting it in the chatroom right now so everyone can see the glory.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I want this in my life. This has to be in my life, Hob.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I want it for reasons.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Fair enough.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
So, um...

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Thank you for making her squee, Robert M.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Maybe we squee way too early. Okay, we got another long one from RossdellU2.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Alright, well, you know, we've talked about his emails before.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000
He brings up sometimes uncomfortable but necessary points.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I know. I'm reading it.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Greetings, guys. Your discussion about the Wii U is perhaps a bit weighted in Nintendo's favor.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Perhaps due to not having Loki on the show.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I thought I'd inject...

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Oh, here we go.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Didn't I say earlier I don't want Nintendo Doc? I'm done. Alright, fine. Fine.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
A bit of the other side in this message.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I picked up the Wii U despite having been thoroughly turned off by the Wii in April of last year while we were still worried about the PS4 following, um, the DRM path.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:50.000
After catching up on the games I'd missed in the past month's Monster Hunter SMMBU et al.,

02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I found myself in the familiar Nintendo drought and came to realize why Nintendo home consoles will never be relevant to the core gaming market.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:06.000
While the Wii U went months without content of any sort, the PS3 and 360 were spoiled for games just everywhere.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
See, the issue with Nintendo is twofold.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000
They've saddled the system with a stupid hook that they've failed to explain to consumers,

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000
and since they're clearly focused on the 3DS, which I can't blame the company for,

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:24.000
there's just not going to be the attention needed to make Wii U games at a fast enough rate to be appealing to the people outside of the Nintendo Defense Force.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Already I've got just under half as many games for the PS4 as I do on the Wii U, and I expect my PS4 collection to blow past my Wii U collection pretty fast.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I'll admit that part of this is that I abhor the gamepad with the passion of a thousand burning suns, but more importantly the games just aren't there,

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:48.000
and the ones that do come are extremely conservative entries into their perennial franchises.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Put bluntly, Nintendo cannot support two consoles without third-party support, at least not as they are.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:00.000
And I have to go back to the chatroom because it times out on me. Sorry.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:08.000
God damn. Okay. I'm not going to say anything about this product. It's a very good product.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Where was I?

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Unless they're willing to back off the 3DS Forbidden Focus on-

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:22.000
No, for all their talk Nintendo knows exactly where its bread is buttered, and unless they're willing to back off on the 3DS Forbidden Focus on the Wii U,

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:31.000
it's going to be another 4-5 years of nothing but your Mario, Zelda, and Wii franchises, with the only breaks in sight being X and Bayonetta 2,

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000
neither of which have release dates in sight.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Put short, Nintendo's games are too few and far between to support a system without third-parties,

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:46.000
and that will down them to security in the home space until they start investing heavily in internal Wii U development.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Anyway, I look forward to the inevitable Nintendo defense that Rob will mount.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Seriously guys, have a good one and have a great week.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Regards, RossdielUT, who is apparently disgusting for being a brony.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:03.000
P.S. Shane and Exifer were painful to listen to. I'm not going to say anything about that.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.000
You know what, I love Exifer and I love Shane, so they were awesome.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Um, different strokes for different folks.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000
I apparently have a high-pitched voice.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Do you?

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I don't know, do I?

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
That's really good.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I don't know what to say to that email, I mean to be honest it's kind of the same shtick I'm hearing about Nintendo.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:39.000
I'm going to be honest, although, and please don't take this as disrespectful, I just feel like what he's saying is nothing I haven't heard like a hundred times already.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Yeah.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Maybe that's why it didn't come up on the show that Loki wasn't here, it's just kind of like it's the same.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
But they were good points.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000
It's fine, but also some of them, some of them, I could apply to Xbox One.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Just saying, unnecessary gimmick we're all forced to buy, that's an Xbox One.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Drought of Games, Xbox One.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I'd second that for now.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Now I'm not here to sing the doom and gloom praises of Xbox One.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.000
But I just will say this, since you are expecting me to be the Nintendo defendant, I will say this much.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Yeah, Wii U is hurting. Wii U needs to attract third party people back.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Wii U does not have the online experience that can hold a candle to the other consoles.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Wii U is far from perfect.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
That's for sure.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:32.000
But, sure, Wii U only gets those one or two or three Nintendo games a year right now.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.000
But they are quality fucking games.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.000
It's a little bit of irony that we won't sing the doom and gloom at the Xbox division,

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:48.000
but there are large swaths of Microsoft, of which the Xbox One is related to by nature of the online services division,

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
that isn't making a whole bunch of money.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:55.000
And considering the loss that Microsoft takes on the console itself for so long,

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.000
that they have to recoup in, you know, licensing for purchases and all that kind of stuff, game publishing,

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:09.000
they make a hell of a lot of money, but they're not always above water in the strict division-specific financial sense.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Here's the thing, at the end of the day, I'm not delusional where I think the Wii U is gonna overtake the PlayStation 4 on the Xbox One at this point.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Fuck no, that's not happening.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:27.000
At this point, it is to try and minimalize the loss of money that they're getting on Wii U right now.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
And hopefully some quality games will bring that up and get people excited again.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:38.000
But honestly, at this point, I'm not dissatisfied with my purchase of the Wii U,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000
because how else would I have gotten to play as some of the great games that are on it?

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:50.000
But it's just kinda like, as far as its success everywhere, Wii-style large thing, it's just not gonna happen with this console.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Maybe the next time. You know what, the GameCube wasn't a big hit either,

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:59.000
but Nintendo didn't go under and have to make games for, you know, Apple and Android and all this.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:06.000
So, I just don't think, I don't think Nintendo's going bankrupt tomorrow or anything like that.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.000
It's not gonna happen.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Far from it, honestly.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
So anyway, how about we move forward?

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Hi, OLR, this is KZ Borat.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000
I just wanted to say I love the show, as I have for the last nine years.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Thanks for being long-term.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Holy crap.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Also, I wanted to inform you that there is a Wikipedia page that includes your show about a game.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000
The wiki page for Guitar Hero, Rock of the 80s, under the History tab,

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:40.000
it says that OLR was the only source to announce its release on a particular date, and that you guys were right.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Just thought it was interesting, and also I wanted to donate some microphones, mic stands, and some nice cables.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Please let me know if you'd be interested in that.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
I have a surplus and I'm always looking for a way to support the show.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Yeah, actually the mic stands especially would be pretty phenomenal.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.000
And you know what's funny? Somebody else was messaging me on Facebook about that too.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.000
And these mics we're using now were donated by the fantastic people over at PodCulture.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
You guys' generosity is amazing.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I want to ask you, dude, did you actually do this as a voice recording? Like voice-to-text?

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Oh, maybe.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Just because, I mean, you know I have an eye for grammar and stuff.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I can figure it out because the last thing listed is Boar Hot Out.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
And I guess that's supposed to be Boar At.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:31.000
But that's the same type of stuff that, you know, the stuff that goes in is like usual.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I'd really like to know. Actually, that sounds like you're using a fairly decent voice-to-text program.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
I'd really like to know what you're using.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.000
And I will just say quickly, yes, I actually did know about the Wikipedia thing.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Because Orange Dance Radio used to have an article on Wikipedia some time ago.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
We should, someone remake our thing.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Well, it was taken down because it didn't establish nobility or whatever and didn't have enough outside resources or whatever.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:58.000
But I'm just, I don't know. It's kind of one of those things where I don't want to sound like,

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
You know, we deserve a Wikipedia page.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
But we did.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000
History.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.000
We are the longest running weekly podcast about games.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Okay. Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar Hero 1980s Edition.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an Activision announcement.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
And no other source has cited this announcement.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Activision officially revealed the first details of the game May 11, 2007.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.000
In addition to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock the 80s.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
I just, I remember that. Loki figured that out.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Loki had like a presentation at his work or something.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
And that's why it wasn't out, because it wasn't a media thing.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.000
It was an internal. Right, Loki? Do you remember that?

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Vaguely.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.000
I'm almost positive it was a distribution announcement, not a media announcement.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And that's why we had it before.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Yeah, I say a lot of things before they come out, but no one ever knows this.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Of all games to get noticed for, Loki, Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I want to quickly on Wikipedia, just because I, you know, yes, I like to see where this show is having an impact.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I think a lot of you would too.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
I think we're referenced on the Ultramix 4 article.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:17.000
And I think we're referenced on the beautiful Katamari article, which will not go there.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.000
But that should come as no surprise if you've been listening to OLR for nine years.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.000
That's all I'll say.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:26.000
I would actually really like for our Wikipedia page to come back.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s, beautiful Katamari, Dance Sense Revolution Ultramix 4, and Podcast Awards.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.000
That's right. Sorry, I was just laughing, because it's like, oh, hey, yeah.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000
A whole breakdown of all of the nominations and winners per category and everything.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Yeah, and a ton of those shows have pages. How come we don't get a page? We're not notable enough.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:53.000
2005. This is actually a really nice table. Quick overview, since we're running over it.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Podcast Awards, 2005 until 2013 in the gaming category. These are the winners, naturally.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.000
As of 2005, going forward. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.000
You can just stop there. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm such an asshole.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.000
How about the last email?

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Go ahead and let Jason have his moment.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Orange Lounge Radio, pause.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
It's his last show for a while.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Jason's stopping you in your face.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I didn't realize I was interrupting. Sorry.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Gaming, 2005, and each successive name will be a year forward.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio, Podtacular, Cagcast, The Instance, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, 4-Player Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast, Rooster Teeth Podcast.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
You know what's interesting, though, about all that? All of those shows still going. Every single one of them.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Is Podtacular still going?

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Except us. We're gone.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.000
We are out of here. Bye, bitches. No, I'm just kidding.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Also interesting.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
That's really cool.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Orange Lounge Radio in that list is linked, but it's red, meaning there's no source article that it's linked to.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
It was probably linked to when we actually had our article.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Sure. It's obviously been around for a couple years.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.000
In 2005, we...

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Okay, that's all.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Get to work, someone.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Raginator says we're referenced in Namco Museum Essentials on PSN, too.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Well, I know we are in the game.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
You mentioned that, but I didn't realize that.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
If we're in the wiki, I had no idea.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
I did a full text search in Wikipedia.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
We've also got the President Cat thing.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
That wasn't a wiki either, was it?

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
No, but they're talking about source elsewhere.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Black Wolf says Podtacular is off.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Oh, I thought they were still doing Halo stuff.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
All right. Well, sorry to hear.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Then I forget what I said. Sorry.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Bring back the wiki.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Hi, OLR. I just really wanted to respond to Sky's so-called fan wink about Sega being potentially acquired slash emerged by Nintendo or Sony or Microsoft.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Big reason this won't happen, Sega just recently took over Index Corporation, which Atlus is a big part of, and Atlus makes Shin Megami Tensei.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:52.000
If Sega were acquired by any of the big three, then Shin Megami Tensei and Persona fandoms would go nuclear.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Probably some of Sega's fans, too.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:02.000
More recently, Sega reported increased revenues for PC and digital games, so they're not going to go console exclusive anytime soon.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.000
I know it's a, I know it's wank, but we've got to wake up with a sore neck every once in a while, too.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
The nasty canasta.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:15.000
P.S. Why isn't hashtag press X to VX JasonXV trending on VOG?

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
That's a good question.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
The world may never know.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Oh, boy.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Because I haven't heard this.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:28.000
There's a, there's a coworker of mine that lives in the East, and every time she comes into town for events,

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I look forward to one very specific, wonderful reference that she's usually the first one to make,

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.000
and then everybody else that gets the joke joins in, so, you know.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:46.000
So, to totally derail the show right now, because I love doing that, and I just saw on Facebook, someone linked to an article saying,

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Pepsi is reintroducing limited edition Crystal Pepsi.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000
What?

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Nope, nope, nope, stop, put the brakes on, satire website, go to the About Us page.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Wall Street Sentinel, sorry.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Wildfire, because people, people don't think it's, I know, I was like, but then I was like, wait a minute, I have never heard of this site.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:08.000
This is not coming from CNN, or, you know, something that you've heard of, it's coming from, yeah.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.000
But in good news, there is a fundraiser for Clearly Canadian to bring that back.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:19.000
There's a, there's a fucking, there's a gaming press website that does that, and it's not clear that they're a satire site,

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:25.000
and people share their shit all the time, and you know they're over there cackling, that people keep sharing their shit like it's fact.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:32.000
I can't, something like, I don't even want to say the name, because I hate it when I see those articles on Facebook, people think they're true,

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:38.000
but it's something like, I actually, I just thought of the name of it, I'm not going to say it.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000
This actually doesn't sound any bit familiar, so, if you're interested, watch Twitter for a couple days.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.000
It's P something something, I'll say.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Alright, moving on, that was it for Mailbag, right?

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Yes it was.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Then you should email us, this is your last, literally your last chance to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
This is your last chance to email us.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
To email that address.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Alright, more information on that coming next week.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Here we go to the, that email address will still be good though through at least the next show, because we know some people are behind,

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.000
we're not going to just shutter the mailbag right away, and we'll put an announcement out on Facebook and Twitter.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:17.000
And at the very least we can set up a redirect.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Eh, no, no, trust me.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Alright, alright.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I have means.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Every week we get angsty.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Why?

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Because that's what we do.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
FU to having to get up at six in the morning.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:52.000
However, this will be the last week for a while that I'll have to do it.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:57.000
So next Saturday, I'm sorry next Sunday, I will be on my late schedule.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
I like sleep, I like sleep a lot.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:14.000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have so much to do before this weekend, and in the rainy weather all I really want to do is just sit and play Bravely Default all day,

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:19.000
but I can't because I have so much to do, like, I just, I'm gonna die.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
I might not be here next week because I might be dead.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.000
So I just want to say, not allowed.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
I really appreciate all of your support over the years.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
And thanks, and peace out.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Alright.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Next up, Loki.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:46.000
As I go along with what DarkSucker said, yeah, FU having to wake up at midnight, two in the morning, four in the morning, six in the morning.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
That pays only last several years, don't worry.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Hashtag baby problem.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Jason.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:06.000
It's funny, I was gonna say, I'm happy, I don't have FUs, but no, I'm gonna third, basically fourth what everybody else has said.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:09.000
I got woken up three times over the course of the morning this morning.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:13.000
One, time zone conflict, and just the fact that I like sleeping in.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:18.000
I got woken up a lot today, and it kind of pissed me off, but whatever, I'm here, I managed, whatever.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Yeah, sleep is wonderful, FU'd everything that prevents it in any way, shape, or form.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, Loki.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Alright, so Steam, you know, trying to be a little bit more legit with their Steam OS, is launching yet another beta.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:53.000
This is Steam Music, and it's gonna be a limited beta, it basically allows you to stream music into your games from stuff that you have on your PC.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:05.000
And just some more features that they're adding in there, probably, I'm guessing at some point, gonna start doing other apps, like Netflix and that kind of stuff.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:11.000
But, it's neat to see how Steam OS is kind of evolving into an actual operating system.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:23.000
How long until you can run Netflix through Steam? Cause that's when it's truly, truly its own system.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Not sure, but they're saying that they're, well this is gonna go on through, I guess, mid-January, or I guess they announced this at mid-January that they're gonna be doing some more beta tests for different things.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:51.000
And, not sure when the final Steam OS is supposed to be coming out, or if it'll ever be final, because, you know, a lot of these companies like keeping things in beta forever.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:58.000
So I guess we'll have to find out, but I'm assuming later this year, cause I know some of the Steam boxes were due out, I think, later this year.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Alright, it's weird though that this music service is only like your local file, which, you know, is fine, that's like what Playstation 3 and stuff do too, but it's interesting they're not trying to push their own little streaming music service thing.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Well, well, that's because Steam has been just integrated into an OS, and now they actually have a way to actually play music.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:29.000
That's a prerequisite to being able to sell you stuff, at least on their own OS that has to have some kind of facility for doing that.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Just saying.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Alright, fair enough. I do have one more story for you guys, but I forgot to set up the Skype line.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Jason, would you be so kind, not to put you on the spot, but would you do the next story?

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Sorry, Jason.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I hope I actually... Go figure, it's the one that I didn't pay too much attention to, so let's see how well we can win this.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Live radio, it's super fun. Just fake it, that's what I do.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.000
See, the irony here is that I should have just shut my mouth, I should have just...

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:05.000
We can take calls! 1-8-7-7-Game-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLunchRadio, and I would have like looked at Rob, I think we're missing the prerequisite.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:11.000
That's alright, young padawan, you're still learning, you've been doing this for a few months, we've been doing it for twelve years, you'll learn to fake it like me someday.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Sometimes I do feel like that.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:23.000
So this article, I'm just gonna apologize right now, this is literally one article that I did not read at all in this list.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.000
Disney Infinity sequel could feature Marvel and Star Wars characters.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Disney Interactive Studios may be planning the sequel to the hit title Disney Infinity, which could feature a Marvel superhero and Star Wars characters.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:44.000
According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, which is the biggest credible source for all of the gaming news, they get it right with media, I don't know why I'm being snarky about that.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Disney has posted a job listing for a games tester at Avalanche Software, which is giving weight to the sequel, and it is also listing requirements for familiarity with the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Wii U, obviously the whole swath.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:16.000
There has been no official confirmation from Disney Interactive, the leaks are coming just as the corporation is due to post their quarterly financial results, and will be laying off several hundred people according to said results.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Yeah, I actually asked them that very question, whether they were gonna do Star Wars characters.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:28.000
It was even before that launch when we had like a conference call with them, and they said it was something they were working on, so.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:45.000
I mean, why not? With all of these franchises under their wing, and the ramp up that they're trying to do, why would you not put these properties in something, like, like, like, granted it wasn't a Nintendo title, but um, uh, frickin' Kingdom Hearts?

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Why, with the success that that has truly brought, why would you not rely on all of your properties to bring them together and make something far better than we've seen so far?

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Yeah, absolutely, they're going to. I mean, they've made a ton of money off of it, so I'm interested to see if they do a sequel to the game this year. I think they are, because they're almost out of DLC, well, not DLC, but characters.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:16.000
They're almost out of characters, I think April is when they finally run out through all the stuff that they had planned.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Well, I'm sure E3 will show us a lot this year.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Yeah, just a couple months away.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Alright, I know there's going to be a sequel. Good job. Alright, let's go ahead, and now we will open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Uh, if you'd like to give us a call, and we can talk about whatever you'd like to talk about from tonight's topics, or maybe there's something we missed, I don't know.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:48.000
But, uh, oh, the phone is already ringing, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:49.000
It's Shane.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Hey, Shane, what's up?

02:58:50.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Nothing much. First of all, I'm glad that I was able to get you to love Bravely Default. I am, like, 10 hours into it, almost 11.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Congratulations.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:07.000
It's so good. Um, secondly, that raw Steel UT guy, kind of a douche.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Why do you say that?

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:19.000
I don't know, because me and Extfer had a good time, and then I told Extfer what he started to say about us, because I think Jamie censored it, and we both think it's hilarious.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Well, it's-

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:24.000
I hope, I hope somebody finds him in an apartment with a needle in his arm.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Stop it! That is not- don't say that. Oh my god, I'm gonna have to write an apology email. That's your opinion, not mine.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Mhm. Um, and then also, I wanted to answer the frugal question of the week, because it's topical for me this coming weekend.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Oh.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:41.000
So, we-

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Details, please.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:57.000
We, through some, what is the word, compromise, uh, we are going to be playing Slender Man, Slender Man The Arrival, and Amnesia this weekend, for our date stuff. So I think that's gonna be awesome.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
So, why horror video games?

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:09.000
Because, just talking about them gets him really scared. So, that's fantastic. If I can just say the word Slender Man, and he freaks out.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:13.000
It's because it's an excuse to cuddle when you get really scared, huh?

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
Or to laugh really hard.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Both valid.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000
I thought you guys were gonna play Final Fantasy 14.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.000
One day, maybe.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Maybe. Fair enough.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Between all the sex.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:33.000
I can't believe you just said that.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:37.000
Well, checking on the video is hilarious.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.000
This week and last, we learned the difference between Shane's filter and Rob's filter.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Is he listening?

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:43.000
No.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Oh, okay. Well, we'll be sure to send him a copy of the recording.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Um, um, well, how-

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Which recording are you talking about, Rob?

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
How was your trip back, by the way?

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
It was to where? To Kansas?

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Yeah.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Full of snow. Snow out of nowhere. Like, my street I live on still hasn't been plowed. It is not fun to drive on.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Well, that's what you get for living in Kansas. California misses you. Come back.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.000
All right. Goodbye. I guess I'll leave right now.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000
All right. Start walking. Bye.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Bye.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
All right. There's, uh, Shane, everybody.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:21.000
The views and opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Lounge Radio-

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Why do you have to go and say that?

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:26.000
All right. 1877 Game O-L-R.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:33.000
Uh, we got time for about one or two other quick calls here.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Uh, I did see some other people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get at least one of them here on the air.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:43.000
But there is a little bit of a delay between when I give the information and when people actually hear it.

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Uh, I should actually pull up Twitter real quick, because I know we had a couple of, uh, Twitter topics.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
I actually queued up a bunch of topics.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.000
All right. Let me, um, I hate Skype on the iPad, by the way.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Just, just so you know, I really hate Skype on the iPad.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
But there we go. Oh, hey, it's another video call. Woohoo!

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
What's up? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Hey, it's Dave. I called in last week. What's going on, guys?

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Hey, not much. How you doing, Dave?

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Good, good. And I now see what you guys mean when you're talking about those hand mics.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
There you go. Right? Now you got a visual to it.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:19.000
Yeah, exactly. Now we can see what Dave looks like. What's up?

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
Not much. How you doing?

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Pretty good. Pretty good. How about you guys?

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Good. What's on your mind, buddy?

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Uh, well, today's actually just kind of a random call.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Uh, I got a late birthday present from a friend of mine, so I've got 20 bucks to blow on Steam.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000
And I wanted to know from you guys what you would blow $20 on right now.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.000
Typing of the Dead.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
Uh, Rogue Legacy.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:42.000
FTL.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Well, are there things that I don't already own or things that you ought to own that you already have?

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Things I should own.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:50.000
That's what I thought. Um...

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.000
Drunken Robot Pornography.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Civ V. The entire collection is a lot of fun. I love Civ V.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Um, actually, there's also legitimately a part of me that's like, hold on to the money until the summer sale,

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
because you could probably get like four times the games.

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.000
But that's a long time to wait. It's a very long time to wait.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Um, are you pulling up your Steam collection right now?

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:17.000
No, I was actually queuing Twitter topics, but it will be interesting to see if Steam also does a spring sale.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Or if that was just the fact that what's winter in America, it would be spring in the Eastern Hemisphere.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:24.000
Guacamelee.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:25.000
Whatever.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:28.000
Guacamelee is a game I've been spending an awful lot of time on lately.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
What kind of games do you like?

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Um, I mean, I've been searching for probably the last eight months for a good RPG.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.000
And Skyrim just didn't do it for me.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:45.000
They've got Baldur's Gate 2 on there, but I'm like, cool, I played that when I was 15.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:50.000
So, are you more like into the Final Fantasy type RPGs?

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.000
Ish. Ish. I actually just picked up my brother's Bravely Default pre-order today.

03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:00.000
I was just gonna say, go return your Steam card and put the money towards Bravely Default.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:05.000
See, maybe I'm alone on this one. I had no idea that the game was gonna be that big.

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:09.000
I walked into the GameStop and said like, hey, I'm here to pick up this pre-order.

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:14.000
And all of the employees in the store kind of collectively just went, oh, thanks.

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Now people can stop calling us about whether or not we have this game in stock.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000
Because this is literally the last copy in the region.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
Oh my gosh.

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Yeah, it was intense.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
Wow, I didn't know it was gonna be that big of a deal either.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:30.000
Um, let's see, ActDeaf suggests get the Ys games.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:31.000
And yes, the, if you like...

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:32.000
Ys.

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
Ys? I always wanted the Ys. E-A-S-E.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:35.000
Ys.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
Alright, well, um...

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Trust me.

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:41.000
Whatever it is, I think that's a pretty fun series.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
Although, I don't know, the attacking is a little weird.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000
It takes some getting used to.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
That's more like a Zelda-esque kind of game.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Yeah, bump, bump, bump.

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.000
This is kind of how it works.

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:49.000
You kind of collide.

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Pump them until they're dead.

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:55.000
Let's see, I'm trying to think of like a straight up JRPG style game.

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:58.000
I was gonna say, if you're not necessarily so much JRPG,

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.000
but you're interested in more action RPG, then Borderlands.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
Ooh, that's a really good one.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
If you can be okay with the first person shooter element,

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Borderlands is actually not a bad choice at all.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:08.000
It's a very good meld of the two.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
The entire Mass Effect series.

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:11.000
Good call.

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Raginator reminds that Final Fantasy VII is a good RPG on Steam,

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.000
so if you miss the classic somehow, Final Fantasy VII and VIII are there.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:19.000
I don't know why.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:20.000
I didn't think about that.

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:21.000
That's still in my queue to be able to play.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:22.000
Right? Exactly.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
I just thought the same thing.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:25.000
You can skip VIII, though.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.000
Um, Alan...

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:29.000
Hey, they fixed the crap from the third desk.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:30.000
...shaded every chance I can.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
Alan Alcomb used to just Hotline Miami.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
That's not an RPG, but that's a really good game.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
You can shoot a lot of people and dogs.

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
So, alright.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
I think we've given you about 25 suggestions.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
You have. You've given me plenty of suggestions.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:43.000
And that's...

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:48.000
And the very last thing is, so I'm still waiting with microphones,

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:51.000
trying to figure out how to get you guys set up.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Well, it sounds like you might...

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
Which we're very lucky to be in that position.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
We had our emailer earlier who also was...

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:00.000
So maybe like we get one guy to get the stands and one...

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
Because Dave was talking to messages about maybe like a USB

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
that could pick us all up or something, so...

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
And some people to make a down payment on a new house for me

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:07.000
so we can build a studio in the backyard.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Yeah, right.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:09.000
I'm gonna be...

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
We're trying to switch studios next month.

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000
It may or may not happen at this point, but we'll see.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:17.000
It'll be a good chance for us to really think about some of that stuff, so...

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:18.000
I really appreciate it.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:19.000
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:20.000
So, we'll be in touch.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:21.000
But thanks for listening.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:26.000
Also, Dave, sorry not sorry about my voice, how it sounds in your car.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:29.000
No, see, I love his voice.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
His voice is just so deep and it's so booming.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.000
Isn't it?

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:33.000
That's why he's the announcer.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
That's why I got fired.

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Alright, well, I might be out in LA at the end of the month for a photography project of mine.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
We are nowhere near LA.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
Ah, well, I'll be in the same state.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Alright, close.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:45.000
But we like Disneyland.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:46.000
We do love Disneyland.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:47.000
We give that recommendation.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:51.000
And I would say this, we want to know, follow up with us what you bought on Steam and what you thought of it.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Will do.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.000
Alright.

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:54.000
Thanks, guys.

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Take care, buddy.

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.000
You too, bye.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Alright, bye.

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.000
Alright, can we squeeze in...

03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Oops.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:00.000
That's what I get for not muting it.

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:01.000
We need one more squeeze in one more car.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Okay, bye.

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.000
I know you gotta go soon.

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:04.000
I do need to go.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:05.000
Alright.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:08.000
Because it's already past a quarter after and I need to be in bed in 40 minutes.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:09.000
That's fine.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:10.000
I understand.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:13.000
Dar Sakura, before you take off, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Fuck 6 a.m.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.000
No, I'm kidding.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
I'm grateful to have a job.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:21.000
I love my job working at Lokat.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Cool job, Lokat.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:23.000
Cool job, Lokat.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
You're not kidding about 6 a.m., though.

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.000
No.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Fuck 6 a.m.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:28.000
No, but you know what?

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
It's good because I'll start my regular schedule next week.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:32.000
This is our...

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.000
We call it nesting.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:37.000
So I'm going to be learning a whole lot and I'm looking forward to getting a start on

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:38.000
my career.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:39.000
So she won't be cutting out early every time.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
This is like the last time for a little bit.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:42.000
For a little bit.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
And hopefully I'll be able to keep on with late schedules.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:45.000
Alright.

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Sounds good.

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:47.000
Alright.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Alright.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Bye.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:50.000
Bye.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:51.000
Drive safe.

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
Alright, I just saw somebody calling in but Dar Sakura was talking and I didn't want to

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:54.000
cut her off with a call.

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:55.000
So try again.

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:59.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:02.000
San Fran Boy on Twitter, username SFRedHead.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Oh, are you on top of the tweets for me?

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:05.000
Thank you.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Sends us an image from a Tumblr post.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:11.000
WalkingMyHellHound says, if I've learned anything from video games, it is that when you meet

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:14.000
enemies, it means that you're going in the right direction.

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:18.000
And the re-blogs and quotes and everything talk about, wow, that's incredibly profound.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:19.000
It was.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:20.000
It was a good quote.

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Alright, we do have that call coming in.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:23.000
So let me get to it.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:24.000
This will be our last call tonight.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:26.000
Who's this?

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:27.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:28.000
Hey, Akdeft.

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
Pretty good, pretty good.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:38.000
I wanted to talk about something, you know, you're already tired of it, but it's something

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:45.000
really curious that I saw today while out doing stuff.

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:53.000
I saw a copy of FIFA 14 for the Wii, the original Wii.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:54.000
Right.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:03.000
And I was thinking, didn't EA say that they didn't want to make the Wii U version because

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:08.000
they didn't have the resources and they didn't want to do it basically?

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:18.000
Meanwhile, here in Mexico, I can find FIFA 14 for every console, even old ones like the PS2.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:23.000
The PS2, the PlayStation 2 has a version of FIFA 14.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:24.000
I'm not kidding.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:28.000
I thought PlayStation 2 games were officially done with the, I thought the Final Fantasy

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
11 expansion was last time.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.000
Technically, yes, but all they did was just reskin the last year's, well I should say

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:38.000
by now it's probably like FIFA 12 and FIFA 11 that they're reskinning, but that's all

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:39.000
it is.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Same with the Wii version.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:45.000
In fact, they even have a call out now I think on the P, the Vita version.

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:51.000
It's like the Legacy Edition or something like that, which is basically just a reskin.

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:55.000
Yeah, so Loki is basically saying they just changed the 13 to a 14.

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:56.000
That's a fair point.

03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:00.000
Yeah, that's basically, sorry, that's basically what they did.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:08.000
They have, I took a picture of the box art and yeah, it has a label that says Legacy

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Edition or Elisiana Legado in Spanish.

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:19.000
But, it's something that struck me like curious because they didn't want to make the FIFA

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.000
14 version for the Wii U, but they did make the other ones.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Even though, and especially like Loki said, they just reskinned the previous versions

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:33.000
to a new one.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:34.000
Just a roster update.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Why didn't they do the same with FIFA 13 on the Wii U?

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:44.000
It's something that I'm seriously trying to understand, but I don't know.

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:47.000
Well technically they did that way I think with the Wii U version.

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:51.000
It was like a, it was a port of something else I think.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:55.000
EA is definitely doing the shots fired type of thing with the Wii U I think.

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:58.000
I just, I do a double take at the picture of your box art.

03:10:58.000 --> 03:10:59.000
I saw you link it in chat there.

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:02.000
When it says $799 I'm like, what?

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:05.000
Then I have to remember, oh wait, that's not our money.

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
That's a different country's money.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
Yeah, that's Tesla's.

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:12.000
It's just around $60 I think.

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:15.000
Yeah, Matt's in chat said $60, yeah.

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.000
It boils down to the fact that on systems that have already had a FIFA release, the

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
assets already exist, the engine already exists.

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:26.000
They may fix bugs, maybe, but they also might not.

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:30.000
They might just leave it to, you know, whatever's going to wind up happening.

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:38.000
It's trivial to change a game's text and get close enough body models and, you know,

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.000
put them in place of new talent that may look different.

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Just pick the right race and get the face close enough and whatever.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
It's detailed enough as it is already.

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
The Wii U is different from the Wii.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:55.000
It requires different work and it requires additional work to perform.

03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:00.000
That's, unfortunately, that's their justification and that's where this is coming from.

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:07.000
Yeah, I do understand that, but seriously, they're doing the, I still gather the Wii

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:15.000
is still selling some games or releasing on a minimal amount, but the PlayStation 2, seriously.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:20.000
They released FIFA 13 and now 14 for the PS2.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:24.000
It's the only game that's getting released on that console.

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:30.000
It's something that if they're going to put resources on something, why not the Wii U?

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
It's my question, basically.

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
There's still a lot of PS2s out.

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:37.000
There's more PS2s out in circulation than there is Wii U.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:40.000
So it's very true.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:41.000
That's true.

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:49.000
It is a strange call, but EA's clearly having a hissy fit with Nintendo, so it is what it is.

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:52.000
All right, Act Def, I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:53.000
Appreciate it.

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:54.000
Thanks for having me.

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:55.000
Of course.

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000
Anytime, buddy.

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:57.000
Take care.

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.000
All right.

03:12:58.000 --> 03:12:59.000
There we go.

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:00.000
Bye bye.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
And thank you very much to all those that called tonight.

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:03.000
I'm sorry if you didn't get through.

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:10.000
We are going to close up the Skype line for now, but try again next week or send us an

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:11.000
email.

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email as well.

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:17.000
Do we have other tweets?

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
The quick, quick, quick Twitter topics.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.000
Tigerclaw sent us into Sony Pictures Entertainment and is negotiating with Seth Gordon to direct

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:30.000
Uncharted, the movie all up in the air, of course, but obviously a lot of excitement

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
coming around for that.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:38.000
A protest game puts Russian President Vladimir Putin in gay-friendly Sochi Winter Olympics

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.000
competition.

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
I'm sure I don't need to go too much into the backstory of this.

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Russia had a big anti-gay...

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:48.000
I don't remember to what extent it was out in the media, but they had a big kerfuffle

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:49.000
months ago.

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:53.000
Flash forward to Sochi Olympics and it's kind of a big deal.

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:54.000
That's related to this.

03:13:54.000 --> 03:14:01.000
That's also why Google has their, for lack of a better term, pride doodle still in place.

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.000
I expect it probably will be throughout the entirety of the Olympics.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.000
If you actually go to Google.com or use any of the Google apps, you can see it right there

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:09.000
front and center.

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
It's very resounding.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
It's very good of them.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:20.000
And then I already read the Twitter, the Tumblr, rather, the Tumblr post.

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:25.000
One other thing that I really, really wanted to get out is that I read an op-ed this morning

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:31.000
on IndieGamerChick.com, written by an individual named Kathy, who's apparently been doing this

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
for about two and a half years.

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:36.000
And she basically, this article is called The Indie Ego.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:41.000
It's still the most recent one on the site, again, IndieGamerChick.com.

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:47.000
And she really breaks down the indie community, how things have been portrayed by the very

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:50.000
prominent and vocal members that people may know.

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Such hate naming names, but let's be completely honest.

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Team Meat, Jonathan Blow, Phil Fish, i.e.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:02.000
Indie Game the Movie, and a lot of other developers that you just see.

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:05.000
Notch, Magnus, Peterson, Peterson?

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
Crap, I forgot his last name.

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:08.000
Notch.

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:09.000
These...

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:10.000
Magnus Pearson.

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:11.000
Yeah, there you go.

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:12.000
Thank you.

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:20.000
She really, really takes the indie mentality, the good side and the bad side, and again,

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:27.000
this article named The Indie Ego, really breaks down why you should not be insular

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:32.000
and exclusive as an indie, because it does a really big disservice to you.

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:33.000
It's a great article.

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:34.000
Please go give it a read.

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000
It was incredibly well written.

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000
Kathy, well done.

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
It came across in a retweet on Twitter.

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:42.000
I sat down, I read the whole thing.

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
It was absolutely fantastic.

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:46.000
Alright.

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Is that it for Twitter topics?

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Not at all related to anything, but a couple of my coworkers have retweeted this thing,

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
San Francisco Emergency Scanner.

03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:00.000
San Francisco Police Department responding to reports of a homeless man operating a cherry

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:01.000
picker on the sidewalk.

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
In the rain and all of the weather that's frick-

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
He just, he needs some cherries.

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:11.000
I chuckled, and I was very sad at chuckling, and yeah, I just had to get that out there.

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for next week, but unfortunately

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
Jason will not be here to read it.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.000
Before we get to the end of the show here, and I go around and hear everybody's final

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.000
thought and so forth, I just really want to thank you, Jason, for all you've done for

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.000
Orange Launch Radio.

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:27.000
Absolutely.

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.000
I mean, God, I'm making it sound like you're leaving, which you are and you aren't.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:35.000
We all know that, but again, we would not have a website if not for Jason.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.000
We would not have the YouTube thing if not for Jason, and I know you guys have only really

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:44.000
heard him for the past three months, but there's a lot of soul to this show that is thanks

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:48.000
to Jason, so I just, I really, really thank you for your efforts to help make O-L-R what

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:49.000
it is.

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
It's been a good decade, and it's been even better last year.

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:52.000
All right.

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:53.000
Amazing.

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:54.000
You are welcome back anytime.

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:57.000
There's always a chair here for you, even though this studio might not be here.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:03.000
Wherever we are, you can just drive that cherry picker on over and have a seat at the table

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:04.000
with us.

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000
That's when I drove in here today.

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000
Because you won't fly, so you have to drive something.

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:09.000
All right.

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.000
In all seriousness, Jason, thank you, thank you for being here.

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:16.000
Anything you want to promote of your own self-worth or what have you before I get your final

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:17.000
thought and all that?

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.000
I'm on Twitter, and I tweet way too much random shit.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:21.000
Sometimes it's meaningful.

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:24.000
Once out of every, like, 100 maybe, twitter.com slash VX Jason XV.

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:26.000
Easy to find.

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.000
Say hi.

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:28.000
You know, whatever.

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:29.000
All right.

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:32.000
And you'll still be able to do calls and other things, so it's not the last of Jason.

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:33.000
I call.

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:36.000
I interject my opinion into the video from time to time.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:37.000
You'll be back in, like, a month.

03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:38.000
I'm back.

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:39.000
Oh, I got snowed in.

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:40.000
Sorry.

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:41.000
Can I be here for another episode?

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:42.000
Yeah.

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:43.000
Any time.

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:44.000
Any time.

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:45.000
It'll be funny.

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:46.000
It'll actually be hilarious at this point.

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:47.000
We give you this big fanfare goodbye, and then, like, in two weeks, you're back.

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:48.000
What's up, guys?

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:52.000
You come back before Loki's able to get back.

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:55.000
That would be some kind of irony.

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000
All right.

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000
Last final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:00.000
Keep warm.

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:01.000
Stay safe.

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:02.000
It's been a great three months.

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
I hope everybody else agrees, just in general.

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:05.000
Have fun.

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:06.000
Enjoy your games.

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:11.000
This is a good point for me to always say what I do every week, as much as I'm begging,

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:14.000
but for real, we don't ask for any money to do this show.

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.000
If you like Orange on the Radio, please help spread the word.

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:17.000
Help grow our family.

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:24.000
A nice review on iTunes or Stitcher goes a real long way, and we just really appreciate it.

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:28.000
I know we said a lot about reviews, but no, seriously, because of that culture we're in,

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:33.000
those help get the promotion and the exposure, and it goes a long way.

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:39.000
Yeah, it helps us stand out amongst all the other corporate-based shows that are out there

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:43.000
that have a lot of money and built-in hits to be able to fund that stuff.

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.000
Thank you very much.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:45.000
I appreciate it.

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:49.000
Thank you all for being here and listening and staying with the show all night.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
Loki, I haven't forgotten about you.

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:55.000
I can't wait for you to be back in studio, but again, take all the time you need with the new baby.

03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000
I'm glad to hear things are going well.

03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:00.000
Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:05.000
No, I'll try to be working a little bit more on the Minecraft server this week,

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.000
although we haven't had a lot of people commenting in threads and stuff, but I've been doing a lot of tweaks.

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:15.000
I haven't been on in a while, honestly, but I did finish my underground tunnel thing I was building,

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
so I've got to find another project to do.

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:24.000
Well, I'm working on, I may test out trying to do, was it Bucket Forge or whatever,

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:31.000
it was MCPC Plus or something, and that basically allows you to add Forge mods,

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:36.000
which are new graphics and stuff, so it's a little bit more complicated,

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:42.000
but you can have totally new mobs, totally new blocks, totally new things that aren't normally in there.

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:45.000
So it'll be interesting if I can get that to work.

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000
Well, come join us on the VOG Minecraft server.

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:50.000
All the details are at vognetwork.com in the forums.

03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:52.000
Some kind words for Jason as well.

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:55.000
I don't know if you saw that in chat, but act-def says,

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:59.000
Jason shall not be missed, considering he now does the intro voiceovers.

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:00.000
Oh yeah, I missed the most important part.

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:01.000
And the outro.

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:02.000
And the passphrase.

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000
Yeah, and the passphrase for the podcast folks.

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:08.000
Ray Genator says, VX JasonXV needs his own VOG show.

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:12.000
Well, I hope he will find something he's passionate about and send us a pitch.

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:14.000
Ideas. Ideas are a-brewin'.

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:16.000
Alright, cook them up. Let them simmer. Let's hear it.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:17.000
Let's hear it.

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:18.000
Alright.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.000
Loki, we'll see you next week, although it might be via Skype again, but have a good week, okay?

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:23.000
Yeah, you too.

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:29.000
Alright, and I guess my final thought is, again, I could be dead next week.

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:34.000
So, just, oh god, wouldn't that be sick if something really did happen?

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:35.000
No.

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:40.000
Here's the thing, I'm just, I am stressed like so much right now, but it'll be good.

03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:44.000
Things will be good, and then there's so much to look forward to this year.

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:51.000
There's a lot of great things in store, and yeah, I'm in a happy place, and I hope you guys are all in a happy place as well.

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:54.000
Thank you guys all for your support. It means so much.

03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000
We'll be back here to do it again next week.

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
Have a great night everybody. Bye.

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.000
