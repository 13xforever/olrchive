0	17480	This week, excitement in online gaming as Blizzard struggles to maintain World of Warcraft's
17480	20720	uptime after Draenor's release and another Sony Network cracking scare.
20720	23440	Even if they're down, we'll tell you about some interesting alternatives along with your
23440	30440	comments, calls, and emails right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
30440	33280	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
33280	36560	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36560	45760	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 576, November the 23rd of 2014,
45760	49840	joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the
49840	51080	gamer lifestyle.
51080	53760	Here in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.
53760	57600	Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
57600	59160	She is out tonight.
59160	64840	I believe it is her husband's birthday tomorrow, today, tomorrow today?
64840	69960	Somewhere around there, but the celebration is today, so she's out to go celebrate with
69960	74400	her man, so I hope she's having a good time, and happy birthday, Dan, whenever it happens
74400	75400	to be.
75400	77600	But here in studio, Techmaster Loki.
77600	78600	Hello.
78600	79600	Hi, Loki, how are you doing?
79600	80600	I'm doing okay.
81120	82640	Except for my dinner sucked.
82640	84120	Yeah, I heard about that.
84120	88600	You know, for those that are playing the home game, the ever popular listening to OLR, betting
88600	89600	pool.
89600	91200	What did Loki eat for dinner tonight game?
91200	92200	You went to Jack in the Box.
92200	93200	I went to Jack in the Box.
93200	95040	Which these coasters wouldn't think of right away.
95040	101040	Yeah, so I went to Jack in the Box, and they got a turkey bacon cheddar sandwich.
101040	102240	It is the season.
102240	106520	Which is fine, I mean, you know, because sandwiches have a, I normally get the bacon ultimate
106520	110520	cheeseburger, and I'm just, you know, after a while it gets, you know.
111440	112440	It's the same thing.
112440	113440	You have to shake it up a little bit.
113440	114440	Variety.
114440	115440	And their sandwich is nasty.
115440	119680	I don't know, they put some sort of sauce on it, it's just gross, so.
119680	120680	Was it like cranberry?
120680	121680	Because it's turkey?
121680	122680	It's not cranberry.
122680	126440	No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, it just tasted sour.
126440	131320	And seeing with the fries, the fries are good until that last fry, the very last fry I had
131320	132320	was just off.
132320	136960	It was just like something, and it's like this sour taste, I had like literally spit
136960	137960	it out of my mouth.
137960	139960	And now that is the fry that is representative of the whole.
140400	143760	The fry that's like stuck permeating in my mouth, like thanks, you know.
143760	147160	Every time you think about your horrible Jack in the Box night, you're going to remember
147160	148160	that fry.
148160	152840	Well, it was just like, you know, I had, left late because I was putting away laundry, and
152840	158240	they had the bleach to sink, and just annoying stuff, and so I got late, you know, I didn't
158240	161560	get to order a pizza or anything like that, and I was like, you know, driving, I'm like,
161560	165200	well I can stop here, well I might not be on time if I stop here, so.
165200	169640	I'm like, well it's either going to be McDonald's or Jack in the Box, I, McDonald's is kind
169640	178440	of meh at this time of day, so I'll do Jack in the Box, and yeah, I was just kind of like,
178440	182000	I guess I'll have that, and then it was just terrible.
182000	185840	I do want to talk about games of course, because this is a video game podcast, but quickly
185840	189700	I thought I'd ask you since you're on the topic of food, it is the week of the Thanksgiving
189700	191920	holiday here in the States.
191920	195800	Happy Thanksgiving to you out there, for those of you that are celebrating it this week.
195800	199360	If you aren't celebrating Thanksgiving this week, well enjoy in your country from the
199360	204000	comfort of your living room, watching the crazies in this country on Black Friday.
204000	208400	Enjoy watching everybody on television at the local Walmart fighting over a $5 crock
208400	213300	pot, you know, pulling out weaves, threatening people, somebody will get shot, some shopping
213300	214520	mall somewhere.
214520	216200	Have fun from the comfort of your home wherever you may be.
216200	217200	No, no, no, no.
217200	221440	No one will get shot, someone will get trampled to death, that's the new shot.
221440	225600	You know what, I'm going to stay home and play video games, that was the way Black Friday
225600	226600	was meant to be.
226600	234520	You'll stay home and you go on certain online, you know, purchasing websites to...
234520	238480	You make it sound shady, like am I going on XTube, where am I going?
238480	245440	You don't purchase anything on XTube, seriously, all the content there is lone.
245440	249760	That's Cyber Monday, Loki, get with your buzzword lingo.
249760	254360	But it's all the pre-Black Friday stuff.
254360	258520	Now it's pre-Black, oh that's right, what do they call it, Gray Thursday?
258520	259520	No, it's Thanksgiving.
259520	260520	It's Thanksgiving.
260520	261520	It's not Gray Thursday.
261520	262520	It's Thanksgiving.
262520	266200	It might happen to be gray outside, because we're having that kind of weather, but it's
266200	267200	Thanksgiving.
267200	268200	Gray Thursday.
268200	270640	I heard that term on the news the other day, and I'm like, it's fucking Thanksgiving.
270640	272360	They're dumb, they're just trying to be buzz-worthy.
272360	275400	I know, I know, and then they have a graphic to go with it.
275400	276400	Gray Thursday.
276400	281740	Alright, anyhow, hey, look, when we're feeling sad and gray, we always have this gal here
281740	283080	to cheer us up.
283080	286960	Joining us in studio tonight, welcome back to the show for the Multitap podcast.
286960	289760	Hey, hold on, hold on, I gotta, sorry, I gotta, I-
289760	293000	Way to wreck the intro, this better be good.
293000	295160	Ron must suggest he and I go to Subway.
295160	299200	No, now see, now I've been to Subway, and I even thought about that, but Subway also
299200	301720	tends to be pretty crappy this time of night.
301720	306480	Did you, did you literally interrupt the guest's introduction to talk about a fucking sandwich?
306480	307480	Did you?
307480	308480	Yes.
308480	310840	To be fair, Subway's horrible, I agree.
310840	312600	It's true.
312640	314480	Welcome to the show, Princess Irene.
314480	315480	Huddle.
315480	317520	How are you?
317520	318520	Would you like a sandwich?
318520	319520	Fuck no.
319520	322520	I already had one earlier.
322520	323520	How are you doing, Princess Irene?
323520	324520	I'm okay, I'm good.
324520	325520	Yeah?
325520	326520	How are you?
326520	328960	Good, thanks for jumping in to fill in tonight.
328960	329960	Sure.
329960	330960	How are things for you?
330960	331960	How's life been treating you lately?
331960	332960	It's exactly the same.
332960	333960	Exactly the same.
333960	334960	Yeah.
334960	337600	I would ask you, well, what, you know, usually I go, oh, well, what's new on the Multitap
337600	338600	podcast?
338600	341240	But like, you were just here like six weeks ago, so I mean, did you do anything in the
341240	343600	past six weeks that we all know about?
343600	347120	I think we released like a couple of episodes.
347120	348120	Go check them out.
348120	349120	Yeah.
349120	350120	Whoa.
350120	351120	Hey.
351120	352120	Where can folks hear the Multitap podcast?
352120	355960	Just briefly, for those new listeners who might have gotten the past couple of weeks,
355960	359720	where is the Multitap podcast and what can folks expect to hear on it?
359720	360720	Sure.
360720	364360	You can find it on FFOP.net.
364360	369880	That stands for Fistful of Potions, and that's kind of our umbrella place that we kind of
370880	371880	Sure, sure.
371880	372880	Yeah.
372880	373880	I'm sorry.
373880	377960	But I and I mean this with all complete respect, but I can't get out of my head that it's Fistful
377960	378960	of Poop.
378960	379960	Like a monkey.
379960	380960	Neither can I, Rob.
380960	381960	Fistful of Poop.
381960	382960	FFOP.
382960	383960	All right.
383960	385960	So that's a good way to remember it.
385960	386960	Yeah, I know.
386960	387960	Whatever works, right?
387960	388960	Right.
388960	389960	Right.
389960	390960	Right.
390960	394560	And you can probably expect to hear just a lot of crap.
394560	395560	Way to talk up your show.
395560	396560	I know.
396560	397560	Woo!
397560	398560	Fistful of Poop.
398560	399560	That's right.
400240	401240	To the boom.
401240	402240	Rimshot.
402240	403240	FFOP.
403240	404240	Right.
404240	405240	No, it's a fun show.
405240	407640	It's a bummer we couldn't get any of your co-hosts back tonight, but you're plenty.
407640	408640	Yeah.
408640	409640	Everyone's out of town.
409640	410640	Oh.
410640	411640	Well, that happens during Thanksgiving.
411640	412640	Go figure.
412640	413640	That's right.
413640	414640	Yeah.
414640	415640	Go figure.
415640	416640	Let's see.
416640	417720	What else do I want to ask you about?
417720	424560	This week was 20 November, which was another holiday of sorts for the DDR and music game
424560	425560	nerds.
425560	426940	I guess it's totally dead in my mind now.
426940	431500	The two day celebration of 19 November and 20 November happened this past week, which
431500	435660	if you don't know what that means, there was a song in the, I believe it was in the original
435660	436660	DDR.
436660	438960	No, I don't think it showed up until third mix.
438960	439960	You know where it was?
439960	440960	It was in Beatmania.
440960	442680	It was in Beatmania, the five key game.
442680	444660	There was a song called 20 November.
444660	449100	So that has kind of been adapted as the unofficial Bamani holiday.
449100	455060	So and you and I didn't necessarily meet playing DDR as I met a lot like that's how I met Loki.
455060	456480	It's how I met Dark Sakura.
456480	460600	You and I knew each other before that, thanks to Rocky Horror and other things.
460600	466320	But Bamani was a huge part of your life as well as mine.
466320	471800	How did you kind of get into music games way back in the day and what did that do for you?
471800	472800	Me?
472800	473800	Yeah.
473800	477700	Well, I think the first time we played DDR was when we went to Las Vegas.
477700	481440	We went to like a Rocky con or something like that and we just saw it and you're like, oh,
481440	482440	this looks really cool.
482440	483440	And I'm like, that's stupid.
484400	485400	I don't want to dance in front of people.
485400	486400	I'm like, dumb.
486400	490920	And then you played it and I think I played a game, but then I just, I kept following
490920	494640	you to places like arcades and stuff and you kept playing DDR and I was like, oh, I'll
494640	495640	play it too.
495640	496640	And it was really fun.
496640	497640	Yeah, it was.
497640	498640	It was the music.
498640	499640	Right.
499640	500640	It's all about the music.
500640	502520	I don't remember the second part of your question.
502520	508620	Oh, what are some memorable experiences you got out of the whole thing from being a part
508620	512280	of the Bamani community for a few years?
512320	515200	I guess I got like friends and stuff from it.
515200	517600	That was pretty cool.
517600	518600	Right on.
518600	521600	Is that how you met Fafop?
521600	522600	Not even remotely.
522600	523600	I met Fafop.
523600	526600	I met them through school.
526600	527600	Gotcha.
527600	528600	Yeah.
528600	531680	I will remember a favorite memory that involved you.
531680	536600	And that was, we went to a tournament in Los Angeles, you and me, it was called the cyber
536600	538280	beat nation tournament.
539280	542600	This tournament was at Koreatown was what was like little Korea.
542600	545560	And I don't remember the name of the place, but this is a really big tournament.
545560	548260	This is one of the biggest tournaments they probably had.
548260	551240	And there was a lot of freestyle and there was perfect attack.
551240	555520	And pretty much throughout the entire weekend in the back of the arcade, there was Irene
555520	563740	and I in a tiny little booth singing karaoke for hours and hours and hours.
563740	567280	We played the fuck out of that machine.
567280	572880	This was before karaoke revolution or rock band or any of that shit.
572880	576840	There was this little thing, and the thing about it was not only could you sit there
576840	582000	and sing the songs, which there was a lot of American songs in there, even though some
582000	586960	of them had been translation, translation back again, like Google translate one way
586960	587960	in the back again.
587960	591720	There was a lot of Japanese songs and Korean songs and things in it too.
591720	595320	So we would go through the catalog and when you would sing the songs, you got scored at
595320	596320	the end.
596360	598560	And the whole thing became about like getting a high score.
598560	605120	And I remember I got a 100 on some song and then you did a song and got like a 21.
605120	608160	I'm pretty sure it was the lower score, the better.
608160	609760	I seem to distinctly recall.
609760	610760	It was like golf.
610760	611760	It was like golf.
611760	612760	Yes, exactly.
612760	613760	Yeah, I was on par.
613760	614760	Yeah.
614760	615760	So there you go.
615760	619260	There's a memory involving Irene for you guys was going to a DDR tournament to play karaoke
619260	620260	all weekend.
620260	621260	Right.
621260	624520	Like you guys don't even know we were in that booth the entire weekend.
624760	626760	I don't even know who won the damn tournament.
626760	627760	I really don't.
627760	628760	Yeah.
628760	629760	I don't think we gave a shot.
629760	630760	Like really.
630760	634040	And I think when people would come close to the booth to try to play the game, we would
634040	636120	like bark at them or something like, fuck off.
636120	637120	This is our game.
637120	638360	This is our territory.
638360	641480	You know what is really too bad about that whole thing too.
641480	642640	And I guess I can talk about this now.
642640	645380	It's been years and years, but they never did the sequel.
645380	649400	And they actually had asked me to MC the second tournament if they did one.
649400	650880	And I was always like, fuck yeah, I'll do it.
650880	651880	Yeah.
651880	652880	That sounds really exciting.
652880	653880	It's a huge tournament.
654240	656800	They didn't have the opportunity for OLR, which was still blooming at the time and everything,
656800	658240	but they didn't end up having the tournament.
658240	659240	And I don't remember why.
659240	660240	I don't know.
660240	663240	I don't think the arcade went under or anything, but it's just, they didn't get the interest
663240	664240	or something happened.
664240	665420	They couldn't financially pull it off.
665420	666960	So that was always too bad.
666960	671520	And you, I mean, I think the prize that you wanted that one was a DDR machine, right?
671520	672520	I think so.
672520	675120	And how do you fucking top that?
675120	676400	It's kind of downhill from there.
676400	678400	It was like a solo 2000 or something.
678400	679400	It was still pretty awesome.
679400	680400	Yeah.
680400	681400	Yeah.
681400	682920	Considering it was like 2002 or something.
682960	688240	So, uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night
688240	692520	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the
692520	694040	voice of geeks network.
694040	699280	That's vognetwork.com and our chat room of course, at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Raginator
699280	706040	in our chat asking, is there any chance that Irene could change fafop.com to fafap.com?
706040	708880	I think we talked about that last time you were here that like, you might have to get
708880	710760	that domain as well as forward.
710760	711760	Yeah.
711800	715560	I'm currently working on that as of five seconds ago.
715560	716560	Okay.
716560	718800	You have your people working on it right now.
718800	719800	Yes.
719800	720800	Yes.
720800	721800	All right.
721800	722800	That's happening.
722800	723800	That's happening.
723800	724800	Uh, let's see.
724800	728440	Rama pointing out that November 20th was also DDR's 16th anniversary.
728440	730360	Oh my gosh.
730360	731360	Shut the front door.
731360	732360	16 years.
732360	733360	That's true.
733360	734360	1998 was the year it launched.
734360	735360	Right.
735360	736360	Oh my gosh.
736360	737360	And we first played it in 2000.
737360	738360	You and I.
738360	739360	Was it 2000?
739360	741360	Cause it was at the Rocky 25th convention in Vegas.
741960	742960	Yeah.
742960	743960	Yeah.
743960	748840	It was you, me, iguana girl and somebody else was there with us, I thought.
748840	749840	All playing.
749840	750840	Yeah.
750840	751840	I don't remember.
751840	752840	I don't remember.
752840	753840	Somebody else was with us.
753840	754840	It was so long ago.
754840	755840	I know.
755840	756840	As our memories are fading.
756840	757840	I have Alzheimer's.
757840	758840	Um, let's see.
758840	761720	Act F pointing out the 20 November is also Mexican revolution day.
761720	762720	Whoa.
762720	767000	Well, maybe that's why it's dance, dance revolution.
767000	771440	So wouldn't it be like by Llamas by Llamas, I don't know Spanish.
771440	772440	I'm sorry.
772440	776200	I just ruined that joke, but I have a Luciano.
776200	779880	If I titled these episodes, tonight's episode would be by Llamas revolution.
779880	780880	Yeah.
780880	781880	There you go.
781880	784480	Uh, well, you know, in Europe it was called dancing stage.
784480	789800	I do know that because I guess, you know, you can't say revolution over there.
789800	791480	It's a bad word.
791480	792480	So it's dancing.
792480	793480	That's true.
793480	794480	It really is called dancing stage.
794480	795480	Right.
795480	796480	Call.
796960	800600	It's one of those things where like, they finally released it as DDR years later.
800600	804040	They just knew that it was going to be a fad, so you're going to go through this dancing
804040	805040	stage.
805040	808920	Well, it's like, it was like us and dragon quest for some reason it was dragon warrior.
808920	811600	And then finally at some point they were like, all right, it's dragon quest.
811600	812600	Yeah.
812600	814520	Make up your fucking minds guys.
814520	816160	Oh my gosh.
816160	817160	All right.
817160	818720	Um, let's see.
818720	823400	Also in this part of November around Thanksgiving and because of the black Friday and the $5
823400	828280	crock pots I talked about a minute ago, this is the time of year where all the games are
828280	832600	coming out because you got to get your game on the shelf before black Friday, the official
832600	837160	start of the holiday season, because you know, that's when people are going to go out and
837160	838880	get the gifts that are going to show up under the tree.
838880	841080	The games sell the most during this time of year.
841080	844840	So we just have an avalanche of games to pick from this week.
844840	848340	Um, I do want to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been
848340	849700	playing this week.
849700	854800	But before we get into that completely, I kind of want to ask you, how do you pick the
854800	856420	games that you're going to play this week?
856420	858060	And this might be a really tough question.
858060	861780	I'm going to pose this in our chat room too over at live.vognetwork.com.
861780	864320	How are you picking out of all these games?
864320	867220	You know, not everybody can afford to buy all 10 games they want.
867220	871120	Some people can't really afford to buy one of the games they want, but how are you able
871120	875460	to pick which game it is that you are going to play this week?
875460	877620	Loki, I'll start with you.
877620	878620	How did I pick which game?
878620	879620	How did you pick?
879620	885820	I bought, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, and so I played that for a bit, at least a few
885820	893340	days out of the week, and then the other few days I played Lego Marvel Super Heroes, mainly
893340	898540	because one of the days I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto 5, it was downloading a patch,
898540	899860	and so it took a long time.
899860	903900	It was going to be like another hour before I could play it, and I was like, eh, I'm just
903900	904900	going to play something else.
904900	911020	And so I played that, and I kept playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
911020	915700	I did want to get Far Cry, maybe Dragon Age Inquisition.
915700	916700	Why?
916700	917700	Why?
917700	921940	Far Cry 3, I loved that game, and it looks like a pretty incredible game, and Inquisition,
921940	923680	everybody's kind of doing it.
923680	924680	So it's like, got to get it.
924680	929060	Peer pressure is, okay, I mean, this is the thing people don't usually want to admit,
929060	930780	but is peer pressure a factor?
930780	931780	I'll kind of openly admit.
932140	935780	I mean, I want to get games that I can play with friends with, and unfortunately not everybody's
935780	938700	on the Grand Theft Auto bandwagon, because I don't know what's wrong with you people,
938700	943680	but seriously, not everybody's on that bandwagon, and so...
943680	946980	If it had come out like a month sooner, I probably would have bought it, but now it
946980	950660	has to compete with all this other stuff, and it's like, okay, I spent like $200 on
950660	951660	video games this week.
951660	953660	That's a lot of money.
953660	954660	No more.
954660	955660	You know?
955660	956660	I don't know.
956660	957660	I don't have to get Inquisition.
957660	963420	See, the thing is, I'm waiting for the Black Friday sales to see what's going to be discounted,
963420	966580	because there's even like, you know, I've been seeing some of the early stuff, and like
966580	972100	they have, was it Middle Earth Shadows of Mordor for like 25 bucks?
972100	974420	I mean, that just came out.
974420	975580	Why is it discounted so much?
975580	977300	It was supposed to be a pretty good game.
977300	982220	I mean, that might be worth picking up, or Wolfenstein down to $25, although I'm not
982220	985660	sure if I want to buy, because I'm already sitting on like a few games on my PlayStation
985660	987500	4 that I haven't played yet.
987500	991780	Like I have Watch Dogs and Destiny that haven't been touched yet.
991780	994860	And I know it's coming up later in the show, but it's no secret that this time of year
994860	997540	means a Steam sale is going to be coming at some point.
997540	998940	Speaking of things I haven't touched yet.
998940	999940	Right?
999940	1001380	And that's just going to be the problem worse.
1001380	1004020	Then it'll be like, oh, I just picked up $2 games.
1004020	1007380	Here's the thing though, I'm getting to the point now, even with like the Humblebundles,
1007380	1010800	and I tend to buy most of the Humblebundles, I'm getting to the point where I'm not picking
1010800	1013220	up because I own most of the games already.
1013220	1014220	Right.
1014220	1016820	And it's getting to the point where they're repeating enough stuff where it's like, well
1016820	1017820	shit.
1017820	1022060	You know, like this last Humblebundle I bought, I bought the highest tier so I could change
1022060	1023500	to a four so I can give the Rob.
1023500	1027460	But uh, thank you by the way, it was very nice of you to have no time to play it.
1027460	1028460	Exactly.
1028460	1031300	It's like, you know, all these other games, like I looked at my list of unredeemed keys
1031300	1032820	on the Humblebundle and I'm like, well shit.
1032820	1033820	Yeah.
1033820	1034820	Cause I have all these already.
1034820	1036300	How many copies of Fez do I have?
1036300	1038420	Like way too many damn copies of Fez.
1038420	1039420	More than anyone needs.
1039420	1044420	You know, it's just, it's ridiculous like, oh hey, cool grid unlocked in grid two.
1044420	1047020	I'm never going to play these games.
1047020	1048660	Why am I buying these things?
1048660	1049660	All right.
1049660	1052620	I'll come back to you later and ask you more specifics about how Grand Theft Auto five
1052620	1053620	is going and all that.
1053620	1054980	Uh, look at our chat room though.
1054980	1058820	Cause I asked you guys in chat what, uh, you know, what you are weighing and what to play
1058820	1059820	this week.
1059820	1063180	Uh, act dev says I pick the game I'm most excited about and probably the one I'll play
1063180	1064420	the longest too.
1064420	1067540	Hence why I pick smash and vid power says, same here.
1067540	1070460	I picked the one I was eagerly anticipating, which was smash guys.
1070460	1073980	You know, it says it's easy to pick games because most of the crap they have out now
1073980	1075180	isn't worth buying.
1075180	1079260	I'm only looking to get grand theft auto five and smash Pokemon grand theft auto five and
1079260	1081380	smash were the only games I was waiting for.
1081380	1084180	Oh, and Sims four and civilization beyond earth.
1084180	1085180	That's about it for me.
1085180	1087500	That's still sounds like a pretty good big list guys, you know, that's still a lot of
1087500	1088500	games in the list.
1088500	1089500	I don't know.
1089500	1095340	Uh, but uh, Irene, what, what do you factor in this week and like, what am I going to
1095340	1096340	play?
1096340	1101140	Um, I think about what's already on my 3ds.
1101140	1103000	So it's more like I'm on a budget.
1103040	1105960	I don't have time for $60 game week.
1105960	1106960	Yes.
1106960	1108880	And also a time budget.
1108880	1113880	So what's going to take five to 15 minutes, which is usually the me Plaza.
1113880	1114880	I see.
1114880	1118080	So you have to kind of weigh in because you have the school and the other stuff that gets
1118080	1119080	in the way.
1119080	1120400	What can I play quickly?
1120400	1121400	Right.
1121400	1124440	So you don't have time to play dragon age inquisition, even if that was something that
1124440	1126200	was up your alley, which I don't think it is.
1126200	1127200	Nope.
1127200	1128200	Yeah.
1128200	1129200	You don't have to, ain't nobody got time for that.
1129200	1130200	Nobody got time for that.
1130200	1131200	Nobody got time for that.
1131200	1132200	Right.
1132400	1136240	So what are the retro titles and kind of what you like, if I kind of look at a list of what
1136240	1139280	are Irene's favorite games, a lot of them tend to be like retro stuff.
1139280	1143160	Is that because it's more bite-sized or, um, not real.
1143160	1147560	I mean, that's all just stuff that I have played because I don't have time to play current
1147560	1148560	games anymore.
1148560	1151960	I, you know, I haven't played them, but I've played a lot of older games.
1151960	1155640	So that's usually why all of my favorite games are older games because I haven't played any
1155640	1156640	new games.
1156640	1157640	I'm too busy.
1157640	1160200	Well, and you can always, and you can always come over here and play the stuff that I got
1160200	1161200	suckered into buying.
1161200	1163000	Well, like you did with Smash this week, right?
1163000	1164000	Yeah.
1164000	1165000	Totally did that.
1165000	1166000	That was fun.
1166000	1168520	Uh, we'll talk about your thoughts on Smash in a minute here.
1168520	1172520	Uh, for me, I think, you know, and the thing I didn't really get to get into as Loki was
1172520	1175700	talking, I think peer pressure does play into it just a little bit.
1175700	1178720	Like I kind of think that's what finally broke me on Dragon Age Inquisition.
1178720	1184520	Like I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really, like I didn't get it super into Dragon
1184520	1185520	Age Origins.
1185520	1189340	Like I tried, but it just, I don't know if it was too slow or if it's just the engine
1189340	1192540	wasn't like Mass Effect, so it didn't really pull me in the same way or the store.
1192540	1193540	I don't know what it was.
1193540	1195500	I couldn't get into Dragon Age Origins.
1195500	1196500	I don't like hate it.
1196500	1200780	I just really couldn't get into it, but I bought Dragon Age Inquisition because I knew
1200780	1202220	Alan was a big fan of it.
1202220	1205680	I knew my roommate was a big fan of it and there would be a lot of chatter about the
1205680	1207500	game in this household.
1207500	1211100	And I was like, oh, it has a multiplayer mode and multiplayer is supposed to be kind of
1211100	1212100	like Mass Effect.
1212100	1215740	And I really liked Mass Effect's multiplayer mode way more than I ever thought I would.
1215740	1218740	Uh, so I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going to do it.
1218740	1220380	Here's the 60 bucks.
1220380	1223100	And I really enjoyed Dragon Age Inquisition.
1223100	1226520	I'll talk about that more in a minute, but I, I'm really glad I bought it.
1226520	1230780	Like the game pulled me in, in a way that Origins didn't do.
1230780	1232380	So I'm like super into the game.
1232380	1235660	So it's a, it's a place where peer pressure actually paid off.
1235660	1237180	I actually think you're onto something.
1237180	1239380	There's always this fear of missing out.
1239380	1241460	I think that a lot of people are susceptible to that.
1241460	1244580	And I mean, I don't know, we're probably gonna talk about this later, but the whole Warlords
1244580	1249100	of Draenor thing, like how the sub, you know, has risen.
1249100	1250100	Yeah, we'll get into that.
1250100	1251100	Yeah.
1251100	1254220	So I kind of think that's part of playing part of that too.
1254220	1255220	That's okay.
1255220	1258840	Let's talk about Draenor for a minute and we will get into that and, you know, and have
1258840	1263420	a more lengthy discussion about, you know, what Blizzard's doing amongst all the chaos
1263420	1266540	happened this past week, but you are a former World of Warcraft player.
1266540	1268860	In fact, you're the one that kind of got me into it.
1268860	1269860	One of a couple people.
1269860	1270860	Yeah, I know.
1270860	1271860	Right.
1271860	1272860	So you got me into it.
1272860	1273860	I don't play anymore.
1274540	1281940	But I found it really hard to resist the temptation to go back this week because everybody is
1281940	1283540	up that expansion's ass.
1283540	1284540	Right.
1284540	1285740	Like, and I'm not hating with that comment.
1285740	1286740	I'm not hating with that comment.
1286740	1290260	I'm really happy for Blizzard and I'm happy that that expansion apparently has turned
1290260	1296340	out as good as it has because I really lost interest halfway through Pandaria when basically
1296340	1300100	Blizzard had thrown five mans out the window, which is the thing I enjoyed most in the game
1300100	1302220	and I couldn't stand LFR and stuff anymore.
1302220	1305140	But it seems like people are really loving this expansion, the story, and a lot of the
1305140	1306260	other things about it.
1306260	1309900	I know people that haven't played in a very long time that are super into it and that
1309900	1313620	peer pressure is kind of making me go, I, I got to do it.
1313620	1314620	I got to try it.
1314620	1318700	Like even though I'm paying for 14 and I got, I've got to, everybody's loving wow.
1318700	1321280	I've got to try wow at some point.
1321280	1326060	But luckily this week I've been able to tell myself, okay, Rob, you just bought three,
1326060	1328620	no four, because I bought the Jackbox game too.
1328620	1331240	I bought four games this week.
1331280	1335640	I do not need fucking wow to make me not play any of it.
1335640	1336640	Right.
1336640	1337640	Right.
1337640	1341000	And you know, it's such a weird dynamic with wow.
1341000	1344720	You kind of have to strike while the iron's hot because maybe a few months down the line
1344720	1346600	it's not going to be as appealing.
1346600	1350400	You know, people will drop off and it just won't be, so it has to be the right conditions
1350400	1351400	too.
1351400	1354720	So right now is when everyone's jumping back on board and everything's still fresh and
1354720	1356940	no one, you know, all the contents new and stuff like that.
1356940	1358960	So it would be the ideal time to do it.
1358960	1363080	And I will tell you, I despise wow, I do.
1363080	1369400	But even I was tempted for a millisecond, like, man, I really miss PVP and just, I miss
1369400	1374320	wow and I just, I would love to go back, but it's just like, no, I mean, I'm done with
1374320	1375320	that.
1375320	1379280	So, but yeah, there's just this confluence of just factors that make it sound appealing
1379280	1380880	and I don't know.
1380880	1384360	Without getting too dark, I hope I'm not going down too much of a dark road here, but you
1384360	1387880	used to be really into wow and now you say I despise wow.
1387880	1389640	That's a very strong term.
1389640	1391560	What flipped for you?
1391560	1392560	Wow killed my brother.
1392560	1393560	I'm just kidding.
1393560	1394560	I shouldn't laugh.
1394560	1397560	It's a horrible thing to say.
1397560	1398560	No, it's not.
1398560	1403400	No, it just, you know, thinking about all of the money I spent on wow and all the time
1403400	1406720	I spent on wow and how much more I could have been doing with my life rather than playing
1406720	1407720	wow.
1407720	1412740	And you know, some of the friendships and the fake friendships that I created with wow.
1412740	1417120	And I say that earnestly, like fake friendships, because sometimes you got to play that game
1417160	1419240	in the game to do anything.
1419240	1423640	Like, you know, if someone finds out you're a girl in the game, wow, it just turns around
1423640	1424640	180 for you.
1424640	1428920	Like they will, there's just this intricate game you have to play with them.
1428920	1432360	And it's, it's not anything I really wanted to be a part of, but that's just, it was kind
1432360	1437240	of the expectation, I guess it was created in the environment of wow.
1437240	1439040	Anyway, that's a whole different topic.
1439040	1441560	But that was fascinating.
1441560	1443840	You could do an entire movie on that.
1443840	1444840	Whoa.
1444840	1445840	No.
1445840	1450440	But I mean, it was just, you know, there were some great things about it.
1450440	1455400	I loved PVPing, you know, I loved interacting with my friends and stuff, but it was just,
1455400	1457960	you know, it was affecting my real life too much.
1457960	1461880	And I just, you know, the more I think about it, the more resentful I get about it.
1461880	1462880	So
1462880	1466080	You know, what's interesting is, you know, I have Hoard House, which was a World of Warcraft
1466080	1470480	podcast for a few years, and I'm pretty tuned into the Warcraft podcasting community of
1470480	1472240	which there's a lot of podcasts.
1472240	1477000	I'm not sure I've ever heard in the years of, of, of doing those podcasts, I've ever
1477000	1481860	heard somebody talk about the real social game the way you just did.
1481860	1486600	That's very, that's, I mean, and I can't really argue with you and what you're saying, but
1486600	1491640	it's a very interesting layer of wow that nobody who's into it really talks about, which
1491640	1492760	I find very interesting.
1492760	1493760	Yeah.
1493760	1496980	I mean, nobody, I think, you know, no one wants to acknowledge that that happens and
1496980	1500480	it's not just wow, it's, it's every MMO that you play or any sort of
1500480	1501480	Or any multiplayer game.
1501480	1502480	Right.
1502480	1503480	It can be League of Legends.
1503480	1504480	Right.
1504480	1505480	Exactly.
1505480	1506480	Yeah.
1506480	1507520	You know, but I mean, everyone knows that it happens.
1507520	1513340	It's just, nobody really acknowledged or they're just kind of, you know, they're blind to it.
1513340	1514340	They just think that that's
1514340	1519440	And just to be clear, you're not only talking about the whole like IRL girl angle.
1519440	1520440	Right.
1520440	1521440	Right.
1521440	1525100	You're talking about, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is what I'm hearing.
1525100	1530660	You have faked friendships in an MMO to advance your MMO game.
1530660	1531660	Yes.
1531660	1534660	Even though you didn't particularly necessarily care for the person who, who might've been
1534660	1535660	helping you out.
1535660	1536660	Right.
1536660	1537660	Yeah.
1537660	1538660	And people have done that with me too.
1538660	1539660	So it's not, and that's okay.
1539660	1542380	I mean, that's just how the game is played.
1542380	1545820	It stings the first time, but you know, you just get used to it.
1545820	1547380	It's par for the course.
1547380	1548380	Wow.
1548380	1549380	Yeah.
1549380	1552220	Loki, when are you going to start playing MMOs?
1552220	1554100	Want to be my friend in WoW?
1554100	1556540	I'll be your friend.
1556540	1559220	Help me get a two player amount.
1559220	1560220	Right.
1560220	1561220	Wow.
1561220	1566040	Uh, let's see, uh, Kaijuto in chat says, wow, screwed up MMOs.
1566040	1569500	It went with mediocre and now every MMO just follows suit.
1569500	1573260	Kaijuto also saying she realized how mediocre WoW is.
1573260	1579020	It is very, you know, I can't hate on the mediocrity of WoW because it went from, I
1579020	1584060	mean, if you think of all of WoW's predecessors, what came, what MMOs came before WoW?
1584060	1588700	I mean, there was request Ultima online, how difficult were these games?
1588700	1593580	How hard were, were they to access for the quote unquote, I guess, casual gamer or, you
1593580	1596140	know, not super experienced gamer.
1596140	1600900	You know, I can credit WoW with, with being very accessible, you know, and I appreciate
1600900	1605540	that because I'm, I'm, I, I, I like games, but I'm not amazing at them.
1605540	1611500	So Blizzard has become a PC gaming powerhouse and now also console, you know, they're, they
1611500	1616460	dabble in the console stuff too, but Blizzard's become a PC gaming powerhouse by dumbing
1616460	1617780	down.
1617780	1621540	And I don't mean that in a harsh way, but just like, I love Blizzard games too because
1621540	1628020	they dumb down what can oftentimes be very difficult genres so that everybody can play
1628020	1629020	them.
1629020	1630020	Right.
1630020	1632500	And they, and they're, they did it with, um, Starcraft.
1632500	1635860	They did it with Diablo is a simple dungeon crawler.
1635860	1638340	They did heroes of the storm big time.
1638340	1642100	The only mobile I can wrap my head around is heroes of the storm.
1642100	1644020	And now they're going to do it again with the shooter.
1644020	1647420	And you've got all these people, and I don't know if it's just this whole effect that Blizzard
1647420	1654300	has that I don't want to say Blizzard creates a cult, but like going, but going to Blizzcon
1654300	1657660	was a very interesting experience because there's so many people that are like, I hate
1657660	1660220	first person shooters, but I'll play Overwatch.
1660220	1664180	I'll play it because it's Blizzard bow down, bow down, I'm going to play this.
1664180	1667140	And I got to admit, even I played Overwatch and the first time I didn't totally get it,
1667220	1670260	but the second time I was like, God, this character development is really good.
1670260	1671940	And I could see myself getting really into this.
1671940	1672940	Yeah.
1672940	1673940	And that's what it is too.
1673940	1679300	They might sacrifice, you know, um, very involved gameplay or, you know, whatever, but they'll
1679300	1680940	enrich something else in the game.
1680940	1684460	They'll make a really good, you know, storyline or, you know, whatever.
1684460	1689380	So I think that's probably what the draw of wow was, was, you know, they're sacrificing
1689380	1692340	that, but they're making in, in making it more accessible to gamers.
1692340	1695460	They improve other aspects of the game to make up for it.
1695900	1700500	And to be fair, I don't think I would use the word mediocre with wow, because I really
1700500	1705380	think wow set the bar in some ways, but I do think there are games that have taken some
1705380	1706860	things in wow and done it better.
1706860	1709140	Y'all know I'm addicted to Final Fantasy 14.
1709140	1712680	I think there's some elements that 14 does better, but I'm not necessarily saying that
1712680	1713740	all of it's better.
1713740	1715780	It has its drawbacks as well.
1715780	1720580	But um, you know, it's just, there's these other MMOs that are all worth checking out,
1720580	1724700	but nobody does it because they're too tied up in the social game of wow.
1724700	1729260	You know, I would acknowledge that wow has devolved since its origins.
1729260	1730260	Absolutely.
1730260	1732860	And I think girl, you were coming out swinging tonight.
1732860	1733860	It's true though.
1733860	1734860	It has.
1734860	1736140	I mean, if you, let's talk about this.
1736140	1739380	I mean, you think about, you know, vanilla wow.
1739380	1745700	If you want to argue with princess Irene, uh, by all means, uh, tweet us at OLR or you
1745700	1746700	want a bump?
1746700	1747700	Let's go.
1747700	1748700	You want a bump?
1748700	1749700	Let's go.
1749700	1750700	No, no, I'm just saying, okay.
1750700	1751700	Ah, you know, I really love the game.
1751700	1752700	I loved vanilla.
1752700	1753700	Wow.
1753700	1757020	Um, burning crusade, you know, wrath kind of sucked.
1757020	1762260	Um, but I mean, once you start looking at when they took all of the pop culture references
1762260	1766920	and the memes and stuff overboard, when it kind of broke the verisimilitude of the game
1766920	1771560	and it went from a fantasy game to a pop culture game and they just were not even subtle about
1771560	1772560	anything anymore.
1772560	1773940	They were getting too ironic with their stuff.
1773940	1776220	Are you saying there was one too many poop quests?
1776220	1777220	Yes.
1777220	1781300	I'm saying that there were one too many poop quests.
1781300	1782300	Yes.
1782300	1787340	You know, and I just, it was, it was fun at first, but then it just became too overt and
1787340	1788460	too much.
1788460	1792500	And I think that really just, you know, it devolved into something for, you know, it
1792500	1796900	was like fucking 12 year old dick and fart jokes, which you know, I normally love, but
1796900	1798420	I also loved original wow.
1798420	1800420	And it really just ruined it for me.
1800420	1804500	Well, some of the people that are talking about warless arena or say it's, it's a return
1804500	1809380	closest thing to vanilla and burning crusade and that period right in between that we've
1809380	1810380	seen since.
1810380	1814540	And see, that's so depressing because I don't want to go back to wow, because I know life
1814540	1816720	after wow and it's beautiful and it's sweet.
1816720	1818820	And then if I go back into wow, it's sucking me back in.
1818820	1821640	But I know people that play wow that are completely like functional, happy people.
1821640	1822640	You know, I don't want to.
1822640	1823640	I'm not one of those people.
1823640	1824940	I don't do that when I play wow.
1824940	1828340	I sit for 12 hours on a Saturday and PVP all day.
1828340	1829340	That's okay.
1829340	1832900	So as long as we're clear, people react differently and that's how you did it.
1832900	1833900	Exactly.
1833900	1834900	Yeah.
1834900	1835900	I want to get through school.
1835900	1836900	So.
1836900	1837900	All right.
1837900	1838900	Let's see.
1838900	1841020	We've got from Alan alchemy, who I believe is talking about the social elements of, of
1841020	1842020	wow.
1842020	1845540	The social game quote, everyone in my raid group ain't shit and are actually kind of
1845540	1848580	racist, but we progress hard modes easily and they fit my schedule.
1848580	1849580	So, Oh, well.
1849580	1850580	Wow.
1850580	1853620	See, see, you have to pretend to like these fuckers.
1853620	1854620	Like yeah.
1854620	1855620	Oh, racism.
1855620	1856620	Good times.
1856620	1857620	All right.
1857620	1858620	Let's go raid.
1858620	1861020	You know, like I just, I, I don't want to do that.
1861020	1866480	I don't want to put up with bullshit just to do things with people, but not that everyone
1866480	1875960	that plays wow is racist, but most of them, definitely grandpa, but I'm not hating on
1875960	1876960	it.
1876960	1879240	I just, you know, it's, it's kind of a slippery slope for me.
1879240	1880240	It's all right.
1880240	1881240	Wow.
1881240	1884200	I did not know this was going to delve into the dark side of MMO chat, but that was, that
1884200	1885200	was great.
1885200	1887600	No therapy time for a read.
1887600	1890840	You're actually like lying back in Jamie's chair.
1890840	1891840	Just kicking it.
1891840	1892840	Just talking about, wow.
1892840	1896000	If you were the smoking kind of as you'd have a cigarette in your hand, just, you know,
1896000	1900040	looking back on it, like a grizzled veteran, let's talk about, wow.
1900040	1901040	All right.
1901040	1904720	Well, I do want to move on with the show and talk a little bit about what have we been
1904720	1908160	playing this week specifically, I guess we've touched on it a little bit, but now let's
1908160	1911040	get into some of the details and maybe some of the stuff that got missed.
1911040	1912040	Loki.
1912040	1913040	How was your gaming week?
1913040	1920360	Um, I played Grand Theft Auto and, um, it's awesome.
1920360	1924780	You know, I, I downloaded it digitally cause I had, you know, pre-ordered, so unlocked
1924780	1930620	on Monday and, um, I started playing through the story, no story campaign.
1930620	1935100	I actually tried streaming some of it and that worked out okay, I guess.
1935100	1941420	Um, and then also I did play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, still kind of bored
1941420	1942420	with that game.
1942420	1943420	I don't know.
1943420	1947260	It's just kind of okay, I guess.
1947260	1950900	But at the time you don't want us picking out games to get from my PlayStation four.
1950900	1955140	I was just like, eh, it looked pretty good, but it's all right.
1955140	1956140	I don't know.
1956140	1959660	I probably, if they made another Infamous game, I probably would not pick it up.
1959660	1963200	Um, but Grand Theft Auto, yes, Grand Theft Auto is amazing.
1963200	1967620	And I did play through a lot of it in first person mode, although I've now gone back to
1967620	1971700	third person mode again, cause I don't know, I kind of got over it.
1971700	1977100	It is hard to like, you know, see around yourself and, um, it might be fun to like play, you
1977100	1980860	know, Grand Theft Auto online that way, if you're playing in online mode, that was only
1980860	1986580	people playing in that mode, but, uh, I don't know, it looks really good.
1986580	1992560	It's very pretty and I love all the new animals, you know, cats and stuff wandering around
1992560	1993560	a lot.
1993560	1999020	And, um, I don't know, it's, I did watch a little bit of your live stream and I saw the
1999020	2002660	cat and now, yes, I got very distracted, you know, I was supposed to be stealing a car.
2002660	2003660	I'm like, okay.
2003660	2004660	Yeah.
2005220	2009620	So, now there's a lot of cats and they're not, not rare at all, so you see them quite
2009620	2010620	a bit.
2010620	2015620	Um, so I did that and I think the other day I was occupying myself playing with Chop,
2015620	2017900	so I was throwing a ball at people.
2017900	2021140	As I take his ball, throw it at a person, they get pissed off and when they get pissed
2021140	2023160	off, he goes and attacks them and kills them.
2023160	2024500	So that's kind of fun.
2024500	2026740	Um, so I was doing that.
2026740	2029500	And then, um, what else?
2029500	2031300	Uh, Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
2031340	2036060	So I had originally got this to play with my son and it's just hard to play with him
2036060	2038820	because he doesn't really understand how to use the controller too well.
2038820	2044140	I mean, he can mash some of the, you know, buttons in it and he wanted to play as Hulk
2044140	2047900	and stuff and then he got frustrated once he passed the Hulk stage that now it's Captain
2047900	2052220	America and, um, oh, who else was it?
2052220	2054460	Captain America and Mr. Fantastic.
2054460	2060180	So I was playing through the campaign to get to, you know, the free mode part of the whole
2060220	2062780	thing where you can kind of run around New York.
2062780	2065740	And so I was playing through that and I finally got that unlocked, but then I kept playing
2065740	2067420	it because, you know, it's okay.
2067420	2068420	I don't know.
2068420	2069420	I was trying to unlock all the characters.
2069420	2072020	I'm still not sure how to switch characters.
2072020	2075940	I think I'll figure that out later on, but I guess there's supposed to be some sort of
2075940	2078580	secret room with Deadpool, but Deadpool's everywhere.
2078580	2080540	He like has so many cameos and everything.
2080540	2081540	It's hilarious.
2081540	2086980	Um, so I just have to play through it, I guess some more to find Deadpool.
2086980	2089580	That's who I'm really trying to unlock.
2089580	2099740	Um, the story's okay, I guess, uh, ran across, um, oh, what's his name, um, I don't know.
2099740	2103820	It's mostly the Avengers stuff right now, uh, them run through and damn, they have like
2103820	2107980	a ton of Spider-Man content and like the first like four or five villains were all Spider-Man
2107980	2108980	villains.
2108980	2112540	I'm like, okay, Spider-Man's in this level and this level and this level.
2112540	2115700	Is Doctor Octopus the first one you run into, like the very first one?
2115700	2116900	Sandman's the very first one.
2117540	2124540	Sandman and then Doctor Octopus and then, then it's what, Green Goblin and then Venom
2124540	2129940	and it's like, okay, you've gone through all of the Spider-Man villains, stop.
2129940	2133460	And then, um, who would it end up being?
2133460	2140980	Then you finally run into Magneto and, um, uh, Sabretooth and you fight, uh, oh, what's
2140980	2141980	his name?
2141980	2143820	Uh, Abomination again.
2143820	2144820	I don't know.
2144820	2145980	There's a lot of characters in it.
2145980	2147460	It's kind of cool.
2147460	2149740	So I played through that and it's fun.
2149740	2152740	I probably will still play through it again because the only thing, granted, I thought
2152740	2156620	it was, I've, I've already beat the campaign a hundred percent in the Xbox 360.
2156620	2161620	So it's like, and I remember how much of a pain in the ass that was to do that.
2161620	2166340	That took a long time and I'm just kind of regretting having to do that again because
2166340	2171700	I want to get in on that whole, you know, Mount Chiliad mystery Easter egg thing, but
2171700	2173260	you have to have a hundred percent to do that.
2173260	2176100	And then it's kind of like, oh, I don't want to do that again.
2176100	2181700	It took so much time, so I'm just hoping someone releases like a save game cheat or something
2181700	2182700	like that.
2182700	2184700	Cause I really don't want to have to go through the whole campaign yet.
2184700	2185700	It was good.
2185700	2191380	It's just, it's a long time, a lot of time dedicated to that, but maybe, maybe I'll do
2191380	2192380	it.
2192380	2193380	You know, who knows?
2193380	2198520	I do want to pick up far cry four at some point, but all these games take a long time.
2198520	2201220	That's why Lego Marvel superheroes.
2201220	2205340	It's just kind of linear for the most part, although the open world stuff's really huge
2205340	2206340	too.
2206340	2207580	I was like, holy crap, this map is huge.
2207580	2213780	I mean, it's kind of empty, but it's very, there's a lot of stuff and I'm still not really
2213780	2217440	sure what collecting all those studs do if I can like buy things with that.
2217440	2221620	So I've been just collecting them anyways, but there's a ton of collecting this.
2221620	2222620	I don't know.
2222620	2225620	Cause it's shiny and I'm like, I don't know them getting points.
2225620	2226620	I guess.
2226620	2227620	Are these points?
2227620	2228620	Are they money?
2228620	2229620	What, what are these things?
2229620	2230620	I don't know.
2230620	2232540	So maybe I'll just look it up on the internet.
2232540	2236340	But uh, so yeah, that's what I've been doing this week is just really those games.
2236340	2237340	All right.
2237340	2238620	Well I'm going to try to cover this quickly.
2238620	2239620	I know.
2239620	2240620	I'm sorry.
2240620	2241620	Real quick.
2241620	2242620	Real quick.
2242620	2245100	I also played more of the, um, well you want to talk about a sandwich play, no play room.
2245100	2246420	I didn't play any sandwiches.
2246420	2248420	No, actually my son was playing play room.
2248420	2250300	Um, he was playing the alien.
2250300	2256740	My was like some alien one, um, brave, like a toy alien and you destroyed, like it almost
2256740	2257740	looks like a little bit playing.
2257740	2259820	Destroyed a bunch of like cardboard things.
2259820	2260820	And so he loves it.
2260820	2265180	Like he literally spent like two or three hours playing that the other day all by himself.
2265180	2266180	I was like, Hey, cool.
2266180	2267180	All right.
2267180	2268180	That's it.
2268180	2269180	All right.
2269180	2273060	Uh, I will try to be quick cause I, I had, I covered a lot of ground in gaming this week
2273060	2274820	and so I'm going to try to be quick.
2274820	2279420	So I played a lot of my usual stuff like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo three because, and the
2279420	2281880	reason why I played a lot of Diablo three and probably more of that than anything else
2281880	2286500	this week is that Alan decided to make this his week that I'm just, I don't know why,
2286500	2289060	but I've decided I'm going to beat Diablo three finally.
2289060	2292620	Maybe watching me play all that time finally rubbed off on him and he was like, I want
2292620	2295060	to do riffs and all the cool things that Rob talks about.
2295060	2300580	So he finally beat the game and he's level like 69 he's really close to that 70 cap right
2300580	2301580	now.
2301580	2304720	Um, so he's been playing Diablo three, so I've been helping him out and I've just been
2304720	2306620	playing a lot of it because of that.
2306620	2309540	Looking forward to the new patch, trying to finish out what I want to do in season one
2309540	2310900	before it hits.
2310900	2316220	Um, so a lot of that old, the old stuff I've been playing, but new stuff, lots of new stuff.
2316380	2318580	Dragon Age Inquisition, which I mentioned a little bit ago.
2318580	2323420	Um, I, I got really sucked into the game because the game really hits the ground running with
2323420	2324420	the story.
2324420	2325500	I found the story very interesting.
2325500	2330860	I think the characters are really interesting and this is something BioWare does very well.
2330860	2334220	Uh, they did it in Mass Effect and I know they did this in the other Dragon Age games.
2334220	2336660	I just think the characters are really, really interesting.
2336660	2340380	You know, I know Dragon Age gets a lot at a lot for its diversity.
2340380	2346700	I think that just goes to enhance the, the stories, the backgrounds that all these different
2346700	2351180	characters have that you can really go down a rabbit hole of exploring these people's
2351180	2353500	paths, where they come from and their stories.
2353500	2354860	This is, it's great.
2354860	2356580	And so many different party members.
2356580	2362580	Um, I also, a lot of folks comparing Dragon Age Inquisition to Skyrim in some ways, and
2362580	2364980	I definitely feel the Skyrim influence in the game.
2364980	2365980	And the reason why...
2365980	2368180	No, don't say that.
2368180	2369180	Don't say that.
2369180	2370180	You have to buy it now.
2370180	2375060	And the reason why Irene's making a face, like, I don't like Skyrim face.
2375060	2376780	What is wrong with you?
2376780	2378220	Absolutely nothing.
2378220	2379820	I have my own opinion, Matt.
2379820	2380820	What is your quick opinion?
2380820	2383620	Clearly, it's clearly because you haven't played a little PC mods.
2383620	2384620	You can make that game.
2384620	2385620	Clearly.
2385620	2386620	Clearly.
2386620	2387620	What is clearly your problem with Skyrim?
2387620	2390100	It is clearly fucking boring as shit.
2390100	2391100	Okay.
2391100	2392100	So you know what?
2392100	2394940	I can see why people get bored with Skyrim.
2394940	2395940	I really can.
2395940	2396940	Yeah.
2396940	2397940	Because it is, it is a slow burn.
2397940	2398940	Yes.
2398980	2402300	And it isn't necessarily a game that kind of, I mean, I don't know, it does kind of make
2402300	2403300	your own excitement.
2403300	2404300	Yeah.
2404300	2405780	I don't even think it's on fire.
2405780	2406860	It's not a slow burn.
2406860	2407860	It's just sitting there.
2407860	2408860	Like a candle.
2408860	2409860	Right.
2409860	2410860	That isn't lit.
2410860	2413580	The thing about Dragon Age Inquisition, if you've read up on the game, everybody heard
2413580	2414580	about this.
2414580	2417580	The very first area you go in, the Hinterlands, you're doing the quest and suddenly you're
2417580	2418580	going down the map.
2418580	2419580	Oh, there's a side quest over there.
2419580	2420780	Oh, there's a side quest over there.
2420780	2422700	Oh, there's a camp I need to mark over there.
2422700	2423700	Oh, there's, there's...
2423700	2424700	Can't fucking deal with that.
2424700	2425700	I can't.
2425700	2428060	Side quest, side quest, side quest, and then you go do one side quest.
2428060	2429660	There's five more side quests to do.
2429660	2434220	So it's like, you get stuck in this one fucking zone because you can't stop doing the side
2434220	2438620	quests that are all showing up on your map with very similar icons to Skyrim, might I
2438620	2439620	add.
2439620	2440620	I just kind of noticed that.
2440620	2441620	It was very interesting.
2441620	2442620	Uh, it just, yeah.
2442620	2447980	So, but, but I kinda, I like that, that you go down this and then there's, there's more
2447980	2449500	and you go keep further down.
2449500	2450500	There's even more and more.
2450500	2454300	And I kind of liked that there's so many things to do, but I really stress if you are playing
2454300	2458900	Dragon Age Inquisition, leave the fucking Hinterlands when you can.
2458900	2462520	Go progress the story because you'll get more characters.
2462520	2468140	I don't want to do spoilers, but there are more characters, pretty, at least two to three,
2468140	2472460	three new characters you can get pretty quickly after you get out of the fucking Hinterlands,
2472460	2474220	you can always go back.
2474220	2475220	And that's what I did.
2475220	2477260	I went and I got three new characters and then I went back.
2477260	2479580	So now I'm, I'm doing the burn in the Hinterlands again.
2479580	2484220	And then I got to another area, the Storm Coast, which is another open world area that
2484220	2485900	has five more things to explore.
2485900	2488700	It's just like, Oh my God, there's so much to do.
2488700	2490860	So a lot to do in Dragon Age Inquisition.
2490860	2493580	Now it's not a perfect game.
2493580	2498580	And the other reason why I compare it to Skyrim is that Dragon Age Inquisition has some pretty
2498580	2505980	hilarious glitches and we have to be fair for a minute because all of the internet sat
2505980	2511620	here and gave Assassin's Creed Unity a hell of a time last week over some of the bugs.
2511620	2517460	Yet, come on, there's some pretty derpy things that happen in Dragon Age Inquisition and
2517460	2519500	people aren't talking about that.
2519500	2521340	So that needs to be called out.
2521340	2525580	There are definitely some choppy frame rate things that happen.
2525580	2529660	The thing that gets me is dancing characters, like characters that will start to move in
2529660	2532080	these really erratic patterns for no reason.
2532080	2533780	And I'm like, why stop doing that?
2533780	2537420	Now we don't have anything as bad as say somebody's face is fucking missing.
2537420	2542700	Like there's nothing that bad, but there are definitely still some technical glitches that
2542700	2546100	take you out of the experience for a little bit.
2546100	2550100	I do consider that minor in the big picture because those minor things aside, the game
2550100	2551740	is really beautiful.
2551740	2555900	And you know, when glitches aren't happening, there's a lot of gorgeous things to look at.
2555900	2557740	Cutscenes are rendered very well.
2557740	2562380	The way your custom design character is woven into the experiences is really, really something.
2562380	2564980	So there's a lot of good stuff in Dragon Age Inquisition.
2564980	2568520	I think if you are into RPGs, it's worth checking out.
2568520	2570520	I did not really play the first two games.
2570520	2573920	I don't think you have to have either to get fulfillment out of this game.
2573920	2576180	So just throwing that out there.
2576180	2579920	Multiplayer is kind of, I don't want to say it's thrown on.
2579920	2583980	There's definitely a rich experience in there, but it is completely disjointed from the single
2583980	2584980	player game.
2584980	2585980	They are two separate games.
2585980	2588500	They have nothing in common.
2588500	2594140	So I, well, sorry, when I say nothing in common, I mean what you do in one does not impact
2594140	2595620	the other and vice versa.
2595620	2597700	The battle system is very similar.
2597700	2600020	That's what they do have in common.
2600020	2605500	But yeah, I was actually a little disappointed that multiplayer is so separated from the
2605500	2610260	single player experience because there's A, no reason to play it, meaning B, it's hard
2610260	2612460	to find people to play it with.
2612460	2616980	And if I grind and grind and grind in multiplayer, I don't even get PlayStation trophies to show
2616980	2617980	for it.
2617980	2622260	Because unfortunately I think there's some people out there that are so opposed to multiplayer,
2622260	2625000	they're like, oh, well I'm not going to pick up Dragon Age if they have multiplayer trophies
2625000	2628780	because I don't do multiplayer and PvP, ew, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2628780	2631280	Well A, the multiplayer Dragon Age isn't PvP.
2631280	2633960	It's all dungeon crawling, four man stuff.
2633960	2638620	And I see trophies as achievements and they are optional.
2638620	2643060	And if you, I mean, if you decide not to do the content, that's kind of your own damn
2643060	2644060	problem.
2644060	2645060	Like, I don't know.
2645060	2650620	I don't understand why they couldn't do just some things for multiplayer to make it a little
2650620	2652420	more tied to the experience.
2652420	2654220	It was a little silly.
2654220	2655740	Yeah, that's kind of stupid.
2655740	2656900	It's like, what's the point then?
2656900	2661520	I mean, there are a lot of people who are just achievement whores and they just want
2661520	2663100	to get every single achievement.
2663100	2666640	And that's why I assume they didn't put it for multiplayer, but you're just kind of making
2666640	2667640	it useless then.
2667640	2671620	It's like, we spent all this time developing multiplayer, but no one's going to play it.
2671660	2675740	And for me, at the end of the day, it's not as fluid as Mass Effect's multiplayer was.
2675740	2678520	And that kind of takes me out of the experience a little bit.
2678520	2680860	Like I don't, I don't, I think that's the best word I can think of to describe it.
2680860	2682500	It's just not, it's just not very fluid.
2682500	2686380	It's kind of like you go through a dungeon, you kill a few mobs and then it's like, oh,
2686380	2687380	I look around here.
2687380	2689500	I look around here and then, oh, now we're going to wave two.
2689500	2694900	And it's just, I don't know, it just, it doesn't really feel as strong as the single player
2694900	2695900	game itself.
2695900	2700780	And I don't think it, it doesn't, I think a good multiplayer experience compliments
2700820	2702300	the single player experience.
2702300	2704380	And this does not compliment anything.
2704380	2706780	This is a spinoff.
2706780	2710260	This is like playing the Dragon Age game on Facebook or something.
2710260	2711260	It's that kind of spinoff.
2711260	2716020	I mean, ultimately, like I hate to sound so damning of it because I do think, I think
2716020	2718960	you could have a little fun playing multiplayer a few times, especially if you had some friends
2718960	2721660	to play it with, but then you'll be like, why am I playing this?
2721660	2724500	I need to go back into single player mode and actually progress my game.
2724500	2725500	Right.
2725500	2726500	Right.
2726500	2727500	Okay.
2727500	2731420	So we're going to do a Jackbox Party Pack, which by the way, we have a code we're going
2731420	2732420	to give away.
2732420	2735900	We're going to give away a copy of Jackbox Party Pack for the Xbox One or PlayStation
2735900	2736900	Four.
2736900	2737900	We're going to give it away.
2737900	2738900	You can be live listener or podcast listener.
2738900	2743260	We're going to do a contest and I'll talk about that at the start of part B. And obviously,
2743260	2745180	you know, we've had them on the show before.
2745180	2749980	So just that whole disclosure in case you think that's going to taint my review.
2749980	2753780	But I had, I had a great time with Jackbox Party Pack.
2753780	2755540	It is that, it is a party pack.
2755580	2759980	It's a bunch of little like board games virtually.
2759980	2762820	And you might remember when we had them on the show, we talked a little bit about that
2762820	2768900	experience of doing the tablets and cell phones as controllers.
2768900	2771660	And it works very, very, very well for games like Fibbage.
2771660	2777220	And I think a standout in the pack is Drawful, which you play, you played it too.
2777220	2778780	You, you'd enjoy Drawful, right?
2778780	2779780	It was fantastic.
2779780	2784500	Drawful was a hell of a lot of fun for such a simple concept, but the way that it's all
2784500	2788180	weaved together with being able to draw it on the phone and everything is, is really
2788180	2789180	cool.
2789180	2792820	And because it was on PlayStation 4, we were share playing with Extifer.
2792820	2794020	And so there's no lag.
2794020	2796940	He can see the screen like he's sitting in the room and he's on his phone and he can
2796940	2797940	play with us.
2797940	2799060	And we're talking through the TV.
2799060	2800940	Like it's just technology.
2800940	2802340	It's so fucking great.
2802340	2803340	Right?
2803340	2804340	Dun, dun, dun.
2804340	2805340	Oh my God.
2805340	2806340	So that was really cool.
2806340	2810540	The only part, like if you play, you don't know Jack, for some reason they decided to
2810540	2813500	put the tablet controls in that too.
2813500	2817700	And I don't understand why they went down that, well I do and I don't, like not everybody
2817700	2822860	has four $40 controllers for PlayStation 4 or whatever, but I still kind of think controllers
2822860	2826820	should have been an option because I think in some of the more precise things you have
2826820	2831900	to do and you don't know Jack, such as, um, the, the very last round, the Jack attack
2831900	2835260	where you have to be like the first person to push the button when you, like that is
2835260	2836620	skills and reflexes.
2836620	2841300	And unfortunately when you add the lag of cell phone browser into that, it really detracts
2841300	2842300	from the experience.
2842300	2846460	So I think, you know, one feedback I would have for the developers is that I don't think
2846460	2850540	you made the right call in saying tablets only in multiplayer in that.
2850540	2853940	I would love to see controllers or tablets.
2853940	2857460	I mean, that's great for the people who don't have four controllers, but I know what I used
2857460	2861220	to do is I would tell my friends when they came over to play, you don't know Jack, bring
2861220	2864180	your controller and then we don't have that problem.
2864180	2866100	So I just, I would like to see them bring that back.
2866100	2870180	But otherwise I think, I think, uh, I mean, it was what, 25 bucks and you get five games
2870180	2873420	and I think Fibbage and Drawful are definitely the standouts.
2873420	2875900	Word Spud is okay.
2875900	2878300	I didn't, I know you weren't really super into it.
2878300	2880060	It's a very simple idea.
2880060	2884140	It's basically like just chain one word to another and then everybody votes if they like
2884140	2885140	it or not.
2885140	2886660	You know, it's a very simple concept.
2886660	2891660	Um, I just didn't get, not something I think you'll play a bunch, but the other games kind
2891660	2894380	of lifted up where it's like, Oh, this is just a bonus.
2894380	2895380	Absolutely.
2895380	2898380	Um, other games I've played this week, Super Smash Brothers on the Wii U.
2898580	2902980	Um, Oh my God, why did I even buy the 3DS version at this point?
2902980	2906620	Like it's like the three, this is going to sound really harsh and I'm going to get some
2906620	2911700	hate from some fans, but like after playing the Wii U version, the 3DS version is garbage.
2911700	2912920	I'm sorry.
2912920	2913980	That is how I feel.
2913980	2918720	It's like, I cannot go back and play the 3DS version because it's just like, you have this
2918720	2923220	huge experience on the Wii U that looks beautiful.
2923220	2924860	It plays smooth.
2924860	2927340	It is so beautiful to look at and fun.
2927340	2929860	I cannot go back and play it on the 3DS.
2929860	2933380	That just felt like an appetizer for the main course.
2933380	2939900	And just to think, if they had not made the 3DS version, we'd have the ice climbers.
2939900	2940900	Yeah.
2940900	2941900	I don't know.
2941900	2944300	And some will argue with me, well, the 3DS version serves its purpose.
2944300	2945420	It has separate modes.
2945420	2948060	It serves its purpose.
2948060	2950500	You can play a portably.
2950500	2951660	I get all that.
2951660	2952780	That's all fine and good.
2952780	2954660	Yay for you Smash Brothers fans.
2954660	2957640	I'm glad you have a portable version.
2957640	2961140	It's not for the more casual fans.
2961140	2962140	It's not worth it.
2962140	2966820	That's awesome that you have a portable version of your console game experience, or if you
2966820	2971300	know you had made a more powerful handheld system, you might be able to stream it to
2971300	2972300	that console.
2972300	2975180	Like I don't know, the Vita does.
2975180	2978220	Maybe it's for people who don't have Wii U's.
2978220	2979220	Sure.
2979220	2980220	Why not?
2980220	2981220	Are you saying you?
2981220	2982220	Pretty much.
2982220	2983220	I'm their target.
2983220	2985140	You've played the Wii U version.
2985140	2989940	Are you like, I love Smash 3DS, or are you like, hmm, this is a subpar experience?
2989940	2994020	Honestly, when we were playing on Friday, it didn't seem that different.
2994020	2996300	I mean, like we played the new levels.
2996300	2999540	That was fun, I guess, you know, and then the eight player Smash was just, it was a
2999540	3000540	little cray.
3000540	3001900	Like I couldn't see anything.
3001900	3002900	Yeah.
3002900	3004900	The eight player Smash is a little crazy.
3004900	3005900	Level editor.
3005900	3006900	Yeah.
3006900	3007900	There's level.
3007900	3008900	I didn't play around a lot with a level editor yet.
3008900	3011180	I just haven't had the choice, but because there's so much in the game and I realized
3011180	3014380	there's some things that like were in melee that weren't in this, like the whole like
3014380	3018500	story modes and things, which kind of sucks because I did really like that in melee and
3018500	3020980	I don't really care for the board game they put into this.
3020980	3025700	It's not really as rewarding, but there's still like, like to say it's a huge detraction
3025700	3026700	from the game.
3026700	3028820	There's so much other shit in there.
3028820	3035780	Like the home run challenges, the Mii battles, the classic mode where you fight the master
3035780	3039940	hand at the end and all that and all these other, you know, meta games they have in it.
3039940	3045620	You know, it's still a very rich experience, but I was perfectly content just playing the
3045620	3048380	main Smash mode over and over and over again as we were doing on Friday night.
3048380	3049380	I had a lot of fun.
3049380	3050380	Right.
3050380	3051380	Right.
3051380	3054020	And that's why I think it's not, I'm not so sad that I don't have the Wii U version because
3054020	3059260	it's like, you know, this is cool, but it's not like, I'm not sad that I don't have it
3059260	3060260	or anything.
3060260	3064020	So that's, well, that's, that's probably Nintendo wants you to be a little sad because they
3064020	3065540	do want to sell more Wii U's.
3065540	3066540	So sure.
3066540	3067540	But I mean, it wasn't enough.
3067540	3068540	I mean, I don't know.
3068540	3069540	That's fair.
3070140	3073220	All right, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3073220	3077780	Act F says the 3DS version is great for what it is, but the Wii U version definitely blows
3077780	3079260	it off the water.
3079260	3080260	Uh, let's see.
3080260	3084220	Black Wolf points out the 3DS can be used as a controller for the Wii U version and
3084220	3086900	you need the 3DS game to do so.
3086900	3088540	That part was awfully convenient.
3088540	3093360	Well, that's at least one way to play the better version on the 3DS.
3093360	3097780	But that actually did end up being very convenient because like all I have here are Wiimotes.
3097820	3101900	You know, we have like the Wii U game pad is it, but I was like, Irene, Nathan, bring
3101900	3105820	your 3DS's and then you guys have controllers and that actually worked out pretty well.
3105820	3106820	Yeah.
3106820	3108380	And I was already used to controlling with it.
3108380	3109380	So it's perfect.
3109380	3110380	Yeah.
3110380	3113140	And Nathan was able to get his custom scheme or whatever he has that he does.
3113140	3114660	You were telling me not to let him do that.
3114660	3115660	And I did.
3115660	3116660	And then he beat our ass.
3116660	3117660	Yeah.
3117660	3118660	Oh, well.
3118660	3119660	Told you.
3119660	3120660	Uh, amiibo integration.
3120660	3124080	Um, I did buy three that I bought my three amiibos.
3124080	3128760	I have, uh, Mario, Peach and Samus, which good, good, good choices.
3128760	3132560	Although I kind of wish I bought link kind of wish I bought link instead of Mario, but
3132560	3133560	that's all right.
3133560	3134560	Yeah.
3134560	3141640	Um, I, the figures are well-crafted and I think the figures sit well on a display as
3141640	3144400	for the way they're integrated into the games.
3144400	3145400	Yeah.
3145400	3147480	I kind of take it or leave it.
3147480	3152080	Like if you haven't seen it yet, you, what you do, you take your amiibo and you can tap
3152080	3156980	it to the Wii U game pad and it enters the game as basically a computer controlled character.
3156980	3161760	But it's a special character that levels up the more you beat up on it and it learns from
3161760	3163480	you the way you beat up on it.
3163480	3166160	If you tend to block attacks, they'll learn to block attacks.
3166160	3169520	If you tend to do more of X than Y, they'll do more of X than Y.
3169520	3173160	So they start to take after you and they get a mind of their own and you can level them
3173160	3174960	all the way up to level 50.
3174960	3179320	Why you would do that, I'm not, that's the part I'm not understanding.
3179320	3180320	Why?
3180560	3184240	Ultimately the goal of leveling them to 50, and I'm sure some of the Smashaholics out
3184240	3188680	there will be like, well, you can do a mode where it's you and your amiibo versus a friend
3188680	3190320	and your friend's amiibo.
3190320	3194840	And you know, you could have the amiibos fight each other to have like an amiibo style tournament.
3194840	3199660	And I'm kind of sitting here going, I, I think, I think you're stretching a little bit with
3199660	3201200	those functionalities.
3201200	3206200	Those are a bit of a stretch from what the game is really about, which is beating up
3206200	3208040	on your friends.
3208080	3212920	But the figures are nice and I sort of go, okay, if they get you little perks in games,
3212920	3214160	then that's kind of neat too.
3214160	3217480	I get a little extra outfit in Mario Kart, all right, cool.
3217480	3220360	I get some extra weapons in Hyrule Warriors, cute.
3220360	3224680	You know, I like that they at least function in more than one game, but I really think
3224680	3229540	if you're going to obsessively collect these amiibo, I hope you like the figures because
3229540	3235800	what they're going to do for you in the game, I, you could get one amiibo and kind of get
3235800	3238320	a good enough taste of what they're going to do in the various games.
3238320	3239320	You know what I mean?
3239320	3244480	So are, do they have any plans to make any amiibos-centric games where you need to have
3244480	3246800	the amiibos to play?
3246800	3249040	Wait for Pokemon Wii U, I'm sure.
3249040	3250160	Yeah, probably.
3250160	3251600	I'm sure that is coming.
3251600	3253880	I just don't know what it is.
3253880	3256080	I would be very curious.
3256080	3258800	Here's something not a lot of people have been asking this question, but I'm going to,
3258800	3260600	I'm going to ask it out here.
3260600	3265600	What is the amiibo implementation going to look like in Splatoon?
3265600	3270520	Because I could see that game really doing something with this, where you start to put
3270520	3276360	the characters in Splatoon and maybe they are again doing some type of level up or something.
3276360	3279480	I would like to see something, I don't know if Nintendo is ever going to build this, I'd
3279480	3284600	like to see something where I level up my character in Mario, or excuse me, I level
3284600	3289700	up my character in Smash, and now when I use that amiibo in Splatoon, because it's leveled
3289700	3292740	up in Smash, it can do this.
3293020	3297900	And something where the amiibos kind of become this personal achievement gallery, if that
3297900	3301380	makes sense, and the more I've played these other games and leveled up in other games,
3301380	3302740	the more it's going to do for me elsewhere.
3302740	3306420	I would really love to see Nintendo to go down a path like that.
3306420	3310500	Not going to hold my breath, but that would be my, you know, how could they make this
3310500	3313540	even more exciting?
3313540	3315820	Give me more of a reason to level my amiibos to 50.
3315820	3319060	Right, I was actually just going to say that, because were you the one that was mentioning
3319060	3323300	that if you get your amiibo to level 50, it's as strong as a level 9 CPU?
3323300	3324300	I think stronger.
3324300	3325300	Stronger than a level 9.
3325300	3331380	So I can see doing that, you know, but aside from that in other games, your amiibo is not
3331380	3337300	going to really grant you any more power than other players, is it?
3337300	3341100	It's just giving you extra perks, like fun, like you said, extra outfits and stuff like
3341100	3342100	that.
3342100	3344780	It's like a little custom character that, it's like a pet.
3344780	3347080	It's a pet rock.
3347120	3349320	It takes after some of your features, you know what I mean?
3349320	3351000	And they're how much each?
3351000	3352120	$12.
3352120	3356320	And how many are they planning to release total?
3356320	3360260	Don't quote me on this, but it looks like one for every character in Smash Brothers.
3360260	3361800	That's the way it's going right now.
3361800	3364200	So every character in Smash Brothers will have one.
3364200	3368240	So do you think this is more of like a hardcore collector kind of a thing or do you think
3368240	3370960	this is ever going to appeal to like the general market?
3370960	3371960	I think it's both.
3371960	3375600	I think it's a hardcore collector thing and it's the general market because mommy, mommy,
3375600	3376600	I want the Mario.
3376600	3377600	Mommy, mommy, I want the peach.
3377600	3378600	Mommy, mommy.
3378600	3379600	I think that's...
3379600	3383200	Oh, you think the mommy, mommy stuffs, you know, are bad with, you know, I've been hearing
3383200	3384200	all these stories of these.
3384200	3385200	Well, and daddy, daddy too.
3385200	3388880	Well, no, I've been hearing all these stories of like, these are sold out at all these stores
3388880	3389880	and stuff.
3389880	3392760	I'm like, it boggles my mind why?
3392760	3394920	I mean, yes, I understand that it's Mario.
3394920	3395920	Cool.
3395920	3396920	Okay.
3396920	3397920	It's Mario.
3397920	3401160	But the functionality with the games that support it right now is kind of, eh, I mean,
3401160	3405840	it's just, it's very, it's not like Skylanders or something where at least those characters
3405840	3408840	can actually fucking play them.
3408840	3412480	It's a unique experience where it's like, Ooh, AI character, who gives a shit?
3412480	3419480	Did you read that fucking fan wank on a news site that I will not name, but it was a shapely
3419480	3426120	article on why Disney should buy Nintendo.
3426120	3431400	And it read like, like fucking fanfic that I was reading on this site because I'm like,
3431400	3434520	Disney's never going to buy Nintendo and Nintendo's gonna never let themselves be bought by Disney.
3434520	3436380	But anyway, I'm getting beside the point.
3436380	3442520	The only thing in it that made sense was Disney would want Nintendo because Nintendo has strong
3442520	3451640	characters that 20 and 30 year olds are very attached to, which, you know, Disney has a
3451640	3456960	lot of characters that people are attached to as well, but some could argue that they
3456960	3460120	target a different generation than Nintendo gets.
3460120	3462240	Well, no, I mean, you're right.
3462240	3465840	20 and 30 year olds are very strongly attached to it, but also children of this era.
3465840	3466840	Oh yeah.
3466840	3467840	Absolutely.
3467840	3470080	Because the 20 and 30 year olds pass them on to their kids.
3470080	3471080	Exactly.
3471080	3472080	Absolutely.
3472080	3477080	So that was my long winded answer to your question was that, uh, it's the characters,
3477080	3478520	the characters are so strong.
3478520	3479520	It's the same.
3479520	3484200	How do people want toys from the latest Disney or Pixar movie that they see that don't do
3484200	3487360	anything but have a swinging arm, you know, or something like that?
3487360	3489360	The arm swing?
3489360	3490360	Sometimes.
3490360	3491360	Depends.
3491360	3492360	Anyway.
3492360	3493360	All right.
3493360	3494360	Uh, wow.
3494360	3495360	Sorry.
3495360	3498080	I have talked a lot about my gaming, but it was just a lot to play.
3498080	3499640	I didn't even get in a little big planet three.
3499640	3502440	I played little big planet three.
3502440	3507600	They have some new mechanics like the, uh, the gun that sucks and blows.
3507600	3509720	Can I think of that scene from Wayne's world?
3509720	3511800	She's gone from suck to blow.
3511800	3512800	That's not from Wayne's world.
3512800	3514080	That's from space ball.
3514080	3515640	Oh, what's from space balls?
3515640	3516640	Why did I know?
3516640	3519640	Uh, what was this haircut?
3519640	3523400	Yeah, it certainly does suck or I don't know, whatever, whatever.
3523400	3524400	Anyway.
3524400	3526280	So that whole thing.
3526280	3527280	Yeah.
3527280	3529520	The new guns and the new elements that they do, they have that and they have like the
3529520	3535040	portal esque kind of gun that fires a ball and if you fire it into a certain shape, uh,
3535040	3536720	it will port you there.
3536720	3539080	And so, okay, that's all good, but what does this all end up being?
3539080	3543800	This is stuff to put on the canvas for the level creators where the really strong content
3543800	3544800	is going to come out.
3544800	3546640	So I'm really excited to see what people develop with this.
3546640	3550360	I'm enjoying little big planet so far, but holy shit, we're an hour into the show.
3550360	3554280	We haven't even touched the news yet, so, uh, let me get to Irene quickly and your gaming
3554280	3556800	week and anything you want to share with listeners tonight on what you've been playing.
3556800	3557960	We already talked about it.
3557960	3559280	Jackbox and Smash Brothers.
3559280	3560280	Okay.
3560280	3561280	Yeah.
3561280	3562280	There you go.
3562280	3563280	Well, thank you.
3563280	3565280	You're, you're giving up your segment essentially to help us save on time.
3565320	3566800	I think we already talked about it, so.
3566800	3567800	That's true.
3567800	3568800	We did.
3568800	3569800	All right.
3569800	3570800	Uh, let's see.
3570800	3571800	Let's see.
3571800	3575760	Uh, Alan Alchemy says it's sucking my will to live was the Wayne's World thing.
3575760	3576760	That's it.
3576760	3577760	Sucking my will to live.
3577760	3578760	That's it.
3578760	3579760	All right.
3579760	3583440	Um, let's get into, uh, some housekeeping real quick.
3583440	3589200	Uh, if you missed the announcement last week, we will be doing our show on December 7th.
3589200	3591640	That's in two weeks at a special time.
3591640	3597280	That show will be broadcasting at noon Pacific time, three Eastern time, eight o'clock for
3597280	3602160	those of you guys in the UK, uh, for what is that called UTC or whatever that is.
3602160	3606640	Um, so we're doing that because Jamie and I have an event we want to attend, uh, personal
3606640	3611320	later in the evening, but we thought it's a good, Oh, two for one shot because our overseas
3611320	3613840	listeners sometimes say, when are you going to do a show that we can participate with
3613840	3614840	and we can call into?
3614840	3615840	So here's your chance.
3615840	3619640	December 7th, that will be broadcast, uh, much earlier in the day.
3619640	3623240	Um, but certainly I'm not saying only UK people can participate.
3623240	3624240	Absolutely not.
3624240	3627640	Uh, if you happen to be around at noon or three o'clock or whatever, then by all means
3627640	3629500	listen and give us call and all that good stuff.
3629500	3633560	So we will be doing that, uh, in a couple of weeks or if you're not, it'll be rebroadcast
3633560	3634560	of the regular time.
3634560	3635560	That's right.
3635560	3637040	It'll be rebroadcast to the regular time, right after Bobby black Wolf.
3637040	3640960	So however, however you or, and it will be on the podcast feed for those of you guys
3640960	3642440	that are like, I don't do live shows.
3642440	3644040	I don't, I don't do live pod.
3644040	3647600	I need you on Monday to get me through workday, then we'll be there for you too.
3647600	3648600	All right.
3648600	3650480	Uh, let's get into some news already.
3650480	3651480	Holy moly.
3651480	3652480	Busy, busy week.
3652480	3653480	Loki.
3653480	3654480	Yes.
3654480	3659640	So busy week also for, um, Activision and blizzard world of Warcraft, um, has been having
3659640	3663080	a little bit of issues, especially right after the release of warlords of Draenor.
3663080	3666520	They had people DDOS in their servers.
3666520	3669760	They had, you know, just Q problems.
3669760	3674720	So they finally decided, Hey, you know what, we're going to address this.
3674720	3678640	Um, you know, basically saying, you know, the quality of the content does not excuse
3678640	3681440	the subpar launch experience we delivered.
3681440	3682960	And I apologize for that.
3682960	3688020	And that's J Allen Brack, the executive producer of world of Warcraft.
3688020	3691880	And basically saying, you know what, uh, we're making things better.
3691880	3698040	We're working on reducing, you know, the cues and the compensate people for their troubles.
3698040	3700760	We're going to give you a five days a game time.
3700760	3703160	So that's pretty nice.
3703720	3709760	At least they're fixing that and, uh, apparently doing pretty well, especially, um, back up
3709760	3714320	to 10 million subscribers after the launch of the newest expansion.
3714320	3716520	So, so how about that?
3716520	3719700	3.3 million copies day one.
3719700	3721120	So they're back up to 10 million.
3721120	3725880	They were down to like seven, four, seven, six somewhere I heard was the last number.
3725880	3727860	And now they're up to 10 million.
3727860	3731440	So that whole peer pressure thing we talked about earlier and the feeling of it's, it's
3731440	3732440	working a lot.
3732560	3736800	I'd be curious though, you know, I granted there are 10 million right now, but how quickly
3736800	3739600	are they going to get through all that content and just, you know, is it going to be three
3739600	3742820	months from now that they're back down to, you know, they're going to see that drop again?
3742820	3748120	I think that's a very fair question to ask because Blizzard has really said nothing about
3748120	3751760	patches and what else is to be looking forward to.
3751760	3755720	I think they're going to save a lot of that this time for just when people are starting
3755720	3760000	to feel burned out a little bit and they're obviously they're slowly rolling out content.
3760000	3761160	That's what they do now.
3761160	3762720	Like the raid isn't out yet.
3762720	3766860	The raid launches, I think next week, don't quote me on these dates, but I think the raid
3766860	3772240	launches next week for the normal raid and then the mythic, which is their new heroic
3772240	3778200	or however it all breaks down, that is out in two weeks and the LFR happens then too,
3778200	3780820	but you can only do one part of the raid in LFR.
3780820	3785760	The rest of LFR opens up over the course of like four more weeks or something like that,
3785760	3788640	which it makes sense the way they're doing it.
3788640	3791000	I can't really fault them for the way they're slowly rolling out.
3791000	3793000	And I think it does take a lot of that pressure off.
3793000	3795240	Like I got to level up to on her tonight.
3795240	3798000	I've got to do it tonight so I can raid with the people or I'm going to get left out in
3798000	3799000	the cold.
3799000	3800000	Right.
3800000	3801000	Like thankfully they don't do that anymore.
3801000	3802080	Uh, so I'm okay with that.
3802080	3806640	But yeah, I mean, Loki, what is it going to look like in three months once a lot of people
3806640	3807640	have gone through the raid?
3807640	3808640	I don't know.
3808640	3813640	Well, and also the fact that a lot of the time, um, that was, you know, cause they have
3813640	3815600	that token to level you up.
3815600	3818120	Remember to, I forget what it was now.
3818120	3821480	The boost to 60 or the boost to 90, excuse me, boost to 90 or something.
3821480	3823740	So that's going to take a lot of the grinding time out.
3823740	3827560	So it's going to kind of quickly, you know, it's going to make the game go a little bit
3827560	3828560	quicker for you.
3828560	3831920	So I don't know if that's, you know, a great thing.
3831920	3836560	So many of those people have so many alts already at 90 because of Pandaria's drought.
3836560	3839040	I think they're probably not as worried about it.
3839040	3842580	I think it's interesting though that out of 10 million subscribers, only 3.3 million bought
3842580	3843840	the expansion.
3843840	3847960	But one thing to consider that number is from the first 24 hours or something like that.
3847960	3852360	And it doesn't include China, which you probably can figure half those subscribers in the 10
3852360	3857000	million are China, Asia, and other regions that don't have that expansion yet.
3857000	3861360	So 3.3 out of 5 million makes a lot more sense because I know not everybody jumps on board
3861360	3862360	with the expansion.
3862360	3865020	And also not everyone's going to jump aboard the first 24 hours and people got to wait
3865020	3866020	for paychecks.
3866020	3867020	Exactly, exactly.
3867020	3868020	So that makes a lot more sense.
3868020	3869020	And you consider that.
3869020	3871540	But when I first heard there's numbers, I was like, why did only a third of the players
3871540	3872540	buy the expansion?
3872540	3874800	Oh, it didn't come out in China at the same time.
3874800	3875800	Got it.
3875800	3883840	So yeah, wow, it looks like the expansion is doing very well for them.
3883840	3887400	If you really want to push me over the edge, Blizzard, because here I am looking, all my
3887400	3891940	friends are playing, wow, maybe I should play some wow.
3891940	3894880	Tell me what the patches are going to look like and what there is to look forward to
3894880	3897240	and what my money's really going to end up buying.
3897240	3902220	Because if you can kind of get that one, I don't know what it is that would be that key
3902220	3903600	thing that would bring me back.
3903600	3905560	Maybe that level syncing I've always talked about.
3905560	3907640	I don't know why they don't do it.
3907640	3911280	Or maybe more five man dungeons will get me really excited.
3911280	3913760	That's probably going to send me over the edge and I'll do it.
3913760	3915640	I'll go back to wow.
3915640	3918760	I don't know what exactly is happening with Warlords of Draenor.
3918760	3920400	I haven't watched any trailers.
3920400	3923880	I haven't really heard anybody talk about it to me because I'm not interested in wow.
3923880	3928320	But have they talked about some of the ways that this expansion is going to be different
3928320	3930600	from the last couple of expansions that they've had?
3930600	3931600	Last few?
3931640	3937720	They've been pushing like the garrisons, which is, you know, the new, it's their new profession
3937720	3943540	basically, but they don't frame it as a profession, but you know, the garrisons and it's a return.
3943540	3948000	It's let's do the time warp again, because they're going back to Burning Crusade to fix
3948000	3949800	a timeline or something like that.
3949800	3955280	So it's, you know, a whole time travel thing that they're doing.
3955280	3960200	And then they simply took a lot of talents out is my understanding.
3960240	3963980	Now Blizzard had to simplify their own MMO to make it more accessible.
3963980	3964980	But you know what?
3964980	3965980	That's good.
3965980	3968040	They were just getting too disparate with their stuff.
3968040	3972200	And that's kind of what I mean is not in terms of what they're adding, but like how they're
3972200	3978680	making the gameplay experience different from what were very mediocre expansions.
3978680	3981120	And they did the squish, the item squish.
3981120	3982120	Yeah.
3982120	3983120	That happened.
3983120	3988640	So now, you know, the math and all that isn't so obscene with how much stats everything
3988640	3990280	was.
3990280	3991880	But I haven't heard a lot about PvP.
3991880	3994300	I didn't hear about any new Battlegrounds or anything like that.
3994300	3997040	But one thing Pandaria did have like two or three new Battlegrounds.
3997040	3998760	There's a lot of Battlegrounds in WoW.
3998760	4000100	I kind of miss them.
4000100	4005680	Like I actually really enjoyed the PvP game in WoW, which is weird because I don't usually
4005680	4009260	super get into PvP, but some of those Battlegrounds are really fun.
4009260	4013680	Like I know you hated it, but I loved Isle of Conquest, which is a lot of fun.
4013680	4015240	That new one they put in really wasn't bad.
4015240	4016240	I don't remember the name of it.
4016240	4017440	It was the very last one they did.
4017440	4018960	The Goblin Mines or something.
4018960	4020240	No, there was a Goblin Mine.
4020240	4021240	That was one.
4021240	4022240	Then there was like another one.
4022240	4023240	Anyway.
4023240	4024240	Sorry.
4024240	4025240	It's been a while.
4025240	4027440	But yeah, there's a lot of fun PvP in there.
4027440	4028440	Right.
4028440	4031440	I mean, they don't need to change anything really with their Battlegrounds.
4031440	4032440	I feel like.
4032440	4034360	I mean, they can stop making new ones.
4034360	4038080	I mean, the people that like for me, when I was PvPing, I did Gulch all the time.
4038080	4039400	I sometimes did Basin.
4039400	4041640	I don't need them to reinvent the wheel for me.
4041640	4043400	I'm playing them because I like it how it is.
4043400	4047120	And it doesn't get old for me because it's playing against other people that's making
4047120	4048200	it new every time.
4048200	4049480	So I don't know.
4049480	4050480	Yeah.
4050480	4053400	And like as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, it really doesn't have a strong PvP game right
4053400	4054400	now.
4054400	4058640	They have like one arena and they have something called Cartno Flats or Frontlines, which is
4058640	4061960	sort of Arathi Basin, sort of.
4061960	4068520	But the weird twist on Final Fantasy 14 is that it's three factions, not two.
4068520	4072680	So it's everything is now is like 3v3 or whatever you call it.
4072680	4073680	Right.
4073680	4074680	Kind of puts a new twist on it.
4074680	4075680	Interesting.
4075680	4076680	Very interesting.
4077240	4082480	So, I mean, a lot of the PvPers are just they're playing the MOBAs now, so they don't really
4082480	4084360	need that from WoW.
4084360	4088400	Rama in our chat is asking, wait, when did this become WoW Lounge Radio?
4088400	4090080	Hey, you know what?
4090080	4094040	Because 10 million people are playing World of Warcraft right now.
4094040	4095040	It's kind of big news.
4095040	4097040	What happens when you miss an episode of...
4097040	4099040	Take an episode of Warhouse off.
4099040	4100040	All right.
4100040	4101040	All right.
4101040	4102040	Look, you want to hear consoles?
4102040	4103040	I'll tell you consoles.
4103040	4104040	Here's the thing.
4104040	4105240	Your Sony information is safe.
4105240	4106240	That's the news.
4106800	4112080	There was news out there that apparently about 2,000 PlayStation Network logins had been
4112080	4113080	hacked.
4113080	4117360	But Sony has responded saying, we've investigated the claims that our network was breached and
4117360	4120560	have found no evidence that there was any intrusion into our network.
4120560	4124440	Unfortunately, Internet fraud, including phishing and password matching, are realities that
4124440	4127180	consumers and online networks face on a regular basis.
4127180	4131280	We take these reports very seriously and continue to monitor our network closely.
4131320	4136640	Apparently, a group did take responsibility finally for, speaking of World of Warcraft,
4136640	4142160	the denial of service attacks that were happening on Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV were also
4142160	4145480	claiming to have obtained this information.
4145480	4147160	But Sony saying there is no...
4147160	4148160	Move along.
4148160	4149160	Nothing to see here.
4149160	4150280	That's what Sony is saying.
4150280	4153160	I still think this is just a good reminder.
4153160	4158520	Use a different password on these technical sites than you would use in other places.
4158520	4164880	Because this Sony, Blizzard, Square Enix now, apparently, Microsoft, all of them are
4164880	4165880	targets.
4165880	4167720	And two-step authentication when you can.
4167720	4169940	When you can have two-step authentication, absolutely.
4169940	4173400	Your email is a must.
4173400	4176160	Because if somebody gets control of your email, that's it.
4176160	4177160	You're done.
4177160	4178400	They can get anything else.
4178400	4180080	Your banking, whatever else.
4180080	4182320	Get two-step authentication on your email if nothing else.
4182320	4186560	So just a friendly little reminder from us here at Orange Launch Radio, because we don't
4186560	4189320	want dickbags to steal your information.
4189320	4191040	Your information is important to us.
4191040	4192040	Thanks, Rob.
4192040	4193040	You're welcome.
4193040	4194040	Anytime.
4194040	4195040	That's what we're here.
4195040	4196040	We're your friends.
4196040	4197040	Loki.
4197040	4198040	So this is pretty sweet.
4198040	4199040	There's a new Kickstarter.
4199040	4200040	Yeah, I know.
4200040	4201040	Another Kickstarter for another game.
4201040	4203920	But this is awesome because it's Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick.
4203920	4209860	They're doing a brand new Maniac Mansion-style adventure game, and it looks straight up like
4209860	4210860	Maniac Mansion.
4210860	4215120	I mean, the old-school LucasArts point-and-click adventure game.
4215120	4223400	It's called Thimbleweed Park, and it's Brainiac Branchin'.
4223400	4225700	It looks awesome.
4225700	4227160	So go check it out.
4227160	4228600	They're going to pretty much hit their funding.
4228600	4236300	They're already at $355,000 of their $375,000 goal, and they have 24 days to go, so there's
4236300	4238600	pretty much no chance that they're not going to.
4238600	4239600	It's going to happen.
4239600	4240600	Interesting.
4240600	4243640	People really longing for those 2D adventure games.
4243640	4247400	I remember at some point people tried to say that genre was dead, and then Telltale
4247400	4252600	puts out all these award-winning games, and fans are doing these 2D.
4252600	4254760	This genre is not dead.
4254760	4256400	People still love this stuff.
4256400	4259780	Just the art style and everything looks just like...
4259780	4263920	It's straight up out of the 90s.
4263920	4268600	They even have a little animated image here.
4268600	4275120	It looks like they'll use balloon animal with corpse.
4275120	4277760	You can try all those things, and it's awesome.
4277760	4281600	And who wouldn't try to use a balloon animal with a corpse, really?
4281600	4283920	This is getting into awkward time.
4283920	4286920	It's pretty awesome, and some of the rewards.
4286920	4288520	Let's see here what they're giving away.
4288520	4290720	$20 gets you the game.
4290720	4295680	If you want to spend more than $20, it looks like $30, or $25.
4295680	4301560	$25 is the I-pirated maniac mansion in Monkey Island when I was a kid, and I feel bad.
4301560	4306320	This reward tier instantly absolves you of all guilt, including the theming part game.
4306320	4307800	That's kind of funny.
4307800	4312200	Subsequent tiers also include guilt absolution.
4312200	4313360	That's awesome.
4313360	4314360	That's awesome.
4314360	4318280	Looking at our chat, Dungeon Buster says, CinnaWear is also doing a Kickstarter for
4318280	4322400	an HD version of Rocket Ranger with new gameplay bits.
4322400	4327840	Just tell me when they start Kickstarting a new Legend of Chirandia, all right?
4327840	4330120	Seriously, that would be awesome.
4330120	4333160	Game Guru says, donate to this game or the hamster gets microwaved.
4333160	4334480	That was my favorite part.
4334480	4335480	Yep.
4335480	4336480	Oh boy.
4336480	4337480	That's awesome.
4337480	4338480	That's a dark place.
4338480	4339480	Let's see.
4339480	4345200	SSJ100Matt says, I think people just desire the old days where that quote, not the greatest
4345200	4348160	game of all time, Super Metroid ruled.
4348160	4350680	Why did you put that in quotes that it's not the greatest game of all time?
4350680	4352600	Because it is the greatest game of all time.
4352600	4357960	Who would dare argue with that sound logic?
4357960	4364400	It's because games like Maniac Mansion and Secret of Monkey Island and stuff are just
4364400	4365400	timeless.
4365400	4368120	They're just greatly written games.
4368120	4372760	And also, even though that one bullet point was supposed to be funny about the piracy,
4372760	4375280	it really unveiled it there.
4375280	4378280	Absolve yourself of the guilt from being a kid.
4378280	4379920	Hey, kid.
4379960	4383200	Now that you have a job to make money, give me your money.
4383200	4384200	Right.
4384200	4385200	Right.
4385200	4386200	I mean, that's a big part of it.
4386200	4387200	It's stuff we remember.
4387200	4390080	Hey, back in those days, it was difficult to pirate games.
4390080	4393200	You had to rip apart those disks.
4393200	4395040	And I'm not talking about the actual floppy disks.
4395040	4399840	I'm talking about the code disks that you had to turn and match up the phrases in order
4399840	4401320	to photocopy this.
4401320	4404840	Or I had to call my friend and be like, all right, get out the box.
4404840	4405840	Turn to page 24.
4405840	4406840	All right.
4406840	4409600	What's the third word in the second paragraph?
4409600	4414080	You know what we're talking about, though?
4414080	4415080	Come on.
4415080	4416080	I do.
4416080	4417080	I do.
4417080	4418080	That's why I say it.
4418080	4422040	Or one of my favorites was covert action, where it was like, you had the page of the
4422040	4425080	mugshots and you had to be like, which one is this operative?
4425080	4427800	And if you get it wrong, the game would be like super hard.
4427800	4432000	You can do anything in it and make good times with copy protection.
4432000	4433000	Good times.
4433000	4434000	Do you have any copy protection memories?
4434000	4435000	No.
4435160	4437720	Moving right along.
4437720	4439720	Space Quest 4, I remember.
4439720	4443440	And because I actually did buy the game and I had the manual and sometimes I'd still get
4443440	4445880	it wrong.
4445880	4450560	Mine was Leisure Suit Larry, the remake that they did, because you had to answer trivia
4450560	4453160	questions to get into the game.
4453160	4454160	And they were quite...
4454160	4457640	It wasn't really copy protection, but it was making sure you were of age.
4457640	4461040	And so it would ask you questions that only somebody in their 20s or 30s know the answers
4461040	4462040	to.
4462040	4463040	But we got them all right.
4463040	4464040	We'd be like 13.
4464080	4465080	We get them all right.
4465080	4467320	It's like, yeah, we're going to see some pixelated titties.
4467320	4469640	Why were you excited?
4469640	4472520	I don't know, because everybody likes titties.
4472520	4474520	Yeah, pixel tits.
4474520	4477480	That'll be the sequel.
4477480	4484800	At the top of part B, by the way, I've got to ask you about last week's show and this
4484800	4488600	whole pixel shit phenomenon, but we'll save that for later.
4488600	4493320	Anyway, let's get into another story, and this one is about the game Evolve, which a
4493320	4495040	lot of people are looking forward to.
4495040	4498360	This is that whole four versus one game.
4498360	4499960	Lots of people looking forward to this.
4499960	4505360	And some folks are going to be very happy to hear that DLC maps in Evolve, they will
4505360	4507560	be available for free.
4507560	4512640	And this is to ensure that you don't have one person who doesn't have the maps.
4512640	4516320	They're not able to play multiplayer matches with other people or getting kicked out of
4516320	4518600	public rooms because they don't have a certain map.
4518600	4521660	So they just decided, you know what, we're going to make the maps free.
4521660	4525000	So that's always nice to hear about free DLC.
4525000	4529680	But just so you know, Evolve will have some other pay DLC.
4529680	4534760	For example, you're going to have characters and monsters that are pay DLC.
4534760	4539380	But the good news is, even if you didn't buy them, if your friend did, you'll be able to
4539380	4540780	play against them.
4540780	4541780	And that's alright.
4541780	4545340	I mean, we were playing Mario Kart 8, I didn't even talk about it during the game, we were
4545340	4547620	playing Mario Kart 8 with Extrovert online, right?
4547620	4550020	He has not bought the DLC pack.
4550180	4555900	We were able to still pick Tanooki, Mario, and Zelda, and Link from Zelda, and he was
4555900	4557460	able to see them in the race.
4557460	4561100	We couldn't do the new tracks, but we could do the new characters.
4561100	4562940	So it's kind of like something similar with that.
4562940	4563940	So, yeah.
4563940	4564940	Alright.
4564940	4565940	Good times.
4565940	4566940	Good times.
4566940	4569540	So that is Evolve and DLC.
4571540	4575460	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at bognetwork.com,
4575460	4576940	use the passphrase, pumpkin.
4576940	4580780	Alright, we are going to now travel around the world and check out some release dates
4580780	4584740	and see what is coming to a gaming store near you.
4584740	4588900	Ah, well after last week, you would think that there would be a ton.
4588900	4589900	But no.
4589900	4591860	Actually, it's died down to nothing again.
4591860	4595340	We're back in the drought, thankfully.
4595340	4599660	So this week, we have Akiba's trip undead and undressed for PlayStation 4, which I'm
4599660	4603900	actually thinking about picking up, because, I don't know, I need more PlayStation 4 games.
4603900	4606140	Maybe I should get Far Cry instead.
4606140	4613820	Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth on 3DS, and that's literally it.
4613820	4615820	Just those two games.
4615820	4617460	I guess it's slowing down a little bit now.
4617460	4618460	Quite a bit, yeah.
4618460	4621540	Once we get into December, it's going to be dead.
4621540	4622540	Yeah.
4622540	4625620	Geometry Wars is the big thing I'm looking forward to this week, but that's all online.
4625620	4626620	Yeah.
4626620	4627620	Right.
4627620	4629660	Which, if we go over to Europe, I'll do this out of order here a little bit.
4629660	4631280	We'll go to Europe and look at the releases there.
4631280	4635740	In fact, Geometry Wars is out this week on the 26th on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox
4635740	4637540	360, and PlayStation 3.
4637540	4642420	LittleBigPlanet gets its release overseas in the UK, also on the 26th of November.
4642420	4647940	On the 27th of November, Raven's Cry hits the Mac and PC platforms, and the delayed
4647940	4654580	for Europe, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Pokemon Omega Ruby make their way on the 28th of November.
4654580	4659660	That was the slap on the hand to the entire country for leaking X and Y earlier.
4659660	4661220	Remember that?
4661220	4666540	X and Y got leaked early in Europe, and it was a Europe store that had put it, so Nintendo
4666540	4669860	punished the whole country by putting it out a week later there.
4669860	4672940	So that'll teach you to leak a game early.
4672940	4675820	Do not fuck with them, man.
4675820	4676820	They're a force to be reckoned with.
4676820	4680420	I know a lot of players overseas eagerly awaiting that.
4680420	4682300	Let's talk about Japan.
4682300	4685880	Dragon Age Inquisition gets its Japanese release on the PlayStation 4.
4685880	4689200	I don't know if that's localized or if that's with, like, subtitles or something.
4689200	4690200	It doesn't really say.
4690200	4694200	I would imagine this is a subtitled version, but it is available for the PlayStation 4
4694200	4697600	in regular and deluxe edition on November 27th.
4697600	4703320	Simply Series G4U Volume 1, the Mahjong, is also out on November 27th, because I know
4703320	4705160	y'all love Mahjong.
4705160	4709520	Little Big Planet 3, oops, sorry, that is somehow a Europe date snuck its way on my
4709520	4710640	list there.
4710640	4717040	But NBA 2K15 is something you can check out in Japan also on November 27th.
4717040	4720380	Many of those same games on the Xbox One this week, including Dragon Age Inquisition
4720380	4722160	and NBA 2K15.
4722160	4727820	Microsoft Xbox One's edition comes out on a disc version in Japan this week.
4727820	4732020	There's also some new game pads, some black and blue Hori pads if you want to check those
4732020	4734320	out in Japan.
4734320	4740200	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard HD Remaster, which of course is Resident Evil,
4740200	4742000	that is releasing this week.
4742000	4746160	There's also a collector's package and something called an eCapcom Complete Edition.
4746160	4749320	Dragon Age Inquisition also on the PlayStation 3.
4749320	4754160	I had no idea that Inquisition was also on last generation's consoles.
4754160	4755800	That blew me away.
4755800	4761120	If it's buggy on the new ones, I can only imagine what the old ones look like, sorry.
4761120	4763800	Buyer beware.
4763800	4770740	Let's see, on the Xbox 360, Dragon Age Inquisition, as well as Sakura Flamingo Archives.
4770740	4775240	Your guess is as good as mine as to what that's on, like Flamingo Festival, I don't know.
4775240	4782900	On the Wii U this week, Gotouchi Setsudo, Gotouchi Chara no Nihon Zenkoku no Tabi comes
4782900	4789040	out this week, which is, I'm trying to see if this is a series I recognize.
4789040	4795640	This looks like a Mario Party-esque kind of game, but these are not characters I recognize,
4795640	4799960	so it might be tied into like a Japanese TV show or something like that.
4799960	4803720	Oh, they have a little trailer, I did not realize that.
4803720	4804720	Let's take a look.
4804720	4805720	Yeah, it's...
4805720	4816440	It's always better when you yell it, that's right.
4816440	4820040	There's like trains in Japan.
4820040	4824360	Yeah, it's Mario Party, that's what it is basically.
4824360	4829400	All right, so that is what you have to look forward to on the Wii U this week.
4829400	4831000	So there you go with the releases.
4831000	4834640	We're going to get into a few more stories here in the classic game of the week, but
4834640	4838240	I thought I would say hello to, just walked into the studio here.
4838240	4839640	Hello Jonas, welcome back.
4839640	4840640	Hello.
4840640	4841640	You're here again.
4841640	4843200	I'm going to start charging, I'm just kidding.
4843200	4844200	How you doing?
4844200	4846480	I actually did fine, sorry, I came in a little later than expected.
4846480	4848640	That's fine, it happens.
4848640	4850040	Big game release week, right?
4850040	4852040	Oh yeah, that would be busy.
4852040	4855920	So I'm thinking you've probably had a chance to check out Super Smash Brothers on the Wii
4855920	4856920	U?
4856920	4857920	Yep.
4857920	4858920	What'd you think?
4858920	4860480	So far so good, I mean, I like it so far.
4860960	4865360	Are you getting excited about implementing this at anime conventions, because, you know,
4865360	4866360	for those that...
4866360	4868600	That's pretty much my whole email bucket.
4868600	4869600	Oh really?
4869600	4870600	Yes.
4870600	4874720	So when you check the emails for the teabaggers, the big anime game room, when's the Smash
4874720	4876120	Tournament?
4876120	4877920	They're asking about that.
4877920	4882360	It's still to be announced, we'll probably announce it in a week or two, when we get
4882360	4885560	all the schedules finalized for SacAnime.
4885560	4888640	Have you played around with the, oh that's right, because SacAnime is, what, the first
4888640	4889640	weekend of January, right?
4889800	4891080	January 2nd to the 4th.
4891080	4892080	Wow.
4892080	4893080	Oh my gosh.
4893080	4894080	No time after the holidays.
4894080	4895080	No time.
4895080	4898200	You're gonna hit the ground running, it's time for an anime con.
4898200	4899200	Amiibos.
4899200	4901280	Have you had a chance to play around with that at all?
4901280	4904200	I haven't had the time to test out Amiibos, unfortunately.
4904200	4905200	Yeah?
4905200	4909040	Well you know, like, people can level up characters that learn their own stuff.
4909040	4912840	So my question is, are you gonna have a contest where it's just Amiibo versus Amiibo?
4912840	4913840	That would be pretty cool.
4913840	4915400	That might be kinda interesting.
4915400	4917040	Amiibo versus Amiibo.
4917040	4919800	Right now we're thinking about it, but we wanna test the waters first.
4919800	4920800	Okay.
4920800	4926000	Because we don't wanna overwhelm, like let's say, for instance, oh we're gonna throw an
4926000	4930480	Amiibo contest, and guess what, 128 people show up and you know how long that will take.
4930480	4931720	Yeah, that's true, that's a good point.
4931720	4933040	We wanna play a little safer.
4933040	4934920	8 player smash, if that's the case.
4934920	4935920	8 player smash.
4935920	4939120	You better be here 5 minutes before your timer, you're out, buddy.
4939120	4942840	And from what I've heard, you might as well get those 4 player adapters, or at least two
4942840	4946800	of them, if you want 8 players as soon as possible, because those prices are gonna skyrocket.
4946800	4951720	If you have not already bought the GameCube adapters, you better be prepared to put out
4951720	4952980	on eBay.
4952980	4953980	To buy one.
4953980	4954980	Or just put out.
4954980	4956880	Or just put out, because they're gone.
4956880	4958960	They are gone.
4958960	4962040	Unless Nintendo, kind and benevolent, does a reprinting.
4962040	4964520	Oh no, they'll do a reprinting.
4964520	4967120	For the adapter that works with one fucking game.
4967120	4970260	Oh no, they'll do a reprinting of course.
4970260	4973800	And guess who we'll be exclusive to.
4973800	4974800	Don't you dare.
4974800	4976080	Bite your tongue.
4976080	4979000	Just in time for GameCube games coming to Virtual Console.
4979000	4980000	That would be-
4980000	4981000	That would triple the cost too, by the way.
4981000	4982000	That would be, yeah, that would be why.
4982000	4987120	Then they'll release a bundle where it's like, you get this, and a code to get Super Mario
4987120	4988120	Sunshine.
4988120	4989120	Adapter, get.
4989120	4996280	But, I think those adapters are not like 100 bucks, it went from like 20 dollars to 100.
4996280	4997280	It's crazy.
4997280	4998280	Yeah.
4998280	5000560	Please don't, please don't pay those prices on eBay, you don't need a GameCube controller
5000560	5001560	that bad.
5001560	5002560	You do not.
5002560	5007600	If you can't fucking play Smash with the fucking giant control, you know what, then maybe you're
5007600	5008600	just bad at Smash.
5008600	5009600	Like, I'm just gonna say it.
5009600	5010600	I'm just gonna say it.
5010600	5014400	If you're that reliant on a GameCube controller, maybe your skills aren't that good.
5014400	5015400	I'm sorry.
5015400	5016400	I'm sorry.
5016400	5017400	Come at me.
5017400	5018800	Come at me.
5018800	5022640	And also, if you really, if you don't want to spend 100 bucks, you have to find the places
5022640	5023920	that actually still have it.
5023920	5024920	Yeah.
5024920	5025920	Which you won't.
5025920	5026920	Good luck with that.
5026920	5027920	Yeah, exactly.
5027920	5028920	You won't.
5028920	5029920	Alright.
5030280	5034480	Of course, of course, Pokemon's also taking my time too, unfortunately.
5034480	5038520	Alright, ST-100 Matt saying, don't say it, Loki.
5038520	5039520	Don't say it.
5039520	5040520	Do not.
5040520	5041520	Don't you dare.
5041520	5044960	Alright, Jonas, we'll be checking in with you again as we move on with the show here,
5044960	5048200	and feel free to chime in if you have anything to say on the news as we move on with some
5048200	5049200	more news.
5049200	5050200	Loki.
5050200	5055360	Yes, because it wouldn't be the GameCube without an evil G in there.
5055360	5059360	Alright, anyways.
5059800	5063200	So, let's talk about the Game Wars, because hey, that's right around the corner, isn't
5063200	5064200	it?
5064200	5065600	Remember the whole independent game?
5065600	5070240	Well, it's not on Spike anymore, but there's a surprise for having an awards ceremony next
5070240	5071240	month.
5071240	5076320	Yes, and they have nominees from each category, and here's the full list, so we'll just go
5076320	5079400	over some brief ones here.
5079400	5081120	Best online experience.
5081120	5086280	Call of Duty, Dark Souls 2, Destiny, Hearthstone, or Titanfall.
5086320	5090000	Hearthstone's going to be a tough one, considering how the launch was.
5090000	5091000	But whatever.
5091000	5092360	You're thinking World of Warcraft.
5092360	5093360	Hearthstone's fine.
5093360	5094360	Hearthstone doesn't have any bugs.
5094360	5095360	Oh, I'm sorry.
5095360	5096360	Yes, you're right.
5096360	5097360	I'm thinking World of Warcraft.
5097360	5098360	Yeah, Hearthstone's fine.
5098360	5099360	Best family game.
5099360	5104680	Disney Infinity 2.0, Fantasia, Mario Kart 8, Skylanders, or Tomodachi Life.
5104680	5108520	I think Mario Kart 8's got that in the bag.
5108520	5114080	Best sports slash racing game, FIFA 15, Forza Horizon 2, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart 8 again,
5114080	5116280	NBA 2K15, and Trials Fusion.
5116280	5117560	Get to the big stuff.
5117560	5119200	No one cares about these piddly categories.
5119200	5121720	All right, let's see here.
5121720	5122720	Game of the Year.
5122720	5123720	There we go.
5123720	5131440	Bayonetta 2, Dark Souls 2, Dragon Age Inquisition, Hearthstone, or Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor.
5131440	5135400	That's kind of a weird culmination, I have to say.
5135400	5138720	And of course, the entire internet piping up on where's this?
5138720	5141380	Where's Smash Brothers?
5141380	5143280	Where's Shovel Knight?
5143480	5146400	Nobody's happy with this final result.
5146400	5148800	But I think it does beg a good question.
5148800	5151180	How did they come up with this list?
5151180	5153600	And there's a jury or something, right?
5153600	5158760	That's all these random men, because I don't think there was a single woman on it.
5158760	5160480	There's all these men, maybe one.
5160480	5163440	Is there ever a one on these panels?
5163440	5164440	Good question.
5164440	5166840	But anyway, on the jury.
5166840	5172720	And then there also was a page that showed all the, I don't know if they were sponsors
5172720	5174720	or partners or something like that.
5174720	5176520	Like Ubisoft's one of them.
5176520	5180760	And so the one that struck me as really interesting, do you have the nominees for Studio of the
5180760	5182760	Year?
5182760	5184520	I'm sorry, I have to say something on this.
5184520	5186480	Is it Developer of the Year?
5186480	5188720	Yeah, Developer of the Year.
5188720	5190240	Blizzard Entertainment, Monolith.
5190240	5193800	Okay, let's stop and go over each one as we go.
5193800	5200000	So Blizzard Entertainment, which obviously the behemoth of Hearthstone, Heroes of the
5200000	5203400	Storm doing great for them, World of Warcraft, everybody's playing WoW games.
5203400	5209280	Maybe not so great with the launch, but they're having a good year otherwise.
5209280	5211120	Monolith Productions.
5211120	5218040	Monolith Productions, they made, what am I thinking?
5218040	5219640	They do Wii games, right?
5219640	5224180	Didn't they do Xenoblade, but Xenoblade wasn't this year.
5224180	5227120	That's why I'm like, wait a minute, that can't be the game they were nominated for.
5227120	5228840	What's the big game that they did this year?
5228840	5231840	They didn't do Bayonetta.
5231840	5233920	I don't know.
5233920	5234920	Nintendo.
5234920	5236840	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5236840	5239000	No, no, no, somebody's got to answer this question.
5239000	5241400	Why is Monolith on the list?
5241400	5243160	Nobody knows.
5243160	5244960	I guess all the hype for Xenoblade for next year.
5244960	5246280	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
5246280	5249160	No, there's Monolith and there's Monolith Soft.
5249160	5251160	And we're thinking Monolith Soft, right?
5251160	5255680	No, this is Monolith Productions.
5255680	5256680	That's why.
5256680	5257680	Monolith Productions.
5257680	5258680	Okay, that's why.
5258680	5259680	Because, okay.
5259680	5261240	I'm like, what the hell did they do?
5261240	5265680	Okay, Monolith Productions did Shadows of Mordor.
5265680	5267680	So that's why they're on the list.
5267680	5268680	Okay.
5268680	5269680	Nintendo.
5269680	5273560	Okay, which, you know, Nintendo did Mario Kart and Nintendo games.
5273560	5276400	Telltale games.
5276400	5281400	Which I was like, wait a minute, Tales from the Borderlands isn't out yet, but the Fable
5281400	5285040	game, Wolf Among Us has been very well received.
5285040	5287120	So I can see that.
5287120	5290800	In Ubisoft Montreal.
5290800	5291800	And they're one of the sponsors?
5291800	5292800	Hold on.
5292800	5293800	Hold on.
5293800	5299800	Not only is Ubisoft one of the sponsors, what games did Ubisoft make this year, specifically
5299800	5301800	Assassin's Creed Unity?
5301800	5305280	Assassin's Creed Unity.
5305280	5308960	Which now, to be fair, I talked earlier in the show about how, wait a minute, wait a
5308960	5309960	minute.
5309960	5313960	If we're going to razz Assassin's Creed Unity, we got to do a little razzing on Dragon Age
5313960	5320800	Inquisition as well, but still, the studio that was infamous this year for a comment
5320800	5324760	about what they can and they can't render, you know, that whole thing, I'm just, I'm
5324760	5330760	very surprised that they're on the list when, you know, maybe, I don't, maybe Yacht Club
5330760	5337560	Games who made Shovel Knight, who's basically kind of, you know, the Kickstarter phenomenon,
5337560	5340280	they kind of personify, I don't, maybe would be.
5340280	5344520	They also made Far Cry 4, but then again, they also made Watch Dogs, so.
5344520	5350520	Oh, oh, oh, the studio that had the E3 footage that didn't match the final game.
5350520	5354320	I'm not sure if that's, I don't think that studio did all three of those games.
5354320	5357600	I think that they're just kind of lumping all this stuff together, because it wasn't
5357600	5361680	all Ubisoft, Ubisoft Montreal was in every fucking game that came out from Ubisoft this
5361680	5362680	year.
5362680	5366680	There's no way that that was the case.
5366720	5373400	I just, unfortunately, I think the information I was looking at was lumping everything together.
5373400	5379520	I just, I'm sorry, I just, I would like to know who on the jury actually wrote that down
5379520	5385240	on the paper, like, because all these people that are on the jury are the same, and this
5385240	5389280	is the thing, if, like, if you're an Assassin's Creed fan and you're like, Rob, stop fucking
5389280	5394520	picking on this game, here's the thing, this is my point, this jury is made up of all these
5394520	5400880	people that are in the industry, right, who all gave that game shit.
5400880	5405080	Like the reviews across the board have been harping on the same thing, yet those same
5405080	5408440	people ended up nominating for Studio of the Year?
5408440	5410440	Maybe it's a joke.
5410440	5411440	I don't know.
5411440	5412440	Just something doesn't add up.
5412440	5413440	Satire?
5413440	5414440	Something doesn't add up.
5414440	5415440	That's all I'm saying.
5415440	5417680	Okay, and then, let's see what else here.
5417680	5423560	Best independent games, Broken Age Act 1, Monument Valley, Shovel Knight, Transistor,
5423600	5425680	and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.
5425680	5428680	And Assassin's Creed Unity.
5428680	5437240	Now, Dungeon Buster points out that Ubisoft Montreal also did Child of Light, and that
5437240	5438840	was, that was a pretty good game.
5438840	5442160	Like, I don't know, I don't know if I would look back on, like, that was, wow, that was
5442160	5445280	one of the year's best, but that was a good game.
5445280	5449120	Okay, come on, come on, this is a little ridiculous.
5449120	5450120	Best fighting game.
5450120	5452200	All right, Killer Instinct Season 2.
5452200	5453200	Okay.
5453840	5454840	War Arena Ultimax.
5454840	5455840	Okay.
5455840	5456840	Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.
5456840	5460400	Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Ultra Street Fighter IV.
5460400	5462040	That's a little...
5462040	5464240	Was it a slim year for fighting games?
5464240	5465240	I mean...
5465240	5466240	Apparently.
5466240	5467240	What came out this...
5467240	5471000	Yeah, that's pretty much all, pretty much all that came out, really, because a lot of
5471000	5474400	the games are being delayed for next year.
5474400	5475800	So it's been a really slow year for fighting games.
5475800	5476800	Well, then, here's a thought.
5476800	5478320	You know, just throw this out there.
5478320	5479920	So Smash Bros. did get nominated.
5479920	5480920	It just...
5480920	5481920	I'm just throwing this out there.
5481920	5482920	Here's the thought.
5482920	5487120	If you don't have enough entries for a category, don't do that category.
5487120	5488520	Or you cut the number of nominees.
5488520	5489520	That's what the Oscars does.
5489520	5492320	If there's not enough nominees for, like, best animated picture, then they only have
5492320	5493320	three nominees.
5493320	5494320	Right.
5494320	5495320	Anyway.
5495320	5496320	I'm just...
5496320	5499480	There's a lot of question marks with this, and no award show's gonna be perfect.
5499480	5503080	And I suppose here we are buying into it, because we're talking about, you know, that's
5503080	5504080	what it is.
5504080	5505080	It's buzzed or whatever.
5505080	5508960	But I'm kind of looking at this already going, this thing's got problems, and I don't think
5508960	5509960	I'm gonna be watching.
5509960	5510960	Right.
5511000	5512000	It's a little sloppy.
5512000	5513000	Best action adventure game.
5513000	5514000	Yeah.
5514000	5515000	Fighting game of the year.
5515000	5517880	Yeah, they can't really say much, because there's only five games around that really
5517880	5518880	just came out.
5518880	5522320	Everything else either came out years before, or coming out next year.
5522320	5523320	That's the thing.
5523320	5529080	Also, some of these games that just came out, like, literally Friday, it's like, oh, game
5529080	5530080	of the year already.
5530080	5531080	It's like, okay.
5531080	5532080	Right.
5532080	5535920	I'll cut them slack on that, because press would have access to early copies of the games
5535920	5537560	so they can write their reviews.
5537560	5542340	So I would imagine that the people on this jury were pretty well seasoned in the games
5542340	5544920	coming out this month because of their review copies.
5544920	5549120	And also, not to be a dick about this, but why the hell are people doing game of the
5549120	5554640	years when the year is still going on, even if you get the early copies?
5554640	5559580	To be fair, the Grammys do a similar thing.
5559580	5564000	And everybody respects the Grammys for some reason, which, if there's one award show that's
5564000	5566480	worse than any of this, it's the Grammys.
5566480	5567480	Seriously.
5567520	5569040	I'm just calling people out tonight.
5569040	5571000	The Grammys are awful.
5571000	5574840	If you really think about it, the Grammys are horrible.
5574840	5577320	They are the worst of all the award shows.
5577320	5578320	They really are.
5578320	5581280	Do they ever pick a good song to win for the year?
5581280	5582280	Ever?
5582280	5583280	I don't watch them.
5583280	5584280	It is what it is, okay?
5584280	5585480	It's a giant circle jerk.
5585480	5586480	That's all this is.
5586480	5588120	I mean, who cares?
5588120	5595360	Who cares if someone says Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Unity is the game of the year?
5595360	5597280	If you don't think that, then who cares?
5597280	5598840	It doesn't fucking matter.
5598840	5599840	It doesn't matter.
5599840	5603720	It's another sticker or label that goes on the cover of their game of the year edition.
5603720	5604720	I'll come out next year.
5604720	5605720	Oh, right.
5605720	5608440	Vitpower in our chat says, I'll be at the game awards in the audience.
5608440	5614400	Well, sir, I want a man on the street report from you.
5614400	5615640	I want to hear about it all.
5615640	5619160	I want to hear how it goes, how your experience is, and all that.
5619160	5623720	Because if you have a great time, that's all that really matters, right?
5623720	5625040	These awards are da-da-da-da-da.
5625040	5626600	They have really good performances.
5626600	5630120	If they have some games maybe available in the lobby for you to play, some other fun
5630120	5632280	things, then all this is for naught, right?
5632280	5635140	So I hope you do have a fun time at the show.
5635140	5639320	But it's still a stupid award show, is what Rob is trying to tell you.
5639320	5644120	I hope Kevin Spacey wins her best performance, because he was fucking awesome calling the
5644120	5645120	duty.
5645120	5646120	Yeah, game of the year.
5646120	5647120	Because it's Kevin Spacey.
5647120	5648120	Too early.
5648120	5649120	Right.
5649120	5652880	Especially with, again, back to the game of the year things, because if you do a game
5652880	5656840	of the year, what if a patch came out that fixes, let's say it says it's a great unity,
5656840	5662120	ooh, it kicks ass, it fixes all the bugs, everyone wants to play it now, kind of thing.
5662120	5663120	Good point.
5663120	5664120	Yeah.
5664120	5665120	Good point.
5665120	5667520	And then all my hating is for naught, but all those other people do.
5667520	5672200	Let's say the patch was released December 31st, it fixes every problem that you said
5672200	5676280	in the radio show, and you play as like, oh my God, now this is game of the year.
5676280	5677680	Well, it was ineligible.
5677680	5680720	Like the Grammys run, I think it's October through October.
5680720	5682760	Like the Grammys aren't really the year.
5682760	5684040	The Grammys only run to October.
5684040	5685600	That's why weird shit wins.
5685600	5688760	Like you'll be hearing about who won the Grammys and you're like, that fucking thing came out
5688760	5690400	like last October.
5690400	5691560	Why is it winning now?
5691560	5693520	And it's because of the weird eligibility window.
5693520	5694520	Yeah.
5694520	5697840	The reason why I bring that up, because the game of the year is not over, there's still
5697840	5701040	things and updates as will still go on.
5701040	5704880	Once it hits January 1st, okay, now you can say, oh, now game of the year.
5704880	5709060	Because at that time we're in the new year and okay, we're expecting new stuff.
5709060	5713860	So anything that gets released like 2015, that now belongs in the 2015 categories.
5713860	5720580	Sg100matt saying, oh snap, Rob is going after the award show, Loki Rants style.
5720580	5722900	And Kaijuto says the Grammys pick real artists.
5722900	5724540	They don't always pick mainstream.
5724540	5727140	Grammys are legit.
5727140	5731260	Three words for you, best new artist.
5731260	5732940	Look up the history of that category.
5732940	5736260	And I'm not just talking about who wins, but who gets nominated because you look at that
5736260	5740260	category and you go, the fuck?
5740260	5745460	Anyway, and, and, and, which is honestly an award they shouldn't even give out.
5745460	5748620	This is not a show about music, it's a show about games, but I'm just saying the Grammys,
5748620	5749620	they're awful.
5749620	5750620	Let's be honest.
5750620	5751620	Okay.
5751620	5753540	The real reason that you would watch this show, at least in the past, the reason I watched
5753540	5757580	this show is because of the trailers that for the new games that aren't even out yet.
5757580	5762900	New trailers is really why I want to watch the show and I hope they have new trailers.
5762900	5767780	I hope we have another trailer for No Man's Sky because that's a game I really want.
5767780	5769180	Some announcements would be really cool too.
5769180	5772500	Like maybe Nintendo will drop an announcement of something that's going to be in the first
5772500	5774460	part of next year that we don't know about yet.
5774460	5775460	It's plausible.
5775460	5776460	Why not?
5776460	5778460	So we'll see.
5778460	5783180	Reggie Reggie's face was on the site somewhere when he's one of the guys contributing.
5783180	5784180	I don't know.
5784180	5787460	Speaking of Nintendo, uh, this is a pretty cool, uh, turn of events here.
5787460	5790980	And I don't know if there's a lot, a lot of details on this because it, I think it happened
5791020	5794620	out of an event in Japan, uh, that's being reported on.
5794620	5800660	However, a word on the wire is that Satoru Iwata, a president of Nintendo said that fans
5800660	5807260	can now use company's properties for a number of different things such as let's play videos,
5807260	5809820	which I, that's where I start to go.
5809820	5810820	Wait a minute.
5810820	5811820	Did they really say that?
5811820	5813740	Uh, fan art and much more.
5813740	5819540	They will be joining the creative endorsement program, which rewards folks that get work
5819580	5821820	that is popular and well received in Japan.
5821820	5827060	Uh, they will be sponsoring the Toki, Toki, I don't know how to pronounce that.
5827060	5828060	I'm sorry.
5828060	5829060	Game party.
5829060	5830060	Yeah.
5830060	5831060	Thank you.
5831060	5832060	Which takes place early next year.
5832060	5833060	Yeah.
5833060	5834060	A little bit clarification though.
5834060	5835060	Okay.
5835060	5836980	Apparently I knew there had to be something with it.
5836980	5837980	Yeah.
5837980	5839900	There's, there's a new, new bit of information.
5839900	5847940	So apparently not everything is allowed and this only applies to Japan.
5847940	5852220	So they're saying that, um, you know, they announced on the stream of videos featuring
5852220	5856980	their games properties upload to Nico video that JP is allowed.
5856980	5862260	Um, it says, uh, so far they've acknowledged it for let's plays game music covers and fan
5862260	5867680	art, nothing else under the creative endorsement program from Nico video.
5867680	5869300	So it's only for that one site.
5869300	5870300	It's only for Japan.
5870300	5871300	Okay.
5871300	5872300	Okay.
5872300	5873740	So I knew there had to be a little twist in here somewhere.
5873740	5875380	So good to know.
5875380	5876460	Thank you.
5876460	5881020	So yeah, unfortunately that's not the case.
5881020	5885100	So you can't go and profit off all their stuff on, you can't, you can't go make that fan
5885100	5890460	Mario game that you're planning on doing or making, you know, whatever.
5890460	5891460	Yeah.
5891460	5892460	Oh yeah.
5892460	5894460	Project project M is still illegal.
5894460	5896280	Sorry.
5896280	5897280	That's a good point.
5897280	5898380	All right.
5898380	5902020	Let's try, let's go back in time to a more classic time in games.
5902020	5903020	Let's go back.
5903580	5907900	You didn't have like fricking patches that, that changed the game completely.
5907900	5912100	Well, unless it was like the translation patch for second dead sets at two, three, like maybe
5912100	5913100	that was the thing.
5913100	5916040	But anyway, uh, we go back to a simple time.
5916040	5920500	Actually tonight's pick goes way, way, way, way, way back further than that.
5920500	5923820	Tonight's pick goes back to 1984.
5923820	5928460	It is the classic game of the week where usually dark Sakura jumps into the gaming ball and
5928460	5931580	picks the game that she thinks, Hey, you should be playing this game this week.
5932140	5936140	And since dark Sakura isn't here, guess who's picking the game?
5936140	5937140	Me.
5937140	5938140	Wow.
5938140	5943260	So tonight I have picked a game that was on a multitude of different platforms, but of
5943260	5947980	course I remember it most fondly from the Commodore 64.
5947980	5950940	And it's because of those sweet, sweet chip tunes.
5950940	5958940	And I think all I have to do is play the intro song for you guys to know this game.
5958940	5962060	Looks like they said the name of it in the intro or something.
5962060	5963060	Exactly.
5963060	5964060	That's right.
5964060	5967820	Tonight I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters, specifically the 1984 edition.
5967820	5971620	Let me skip ahead to some actual gameplay here in the video.
5971620	5972620	Okay.
5972620	5977300	So I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters from 1984 because there were several different
5977300	5983060	additions of Ghostbusters games, but this is the, really the classic one that I remember
5983060	5988420	from being a kid like this, this was the stuff that like I went to the store and I saw this
5988420	5993580	on like the demo computer and like, I lost my mind because this game looks so awesome.
5993580	5995620	And did you, Irene, you grew up on Commodore 64.
5995620	5996620	Did you ever play this?
5996620	5997620	I played this.
5997620	5998620	Yeah.
5998620	5999620	Yeah.
5999620	6000620	It was so fun.
6000620	6001620	Fucking awesome.
6001620	6002620	Like there really wasn't anything like it.
6002620	6003620	Now they did.
6003620	6004620	They did port it to other platforms.
6004620	6006420	It wasn't just on the Commodore 64.
6006420	6008220	It was on the Atari 2600.
6008220	6011900	It was also on the Sega master system, but it was kind of a crappy port and it was also
6011900	6012980	on the NES.
6012980	6014160	Also a crappy port.
6014160	6017980	That's why I picked the Commodore 64 version, which is a little more true to the original.
6018060	6022060	This is a game by the infamous David Crane, and that's also part of what made this game
6022060	6023060	special.
6023060	6027340	And if you don't know that name, like all the great Atari classics were David Crane.
6027340	6034580	He made Pitfall, Pitfall 2, Kaboom, like back when Activision was like almost like an indie
6034580	6035580	developer studio.
6035580	6036580	Is that music too loud?
6036580	6037580	I'm sorry.
6037580	6038580	Let me turn it down a little bit.
6038580	6040620	Although the chip tune is so awesome, right?
6040620	6042180	It's totally fine if it is.
6042180	6043180	I know exactly.
6043180	6044180	It's like part of the game right there.
6044180	6045740	So anyway, he made all those games.
6045740	6049060	He also made this game.
6049060	6055020	Now Crane wrote the game in six weeks and it was the Commodore 64 version that he wrote
6055020	6058560	and I believe the Atari 800 game he also wrote as well.
6058560	6064600	He had made the game based off a concept he had called Car Wars, where you had automobiles
6064600	6069740	in a city which led to the driving sequences that were present in the game, where as you
6069740	6074260	were driving from building to building, you could suck up ghosts in the ghost vacuum that
6074260	6075340	you would attach to your car.
6075340	6076340	Yes, this is all a thing.
6076340	6077340	Okay.
6077340	6078340	It was the 80s.
6078340	6081260	And if you ever saw the Ghostbusters movie, some of this stuff was in the movie as well.
6081260	6084580	So you could suck up the ghosts and so forth.
6084580	6090380	Now Activision had the license to Ghostbusters to do a movie there and then Crane watched
6090380	6093460	the film after doing the game.
6093460	6097020	So he was already done with the game before he even saw the film.
6097020	6101060	So he wished he could have done a better victory screen and so forth, but he wasn't able to
6101060	6102060	do that.
6102060	6104540	I'm assuming he had to know some things about the game though, because the Marshmallow Man's
6104540	6105540	in it.
6105540	6106540	Yeah.
6106540	6108540	You wouldn't know about the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man once you've seen the movie.
6108540	6109540	Anyway.
6109540	6110540	Of course.
6110540	6114580	The game was also ported to the Spectrum, the Amstrad, the MSX, and oh my gosh.
6114580	6120140	So in the game, you pick from one of four cars with your bank money that you have, but
6120140	6123220	the funny thing is you can't afford the fourth car with the money you start with, and there's
6123220	6124220	a reason why.
6124220	6125220	We'll get into that later.
6125220	6129560	So you have to stock up your car and then you drive around the city and buildings will
6129560	6135960	get attacked by ghosts and you use the streams, but don't cross them, you use the streams
6135960	6139920	to try and lure the ghost into the trap and then you fire the trap and get the ghost.
6139920	6145720	And then that is how you basically get money that you save up and I think you also affect
6145720	6149600	the energy meter and you don't want the energy meter to get past a certain point or you won't
6149600	6154060	be able to get past the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who comes out late in the game.
6154060	6157240	And then at the very, very end of the game, you have to sneak by the Stay Puft Marshmallow
6157240	6162720	Man to get to the top of the building where the game comes to a conclusion.
6162720	6167880	Now other versions of the game, the NES version and I believe the Sega Master System game
6167880	6172320	had like a level where you actually climbed up the building when you got to the very end
6172320	6173320	of the game.
6173320	6176160	I don't believe that was in the original version.
6176160	6177160	So yeah.
6177160	6178400	And also this game is infamous.
6178400	6183800	The NES version was actually ported by a Japanese developer and they had some really bad Engrish
6183800	6190400	at the end of the game because the ending screen says, congratulation, you have completed
6190400	6195800	a great game and proved with two O's the justice of our culture.
6195800	6198360	Now go and rest our heroes.
6198360	6203000	That was literally the end game screen in Ghostbusters on the NES.
6203000	6207640	You see this text in a later Ghostbusters video game as an Easter egg.
6207640	6209800	It's like in the background hiding somewhere.
6209800	6210800	So yeah.
6210800	6212360	Anyway, this game was huge.
6212920	6214360	In fact, it was so huge.
6214360	6217960	It was one of the most pirated Commodore 64 games of its day.
6217960	6222040	This and the print shop were two of the most pirated titles.
6222040	6224040	I swear to God.
6224040	6225040	I'm reading it right here.
6225040	6228920	The print shop and Ghostbusters were two of the biggest pirated Commodore 64 programs
6228920	6230680	in 1985.
6230680	6232080	So there it is.
6232080	6237280	So yeah, apparently an enhanced remake of the spectrum version was released as freeware
6237280	6238960	for the PC in 2006.
6238960	6239960	I did not realize this.
6239960	6241960	I'll have to check that out at some point.
6242560	6245560	So yeah, that's Ghostbusters 1984.
6245560	6247160	My pick for classic game of the week.
6247160	6250360	Irene, any memories with this game?
6250360	6251360	Not really.
6251360	6252360	I didn't play it very much.
6252360	6257200	But you know what else David Crane made that should be featured as a classic game of the
6257200	6258200	week?
6258200	6260720	I will write that down and send it to Dark Soccer for consideration.
6260720	6267120	It's on the NES and it involves a certain person feeding another person a certain kind
6267120	6268120	of candy.
6268120	6269120	Oh, yes.
6269120	6270840	You know what I'm talking about.
6270840	6271840	That's right.
6272720	6273720	All right.
6273720	6274720	Okay.
6274720	6275720	Feeding the jelly beans.
6275720	6276720	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
6276720	6277720	Yes, exactly.
6277720	6278840	That was a David Crane game.
6278840	6283040	That was because it always said David Crane's title of the game.
6283040	6284040	That guy was in this.
6284040	6285040	All right.
6285040	6286040	Yeah.
6286040	6287040	Anyway, good game.
6287040	6288040	Good game.
6288040	6289040	Yeah.
6289040	6290560	Oh, and I didn't mention this, but at the end of the game, once you beat it, you get
6290560	6295480	a passcode that you use the same name the next time and you start with as much money
6295480	6297560	as you finish the game with at the end.
6297560	6301000	This allows you to buy the more powerful car and some of the more powerful enhancements
6301040	6304360	for the vehicle later, so you can, I guess, do speed runs and shit.
6304360	6305360	I don't know.
6305360	6306360	So there it is.
6306360	6307360	Loki, did you ever play this?
6307360	6311000	This seems like the type of thing you would have lost a few hours on.
6311000	6312000	I'm pretty sure.
6312000	6313000	I've played it.
6313000	6315880	I don't remember which version I've played, but I've played it.
6315880	6317120	I know I've played it.
6317120	6321120	Probably the Atari 2600 version looked a lot like this, except the buildings were just
6321120	6322120	solid colors.
6322120	6323120	Right.
6323120	6325960	Because you have a green square that would flash red.
6325960	6328000	I may have played the NES version.
6328000	6329000	Yeah?
6329000	6330000	Conglaturation.
6331000	6334000	Can you prove that?
6336000	6338000	All right.
6338000	6342000	Dungeon Buster says the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is insanely tough to sneak past in that
6342000	6343000	version as well.
6343000	6345000	Talking about the remake.
6345000	6350000	Apparently it's hard to find because the main page hosting it was abandoned there.
6350000	6352000	So very interesting.
6352000	6356000	Dungeon Buster says you usually had to start with a Volkswagen Bug as your first Ecto.
6356000	6357000	That's right.
6357000	6358000	That's right.
6358000	6359000	Or there was that big, the big white car.
6359000	6360000	Is it a hearse?
6360000	6361000	I don't know.
6361000	6362000	I use that a lot too.
6362000	6363000	I think so.
6363000	6364000	Yeah.
6364000	6365000	So there it is.
6365000	6366000	Classic Game of the Week.
6366000	6368000	Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64 and a host of other platforms as well.
6368000	6369000	Good times.
6369000	6370000	Did you like that pick?
6370000	6371000	Yeah, absolutely.
6371000	6372000	I liked that pick.
6372000	6373000	It was a good pick.
6373000	6374000	Solid pick.
6374000	6375000	There it is.
6375000	6376000	Classic Game of the Week.
6376000	6377000	Dark Soccer will be back next week to pick a new game for you guys.
6377000	6378000	I'm sure she'll still be on her.
6378000	6379000	What's her kick that she's on now?
6379000	6380000	Capcom arcade games?
6380000	6381000	Or Sega arcade games?
6381000	6382000	One of the two.
6382000	6383000	I don't remember.
6383000	6384000	One of the two.
6384000	6385000	But there you go.
6385000	6387000	I have to break her streak.
6388000	6390000	She's never going to pick Commodore 64 games.
6390000	6391000	Why?
6391000	6394000	Because she didn't really grow up with it the way I did.
6394000	6396000	She's just picking CPS3 games now?
6396000	6398000	I think she's on CPS3 games or something.
6398000	6399000	But anyway.
6399000	6401000	She does pick a lot of obscure stuff though.
6401000	6405000	I think we complement each other well because she picks games that I've never played.
6405000	6406000	And I'm sure she...
6406000	6408000	Well, she probably played the Ghostbusters game to be fair.
6408000	6409000	That was kind of everywhere.
6409000	6410000	It is a popular game.
6410000	6411000	She probably did play that one.
6411000	6412000	But some of the other ones.
6412000	6413000	I almost did Last Ninja tonight.
6413000	6415000	She probably never played that.
6415000	6416000	Really?
6416000	6417000	Yeah.
6417000	6419000	If you didn't own a Commodore 64 you didn't really have a way to play it.
6419000	6420000	That's true.
6420000	6421000	Yeah.
6421000	6423000	I appreciate that you're showing Commodore 64 some love.
6423000	6424000	I'm trying.
6424000	6425000	I'm trying.
6425000	6426000	Here.
6426000	6427000	Jonas approves Commodore 64 love.
6427000	6428000	Did you grow up on Commodore 64?
6428000	6429000	No.
6429000	6430000	You kind of missed that.
6430000	6431000	I don't think I was born.
6431000	6433000	1984 I was like one years old.
6433000	6434000	Yeah.
6434000	6435000	You're a little young.
6435000	6436000	Here's the thing.
6436000	6437000	I didn't grow up on a Commodore 64.
6437000	6441000	I had a Commodore 64 when I was like 14.
6441000	6446760	So it was like in the 90s because we were poor and we're like, hey, let's get the Commodore
6446760	6447760	64.
6447760	6451000	It's like $20 from our neighbor.
6451000	6455840	I still think it was an underrated gaming console because you could do a lot of games
6455840	6456840	on it.
6456840	6457840	But anyway.
6457840	6458840	All right.
6458840	6460140	We got to take a break guys because we're running long tonight.
6460140	6463040	We want to come back and make sure we get your calls on our Skype line at Orange Lawn
6463040	6464040	Radio.
6464040	6465040	All one word.
6465040	6466040	I want to talk about that giveaway.
6466040	6468900	We're going to be giving away a copy of the Jackbox Party Pack and I'm going to tell you
6468900	6472100	how to do that at the start of the next segment and we're going to get into rapid fire news
6472100	6485860	and so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6485860	6489500	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6489500	6494100	Live tonight on this Sunday evening, November the 23rd of 2014.
6494100	6497740	Episode number 576 of our show in progress.
6497740	6498740	Mark Stocker.
6498740	6499920	She is not here tonight.
6499920	6503340	She's at a party for her husband who's having a birthday.
6503340	6507460	But here in studio with me, Tech Master Loki, of course, as well as Princess Irene joining
6507460	6509780	us for the multi-tap podcast.
6509780	6511940	You missed a fun little part A if you're just joining us.
6511940	6515500	Irene and I had some real in-depth talk on World of Warcraft.
6515500	6517820	It'll make you miss this week's Hoard House.
6517820	6520980	And then also we talked about Ghostbusters.
6520980	6525100	We did a little bit.
6525100	6526100	What else?
6526100	6527100	And the news and all this stuff.
6527460	6533020	Also in the studio, of course, Jonas from the big anime game room, Teabagger, talking
6533020	6536860	a little bit about Smash and all the games that came out last week.
6536860	6540420	Have you had time to play anything else this week, Jonas, or just Smash?
6540420	6546020	Nope, unfortunately, because the day before I actually finished all the pump videos.
6546020	6549340	Oh, can we finally see your second place pump finish?
6549340	6550340	Is that available?
6550340	6551340	Yes, it's available online.
6551340	6552340	Oh, I need it.
6552340	6553740	I somehow missed it when it popped through on Facebook.
6553740	6554740	I didn't see it.
6554740	6556340	1080p at 60 frames a second.
6556580	6558540	Fucking Facebook not showing me.
6558540	6559900	You know how Facebook does that?
6559900	6563780	It won't show everything that a page posts on your feed.
6563780	6567540	Is it too hard to ask for a social network where I control what I see?
6567540	6570900	Yeah, Facebook's acting a little finicky over those matters.
6570900	6572780	Well, God, you should see.
6572780	6576620	We actually have had a lot of great content on vognetwork.com this week.
6576620	6581540	I will admit, we've had a bit of a drought in content, not podcasts, just the written
6581540	6584460	content that's on the site because it's an all volunteer group.
6584460	6589420	Unfortunately, we can't afford to pay people right now, but if you want writing experience
6589420	6595340	and want to try to get more exposure and write stuff, please contact me, rob at vognetwork.com.
6595340	6598020	We're always looking for more writers, not just on game content.
6598020	6601900	Actually, I'm really looking for people for movies and some other.
6601900	6606620	We have TV pretty well covered, but movies, books is another big venture I would love
6606620	6608100	to get into.
6608100	6609420	What about poetry?
6609420	6612460	If it has a geek angle, why not?
6612460	6613460	No.
6613460	6617940	So we've had a great amount of content in the past week and so forth at VOG, and I'll
6617940	6621300	post about it on Facebook and it's like 30 people reached.
6621300	6624260	And I'm like, wait a minute, we have way more people in that who like VOG network, but they
6624260	6627380	don't push it because we don't pay for it.
6627380	6631060	And because it's a link to our site, they're like, oh, this is spam.
6631060	6632060	This is spam.
6632060	6633060	I'm like, fuck you.
6633060	6634060	Yeah.
6634060	6638380	Facebook X is weird on these matters, the reach counts matter.
6638380	6639900	Yeah, it's weird.
6639900	6644680	But anyway, please do check out all the great content this week at vognetwork.com.
6644680	6648980	We have Eric from the RP Grinders podcast is reviewing games.
6648980	6654140	He just did one for Tales of R on the PlayStation Vita.
6654140	6657940	And then just today we pushed a review, John from Critical Myth reviewed Assassin's Creed
6657940	6663100	Rogue, the other Assassin's Creed game that people weren't talking about as much as the
6663100	6664100	now.
6664100	6665100	Okay.
6665100	6666100	Oh, let's talk about Rogue for a little bit.
6666100	6667700	So John did that as well.
6667700	6671460	Henry also on the Critical Myth team pushed a review of Interstellar, the movie.
6671460	6677660	And remember, it's where everybody has a voice and you can relieve a response review.
6677660	6682220	So if you read Henry's Interstellar review and you're like, I disagree, this movie I
6682220	6685940	felt so you can leave a response review and it shows right there on the page right next
6685940	6686940	to Henry's review.
6686940	6688300	So very cool.
6688300	6691060	So check that out all at vognetwork.com.
6691060	6696780	Before we get into rapid fire news, the folks over at Jackbox Games, very kind to give us
6696780	6700780	a code for the Jackbox Party Pack.
6700780	6706060	Now I can give you this code either on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
6706060	6710460	So whichever platform you're on, we've got a code for you if you are our big winner.
6710460	6711460	So here's how it's going to work.
6711460	6714780	We have a little contest now because this is like a $25 game.
6714780	6716580	We are going to make it work a little bit for it.
6716580	6719620	This is something a little more than previous.
6719620	6725340	So what we want you to do, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack, and again, thank
6725340	6729220	you to Jackbox Games for providing the codes, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack
6729220	6730820	is Drawful.
6730820	6736220	And in this game, you have to draw what is otherwise like a nonsensical phrase.
6736220	6740860	And all you really have is your finger and the freaking tablet.
6740860	6748300	So we would like you to submit your best drawing for Orange Lounge Radio.
6748300	6751260	Whatever it is that you associate Orange Lounge Radio with.
6751260	6753180	Maybe you're going to draw a picture of a ferret.
6753180	6755820	Maybe you're going to draw a picture of Loki screaming something.
6755820	6760700	Maybe you're going to draw, I don't know, but we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge
6760700	6761700	Radio.
6761700	6763340	Oh, but there's a twist.
6763340	6769380	Because you can only use your finger and the thing, it has to be ugly on purpose.
6769380	6775860	So we are requesting that you only use MS Paint.
6775860	6781700	So you will be deducted points if your drawing is too good.
6781700	6784580	So we want you to submit those and you can only use MS Paint.
6784580	6787260	I'm sure the Mac users are like, what about me?
6787260	6788500	Whatever the equivalent is on the Mac.
6788500	6792260	Isn't there like a paint thing built into the Mac?
6792260	6794020	You know what the equivalent is over there.
6794020	6797300	You can only use that.
6797300	6799540	You can use a brush and a text tool maybe.
6799540	6800540	I don't know.
6800540	6802220	If you use a text tool, you still don't get to use that on the phone.
6802220	6804020	You get to use a brush and one color.
6804020	6805020	That's it.
6805180	6806900	So we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.
6806900	6813500	You're going to send those to participate at orangeloungeradio.com and make sure in
6813500	6816900	the subject so we don't miss it, it says Jackbox.
6816900	6818860	So something about the Jackbox contest.
6818860	6822380	So Jackbox in the title and submit your best drawful.
6822380	6823720	Here's the beautiful part.
6823720	6825260	Dark Sakura is not here tonight.
6825260	6827060	She has no idea this is happening.
6827060	6829900	So when she opens up the mailbag next week, she's going to see these submissions.
6829900	6834940	So we will ask Dark Sakura to pick her favorite knowing these rules and that will be the
6834940	6835940	winner.
6835940	6839780	And again, please include in the email if you would prefer a copy on PlayStation 4 or
6839780	6840780	Xbox One.
6840780	6845340	So we make sure we get you the right code from our friends over at Jackbox Games.
6845340	6846820	So to summarize.
6846820	6847820	What?
6847820	6848820	What the hell?
6848820	6849820	Sorry.
6849820	6850820	I was pulling up his video.
6850820	6852780	Oh, you're looking at his pump video over there?
6852780	6853780	All right.
6853780	6856500	Look, he's looking at something over there.
6856500	6860980	So to summarize, you are going to submit your best drawful using a very simple paint program
6860980	6863020	that has a brush only.
6863100	6866980	You are going to send that to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you're going
6866980	6869780	to make sure the subject says Jackbox in it.
6869780	6872460	Now these are due by the next show.
6872460	6876220	So we want everybody to be able to participate, both the live listeners and the people on
6876220	6877220	the podcast feed.
6877220	6883420	So these are due by the 30th at we'll say noon Pacific time or three Eastern time that
6883420	6887020	gives us a time to go through and make sure we got a winner before the show starts.
6887020	6889900	So those are due on the 30th at noon.
6889900	6893700	So if you're listening to this after the cause I, I'm still getting contest entries
6893700	6895620	for something we gave away like two weeks ago.
6895620	6900020	Why did that guy with the really high power, you know, powered camera come up and take
6900020	6902220	a picture of your ass with it?
6902220	6903220	I don't know.
6903220	6908980	And he's just like kind of shrugs and shows like, okay, I'm doing that.
6908980	6911780	I don't know about that part.
6911780	6916100	You better watch it or I'm going to ask people to submit pictures of Jonas's ass for the
6916100	6917100	Jackbox competition.
6917100	6918100	Just kidding.
6918100	6919100	I'm kidding.
6919300	6920300	I wouldn't do that to you, buddy.
6920300	6921300	All right.
6921300	6922300	So there it is.
6922300	6923300	Uh, have fun.
6923300	6924300	Enter the competition.
6924300	6925300	It'll be fun.
6925300	6926300	All right.
6926300	6927300	Good time.
6927300	6928300	Are you going to submit Irene?
6928300	6929300	Yes.
6929300	6930300	You're not eligible.
6930300	6931300	All right.
6931300	6932300	I'm going to do it anyway.
6932300	6933300	All right.
6933300	6935700	Robert M is asking, is there a PS three version of the game?
6935700	6936820	I'm sorry there.
6936820	6941700	I believe there is a P does the PS four version work on the PS three.
6941700	6942700	Oh shit.
6942700	6943780	I'm being put on the spot.
6943780	6951060	I believe the code he gave me works for both because it's crossed by Loki.
6951060	6954700	Will you do some research for me real fast and figure out if live radio folks figure
6954700	6957860	out if the Jackbox party pack is crossed by on PlayStation three and four.
6957860	6959460	I think it is.
6959460	6963180	And if that's the case, then yes, the code will work on PS three.
6963180	6970680	So you didn't mention that also for droffle, you can't erase, maybe that's something that's
6970680	6973520	going to be a little harder to figure out if somebody did that or not.
6973520	6975400	So I guess we'll let you slide on that.
6975400	6976400	Okay.
6976400	6977400	Hmm.
6977400	6978400	What the draw?
6978400	6980240	He said it could be anything related.
6980240	6984680	Just if, if the clue was orange lounge radio, how would you draw that for somebody else
6984680	6985680	to guess?
6985680	6992400	I hope that someone draws like world of Warcraft stuff because we've been talking about tonight's
6992400	6993400	world of Warcraft.
6993400	6994400	Yeah.
6994400	6996040	Except then I'd be like, what a great picture for hort house.
6996040	6999120	It doesn't say, I don't think it is.
6999120	7000120	It might be, I don't know.
7000120	7005440	I thought he said something about PlayStation three and four being crossed by, uh, my advice
7005440	7009120	to you, if you only are on PlayStation three, enter anyway.
7009120	7010120	I will.
7010120	7014120	And if you can't use the code, I'll do my best to get you a PlayStation three one.
7014120	7015600	I bet I can get it.
7015600	7018800	So, uh, but I don't believe I can get Xbox three 60.
7018800	7019800	Sorry.
7019800	7020800	So, uh, yeah.
7020800	7021800	Sorry about that.
7021800	7025100	I should have researched that in advance, but, uh, the code I believe will work on PS
7025100	7026640	three or PS four.
7026640	7029240	So, all right.
7029360	7031840	That's a really good question.
7031840	7033360	Oh, you know what?
7033360	7037080	Stay tuned to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as soon as I know the answer, I'll
7037080	7038720	send a tweet about that.
7038720	7039720	Okay.
7039720	7045040	Uh, let's do some rapid fire news and, uh, travel around and check out some quick news.
7045040	7046040	What's been going on?
7046040	7047040	Loki.
7047040	7051760	So now with the Xbox three 60 version now free to play as well.
7051760	7054640	Defiance as a whole has finally got a free to play Defiance.
7054640	7060160	If you may not remember was the MMO that they launched was last year, maybe, no, maybe
7060160	7067640	even the year before last, um, basically tying in with a scifi TV show by the same name.
7067640	7069040	I actually played a little bit of it.
7069040	7071360	It was kind of, kind of lame, but it was all right.
7071360	7072360	I don't know.
7072360	7076880	It's worth checking out, I guess, but now that it's free, might as well check it out.
7076880	7082720	Um, I guess if you did happen to buy the game, you do get some additional goodies, including,
7082720	7090080	uh, they say a 30 day patron pass for, um, character slots and a thousand arc forge,
7090080	7094160	which since it's been so long since I played that, I don't remember what the hell any of
7094160	7095160	that means.
7095160	7100520	Um, and I guess it's all the content of through the aftermath of season two.
7100520	7103840	So it'd be worth to check out on me if it's free.
7103840	7104840	So why not?
7104840	7110480	Um, no, this is kind of funny coming out with a Kiva's trip later this week.
7110480	7114520	If you happen to stream the PlayStation four version, there's going to be some integration
7114520	7117920	with Twitch, some funny integration with Twitch.
7117920	7122680	They have chat commands that you can type in and things will happen.
7122680	7129120	For example, if you type in tourists or Gaijin, you'll summon, um, some tourists into the
7129120	7130120	game.
7130120	7135360	If you type in Gothic Lolita, you'll get a Gothic Lolita or, um, there's sounds like
7135360	7136880	scribble knots all of a sudden.
7136880	7137880	Yeah.
7137880	7139880	Like if you type in anti, yes, someone's anti will show up.
7140160	7144920	They're also saying that like, um, I guess you can do like panty jump and they'll blow
7144920	7148000	all the panties and stuff in the air.
7148000	7149080	Crazy stuff.
7149080	7152160	So I don't know, that's kind of, that sounds funny.
7152160	7156360	So um, yeah, that game's coming out of this week on PlayStation four.
7156360	7159720	So that's interesting to you.
7159720	7167080	And then, um, I guess, um, more amiibos, of course, right around the corner and more exclusive
7167080	7169140	amiibos to different locations.
7169140	7172240	So if you want to collect them all, you're going to have to go to a few different locations
7172240	7173340	and pick them up.
7173340	7179420	For example, um, they're saying that Meta Knight is going to be exclusively at Best
7179420	7180420	Buy.
7180420	7188100	Lucaro is going to be, um, in Toys R Us and Shulk of course going to GameStop.
7188100	7190220	So that's kind of lame.
7190220	7192420	Um, I don't know.
7192420	7196780	I don't like that whole idea, you know, with having the travel on.
7196820	7202980	I don't like the whole exclusivity thing, but at least they spread it around so that
7202980	7205140	not one store had one.
7205140	7209540	It could be timed exclusives because there was that issue with, I know Disney infinity
7209540	7214140	had like, you know, uh, Jack Skellington knows that GameStop for like four weeks or something
7214140	7215660	before it came out everywhere else.
7215660	7216940	So I don't know.
7216940	7220660	Um, the other thing I read was apparently the next batch of amiibos is supposed to launch
7220660	7222600	on the 14th of December.
7222600	7227240	So all those like, uh, Mega Man and that kind of stuff is supposed to be December.
7227240	7228240	All right.
7228240	7234000	Uh, just to follow up in our chat, they are saying, um, that the cross by, uh, does not
7234000	7237880	work on Jackbox party packet is not crossed by between PlayStation three and PlayStation
7237880	7238880	four.
7238880	7241560	I'm still pretty confident that I can get you a PlayStation three code if that's the
7241560	7242560	only thing you have.
7242560	7243560	So you know what?
7243560	7244640	I'm just gonna throw it out there.
7244640	7246040	I go enter.
7246040	7250840	And if you want it on PlayStation three, even if I can't get a code, I'll put my mind, I'll
7250840	7251840	buy it.
7252320	7255900	If you, if you win in your PlayStation three only, I'll buy it.
7255900	7259720	So I want everybody that, that has one of the systems to be able to participate.
7259720	7262300	So there you go, all those systems.
7262300	7265160	So be sure to specify in your entry.
7265160	7266800	All right.
7266800	7270880	Um, let's move on, uh, with some other rapid fire news here.
7270880	7276660	Uh, Mario Kart eight, some minor tweaks going in, uh, with, you know, a lot of people talking
7276660	7281800	about the DLC, but some of the lightweight racers like toad and shy guy actually
7281800	7283480	had a little bit of a tweak.
7283480	7289380	Uh, some balancing came to the 3.0 version update to lessen the collision impact with
7289380	7294640	heavier racers, because I guess when you would slam into a big fatty like Bowser or Donkey
7294640	7297520	Kong or what have you, your character would go flying.
7297520	7301940	Um, so if this didn't, is something you didn't really care for, try it again, since they
7301940	7306760	did the update, uh, a quote from the Mario Kart eight director for this update, we made
7306760	7310320	just a minor tweak to the way two players deflect when they collide with each other
7310320	7313760	up until now, when two players collided, the more lightweight racers would get knocked
7313760	7315100	too far away.
7315100	7318980	That combined with other overall elements we considered made us conclude that the lighter
7318980	7321200	racers were at a bit of a disadvantage.
7321200	7325240	If you like toad or shy guy and feel you can't win at all, go ahead and give them another
7325240	7327280	try after applying the update.
7327280	7332400	Also note that this tweak doesn't have any effect on time trials when playing solo.
7332400	7333400	All right.
7333400	7343200	Uh, let's see, Microsoft has, uh, celebrated one year of Xbox one by sending out prizes.
7343200	7344200	That's right.
7344200	7349080	Uh, they have sent out prizes, quote, selected at random to receive a special gift from us.
7349080	7353120	These various console owners, uh, some of the things you can win, uh, you can actually
7353120	7357440	win console bundles for call of duty, advanced warfare and sunset overdrive.
7357440	7358920	Guessing not too many people got those.
7358920	7364120	Uh, you can also get a one year subscription to Xbox live gold, uh, free copies of limbo
7364120	7369040	apparently are one as well, or, uh, from our call with Bobby Blackwell for, I heard it
7369040	7374040	on his show earlier tonight, you might get money for grand theft auto on the Xbox one.
7374040	7376440	So, uh, there's a variety of different things you can get in there.
7376440	7380640	I saw, yeah, I read some of the people, a lot of people got just like a free digital
7380640	7382680	poster, which is like worth nothing.
7382680	7383680	Yeah.
7383680	7384680	Or a gamer.
7384680	7386400	Thanks for nothing.
7386400	7387400	Microsoft.
7387400	7388400	Yeah.
7388880	7393480	It's almost as good as like when they gave you was a 25 cents worth of Microsoft points
7393480	7394480	for your birthday.
7394480	7398680	It's like, ah, fuck you.
7398680	7403840	Well now something to point out here is that, uh, if you are 17 or older, you've used your
7403840	7406000	console for more than 10 hours.
7406000	7411320	You're in one of the original markets for Xbox one and you made your purchase, uh, before
7411320	7415480	November 11th of this year, you're going to get the year one celebration box, which gives
7415480	7421120	you a special gamer pick and desktop background and free rentals of halo four forward until
7421120	7423680	Dawn and Dragon Ball Z battle of the gods.
7423680	7428480	Uh, you also get a sampler pack of Dragon Ball Z episodes.
7428480	7433720	So no word if you know, there's over 9,000 episodes given away or, or whatever.
7433720	7434720	All right.
7434720	7435720	I had to work in a joke.
7435720	7436720	All right.
7436720	7442300	Um, also free on the Xbox Atari game over that documentary we've talked about way too
7442300	7443300	much on this show.
7443300	7447300	Uh, the hour long feature is now available for viewing and it talks about the video game
7447300	7448620	crash of 1983.
7448620	7454860	Uh, and, uh, of course, Atari throwing away all of the et video game copies, which somebody
7454860	7458060	thought it would be fun to dig them up and sell them on eBay to people who like to buy
7458060	7459300	other people's garbage.
7459300	7461220	Uh, there you go.
7461220	7462940	So now that documentary is available for viewing.
7462940	7464060	I haven't watched it yet.
7464060	7467460	I think I need to, I'd like to check that out.
7467460	7468460	I was old enough to remember.
7468460	7473020	I mean, not to be like old grandpa, but I am old enough to kind of remember when the
7473020	7479140	shit hit the fan with the, uh, Atari's and they just, you've had just bins of games
7479140	7480500	that they couldn't give away.
7480500	7481500	It was crazy.
7481500	7482500	Yeah.
7482500	7485780	I remember those big bins of games going into the game stores and seeing that stuff.
7485780	7486780	Yeah.
7486780	7487780	Right.
7487780	7490980	Speaking of Atari, cause they remind me of the flashback stuff.
7490980	7494340	The clique of vision flashback is not in stores around here and online.
7494340	7496380	They're trying to sell it for like twice the retail.
7496380	7498820	So what the fuck is up with that?
7498820	7502180	Oh no.
7502180	7504360	Let's go to our foogle question of the week.
7504360	7508620	Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and Google plus communities.
7508620	7522580	You throw those words together, you get foogle Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or
7522580	7529020	google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is where you can find us.
7529020	7533020	And we're going to get to the question that we asked our communities, which was, we asked
7533020	7535340	a very simple question in the communities this week.
7535340	7537780	We just wanted to know how was your gaming week?
7537780	7541540	You know, we always ask ourselves that at the top of each show to establish a frame
7541540	7545460	of reference and what types of games we've been into and you know what we kind of talk
7545460	7546460	about for the week.
7546460	7550580	Uh, but the reason why we asked it this week is because with so much that has come out
7550580	7554100	in the game stores this week, we know there's a lot to pick from.
7554100	7558700	So we want to know what is it that you've been playing or maybe you really just, you
7558700	7559700	know, life happens.
7559700	7561420	You can't afford to get anything right now.
7561420	7565500	So what plastics are you revisiting or, or what games do maybe the rest of us forget
7565500	7566500	about?
7566500	7568500	We ought to be going back and playing this week.
7568500	7571800	So checking out some of the answers on Google plus, I'm going to have to abbreviate a lot
7571800	7572800	of these.
7572800	7573800	I'm sorry.
7573800	7576320	We're just running way over tonight and I want to make sure we ended at least an hour.
7576320	7577320	So bros.
7577320	7581780	Amay says, uh, freedom wars, super smash for evil within and Lords of the fallen.
7581780	7586500	Uh, the first two are amazing and the latter are buggy on PC.
7586500	7588340	Uh, let's see.
7588340	7594860	Redder tainment replied and said, um, WWE two K 15 came out and there are complaints
7594860	7595860	about it.
7595860	7600580	Uh, the week I started playing or this week I started playing WWE two K 15.
7600580	7604300	Some features are missing, but as far as major complaints, I only have one.
7604300	7607980	When I preordered the game, I was promised that I would get the wrestler sting as a download
7607980	7608980	character.
7608980	7613100	And then I picked up the code at, uh, I was given a code on my receipt from GameStop to
7613100	7617500	download the DLC, but it isn't good until December 16th.
7617500	7621740	Uh, he tried to redeem the code and it didn't work.
7621740	7625620	He tried to call Microsoft support and that's when he finally found out that's why it wouldn't
7625620	7626620	work.
7626620	7630420	So, uh, maybe a little more communication, maybe on the box or on the receipt or from
7630420	7632380	GameStop would be helpful.
7632380	7634620	I have heard that that game is a little bit buggy.
7634620	7638340	I'm not super into the wrestling games myself, but, uh, I've heard some things about them
7638340	7639340	being buggy.
7639340	7646540	Uh, Prince Peach Fuzz, I like that name, Prince Peach Fuzz replied and said, uh, I have dusted
7646540	7651100	off my Vita and I've been playing SteamWorld dig and hotline Miami been loving both games
7651100	7652100	so far.
7652100	7653100	That's right.
7653100	7654280	Both of those were free on PlayStation plus as well.
7654280	7655740	So a free is always a good way.
7655740	7659980	I mean, well, I guess you're paying for PlayStation plus, so it's not that free, but freeze a
7659980	7664680	good way to check out some of those classics, uh, act depth says I'm playing some animal
7664680	7667620	cross new leaf for the first time in months.
7667620	7669140	My village is still intact.
7669140	7675460	I also played Spelunky and team fortress two and smash brothers for Wii U most of the weekend.
7675460	7679700	Those are some answers from Google plus let's go over to Facebook where there's a ton of
7679700	7680700	answers.
7680700	7682020	I'm gonna have to really kind of run through this.
7682020	7687940	Um, of course I closed the tab on accident, so I'm bringing it up again right now.
7687940	7688940	Way to go, Rob.
7688940	7693020	Way to go me.
7693020	7695340	Maybe I'll get it someday here.
7695340	7697220	This is because I complained about Facebook earlier.
7697220	7698220	I'm now being punished.
7698220	7703680	Oh, Hey, dark Tetsuya responded and said Mario Kart eight, Mario 64 and stuff on connect
7703680	7705260	like rhythm party.
7705260	7706260	It needs more songs.
7706260	7707260	Uh, Kane.
7707260	7710940	I am says final fantasy 14 has eaten my soul.
7710940	7712780	Yeah, mine too.
7712780	7718660	Uh, Andy R says little big planet three story just finished, uh, outside of that Vita love
7718660	7722980	freedom Wars, Hatsune Miku project diva F second, which I can't believe that's the first
7722980	7725620	time that's come up tonight, but that was another big release.
7725700	7730220	Uh, tales of hearts are, and Andy R says tales of hearts are as awesome.
7730220	7731220	I highly recommend it.
7731220	7734940	You should go leave a response review on eric's review at vog network.com.
7734940	7740980	Uh, silent Tom says super smash brothers and Mario Kart eight rocking my link amiibo.
7740980	7746180	See Al says border lands, the pre-sequel final fantasy tactics, advanced Minecraft star bound
7746180	7752540	and Pokemon Omega Ruby, which again, another huge game that came out this week that none
7752540	7754140	of us have gotten around to playing yet.
7754140	7758620	But uh, I'm sure at some point Shane will invade the show and tell us all about what
7758620	7762100	we're missing with Pokemon because I know he wasn't into it at first.
7762100	7765980	And then he said, Oh, but they do this thing in the grass and it's so cool now.
7765980	7768020	And I completely changed my mind.
7768020	7773300	Um, a surfing Slurpee said I've been binge playing halo master chief collection, halo
7773300	7778300	CE through halo four, uh, logged into legal legends to check out the new champion Kalista
7778300	7782220	and started a free trial wow account to check out the new character models.
7782220	7786220	They're nice, but not enough to break my one year long wow sobriety Lords of the fallen
7786220	7787220	dragon agent.
7787220	7790300	Grand Theft Auto five are unopened and gathering dust.
7790300	7791300	You hear that?
7791300	7795260	Or is it being Slurpee has a copy of grand theft auto five gathering dust Loki.
7795260	7801620	He's just shaking his head, shaking his head, a low cat frog responds and says, did my yearly
7801620	7805500	tradition of the most current assassin's creed and playing through grand theft auto five
7805500	7806500	on Xbox one.
7806500	7807500	Well, there you go.
7807500	7809060	The next answer redeemed it a little bit there.
7809060	7813620	Fred the Hayes saying, enjoying old DS games on my brand new $60 3DS XL that was price
7813620	7818580	matched to Walmart freedom Wars on Vita and got some old Skylanders for cheap on PS three
7818580	7824200	and 3DS Elliott B says, I haven't bought new games in ages, but I spent a jet lag recovery
7824200	7826820	day getting reacquainted with rock band.
7826820	7830020	Uh, it's still so good.
7830020	7834780	One of my favorite names, William murder face said, I'm getting into dragon age origins,
7834780	7836060	not inquisition origins.
7836060	7839420	And I'm playing payday two and Guild Wars two for the umpteenth time.
7839420	7843060	Winston H says, bust a move one and two.
7843060	7847960	Uh, once my finals are over, I'll go back to persona for arena Ultimax.
7847960	7851260	That was a game we used to play the crap out of all the time was buzz to move.
7851260	7852260	Yes.
7852260	7853260	Oh my God.
7853260	7854260	So they're busted groove or whatever.
7854260	7855260	I wasn't saying I wasn't.
7855260	7856260	Yeah.
7856260	7857260	Yeah.
7857260	7858260	Must've groove.
7858260	7859260	Same thing.
7859260	7860260	Cause it was bust to move in Japan.
7860260	7864740	And in here somehow bust to move was pub puzzle bobble somehow, which had the most interesting
7864740	7868140	PlayStation two box art I've ever seen in my life.
7868140	7872780	I don't recall it, but, uh, get him to Google it or use your tablet.
7872780	7873780	Look it up.
7873780	7874780	Bust a move on PlayStation two.
7874780	7875780	It's like what?
7875780	7882860	Uh, our pal Tiara responds and says so much dragon age inquisition so much tiara.
7882860	7884540	You need to leave the hinterlands.
7884540	7888480	You need to stop and then you need to leave the hinterlands.
7888480	7889480	Get out of there.
7889480	7892820	Uh, I'm thinking about picking up that game.
7892820	7893820	Yeah.
7893900	7900300	Break code man says dragon age, dragon age, and oh yeah, transistor, uh, Haseo Sumeru
7900300	7905220	Gawa says, uh, bought a DS to catch up on the games I miss so much right now.
7905220	7911140	Uh, FONF has he 12 revenant wings and Pokemon black for the Vita I'm cracking out on borderlands
7911140	7912180	too.
7912180	7917300	We played super smash brothers brawl and finally the PlayStation three far cry four, which
7917300	7918300	is amazing.
7918300	7919580	Not going to lie.
7919620	7925100	Fifth dream says so much dragon age inquisition and tales of hearts are, I've also been playing
7925100	7928180	a lot of Pokemon alpha Sapphire and a little project diva F second.
7928180	7931700	I have a bunch of games from the last month I've put on hold this week with more games
7931700	7934140	coming on Tuesday.
7934140	7939700	Critical myths says mostly assassin's creed rogue and final fantasy 10 HD remaster.
7939700	7945120	And last but not least, Veronica Isabel saying Tomodachi life and solitaire by mobility wears
7945120	7946780	daily challenges.
7946780	7951060	I keep putting off downloading star Trek online and beating Pokemon X.
7951060	7952060	There you go.
7952060	7954540	Those are the answers there to our foogle question of the week.
7954540	7956380	I'm really surprised in there.
7956380	7957380	How much of that content?
7957380	7962260	I know there was a lot that I read, but I'm really surprised how much of that was not
7962260	7964200	stuff that came out this week.
7964200	7968860	In fact, there seemed to be like two or three people that were like, I just got a DS and
7968860	7971260	so now I'm catching up on all this stuff.
7971260	7974520	So Irene, you know, you kind of mentioned earlier in the show, that's where you're at
7974520	7976280	right now is, is playing a lot of DS stuff.
7976280	7977640	So you are not alone.
7977640	7982000	It's my people, the poor people of the world.
7982000	7986160	Well, you need to talk to the guy who got a $60 price match DS.
7986160	7987160	That's right.
7987160	7988160	Yeah.
7988160	7989160	Right.
7989160	7990160	Lucky.
7990160	7991400	Well, what about those people that were, you know, I don't think we're talking about, but
7991400	7994000	the people that were exploiting the price matching?
7994000	7996840	Well, that's exploit essentially that's stealing.
7996840	7999880	I mean, you can, you can call it whatever you want.
7999880	8000880	That's stealing.
8000880	8003520	I'm assuming the $60 price match thing was legit.
8003520	8007680	They did have though one time it was a, it was a glitch on the website where they actually
8007680	8011960	had like, you know, we use and places you force down the Sears.
8011960	8012960	Yeah.
8012960	8018200	Sears had the down really cheap and so people were price matching off the website glitch.
8018200	8022040	So from what I understand, that was actually, I think a former employee issue.
8022040	8023040	No, no.
8023040	8025040	I was like, Oh boy.
8025040	8028360	Uh, well then that's, that's yeah, let's go.
8028360	8031160	But anyway, yeah, let's just leave it at that.
8031160	8032760	All right, let's move on.
8032760	8035600	We got some more news to get into and we want to make sure we have some time to get into
8035600	8036600	your calls.
8036600	8037600	We've got the email bag too.
8037600	8039040	So we're going to try to jam through these stories.
8039040	8040040	Loki.
8040040	8046240	So you may remember that Activision, Vivendi were together at one point and now, you know,
8046240	8048640	there was a whole buyout thing.
8048640	8058600	Um, basically some lawsuit that's now resulting in a Vivendi paying, um, 275 million to Activision
8058600	8061000	to settle the litigation.
8061000	8063160	And I guess this happened, was it starting last year?
8063160	8068520	I sort of remember part of it, but I don't remember exactly the details of why one was
8068520	8069520	suing the other.
8069520	8073520	Um, I'm assuming over probably payments or something like that.
8073520	8077040	Um, but yeah, well I guess at least that's settled.
8077040	8079200	Um, I don't know.
8079200	8081160	Oh, here we go.
8081160	8087480	Uh, the lawsuit alleged, I guess, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets
8087480	8089720	and unjust enrichment.
8089720	8094120	I have no fucking clue what any of that means.
8094120	8099520	Bad business stuff that CEOs and corrupt people participate in.
8099520	8100520	I don't know.
8100520	8101520	It's almost.
8101520	8102520	All right.
8102520	8108240	Uh, if you've downloaded anything on the iTunes store lately for your iOS platform,
8108240	8114720	such as the iPhone or the iPad, you may have noticed that the term free has changed to
8114720	8115720	get.
8115720	8119920	Uh, this is because, uh, there's been pressure from the European commission that a lot of
8119920	8124440	these free games are not really free, uh, because they have in app purchases.
8124440	8130600	So for example, the newly released candy crush soda saga, I can't say it without verping
8130600	8131600	a little bit.
8131600	8132600	I'm sorry.
8132600	8135120	I shouldn't judge a game I haven't played, but I'm going to judge this game a little
8135120	8136120	bit.
8136120	8137120	I'm sorry.
8137120	8138120	Uh, you can now see that on the store.
8138120	8143960	It says get because you know, to buy your snozzberries or whatever it is that will do
8143960	8146760	the magic on the board to buy your Bert machines.
8146760	8147760	I don't know.
8147760	8152880	What do you, what do you buy in candy crush soda saga, bunch of bullshit, an Alka Seltzer.
8152880	8153880	I don't know.
8153880	8160100	Uh, you're, it's not really going to be free because those are all microtransactions, right?
8160100	8161100	So there you go.
8161100	8166600	Uh, which, you know, somebody's got to put out a game named shine so I can go shine.
8166600	8171440	Get, that's the second time I've made a Mario sunshine joke tonight.
8171440	8175800	I think you've hit your, your, as we're done for the year, no more Mario sunshine jokes
8175800	8176800	for the whole year.
8176800	8177800	We're done.
8177800	8178800	Right.
8178800	8179800	All right.
8179800	8180800	Loki.
8180800	8185520	I don't know how to follow that, but I'm going to, let's talk about steam sale.
8185520	8186520	Yes.
8186520	8192440	Your wallets are already shivering in fear, but apparently the steam sale will commence
8192440	8197360	the day before Thanksgiving and it'll run up through December 1st.
8197360	8204200	Um, apparently they're saying an email was sent out by PayPal encouraging people to stock
8204200	8206880	up on steam wallet codes.
8206880	8210240	Um, Hmm.
8210240	8215840	No confirmation yet from valve, but I, that sounds like it could make sense.
8215840	8218280	Um, I know they normally do a sale.
8218280	8223520	I'm not sure it's necessarily the fall sale right at black Friday, but usually around
8223520	8225280	that early December time.
8225280	8229880	So I guess we'll just have to look out for all the sale.
8229880	8231880	This is also the precursor to the winter sale.
8231880	8232880	Really?
8232880	8235360	I mean, this is, this is just like wetting your whistle a little bit for games.
8235360	8238240	It'll be even more deeply discounted during the winter.
8238240	8241760	So when's the winter sale usually is that in like next year?
8241760	8242760	Yes.
8242760	8243760	Well, yeah.
8243760	8249960	I mean, it's usually about, um, I want to say it starts around the 27th to 28th, like
8249960	8254160	it's after Christmas and then runs through like the new year's, but I could be wrong.
8254800	8258260	Somebody like rage nator or somebody who's a little more tuned into steam might know
8258260	8260120	a little more about when those sales start.
8260120	8263480	But then the other exciting thing is that, you know, uh, there's more stores out there
8263480	8267880	than just steam and all those stores will start having huge sales as well to kind of
8267880	8268880	compete with that.
8268880	8272240	In fact, a good old games just finished a big sale that they were having.
8272240	8276440	So I used to get a lot of stuff on the Amazon digital store because they would have steam
8276440	8277440	codes.
8277440	8281200	So just say I keep an eye out for that stuff or if you don't want to worry about aggregating
8281200	8286360	that stuff yourself, cheap ass gamer, you know, uh, let's see.
8286360	8288680	Kaijuto says, I think I'm burned out on steam sales.
8288680	8289680	They don't have much of anything anymore.
8289680	8294800	I don't want to bother with any more early access games, uh, as I agree, there is a lot
8294800	8298300	of that going on where there's a lot more of that coming onto the store where it's like
8298300	8299920	by my half finished game.
8299920	8304400	And I mean, it really depends on the developer and on the game if I'm going to buy into something
8304400	8305400	like that or not.
8305400	8313040	Uh, let's see, SSG100 Matt says week before Christmas, uh, I think an active says around
8313040	8314320	Christmas and ends after new year's.
8314320	8318160	I don't know why I thought it started after Christmas and it could be wrong.
8318160	8320400	All I know is that my wallet can't take it this year.
8320400	8321400	All right.
8321400	8326040	Uh, there is a new MMO coming to PlayStation four, uh, but this one's going to be a little
8326040	8327040	different.
8327040	8328800	It's a game called wander.
8328800	8333320	And uh, in a note to the PlayStation blog this week that was written, uh, they talked
8333320	8337800	about this game and how it is a non combat MMO.
8337800	8342880	You explore an environment in several different forms, a giant tree, a soaring Griffin, a
8342880	8344780	sea creature and more.
8344780	8348640	So this is a game about exploration, but you don't fight.
8348640	8354280	Uh, you can, uh, you find clues by examining your surroundings and you might find other
8354280	8357760	people who help you and share information.
8357760	8362520	And uh, you may hear like opera singers and that leads you to something else.
8362520	8366320	I there's a, in some way this kind of sounds like what, what if they made like an MMO
8366320	8367320	out of journey?
8367320	8368320	That's almost what this sounds like.
8368320	8370040	It sounds really fascinating though.
8370040	8375280	Like I like this idea of like, this is a game about exploration and that's it.
8375280	8376900	I kind of, I'm like that one indie game.
8376900	8377900	I don't remember.
8377900	8379440	I'm trying to remember what game it was now.
8379440	8380440	I have it.
8380440	8384040	I'm just, ah, the hell's it called?
8384040	8391560	Um, it was very like low, like pixely and just kind of wandered around and stuff happened.
8391600	8395960	So missed, yeah, missed on was, uh, reminds me of this a little bit cause I don't remember
8395960	8398220	there really being comment missed on proteus.
8398220	8399560	It reminds me of proteus.
8399560	8400560	That's the game.
8400560	8405440	Well, anyway, wander will be playable at the PlayStation experience in Las Vegas.
8405440	8409840	So I'm sure we'll be hearing more, uh, out of this is our Vegas guy vid powers.
8409840	8411560	He going to the PlayStation thing too.
8411560	8412560	I bet.
8412560	8413560	All right.
8413560	8415640	Uh, let's go to the mailbag.
8415640	8420900	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com and a dark soccer dives
8420900	8423500	into the mailbag and find some emails to read.
8423500	8424980	But Oh, she's not here.
8424980	8430340	So I guess I'll put on her gloves and dive in the mailbag.
8430340	8439180	Again, that's participate at orange lounge, radio.com if you want to send us emails.
8439180	8441140	And I was very bad and not logged in already.
8441140	8442340	So I'm logging in right now.
8442340	8443340	Sorry guys.
8443340	8445220	I remember there being, Oh my God.
8445220	8448500	It just, Oh, I was like the mailbox exploded.
8448500	8451700	Oh, cause we're already getting entries for the jack box contest.
8451700	8452700	Hooray.
8452700	8453700	Uh, let's see.
8453700	8456580	Would it be wrong to peek at some of them?
8456580	8457580	No, I'm not going to pee.
8457580	8458580	Okay.
8458580	8459580	Maybe I'll peek at one.
8459580	8460580	All right.
8460580	8462380	The surfing Slurpee says, hi, Rob, Jamie and Loki.
8462380	8468140	I was wondering if you guys do anything special when picking up a hotly anticipated game on
8468140	8471900	release day, I skipped the gym Tuesday is leg day.
8471900	8475740	Anyway, get a six pack of Dortmunder gold.
8475740	8478220	I don't know that, but it sounds like alcohol.
8478220	8485900	Uh, go to Penn station subs for an eight inch Italian Giggity with large fries.
8485900	8486900	I see what you did.
8486900	8493380	It took me a minute and he's Italian with large fries and a sweet tea game pig out and
8493380	8494380	regret it later.
8494380	8495380	There's some Ursa B Slurpee.
8495380	8498100	Do you have any rituals for new game releases?
8498100	8499100	That's a good question.
8499100	8503540	I have to, I honestly, I don't, I love your idea that you pick up a sandwich and go to
8503540	8504540	town.
8504540	8505540	That sounds really good.
8505540	8507740	Considering how terrible my family does.
8507740	8508740	You're making us hungry.
8508740	8512580	Um, no, but I, I really don't have a ritual.
8512580	8514500	I don't really go to midnight releases anymore.
8514500	8517340	I would say my ritual is sitting by the door.
8517340	8518340	Is ups here yet?
8518340	8519340	Is ups here yet?
8519340	8520340	Cause I kind of buy my game.
8520340	8521340	Seriously.
8521340	8522340	Fuck the midnight releases.
8522340	8523340	Okay.
8523340	8527780	Now I'm not sure if this was a special exception with, um, grand theft auto, but that shit
8527780	8530580	fucking unlocked at 9 PM the day before.
8530580	8531580	Yeah.
8531580	8532980	But then you have to buy digital.
8532980	8533980	Who gives a shit?
8534420	8536420	I was going to pay $60 anyways.
8536420	8542780	Oh, I'm going to sell grand theft auto one of the greatest games to ever grace the consoles.
8542780	8545940	Or you convince someone to go to the midnight releases for you.
8545940	8547220	And that's what I did with dragon age inquisition.
8547220	8549300	I was like, Shane, you're going to get the game.
8549300	8553340	Or it's like a game like call of duty where they give you a copy on PS3 and PlayStation
8553340	8555220	four for the same price.
8555220	8558500	Actually interesting enough, since I brought that up, the dragon age inquisition thing,
8558500	8560900	they GameStop started selling it at nine o'clock here.
8560900	8562460	Um, they didn't do a midnight sale.
8562460	8566020	They did a nine o'clock sale, uh, and I think it's because of digital.
8566020	8569380	I think GameStop has finally started saying, look, if you guys release it digitally at
8569380	8572180	nine o'clock, we're going to start selling it because they make their own fucking rules.
8572180	8574940	They, you know, basically, Oh, the street date is this.
8574940	8575940	Yeah.
8575940	8576940	Well, fuck you.
8576940	8577940	We're going to do what we want.
8577940	8578940	What are you going to do?
8578940	8579940	Not sell at GameStop.
8579940	8580940	Yeah.
8580940	8581940	Right.
8581940	8582940	I'm kind of not surprised that they're playing hard ball like that actually.
8582940	8583940	So sorry.
8583940	8584940	I didn't mean to derail a little bit.
8584940	8588620	There has to be certainly your question, but, um, just glad to not have to deal with that
8588620	8589620	drama anymore.
8589620	8592780	I just, I just tried to make the time.
8592780	8594620	I don't for MMOs.
8594620	8600900	I've taken the day off of work talking about productive life playing with MMOs.
8600900	8604100	I've taken days off work to play that, but I've done that too.
8604100	8609140	I remember when Final Fantasy 11 first came out, I had like two days off work when that
8609140	8610740	it came out so I could play Final Fantasy 11.
8610740	8611740	Love.
8611740	8612740	It was amazing.
8612740	8613740	It was amazing.
8613740	8614740	Those is good.
8614740	8615740	Good times.
8615740	8616740	When the fuck is that going to free play?
8616740	8619060	You know, way after Final Fantasy 11.
8619060	8621460	Come on, come on.
8621460	8622460	Come on.
8622460	8623460	All right.
8623460	8624460	Let's see.
8624460	8628720	Uh, Raging Nader has emailed us saying, Hey, peeps, it's your favorite person in the world.
8628720	8629720	Raging Nader.
8629720	8631780	I just thought I'd pose some questions this week.
8631780	8632780	Actually.
8632780	8633780	I want to go back to the chat real quick.
8633780	8636940	Cause I want to see if anybody else said what they're what they do.
8636940	8639660	Cause I liked the question about the rituals.
8639660	8640660	Let's see.
8640660	8642440	Uh, Borat says, I want a big greasy hamburger.
8642440	8645060	I'm jealous of California for in and out burger.
8645500	8648020	Um, to be honest, you should be really fries.
8648020	8649020	Well done.
8649020	8650020	Marvelous.
8650020	8651020	Anyway.
8651020	8655580	Uh, but we don't have Dunkin Donuts and I love the coffee.
8655580	8657200	So there is a trade off there.
8657200	8661860	Now I would, I would give up Dunkin Donuts coffee to keep in an upper, but I'm just saying
8661860	8662860	there is a trade off.
8662860	8663860	Anyway.
8663860	8667620	Um, Kai's judo saying pre-order killed the midnight release as a Joe and under Matt saying
8667620	8670420	console midnight releases could be fun with friends again.
8670420	8674980	Uh, last time I did a console midnight release, uh, extra for waiting in line for me, it was
8674980	8675980	awesome.
8675980	8680140	I think we should do one Rob for a game that's not hotly anticipated.
8680140	8682340	Well, I guess they don't really do that.
8682340	8684980	Do they do midnight releases for popular games?
8684980	8690700	Well, you can go and then show up and be like, well, I'm here to get, you know, Barbie fun
8690700	8693460	pack, you know, hello kitty Island adventure or whatever.
8693460	8694460	Right.
8694460	8695460	All right.
8695460	8696460	Sorry.
8696460	8697460	We don't have that delivered yet.
8697460	8698460	Back to regionators email.
8698460	8699460	Sorry.
8699460	8700460	I just thought I'd post some questions this week.
8700460	8701460	Yes.
8701460	8702460	I'd mentioned on Bobby's show tonight.
8702460	8703460	Steam is an upcoming sale this week.
8703460	8706260	Is there any games that you folks are looking to pick up during the sale?
8706260	8707660	God, I don't know.
8707660	8711780	See, here's the thing is I can't buy any modern games anymore cause my laptop cannot run that
8711780	8712780	shit.
8712780	8716940	I mean it barely, it was, it was Titanfall melted my last laptop.
8716940	8723880	So this one, you know, it runs Titanfall sort of, I mean it, I can't really pick up anything
8723880	8728380	that's non indie and even some of those indie games I can't, and there's really not anything
8728380	8730960	out there that's like, shit, I don't have this yet.
8730960	8734860	I can't really remember off the top of my head, but I know I have a wishlist on steam
8734860	8738280	and I'm sure if something on there gets low enough, I'll buy it.
8738280	8742960	Sometimes I have a tendency to buy like indie games that just look cool, especially if they
8742960	8743960	get really cheap.
8743960	8747320	Like they're just like between like under five bucks because you know, I have money
8747320	8751080	in my steam wallet, so if something gets cheap enough, I might just be like, eh, why not?
8751080	8752120	Let's buy it.
8752120	8754040	Super hexagon for 39 cents.
8754040	8755040	What the fuck?
8755040	8756040	Why not?
8756040	8757040	Of course.
8757040	8758040	Let's see.
8758040	8761640	Uh, on a semi related note, I imagine that you all have a fairly decent sized gaming
8761640	8764920	pile of shame in regards to unplayed steam games.
8764920	8769920	If you were to make a rough guesstimate, how many games or what percentage of your games
8769920	8778720	remain unplayed for me of my 457 steam games, roughly 43% of my games remain untouched.
8778720	8782000	Oh, this is, this is a dick question.
8782000	8783500	This is, this is shame.
8783500	8785460	This is shame right here.
8785460	8786460	What is it?
8786460	8791020	What percentage of your library, it's loading, it's, it's taking its sweet time loading.
8791020	8792020	All right.
8792020	8793020	Rob's is 100%.
8793020	8799860	No, I, I, in all, I'm going to be honest, I'm going to guess it's like 60.
8799860	8800940	Only 60?
8800940	8801940	Only 60.
8801940	8802940	Are you lying to me?
8802940	8808380	Uh, if you combine Alan and I's library, it's probably more like 80, but it's, I would say,
8808380	8809380	I would say 60.
8809380	8814020	Does it count just if you play it for like an hour or two and then set it aside?
8814020	8815660	I mean, what are we talking about?
8815660	8819820	I think that counts, but like if I loaded it to see the title screen and that's it,
8819820	8820820	then it doesn't count.
8820820	8821820	Okay.
8821820	8827440	But the reason why is, is humble bundles and bundled games and things like I bought an
8827440	8830740	X com bundle and I played maybe one game in the bundle.
8830740	8832640	So I mean, keep in mind, there's things like that.
8832640	8835740	Like it's not like I buy all these games just to never play them.
8835740	8836900	I get a lot of games.
8836900	8842720	I just wasn't really looking for, and I just remember just saw an update and I just remembered
8842720	8846840	something that, um, a new story I'm going to talk about later, but that's fine.
8846840	8853080	But no, to go back to what I have, 301 games, I guarantee I've probably played about 3%
8853080	8860540	of those if, if, if, if not less than that, I think I literally, I don't even remember
8860540	8863760	how many games I played, but I've played like less than 5%.
8863760	8868120	Your answer to Ray's question is 97% of your library is unplayed.
8868400	8874200	That's probably, that's probably a very conservative estimate that I, I betting it's a lot higher
8874200	8878840	than that, that I have not played that I would have to go and look at all my, I'm sure they've
8878840	8881840	got some sort of record somewhere of what you've actually played.
8881840	8882840	All right.
8882840	8885560	Lastly, enrage nators email finally on an unrelated note.
8885560	8889040	Is there any chance that we can get another Rob diva fit?
8889040	8893220	It's been a few years since the infamous one and in my humble opinion, we're kind of overdue
8893220	8895080	for one.
8895080	8896440	No.
8896440	8898480	You cannot have another diva fit.
8898480	8901480	I don't get paid enough on this show to have a diva fit on demand.
8901480	8903480	I'm not your fucking switch.
8903480	8906080	That's the best I could do.
8906080	8907080	All right.
8907080	8908080	Uh, let's see.
8908080	8914640	Uh, we have a few emails here from Robert M and I think one of them was a follow up.
8914640	8915640	Oh yes.
8915640	8919720	Uh, let me get to this main email here that he had sent.
8919720	8925360	Not to be quote that guy, but I believe battle toads was a joint project between rare and
8925360	8926600	trade west.
8926600	8931440	The latter of whom was owned after bankruptcy, at least in name by midway according to my
8931440	8932880	limited research.
8932880	8936680	Who knows if a new game would require Warner brothers involvement?
8936680	8937680	That's a very good question.
8937680	8940400	I'm straight and you're not being that guy.
8940400	8942840	I'm, I'm okay with being wrong.
8942840	8948480	You guys like nobody out there knows every single trade was because they remember they
8948480	8949480	had the didn't.
8949480	8950480	Yeah.
8950480	8951480	There's battle toads versus double dragon.
8951480	8952480	Dragon.
8952480	8953480	Yeah.
8953480	8954480	Yeah.
8954600	8957720	It was just, I don't claim to know every single nook and cranny about gaming.
8957720	8961800	Um, probably captain spike a game, but we probably does know everything about gaming
8961800	8962800	on it.
8962800	8964080	He's probably the closest person I've met.
8964080	8968680	Um, but yeah, I mean like that's why I love doing live radio because you guys kind of
8968680	8972660	give that instant feedback and you know, if you're not listening live, you can email us.
8972660	8977160	So don't be afraid to email us and say, Hey, you got something wrong on the show.
8977160	8980000	As long as you know, there's the presentation is everything.
8980000	8983560	Cause if you email us going, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'll just be like, Oh, the delete
8983560	8984560	key.
8984560	8985560	How'd that get hit?
8985560	8990400	Um, but if you email us as you did saying, Hey, I think this might actually be the case.
8990400	8994280	Then I go, Oh, that's, that sounds like an informed opinion.
8994280	8995600	Gold star for user.
8995600	9000720	Also, I recently restored and rebuilt my iPod touch to try to fix some play counts, sinking
9000720	9005800	and memory issues, losing my game saves and other data in the process I had just purchased
9005800	9010100	and finished the forgotten shores expansion to monument Valley, which was despite negativity
9010100	9011700	and reviews for the DLC cost.
9011700	9013620	Absolutely worth the asking price.
9013620	9017380	However, the app does not currently have a restores purchases option.
9017380	9021380	I did send the developer feedback and I'm waiting for a reply, by the way, he did get
9021380	9022380	that feedback.
9022380	9024260	He said there is a restore purchases option.
9024260	9025660	He heard back from the developer there.
9025660	9027660	So there you go.
9027660	9031420	Um, thank you for the email.
9031420	9032420	Appreciate that.
9032420	9038280	Uh, I think there's no, that was the email on, uh, the sandwiches, the eight inch Italian.
9038280	9039540	So that's it.
9039540	9043560	So if you want to email us, participate at orange laundry.com, don't forget the Jackbox
9043560	9045060	contest going on as well.
9045060	9050100	Make sure Jackbox is in the subject there and you can win a copy of a five in one game
9050100	9051100	pack.
9051100	9052100	It's an instant party.
9052100	9053100	You want this.
9053100	9054100	Yeah, it's good.
9054100	9055100	It's in.
9055100	9056860	And if you're on PlayStation four, you can share play and you're gonna have a party in
9056860	9057860	two homes.
9057860	9058860	Mm hmm.
9058860	9059860	Lice water has like a hundred players.
9059860	9060860	Right?
9060860	9063940	You have a party in an auditorium if you wanted to.
9063940	9064940	All right.
9064940	9069500	Uh, let's get to the F use of the week cause every week we get angsty.
9069500	9070500	Why?
9070500	9089020	I guess gamers have a lot of angst on them.
9089020	9090740	Loki wants to start us off.
9090740	9099140	Uh, F you goes to Jack in the box who don't know how to make fucking sandwich is nasty.
9099140	9103620	Uh, Irene, do you have some F use of the week?
9103620	9114460	Uh, F you to flaky ass people who are just a bunch of dicks and my cat Jonas F you to
9114460	9118740	best buy for forgetting my, um, pre-order for smash brothers.
9118740	9120980	You're not the only one they screwed over, by the way.
9120980	9122500	I'm hearing a lot of that on Facebook.
9122500	9125900	The best buy really fucked it up with those pre-orders just so you know.
9125900	9127580	So that's a big F you right there.
9127580	9131420	Um, another F he goes to the people playing Pokemon.
9131420	9136660	Some of the people in Pokemon Omega Ruby alpha server saying, Oh my God, Salamence is broken.
9136660	9142500	God, for fuck's sake, play the game long enough to before saying something is broken.
9142500	9143500	The same.
9143500	9148100	And of course, another big F you to some of the members of project M. Yes, I'm calling
9148100	9149860	your asses out.
9149860	9154660	If you don't like Super Smash Brothers 4, stick to your, um, Smash Brothers melee or
9154660	9159480	your project or the worst part project M. I'm tired of hearing your God damn complaints
9159480	9166540	about Oh, put project M in the game room when we have Smash 4 enough said, or you can all
9166540	9175140	suck my balls, but seriously though, stop complaining and adapt to the new, um, new
9175140	9176140	games and stuff.
9176140	9177460	You guys want to play the old games?
9177460	9178460	Go for it.
9178460	9179460	Don't, but don't go wrong.
9179460	9182980	Dictating other people what they should and shouldn't play.
9182980	9185780	Or you can suck his balls.
9185780	9189380	Uh, going to, um, my F you of the week.
9189380	9195180	I did not really look at this, act depth, found some website that will actually analyze
9195180	9197940	your steam library for you.
9197940	9206400	And apparently I have 238 games, 144 of which I have not played.
9206400	9207400	That is 61%.
9207400	9208400	Wow.
9208400	9210220	Did I call out?
9210220	9211220	That's that's pretty good.
9211220	9212220	That's pretty good.
9212220	9213220	That's pretty good.
9213220	9214220	I'm impressed.
9214220	9215220	All right.
9215220	9216220	Shock.
9216220	9217220	Fear.
9217220	9218220	My meat.
9218220	9219220	My meat.
9219220	9220220	Laughs.
9220220	9225580	Well, and my terrible English skills.
9225580	9227380	I don't want to fear your meat, Rob.
9227380	9229860	That's my meat lab skills.
9229860	9233020	Well, there you go.
9233020	9234420	Look at that.
9234420	9236980	I was quite conservative in my guests.
9236980	9242580	It says I have not played 89% of my library, not 97%.
9242580	9243820	You know what?
9243820	9245060	Just F you to that whole bit.
9245060	9250460	Well, I guess I'll just have to buy more games so that that number gets up to 97%.
9250460	9251460	I know.
9251460	9254220	Now I'm going to go in tonight and just launch each one of those games just to spite you
9254220	9255220	people.
9255220	9256220	Install them first.
9256220	9259900	Then I'll give you some meat to fear.
9259900	9261900	All right.
9261900	9267140	Let's do a couple more news stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one
9267140	9275820	eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype, Roaring Ounge ADO.
9275820	9277460	All one word.
9277460	9278460	Low key.
9278460	9279460	Congratulation.
9279460	9280460	Congratulation.
9280460	9286820	You got to move on over to the Skype line.
9286820	9288060	OK.
9288060	9294860	So Assassin's Creed Unity is getting a third patch, which will hopefully fix the whole
9294860	9297780	face off glitches.
9297780	9305780	So yes, apparently they've still got their I want to say it's like a weekly blog or daily
9305780	9306780	blog.
9306780	9309340	I don't know what some sort of blog that they have or they're keeping track of everything.
9309340	9313980	The third update will be larger in scope and it says they're going to patch bugs like
9313980	9318060	are getting stuck in certain areas of the map or glitching in and getting in and out
9318060	9321660	of cover problems.
9321660	9322660	So yeah.
9322660	9328060	So apparently the patch will dramatically improve the experience.
9328060	9329060	So more faces off.
9329060	9330060	I don't know.
9330060	9331060	We'll see.
9331060	9332060	All right.
9332060	9333700	They'll be patching in fun.
9333700	9334700	But next patch.
9334700	9340300	And of course I like I like this little like you know this under promise over deliver type
9340300	9347780	of phrasing here but it is noted though that this patch won't solve every problem.
9347780	9350220	Some of them.
9350220	9351220	All right.
9351220	9356380	Well you know folks have been asking when will Final Fantasy 7 be remade for the PlayStation
9356380	9357860	3 or the PlayStation 4.
9357860	9359820	When is that going to happen people?
9359820	9362900	And the answer is it's happened.
9362900	9363900	That's right.
9363900	9364900	It was remade.
9364900	9365900	Final Fantasy 7.
9365900	9366900	Oh wait.
9366900	9367900	There's a twist though.
9367900	9368900	It was remade in LittleBigPlanet.
9368900	9369900	Whoa Rob.
9369900	9374700	You had me going there for a minute.
9374700	9376900	Was your heart palapatating a little bit there?
9376900	9377900	Absolutely.
9377900	9378900	I knew it.
9378900	9379900	I knew it.
9379900	9380900	All right.
9380900	9382780	Fear the meat of this game.
9382780	9387340	Final Fantasy 7 remade in LittleBigPlanet 2.
9387340	9388340	Apparently it's on YouTube.
9388340	9390940	You can watch one hundred and seven videos on YouTube.
9390940	9393460	The entire story in Final Fantasy 7.
9393460	9395700	Apparently this took this guy like years to build.
9395700	9401860	It was in LittleBigPlanet 2's engine and there's a whole website being created for this.
9401860	9410340	It's Final Fantasy VII LittleBigPlanet2.weebly.com and that's where you can follow more updates
9410340	9411780	on this and you can watch it on YouTube.
9411780	9412780	It's something else.
9412780	9414860	I want to know can I download and play it?
9414860	9420060	Because apparently the LittleBigPlanet 2 levels are supposed to be playable in 3 so I can
9420060	9421740	play my Final Fantasy 7 remake.
9421740	9425660	You can and I've watched video of it and it's derpy as fuck but okay.
9425660	9427660	Okay but still come on.
9427660	9429180	It's quite the accomplishment.
9429180	9436940	It's quite the accomplishment but it's quite the derpy fucking accomplishment.
9436940	9437940	Here's the thing though.
9437940	9442660	Nothing will ever beat that level I played in the original LittleBigPlanet that was the
9442660	9444060	Parker Posey level.
9444060	9446060	I remember that.
9446060	9453380	It was like a fucking creepy ass stalker thing and you would unlock pictures of Parker Posey
9453380	9457740	as you played the levels and it was like a tribute to Parker Posey level.
9457740	9459100	It was like a long lengthy level.
9459100	9462700	That was my favorite LittleBigPlanet level I ever played was the Parker Posey tribute.
9462700	9463700	So that's still in the game.
9463700	9465100	You should check that out.
9465100	9467740	Anyhow, there it is.
9467740	9468980	All the news we have on deck for tonight.
9468980	9473820	So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype
9473820	9478260	OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we have or haven't
9478260	9480060	talked about tonight.

9490900	9497300	update for one of the best games that came out was it last year was it even this year

9536740	9540420	just you know all right look the phone is ringing we got to get some calls hi at OrangeLoungeRadio
9540420	9545260	who's this it's the only person with the fastest internet out of everyone in the chat room
9545260	9551340	it is Rama hey Rama how you doing I'm doing good I just finished cooking an amazing dinner
9551340	9556860	I'm sorry say it again I said I'm doing good I just cooked an amazing dinner an amazing
9556860	9560700	dinner you probably could have made a better sandwich than the one Loki got well I'll tell
9560700	9563860	you what next time I come out there's always you have a crock pot I'll put together a mean
9563860	9568500	little dinner for all y'all oh you better bet we have a crock pot we're a couple of guys living
9568500	9574860	here in this house we love crock pots that's what I'm talking about it's great for a dinner
9574860	9580820	and booze what's on your mind my friend a couple of things everyone you were talking about your
9580820	9587220	Steam library and how many games you have and how many games you get to play and I'm like right
9587220	9596060	now I'm staring at my ps2 ps3 Xbox Xbox 360 collection and I'm just like out of all these
9596060	9600540	games I can probably count on both hands how many games I have sat here and played it's gotten to
9600540	9604660	the point where I'm just buying them just to say that I have it because I know if I don't buy it
9604660	9610500	now I will not be able to get my hands on it later so you buy games just in fear that they're
9611060	9617420	disappear off the shelf too quick kind of sort of like project diva I kind of had to sell my soul
9617420	9621740	to the devil and go to the shame stop to pick up the cop because it was only available there
9621740	9627380	honestly that's fair I understand that sometimes sometimes you have to do what you have to do
9627380	9634660	mm-hmm pretty much sounds like Xenoblade let's not go there that pissed me off oh you think that's
9634660	9638980	something I was looking at shame stops Black Friday said they put Metroid Prime trilogy up
9638980	9644340	there for 50 bucks oh gee what a steal it's gonna be more like how many people are gonna
9644340	9650420	be going from store to store to store to store to find it oh I do want to get my hands on that
9650420	9655740	though at some point I mean you know it's just I refuse to pay all that money for it I mean 50
9655740	9659980	bucks is not bad I mean I will go looking for you but to be perfectly honest their Black Friday
9659980	9665900	sales are kind of shitty to share yeah I know I understand what else you said there were a few
9665900	9672660	things another thing is um if you don't remember but I'm also staffing a convention coming up in
9672660	9677260	about two weeks called derpy con I Jamie's been talking about that on the show so yeah I thought
9677260	9681180	for some reason that was like this weekend so it's a couple weeks out yeah this weekend was like the
9681180	9686580	final meeting for everybody to get together and had the bag party got it got it so give us the
9686580	9691780	details on the con cuz I I don't know much about it besides that it's called derpy con well derpy
9691780	9699060	con is a multi-genre con so it's anime fantasy sci-fi all of it so it's gonna be panels about
9699060	9705340	various things and on behalf of our network anime jam session we'll be doing a live podcast and I
9705340	9713540	will also be hosting the karaoke contest oh nice mm-hmm where where is it in New York City actually
9713540	9719380	no it's in the Hyatt Moore's the Hyatt at Morristown New Jersey it's basically three blocks
9719380	9723660	from the train station there are plenty of food places around and is a movie theater built in
9723660	9728500	like not built inside the hotel but next to the hotel is a convention center and if you go around
9728500	9734940	the corner within there there's a movie theater is that why you're calling it derpy con cuz it's in
9734940	9745180	New Jersey you would think come on that was too easy come on too easy oh New Jersey is I love I
9745260	9750020	love your return stepbrother we all know that you know but I love New Jersey for the record I had a
9750020	9755660	great I have great I great memories with Rama in New Jersey one good thing about Jersey gas it's
9755660	9760300	like two dollars and fifty three cents a gallon and you can't pump it yourself yeah because
9760300	9767140	somebody tried it once burnt down a gas station that's all right or organs the same way anyway
9767140	9773860	anyway but but what's cool is that the way we're doing our game room we're going old school oh
9774260	9780220	really yes we're doing we're looking at Nintendo Super Nintendo and 64 Dreamcast nice maybe even
9780220	9785480	Xbox ps1 ps2 we're just we're just keeping it old school what you didn't invite the teabaggers to
9785480	9795060	get out the u-haul and drive out to Jersey realize that the teabaggers came out here there is quantum
9795060	9800220	game there are other gaming groups that are like it will probably run them out of the area oh oh
9800740	9810260	is this turning into West Side Story when you're a teabag you know you're a tub anyway actually
9810260	9814420	might know some people there I was I'm not sure like what groups are actually curious which groups
9814420	9820340	are actually gonna be at the gaming section actually work we're doing our own work we're
9820340	9824780	doing with some cars that we're just gonna purchase older consoles or a couple of staffers
9824780	9829540	gonna bring in their older consoles for play so in pretty much in-house pretty much yeah I like
9829540	9838220	the big conventions like anime next Otacon they will they'll have their own consoles conventions
9838220	9844740	like Zenkai a USA they'll get a third party and they'll usually be affiliated with a gaming con
9844740	9851980	such as too many games such as as an example of one of the bigger local smaller local gaming cons
9851980	9857620	in the area well you said Otacon correct you said Otacon has their own in-house funding for game
9857620	9863820	room I thought that was being funded by um or at least covered by um what's that group up save point
9863820	9871300	save point not my knowledge if it's changed it's might have been recently because I have not gone
9871300	9877700	to Otacon in like about a year or so so if that's changed I I had no idea but when you go in there
9877700	9884220	you'll see like the boxes with the consoles it'll say property of Otacorp well be sure to share your
9884220	9888540	plans with Jonas he can tell you everything you're doing wrong I'm kidding I'm kidding okay you know
9888540	9894180	what he can do that I'll send him directly to the department of gate of video games and if you like
9894180	9899980	dealing with the rock that's all you I just sit here I deal with the karaoke and then when the
9899980	9907180	contest is over I break out the flask turn on open mic and Lego dear Lord that's it you know I wish
9907180	9911140	I'd had some warning I would have loved to come out to derpy con and if you say karaoke I'm sure
9911140	9918460	I could have gotten Irene out there too are doing a midnight thing for midnight karaoke so yeah you
9918460	9925180	know it's nice well our staffers are rocky horror oh it's all I will plan now for derpy con to
9925180	9929500	electric boogaloo you don't say it too loud because you know Jamie would jump right into
9929500	9936180	your arm luggage for that one she is staff so yeah I know I know she's been talking about some
9936180	9941660	of the design work she's been doing for it so okay so so that'll be fun to have that take a
9941660	9945860	lot of pictures since I can't be there I guess now is this good of a time to any to announce
9945860	9955460	this we're speaking about cons and East Coast um I am coming to Boston which convention I'm coming
9955460	9968700	to PAX East trolling me right now bro I'm not I'm not telling you I'm seriously coming out
9968700	9981300	to PAX East so yeah I will be out there what is it like the plane tickets are bought I have the
9981300	9996860	receipts um I didn't but we have a way anyway so that's so yeah I will see you guys well I guess
9996860	10002140	that you're not gonna come to PAX East then oh did you did you oh you probably weren't there
10002140	10008180	here's the thing I subscribe to all of their social media so I know exactly when the tickets
10008180	10015860	were going on sale when the hotels were going up right they waited 20 minutes after they opened it
10015860	10020900	up and made announcements on social media that tickets were available in the hotel were available
10020900	10028940	oh my god I jumped on it three a badges were gone oh my god by the end of the day at 6 p.m.
10028940	10037380	when I was leaving work the entire conventions was sold out and I'm like I refuse to drop $800
10037380	10042980	on a scalper for this and I refuse to I'm not doing it that's not stressing myself over this
10042980	10048700	forget it that's what you need to do is wait for that second wave that they'll put up from the
10048700	10055020	scalper tickets they recover they won't they won't they will no they didn't do it for New York Comic
10055020	10060460	Con well that let's not get into that but let's just say they were they said they were doing it
10060460	10065180	for New York Comic Con I was following a few of the scalpers let's just say the eBay auctions were
10065180	10073140	still up there so frustrating I it's scalpers suck awful but what I will do maybe if Mako
10073140	10078100	Chan is up to it maybe we will day trip up there we can hang out or something there you know we'll
10078100	10082300	figure something out there you go it'll be a party all right I gotta let you go so we get more calls
10082300	10088980	but wow I just dropped a bombshell in the chat room apparently because I did I posted on Twitter
10088980	10093820	I'm like by the way I'm coming to Boston March something to something so he missed that tweet
10093860	10098540	alright well maybe Twitter's hiding things now too with Facebook all right take care buddy are
10098540	10102820	you taking a bro all right bye bye time difference doesn't help either you know cuz if I post
10102820	10106300	something at midnight then it's like 3 a.m. for the East Coast so maybe that's how they missed it
10106300	10111540	I don't know anyhow one eight seven seven game olr or a username on Skype orange lounge radio if
10111540	10114420	you'd like to give us a call let's get some more calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
10114420	10122900	hello Paul here hey pal what's up kind of tired doing packing and stuff like that but everything
10122900	10129900	okay going on a trip and no we're probably moving so he tried to do slowly no waiting
10129900	10136380	until last minute oh probably well moving is like punishment for shoplifting in some countries I'm
10136380	10142060	pretty sure yeah yeah I think of some countries illegal or something it's just thorough what's
10142060	10149780	up buddy I was caught I was going just for my opinion regarding the amiibo um I bought some
10149780	10157140	and it worked different I expected but not so certain necessarily a bad thing I was convinced
10157140	10162540	that we're not gonna be something like kind of more casual but it's strange and strangely enough
10162540	10168940	I feel like it worked more for a hardcore gamer than for a casual gamer which I find it really
10168940	10175460	strange if you compare it with the skylander or or business infinity how so what what made you
10175460	10183340	decide that it was more of a hardcore thing because I don't see a kid for example buying
10183340	10192300	one and saying oh I really want to figure that we're learn to fight the same way I fight I just
10192300	10198260	don't see a kid saying oh that's a great idea but if you're really really good in a smash which I'm
10198260	10204780	not but if you're really really good and you train it they really end up fighting then what you do
10204780	10212300	like for example I jump a lot and I always forget to block because I just forget then they figured
10212300	10218940	out after it reaches a high level like 40 or 50 it really played the way I play like I forget to
10218940	10225020	cover all the time and it a jump all the time and it was kind of annoying it was hard to play like
10225020	10229820	a fighting against a ghost of myself or something you know I need to know if they're gonna put out
10229820	10234900	an amiibo for the master hand because that's the only time I remember to block is on that stupid
10234900	10242140	hand I never remember to block and I never remember to grab and when someone does online
10242140	10252620	I'm like what it was oh yeah it's growing but I think it's it can I like it but I think it has
10252620	10257340	some kind of a strange identity crisis because that kind of toys is probably really appealing
10257420	10263620	for kids but the usefulness in this match it feels like it's way more if you're really into this
10263620	10268020	match and you want to like train yourself or something like that because it's a really an
10268020	10274540	AI that adapts to your gameplay which I don't see that is really kids friendly so I like it
10274540	10280460	but it's a strange is definitely not the way I expected but which amiibos did you pick up I got
10280860	10292740	the really classic ones like Mario Donkey Kong I got the ones that I was worried and maybe in a
10292740	10297780	year from now two years from now when Nintendo decides to do amiibo amiibo world or something
10297780	10303380	party with you and then suddenly will be all remember those amiibos I even buy well now you
10303380	10307980	can use in this game but nobody can find that figure in I hear some of those figures are already
10308620	10313100	going up in price and getting harder to find because yay scalpers but apparently Marth is
10313100	10317220	one of the harder to find figures that just came out and some people are seeing it on eBay already
10317220	10324180	for 30 bucks so it's like and we all knew this stupid shit would happen so I'm whatever yeah I
10324180	10329180	wish sometimes they put some limit to people I'm not never gonna do that but I know it was
10329180	10336140	ridiculous like 24 hours later just checking eBay it was just that the reselling was insane
10336380	10340740	like I'm sure just people go around Walmart just buying all of them or something oh yeah
10340740	10345340	it's a whole thing there's probably seedy websites they gather Intel on and what's going to be
10345340	10351540	popular and how to get them but anyway all right yeah they sell pre-sales all right well pal I'm
10351540	10354300	gonna let you go so we can get more calls but I'm glad to hear you have a good time with amiibos
10354300	10359540	thank you and also I follow your other program I discovered the other a and even though I don't
10359540	10365300	play Wow I don't play Final Fantasy 14 I really enjoy it well thank you grandpa and next for will
10365300	10372020	appreciate the plug all right all right bye it's good to hear from pal and look at this the
10372020	10375980	skyline lighting up oh my gosh just call after call try to get at least one more in hi you're
10375980	10379380	on orange ons radio who's this yeah what's up this guy judo hey guys you know what's on your
10379380	10385900	mind buddy I'm gonna tell you in one second I just wanted to to tell that last caller what he
10385900	10392020	could do is if he's not really that good at smash have his amiibo fight with him instead of against
10392020	10396980	him and it'll pick up from like what the computer is doing and it'll get a lot better than what he
10396980	10402700	can teach it and also amiibo versus amiibo is a lot is like 10 times better than um you fighting
10402700	10406740	your amiibo so in other words you could just put the amiibo in there with a bunch of CPU characters
10406740	10412380	at level 9 and why don't you just learn from the best yeah exactly even though those level
10412380	10417580	nines aren't really that great it's like they tell you to I just fight amiibo versus amiibo
10417580	10423940	interest like you know yeah is it is I think it's really cool I think um I kind of disagree I think
10423940	10428620	I think kids don't enjoy it it's kind of like you know it's like a kid has a little a little
10428620	10433540	little buddy to take along with him and play if he doesn't have you know if his friends don't have
10433540	10437820	the game or is late at night and he can't have friends over just pop that little sucker in there
10437820	10442540	and you have a little sparring partner it's better set a fight in the computer I think kids will be
10442540	10447420	in it probably more for just the figures themselves but I think pow had a decent point that like
10447820	10452700	kids may not be thinking on that secondary level where adults are like oh I gotta get this cuz
10452700	10457260	it's gonna unlock here and it'll be easy here and dah dah dah but I don't know I then again I thought
10457260	10462460	that like game the nine years old I subscribe I could I could I could remember being a kid and
10462460	10468020	when I was a kid there was never a time where I wanted a action figure based off a video game like
10468020	10473180	a video game already feels like a toy already yeah so I don't really see kids using their imagination
10473180	10478540	like getting excited over a freaking Mario figure or Princess Peach figure you like you know they
10478540	10483460	see them for what they are you know they'll they'll be looking for some other cool toy that's out
10483460	10486800	there I don't think they're necessarily gonna use these things as toys I know I wouldn't I got
10486800	10495100	excited for the princess it's like I wish that they would just have like them actually be action
10495100	10500020	figures like have it be an action figure and have the base attached to it and yeah so what if it
10500060	10503780	comes off the base at least if you have the base and you can play the game I still think these
10503780	10507700	things are gonna do better than people I don't think they're gonna like top Skylanders but I
10507700	10511460	think they're gonna do better than people are expecting and this is gonna be Nintendo's way
10511460	10517220	of saying see we didn't have to do a mobile phone game we can do this so yeah I had the I have the
10517220	10521980	Star Fox amigo and like just like look he said it's like I'm tempted to bend his arm like it
10521980	10527140	looks like an arm and bend down like he looks like a poseable action figure but you can't but
10527140	10531900	it's a really cool-looking uh whatever the hell you want to call it but what I'm here to call
10531900	10535620	about was you're talking about Ghostbusters earlier yeah and I'm have a game recommendation
10535620	10541780	for you you need to get ghost control ink on Steam it's almost it's not exactly the Ghostbusters
10541780	10546100	from the you know that you were talking about but it's kind of like kind of like a combination
10546100	10553540	of Ghostbusters and what's the other thing xcom and basically it's like it's turn-based you
10553540	10557860	travel around the city where actually you're traveling around London and you're busting
10557860	10561380	ghosts it's a lot of fun the graphics suck so if you're really in the graphics you're not probably
10561380	10565780	not gonna like it but I'm like we don't mind like the 8-bit looking graphics because I mean that's
10565780	10569980	real it looks like it's something out of Nintendo I just googled it to get a little more information
10569980	10573060	on it while you're talking about it and it looks like this is something that they got on Kickstarter
10573060	10577980	and one of these links goes to Kickstarter the graphics look like game dev tycoon or something
10577980	10581940	like that yeah yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's basically one of those I forgot what they call
10581940	10587300	them they're like like a financial simulator or a business simulator so you know you have to
10587300	10593380	balance your money you know you you upgrade your equipment it's a lot of fun it's a lot like like
10593380	10597460	I said it's not a lot like xcom but it has that ghostbusters theme to it and it's really silly
10597460	10602580	like the game doesn't take yourself serious like there's times where you pick up your um your cell
10602580	10606260	phone because you get calls while you're like you know driving around and it's just mumbles
10606900	10614980	like they talk like sims yeah yeah yeah it's completely bonkers and um it's a never-ending
10614980	10620980	game I love my sandbox and open world never-ending game so as once you beat it you can still continue
10620980	10624580	to play it for as long as you want so that's my favorite part about it there you go there's
10624580	10628340	something I'll have to keep an eye out for on the steam sale so yep all right now I'm gonna let
10628340	10632340	another call get through great show thank you so much guys you know appreciate it all right right
10632340	10637700	bye good call good call well I am going to shut down the skyline I'm very sorry to those of you
10637700	10641620	that didn't get through but we are a little bit past nine o'clock here which is supposed to be
10641620	10646660	when the show ends uh but uh I want to thank you guys for uh downloading the show tuning in and
10646660	10650180	listening tonight really appreciate it don't forget that jackbox competition don't forget
10650180	10654820	you can send us regular emails too or welcome to participate at orange laundry.com this place to
10654820	10658820	send those emails uh Loki checking in one more time for your last minute stories no but I was
10658820	10663460	going to talk a little bit more about goat simulator please mmo or you know go mmo simulator
10663460	10668340	so apparently there's a spot in the game where there's a hole in the wall you jump into the wall
10668340	10674260	you find out it's a concrete room full of servers and it being goat simulator you can smash those
10674260	10679700	servers and eventually as you smash the servers more and more stuff breaks eventually the textures
10679700	10684180	stop drying and eventually the wire frames break and eventually you get logged out
10684180	10692340	brilliant absolutely brilliant and that's all free once you buy the game I think I'm gonna
10692340	10695700	need to try to get these guys on the show for Loki because I think he's a bit of a fan they're
10696980	10703540	not they're in Europe oh well we had the geometry wars guys years and years and years ago they were
10703540	10708340	in Europe you never know you never know all right uh anyhow uh let's go around and wrap up and get
10708340	10712980	final thoughts um Jonas thank you for being here and uh best of luck with everything with the tea
10712980	10717060	bagger on through the holidays hope you have a good thanksgiving oh thank you and all that uh
10717060	10722020	what cons next for you guys sack anime in January I know just sack anime right now gotcha all right

10727060	10732260	the championships as well as Smash Brothers and and Pokemon nice coming out because I
10732260	10737300	guess people want to know when the tournament starts and if there's gonna be a player smash
10737300	10741940	in the actual game room which most likely has to be yes because there's gonna be so
10741940	10748260	many people playing smash right so get eight people through and next eight people come up next
10748260	10752820	all right well uh let me know if you do the robo amiibo competition there and I'll uh I'll uh
10752820	10758740	I'll probably buy into that my my trained at home amiibo amiibo versus amiibo mecha amiibo
10759540	10763620	anything yeah I actually can bring up a question to the people see if it's if it's if the interest
10763620	10767380	is good enough yeah we could probably pull something up maybe for SAC on like next year
10767380	10771540	since we might be doing SAC on but that's still in the works all right well good luck to you

10834820	10843540	thought uh don't forget to fear Rob's meat super meat boy
10846660	10852100	oh that's it okay yeah yeah all right fair enough uh let's see Loki your final thought tonight
10852100	10856420	uh I need to work more of a game yes you do we didn't get an update this week that means you
10856420	10862500	didn't work on it uh not necessarily I worked on like just concept stuff because I'm trying to
10862500	10870980	figure out how to redo uh the engine again just to make it faster with doing um geometry checking
10870980	10876900	and stuff like that so that I can remove extra geometry because I got to the point where I run
10876900	10885060	out of space really fast in each 3d objects on that to make a chunk system and try to find a
10885060	10890180	way to check it because before once I get like you know so many objects on the screen it would lock up
10890180	10895620	for a few seconds when you add a new one so I can't have that that doesn't work so I have to
10895620	10902820	figure out how Minecraft does it or the other other voxel games do it because that's unfortunately
10902820	10907380	I didn't want to have to do it that way but that's the way I got to do it all right and uh
10907380	10911780	as always I want to thank you guys for checking out our show and supporting independent podcasting
