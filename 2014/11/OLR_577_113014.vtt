00:00.000 --> 00:17.320
The holiday season is officially here, so prepare your wallets for sales and discounts

00:17.320 --> 00:20.060
aplenty, assuming what you want will actually be in stock.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.500
Enjoy the splendor of the season and join us for the next few hours of news, your comments

00:23.500 --> 00:30.500
and more, right here on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.540
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.540 --> 00:36.300
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.300 --> 00:44.340
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 30th of 2014 with the 577th episode of

00:44.340 --> 00:45.620
our show.

00:45.620 --> 00:50.100
I hope those of you in the states had a wonderful thanksgiving, thanks for joining us either

00:50.100 --> 00:53.940
the Sunday after if you happen to be here live, or the week after if you happen to be

00:53.940 --> 00:58.140
listening to us in the car, on your commute, at your desk at work, or however it is that

00:58.140 --> 01:00.300
you consume Orange Lounge Radio each week.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.940
Thank you guys so much for listening.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.140
We will be talking about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, probably food

01:06.140 --> 01:09.240
and random tangents as well over the next few hours.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.140
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio, also known as Skie, where you can find me on Twitter

01:13.140 --> 01:15.660
S-K-I-E, joining me as always.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.900
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:18.900 --> 01:19.900
Hi.

01:19.900 --> 01:20.900
How are you?

01:20.900 --> 01:21.900
Um, alright.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.900
Yeah?

01:22.900 --> 01:23.900
Did you have a good thanksgiving?

01:23.900 --> 01:24.900
It was very chill.

01:24.900 --> 01:25.900
It was awesome.

01:25.900 --> 01:26.900
Yeah, that's it.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.020
It didn't involve going to anybody's house.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.020
Yeah.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.020
Or family drama.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.020
Mm-hmm.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.020
Or drama at all.

01:32.020 --> 01:33.020
Right.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.220
It involved me, Dan, the cat, and turkey sandwiches.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.220
No, I hear you.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.220
You know what?

01:36.220 --> 01:41.140
Thanksgiving was just me, Alan, and my parents, and that is totally cool because no more family

01:41.140 --> 01:46.320
dramas and it's, we go out to a restaurant now, we don't even cook or any of that.

01:46.320 --> 01:49.260
My parents are too old to cook and I'm not going to subject anybody to my cooking.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.300
And it was great.

01:50.300 --> 01:56.020
We just got a little turkey roast and roasted it, chopped it up, put it on some bread, threw

01:56.020 --> 01:57.620
on some cranberry sauce.

01:57.620 --> 01:58.620
Yum.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.620
Called it good.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.620
See, I told you it would be about food tonight.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.980
But, I mean, Thanksgiving, it's like we have a holiday to worship food in the state.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.740
I guess there's other stuff, history, but it's food.

02:06.740 --> 02:10.980
Let's celebrate giving an entire indigenous population diseases.

02:10.980 --> 02:11.980
Right.

02:11.980 --> 02:12.980
With turkey.

02:12.980 --> 02:13.980
Anyway.

02:14.580 --> 02:20.000
Also yesterday was Dan's birthday, so I got a Boston cream pie because he said don't get

02:20.000 --> 02:26.880
me a cake, but I didn't want to get pie, so I got the true essence of cake pie, Boston

02:26.880 --> 02:27.880
cream pie.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
Well, there you go.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.220
Well, happy birthday, Dan, even though he doesn't listen to this show, but I know that's

02:31.220 --> 02:34.500
why you were out last week because the family had thrown him a party or something, right?

02:34.500 --> 02:40.660
We went to Chicago Fire and ate pizza and it was a maze.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.660
Pizza is a maze.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.660
You know what?

02:42.660 --> 02:43.660
Stuffed gross pizza.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.660
Uh huh.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.660
Pretty damn good.

02:45.660 --> 02:46.660
Pretty damn good.

02:46.660 --> 02:47.660
Also pretty damn good.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.460
Also eating pizza on tonight's program.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.660
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.780
Yeah, I'm not eating Chicago Fire pizza.

02:52.780 --> 02:53.780
I know.

02:53.780 --> 02:54.780
Nothing that fancy here at OLR.

02:54.780 --> 02:55.780
Oh, no.

02:55.780 --> 02:56.780
I'm sorry.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.780
Fancy?

02:57.780 --> 03:02.500
If you meant by fancy, terrible, then yes, that would be an accurate description of Chicago

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
Fire's pizza.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.940
Now, I realize we are a worldwide show.

03:05.940 --> 03:09.460
We are fortunate to have listeners in countries all over the world and all across America,

03:09.460 --> 03:13.980
so not everybody may be familiar with this chain round table, but I consider them to

03:13.980 --> 03:15.740
be on the higher end of pizza chains.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.900
They're also on the higher end of prices.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.900
I kind of think you get what you pay for with them.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.960
The pizza's pretty good.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.060
It's way better than like fricking Papa John's or something.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.060
Sorry.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.860
The stuffed gross pizza is actually pretty good.

03:27.860 --> 03:30.020
The garlicky, chickeny one.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.300
Chicago Fire is like a restaurant pizza.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.460
That's even a step above.

03:33.460 --> 03:34.460
That's where you got to get a booth.

03:34.460 --> 03:35.460
I don't like their pizzas.

03:35.460 --> 03:36.460
I really don't.

03:36.460 --> 03:37.460
I hate their pizzas.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.740
Because I've had several different types of their pizzas and everyone like swears by

03:40.740 --> 03:42.780
them and I just, I can't understand.

03:42.780 --> 03:45.180
Now on the other hand though, their garlic fries are fucking awesome.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.660
That is right.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.040
So their garlic fries, props to them that, who would have thought that a pizza place

03:50.040 --> 03:52.660
had you know, bitchin' garlic fries.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.180
The pesto strips are pretty good too.

03:54.180 --> 03:57.980
I love how it's the Thanksgiving episode of Orange Laundry or the post Thanksgiving episode

03:57.980 --> 03:59.280
I suppose of Orange Laundry.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.140
And here we are talking about pizza.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.700
I think I already know the answer to this, but I will.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.700
America.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.420
I think I know the answer to this here in studio, but I'll pose the question anyway

04:08.420 --> 04:10.980
and I'll ask it to you guys in our chat room as well.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.180
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

04:14.180 --> 04:18.460
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and you can participate with our show by heading

04:18.460 --> 04:24.260
over to live.vognetwork.com and you can join the chat room and we read comments on the

04:24.260 --> 04:29.260
air and take your questions and so forth as the show is going on.

04:29.260 --> 04:33.420
We usually tape right after the Bobby Blackwell show, however he had the night off, partially

04:33.420 --> 04:36.400
due to the holiday, partially due to football.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.120
So Bobby was off tonight, but he'll be back next week.

04:40.120 --> 04:45.580
So asking you guys, did you do anything for Black Friday?

04:45.580 --> 04:46.960
I went to work.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
Did you?

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
You had to work on Black Friday?

04:48.960 --> 04:50.580
Well, I guess a lot of people do.

04:50.580 --> 04:55.140
I normally work on Fridays, so I had to work.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.500
I guess I'm thankful for my office job.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.020
I also refused to spend money on that day altogether.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.020
So I spent nothing.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.420
Good for you.

05:04.420 --> 05:09.220
So it's been five years in a row where I haven't spent anything on that Friday.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.260
I didn't get gas.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.340
I got free air.

05:12.340 --> 05:15.100
I'm trying to think if we bought anything on Black Friday.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.100
I did not go out.

05:16.100 --> 05:21.980
I will not fight crowds, but I will go to like Target at 8 o'clock at night because

05:21.980 --> 05:23.180
it's just like a normal day.

05:23.180 --> 05:26.460
After all the crazies have hit it up in the morning, then at like 8 o'clock at night,

05:26.460 --> 05:29.740
like if I need to get like bread and eggs, it's just a normal day.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.740
You know what I mean?

05:30.740 --> 05:32.020
Whenever I get at Target.

05:32.020 --> 05:33.360
We didn't go this time.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.460
We usually go at night, but this year we managed to stay home.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.900
Loki, how about you?

05:37.900 --> 05:39.380
Did you get caught up in any of that madness?

05:39.380 --> 05:40.860
No, I licked at stuff.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.700
Window shopping, I guess.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.260
But no, there's nothing really I need.

05:44.260 --> 05:49.700
I mean, I don't need an Android tablet for $20 or whatever it is, you know.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.980
I mean, I guess I could get one for my son to trash, but there may be one for my other

05:53.980 --> 05:54.980
son to gnaw on.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.020
But other than that, I didn't really need anything.

05:59.500 --> 06:05.100
Well, taking it to video games, which is in theory what this show is about, you know,

06:05.100 --> 06:10.540
there's a lot of game sites having sales like, what, Blizzard was selling World of Warcraft

06:10.540 --> 06:16.900
for like five bucks and the Diablo games for 20 a pop, the expansion.

06:16.900 --> 06:17.900
What else was out there?

06:17.900 --> 06:21.980
Steam having a big sale, which was to be expected, I'm sure.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.300
Even I was looking at, oh, only $10 for Gauntlet.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.500
There's supposed to be a big square sale with a lot of the Final Fantasy titles.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
There is.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.220
I think we have a story on that coming up a little later, so yeah, but that is the thing

06:31.220 --> 06:36.380
as well where, you know, if you want to get Final Fantasy XIV's, another big MMO, I think

06:36.380 --> 06:40.900
was like 15 bucks, or you could go back and get like Tomb Raider for dirt cheap or what

06:40.900 --> 06:41.900
have you.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.980
So, were you able to resist all the online temptations as well?

06:44.980 --> 06:50.040
I only bought one game and, you know, as the Steam sale rules, you never buy anything unless

06:50.040 --> 06:56.380
it's at least like 75% off or something like that or I don't remember what the number is,

06:56.380 --> 07:01.060
but I waited until something was, I bought Civ V just because, you know, everybody's

07:01.060 --> 07:05.660
been recommending it and I know a few people play it, so I just figured, okay, I'll get

07:05.660 --> 07:06.660
that.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.500
But honestly, I was looking at the Steam sale stuff and even kind of went through my wishlist

07:10.500 --> 07:15.880
and stuff and I, you know, scrolling down the page now because I don't really like how

07:15.880 --> 07:19.780
they did all the recommendations now because it's, a lot of stuff repeats on there, but.

07:19.780 --> 07:23.020
Yeah, I kind of don't like the new Steam layout compared to the old one.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.140
I get what they're trying to do with the personalization.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.140
I don't like it.

07:26.380 --> 07:31.340
Seriously, they even be like, you know, here's Fez and here's Fez two spots down and here's

07:31.340 --> 07:36.940
Fez again in this side and it's like, okay, one, it already says it's in my library, so

07:36.940 --> 07:40.700
I don't need to really see that, but that was the thing, it's like all these games on

07:40.700 --> 07:44.980
sale, you know, a lot of them were in my library already and so I'm like, eh, I don't really

07:44.980 --> 07:46.380
need to buy these.

07:46.380 --> 07:50.980
And then also the other games, like some of the newer games that just come out, my laptop

07:50.980 --> 07:55.020
probably can't run those very well, so if I'm looking to buy any like new age, you know,

07:55.020 --> 08:02.420
new games like say, Dragon Age or, you know, I don't know, even, oh, what the hell's that

08:02.420 --> 08:03.420
Namco game?

08:03.420 --> 08:07.060
I don't know, one of the other ones, but if I'm going to buy any of those, I'm going to

08:07.060 --> 08:11.260
buy them on console where I know that these are going to run okay, so I'm not really going

08:11.260 --> 08:15.860
to try to, you know, get, you know, was it, I know they had really insane discounts on

08:15.860 --> 08:18.420
like, you know, the Shadow of Mordor.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.660
Yeah, I was just going to say, I was almost tempted with the Shadows of Mordor, but it's

08:21.660 --> 08:24.500
like, I've got enough stinking games to play right now.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.260
We'll talk about our gaming lease in a minute, but it's like, I got enough right now.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.300
Yeah, I got Civ V and then the only other thing I bought because it was just a decent

08:32.300 --> 08:36.380
price is I paid, I beat the average on the Sega Humble Bundle.

08:36.380 --> 08:37.780
Oh yeah, I got that too.

08:37.780 --> 08:43.100
So that was like $350 for a ton of fucking games, including, you know, like the Dreamcast

08:43.100 --> 08:45.700
Collection and fucking Knights and shit like that.

08:45.700 --> 08:50.300
I somehow did not have Space Channel 5 on PC, so when I saw that that was in that Humble

08:50.300 --> 08:52.660
Bundle, I was like, gotta get that.

08:52.660 --> 08:57.260
So yeah, I mean, that's really the only thing, and I'm, I don't know about you, Rob, you

08:57.260 --> 09:00.980
might want to look, they have, was a weekly one now, is Pinball FX 2 tables.

09:00.980 --> 09:02.220
I heard that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:02.220 --> 09:06.380
So I mean, I was like, eh, I don't really play pinball, but I'm like, eh, maybe.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.380
Maybe.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.380
But I didn't.

09:08.380 --> 09:09.660
So that's really, that's all I bought.

09:09.660 --> 09:15.740
I did hover several times over purchasing Dragon Age Inquisition, but it's still full

09:15.740 --> 09:17.900
price, and I just didn't want to do it.

09:17.900 --> 09:28.260
And also Diablo 3, but on PlayStation 4 digitally, but I just didn't do it, because I just have,

09:28.260 --> 09:30.860
I already have two games on Disa I haven't played yet.

09:30.860 --> 09:35.740
I still have another one that I'm only partway through, and I have, you know, a few other

09:35.740 --> 09:40.100
digital games I just bought that I don't need to buy anymore games.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.700
It's gonna end up being like the Steam library in my PlayStation Network.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.300
Yeah, that's where, that's where things are going.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.620
I was gonna say, wait till Christmas, though, in the post, you know, winter holidays, it'll

09:48.620 --> 09:53.380
get even cheaper, I bet, with all the unsold inventory that's still left.

09:53.380 --> 09:57.620
Plus there's like fucking games that like, I backed on Kickstarter that I completely

09:57.620 --> 10:01.660
forget have, you know, not come out yet, that I get keys for and stuff.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
Yeah.

10:02.660 --> 10:03.660
So I don't know.

10:03.660 --> 10:05.500
I'm just not buying a ton of stuff right now.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.580
Let's look at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

10:07.580 --> 10:11.620
Raginator says, Sky, Sky, Sky, dude, there's no such thing as enough games.

10:11.620 --> 10:14.420
I suppose that's a good point there.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.420
Let's see.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.060
Raginator also saying, I went balls to the wall in the Steam sale.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.020
I spent a record $90.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.020
Yikes.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.980
Tigerclaw saying, I didn't buy anything on Black Friday, but I did buy today Smash Brothers

10:24.980 --> 10:29.340
Wii U and a Fox McCloud Amiibo.

10:29.340 --> 10:34.220
He put an extra O on it and says Amiibo, but yeah, one of those Amiibos.

10:34.220 --> 10:37.800
So he has a lot of people jumping on that, especially with, you know, Nintendo's kind

10:37.800 --> 10:40.580
of big comeback or whatever you want to call it.

10:40.580 --> 10:41.580
Let's see.

10:42.580 --> 10:45.540
My dad went out for Black Friday for a toaster.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.300
No one was at his local mall, surprisingly.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.460
I'm really surprised because it seems like every time I log into YouTube after Black

10:51.460 --> 10:56.260
Friday, it's like people dragging each other through the parking lot of Walmart for a $5

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
crock pot.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.980
I almost wanted to buy a toaster this weekend because our toaster, one side of it's really

10:59.980 --> 11:03.020
derpy and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.700
What's the big fucking deal with toasters this Black Friday?

11:05.700 --> 11:08.060
Well, it's just, I meant to buy one.

11:08.060 --> 11:12.760
It's not necessarily because it was Black Friday, but I just wanted to get a toaster

11:12.760 --> 11:15.620
because I don't know.

11:15.620 --> 11:19.700
Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture in chat, saying, figures that two weeks after I buy

11:19.700 --> 11:25.460
an Xbox One, Best Buy has it 20 bucks less and a discount on a second controller.

11:25.460 --> 11:29.860
Managed to get them to price match, but it was a hassle.

11:29.860 --> 11:34.820
I was really close to getting an Xbox One when I saw that it was now like another $20

11:34.820 --> 11:37.740
cheaper for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and all that.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.900
Oh my gosh, I really had to resist.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.900
Really had to resist.

11:40.900 --> 11:45.340
Well, it's not that, and I just want to be clear, I want to get an Xbox.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.560
I want to support Microsoft's platform and get some of the exclusive games.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.340
It's purely a financial thing.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.340
You're still talking about dropping $300 plus.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.700
And also I'm looking at the exclusive games right now.

11:54.700 --> 11:58.060
Forza Horizon 2, I haven't played it yet and honestly I haven't missed it.

11:58.060 --> 12:02.180
To be honest, I haven't missed Drive Club either.

12:02.180 --> 12:06.180
Luckily there's so much else out right now to divert my attention.

12:06.620 --> 12:07.620
I'm not missing it either.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.780
When Crackdown comes out, that's going to be pretty tough.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.020
Same with the Wii U.

12:12.020 --> 12:17.620
When Zelda comes out, that's going to be kind of tough to not justify purchasing that system.

12:17.620 --> 12:22.100
It's like, God, I really want to play that.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.360
Right now I'm hoping, we have a contest at my work right now where they're giving away

12:26.360 --> 12:28.060
an Xbox One as one of the prizes.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.500
I'm like, eh, that would be kind of cool if I win that.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.180
Probably not going to, but it would be kind of cool.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.700
That's like people are like, I have so much debt, but I bought a lottery ticket.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.820
Unfortunately it's Assassin's Creed bundle, which I fucking hate Assassin's Creed.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.900
You're being like one of those people that's like, I'm so in debt right now, but I bought

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
a lottery ticket.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
Here's hoping.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.700
But see, I'm not spending any money.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.460
It's a free contest, so you know, no risk.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.660
Now before I get into our official kickoff topic tonight, SG100Matt is clarifying the

12:55.660 --> 12:56.660
toaster situation.

12:56.660 --> 13:02.420
SG100Matt in chat says, his toaster was borked and couldn't toast bagels properly.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.740
This is a serious problem in a Jewish household.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.940
That's why you get a toaster oven.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.260
I know we have a toaster oven.

13:09.260 --> 13:11.740
I'm like, we're not a Jewish household per se.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.640
We just really fucking love bagels.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.140
So we have a toaster oven.

13:15.140 --> 13:16.140
So just saying.

13:16.140 --> 13:21.500
Are you one of those, like they have seriously the fancy one at work where it's the one,

13:21.500 --> 13:24.320
like they have almost like the bagel shop where you put it into one side and it rolls

13:24.320 --> 13:25.820
across the little oven.

13:25.820 --> 13:30.400
And we'll look at you, mister, I was laid off and now I got this new job and they have

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
fancy toaster ovens.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.960
They have a fancy cafe.

13:32.960 --> 13:38.640
They have fancy cafes there that I buy my fancy Red Bulls during the day.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.480
We have a fancy cafe too at Locat.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.480
Not where I'm at.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.880
We have a cafe, but I wouldn't call it fancy anyway.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.880
Enough talk about that.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.880
Wood fired pizza, Rob.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.260
I wish we have, I can get like a chicken strip basket.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.260
Is that a delicacy?

13:54.260 --> 13:55.260
I don't know.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.360
I'm going to take you guys to my work one day and just feed you.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.640
All right, moving on.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.780
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

14:02.780 --> 14:07.400
This is an interesting article that was making the rounds on the blogs this week and it originally

14:07.400 --> 14:15.200
comes from the site MCVUK.com and they ran a story about the co-founder of the games

14:15.200 --> 14:18.800
workshop and the government's creative industries champion.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.040
This is Ian Livingstone and some comments that he made this week at the first BFI video

14:24.040 --> 14:25.880
games day in London.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.680
This was the interesting quote he said.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.400
Because you just bought Civilization V, Loki.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.840
See if you catch the reference here.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.920
Now is the second golden age of games.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.560
As you know, when your civilization enters the golden age, you get increased production.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.560
Oh, forget it.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
Forget it.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
All right.

14:43.560 --> 14:44.560
Now is the second golden age of games.

14:44.560 --> 14:49.880
Anybody can make a game in their own creative, cultural way in a less formulaic way than

14:49.880 --> 14:54.220
some console games in order to find new audiences.

14:54.220 --> 14:58.780
He went on to talk about games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Minecraft,

14:58.780 --> 15:04.800
even Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans, which is a big one on the iOS and I believe Android,

15:04.800 --> 15:10.460
talking about games that have broadened gaming's audience and brought more people into gaming,

15:10.460 --> 15:13.100
especially when you talk about something like Candy Crush Saga.

15:13.100 --> 15:17.100
I would even add games like Words with Friends and Farmville to that list, bringing in a

15:17.100 --> 15:21.940
demographic that wasn't always a quote-e-quote gamer.

15:21.940 --> 15:27.220
He did say that there is still work to be done, saying games have always had a bad press.

15:27.220 --> 15:31.340
Since the invention of chess, history has not been kind to games.

15:31.340 --> 15:35.660
Grand Theft Auto V was the absolute embodiment of science meeting art.

15:35.660 --> 15:39.220
It should have been put at the forefront of the British games industry as a success, but

15:39.220 --> 15:43.340
instead it was castigated by the mainstream press.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.260
So there you go.

15:45.260 --> 15:50.060
And he also mentioned the mobile market as a cause for concern, saying, I love this quote,

15:50.060 --> 15:55.060
for every Angry Birds, there's 20 million dead birds out there.

15:55.060 --> 15:59.380
Meaning all those clones and knockoffs and everybody wants a piece of the pie when something

15:59.380 --> 16:00.380
gets big.

16:00.380 --> 16:06.740
But let's go back to his comments about, we are in a second golden age of video games.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.220
What do you guys think of when you hear that?

16:08.220 --> 16:10.900
And I'm going to pose this to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.980
What do you guys think when you hear that?

16:12.980 --> 16:16.780
Do you tend to agree that we are experiencing a second golden age of games?

16:16.780 --> 16:20.900
Because I know for a while there, like even just a year or two on this show, we were talking

16:20.900 --> 16:27.140
about that it seemed like another video game crisis or crash akin to what we saw Atari

16:27.140 --> 16:29.180
go through in 84 was imminent.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.820
Are we in a golden age?

16:30.820 --> 16:31.820
What do you think, Logie?

16:31.820 --> 16:34.420
I don't think we're going to have a crash because there's just too many independents.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.420
That's the thing.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.380
You don't have, you know, big publishers kind of ruling everything.

16:38.380 --> 16:42.500
Now you have, you know, people just fucking fed up with publishers and they're leaving

16:42.500 --> 16:46.060
their development companies and starting their own developing companies and hell,

16:46.060 --> 16:51.700
you know, it's easy now, you know, probably way easier than it was back in the 80s, you

16:51.700 --> 16:55.340
know, to start your own development house and build your own games because you don't

16:55.340 --> 16:57.140
fucking have to build motherboards anymore.

16:57.140 --> 17:03.300
You just fucking download a game engine or learn a language and you can output to, you

17:03.300 --> 17:08.500
know, iOS or Android or PC and relatively easy.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.860
And so you can kind of take those creative ideas and run with them.

17:12.380 --> 17:13.380
DarkSocker, what do you think?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.580
Are we in a golden age of gaming?

17:15.580 --> 17:17.460
I wouldn't necessarily say a golden age.

17:17.460 --> 17:29.700
I just say that we're in a, I would probably say a, a hybrid metal stage, hybrid metal,

17:29.700 --> 17:32.700
semi-precious.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.340
I think that it's, it's exactly what Logie said.

17:36.340 --> 17:41.780
I think that we've got definitely a lot of, uh, I'm going to say it's actually the

17:41.820 --> 17:46.940
age of the small business in gaming where you've got independent developers getting

17:46.940 --> 17:50.140
in, basically sticking it to the man and being successful.

17:52.140 --> 17:55.460
I was just gonna say, yeah, cause you can have like a company try to do, you know,

17:55.460 --> 18:01.380
really shady, stupid things like EA, um, and you know, have that totally flop in

18:01.380 --> 18:03.340
the whole industry is not going to crash because of it.

18:03.340 --> 18:07.500
To be fair, EA has kind of been sitting in the background this year.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.460
I think EA took their licks and they're kind of, you know, they, they've let other

18:11.460 --> 18:15.100
guys take a beating this year, you know, and it, and we've even talked about this

18:15.100 --> 18:19.140
before where it seems like all the big companies kind of cycle through and

18:19.140 --> 18:19.980
somebody's getting a beat.

18:20.020 --> 18:20.300
Yeah.

18:20.420 --> 18:20.900
Okay.

18:21.020 --> 18:22.460
Who's had it worse this year, Logie?

18:22.460 --> 18:23.540
EA or Ubisoft?

18:23.580 --> 18:28.260
Recently within the last few months, Ubisoft, EA, let's look at the track record here.

18:28.260 --> 18:33.180
They implemented their wonderful, uh, EA service where you pay $30 to get demos of

18:33.180 --> 18:38.060
games now, and also they've basically blocking their games from being part of,

18:38.060 --> 18:42.980
you know, any of the free deals that you get on PlayStation network or on, um, you

18:42.980 --> 18:48.020
know, games of gold because, you know, they want pieces of the pie, of course.

18:48.060 --> 18:53.660
And because of them, they're probably gonna see more, you know, um, segregation

18:53.660 --> 18:57.940
with, you know, different, I can totally see Ubisoft and Activision following suit

18:57.940 --> 19:02.060
and having their own services where, you know, XML money per year, nobody's

19:02.060 --> 19:02.900
to get their games.

19:03.300 --> 19:09.500
Um, so there's that, yes, I understand that Ubisoft's games, the least last

19:09.500 --> 19:14.740
couple of them have been pretty Rocky at launch, but I just think that there's

19:14.740 --> 19:20.060
just, I don't know, especially in the mobile side, you know, cause you don't

19:20.060 --> 19:23.300
see that with Ubisoft that much and mobile site, there's some really shady

19:23.300 --> 19:26.780
shit that they've done, you know, with the whole, um, now I'm not sure if this is

19:26.780 --> 19:32.180
last year at this point, but you know, with fucking, um, was a dungeon keeper

19:32.700 --> 19:33.740
and that kind of stuff.

19:33.780 --> 19:39.580
I mean, it just really, they really hoard those microtransactions and I

19:39.580 --> 19:46.260
guess they, they can do it, but it's kind of, you know, soils, some of these, you

19:46.260 --> 19:49.820
know, popular franchises that they're bringing back lots of comments in our

19:49.820 --> 19:51.980
chat room, uh, over at live.vognetware.com.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.180
Dungeon buster saying there wasn't going to be a crash.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.220
The market's too diversified for it now because the tools

19:57.220 --> 19:58.540
are in everyone's hands.

19:58.860 --> 20:02.780
ActDef saying, I think we're in a video game Renaissance right now.

20:02.820 --> 20:03.580
I like that word.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.820
Um, Johnny B 79 saying, I don't think we have another golden age going.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.020
Wait until 2015.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.060
Maybe it's the Indies age.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.940
Uh, S200Matt saying gaming has its many problems, but I don't

20:14.940 --> 20:16.180
think it will crash as a whole.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.340
Are we in a golden age?

20:17.340 --> 20:17.780
I don't know.

20:17.780 --> 20:21.060
I think we won't know about that until time has passed enough for

20:21.060 --> 20:22.900
us to look back at this time.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.180
Well, and look at like, you know, look at what these big

20:25.180 --> 20:26.740
companies are putting out now.

20:26.740 --> 20:31.740
I mean, it's basically franchises, yearly franchises seem to be the

20:31.740 --> 20:36.140
case, you know, like with Ubisoft and Sasses Creed and near the kind

20:36.140 --> 20:40.100
of trying to get new franchises that they can have yearly additions of

20:40.300 --> 20:43.620
because they think that's, what's going to sell, but look at some of

20:43.620 --> 20:46.860
the, you know, these indie games that are getting a ton of attention.

20:46.860 --> 20:50.380
Like even with, you know, the E3 press conferences and stuff,

20:50.380 --> 20:53.180
Indies seem to be the forefront of a lot of these presentations

20:53.180 --> 20:55.660
because they're unique games.

20:55.660 --> 20:56.540
It's different.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.540
You're not going to see, Oh, cool.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.700
Madden's out again this year or, Oh, cool.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.940
You know, another call of duty or, you know, Oh cool.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.460
Another, I don't know, Loki Kevin Spacey though.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.180
Hey, Kevin Spacey's awesome.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.620
People got pretty excited about Kevin Spacey.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.420
He's pretty awesome.

21:12.460 --> 21:17.660
And you know, the game is fun, but comparing it to last year's game.

21:17.660 --> 21:22.580
I mean, that was a really, you know, low mark the hit cause Ghost wasn't very good.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.540
Uh, whereas black ops two is pretty good.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.620
And if I was to compare this to black ops two, it's pretty similar, you know,

21:28.620 --> 21:33.180
the style of game, but, you know, they've added a few different, you know, mobility

21:33.180 --> 21:37.180
things that make it a little interesting, but it's not completely new game.

21:37.180 --> 21:39.060
It's just a little different.

21:39.220 --> 21:39.460
Right.

21:39.460 --> 21:44.220
So, um, but you know, and, and I applaud, you know, like battlefield, you know,

21:44.220 --> 21:46.860
doing battlefield hardline, you know, that's kind of cool.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.580
It's different.

21:47.580 --> 21:50.580
You know, instead of just throwing out another military shooter again.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.900
Um, so I'm kind of down with that, but it's still though.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.900
They're trying to, a lot of the times they're just put out these yearly

21:57.940 --> 22:00.740
releases and it just seems like not a lot of efforts going into them.

22:00.740 --> 22:05.020
And it kind of shows in the reviews even like, um, you know, I think NBA

22:05.020 --> 22:07.900
live though this year did a little bit better than last year, but it was just

22:07.900 --> 22:11.340
kind of, eh, you know, it's like, why even bother with some of these?

22:11.820 --> 22:15.500
I sort of feel like video game right now is at a bit of a crossroads.

22:15.500 --> 22:20.620
I definitely see the whole rise of indie development and it does seem

22:20.620 --> 22:24.380
like it's so much more accessible now for people to go in and create their

22:24.380 --> 22:28.620
own games because you, it's not just that the tools are there to necessarily

22:28.620 --> 22:31.980
create games because the tools to create games have been there for a very long

22:31.980 --> 22:32.340
time.

22:32.340 --> 22:36.460
Like I think of, you know, going all the way back to the Apple two E and the

22:36.460 --> 22:40.780
Commodore 64 days, you know, the stuff that us 30 something's played when we

22:40.780 --> 22:42.140
were in elementary school, right.

22:42.380 --> 22:45.700
You know, I remember you could type in and you could make your own programs.

22:45.700 --> 22:49.420
So we even learned about doing things like, um, what was that drawing program

22:49.420 --> 22:50.060
with the turtles?

22:50.060 --> 22:50.740
That logo?

22:50.820 --> 22:51.100
Turtle.

22:51.900 --> 22:52.980
Or is it just called true?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.060
I thought that it might have been logo.

22:54.060 --> 22:57.340
I don't remember programming writers, logo writers, something like that.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.540
I mean, but that was, that was how we learned logic and programming at a young

23:00.540 --> 23:01.220
age, right?

23:01.220 --> 23:02.260
Was, that was the big thing.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.140
I don't even know if that's something they still do.

23:04.180 --> 23:04.860
I hope they do.

23:04.860 --> 23:05.820
That's pretty awesome.

23:05.820 --> 23:10.180
And I completely retained none of that, but, uh, you know, what was the name of

23:10.180 --> 23:13.420
that game that really influenced me as a child, Oregon trail?

23:13.460 --> 23:16.260
I remember going to the computer labs, you know, with the monochrome green

23:16.260 --> 23:19.740
screens and stuff, but, uh, yeah, it was just, it's like logo.

23:19.780 --> 23:23.780
Don't even remember that it was all, you know, Carmen, San Diego and Oregon trail.

23:23.780 --> 23:25.220
I mean, that, that's all we played, right?

23:25.580 --> 23:29.540
Yeah, but, but learning how to program in, in logo and the turtle drawing and all

23:29.540 --> 23:34.020
that stuff is, is so important because learning about like, if then and logic

23:34.020 --> 23:38.540
and things like going into my job that I do now or, or something I used to a few

23:38.540 --> 23:40.980
years ago, I don't do it so much now, but I used to write a lot of policy

23:40.980 --> 23:44.860
documents and a lot of that same like logic gating comes into play.

23:44.860 --> 23:46.660
And it's like, you learned that at a young age.

23:46.660 --> 23:50.220
I think it would be cool if they did teach, have even just like a programming

23:50.220 --> 23:52.780
course in and, and do with games.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.180
I think games would be a good way.

23:54.180 --> 23:58.020
Cause it's something that's interesting to that age group.

23:58.020 --> 23:58.780
Cause they kind of do that.

23:58.780 --> 24:01.420
Logie, I think like in my junior high school, that was like an

24:01.420 --> 24:02.660
elective we were able to take.

24:02.740 --> 24:02.940
Yeah.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.100
Cause I don't know if they do that.

24:04.460 --> 24:07.380
Oh, at least when I went to high school, they didn't have anything like that.

24:07.620 --> 24:12.380
Uh, they only had like typing, you know, it was like typing and typing too.

24:12.380 --> 24:15.740
And, and so it's like, okay, you know, that's kind of dumb, but it would be

24:15.740 --> 24:18.780
cool if they had that, um, I'd be down with that anyway.

24:18.780 --> 24:20.260
I got a little tangenty, sorry.

24:20.300 --> 24:24.900
Um, so I feel like on computers, that's always been something we could do, but

24:24.900 --> 24:27.820
you know, when consoles came out, when like, like, let's say even the Atari

24:27.820 --> 24:31.260
2600 or the Nintendo entertainment system, like, No, you couldn't

24:31.260 --> 24:33.220
just make your own Nintendo game.

24:33.260 --> 24:37.700
I mean, some people did and could, but that was something you really had

24:37.700 --> 24:39.580
to have the tools to be able to do.

24:39.940 --> 24:44.500
But now you're seeing more and more as we enter this more digital era where,

24:44.500 --> 24:48.060
you know, even on, you know, PlayStation four, not only is the marketplace more

24:48.060 --> 24:53.180
opened up for these smaller publishers to put their own creations directly on

24:53.180 --> 25:00.420
the store, be that Apple's app store, Android store, um, uh, steam, you know,

25:00.420 --> 25:02.700
those types of services, or even now you're seeing more and more of it on

25:02.700 --> 25:05.780
Wii U, PlayStation, Xbox, like those are really opening up as well.

25:06.700 --> 25:10.700
And it just seems like even within games themselves, there's

25:10.700 --> 25:12.300
more tools to create games.

25:12.500 --> 25:16.140
And I'm talking about things like things like twine, right?

25:16.140 --> 25:19.980
Which, you know, is a big, popular, uh, people create their own text

25:19.980 --> 25:21.260
adventure games and so forth.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.940
Or even something like little big planet.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.620
I would argue in a way as a game creation, like just last week, we were

25:27.620 --> 25:30.900
talking about that somebody had what recreated final fantasy seven within

25:30.900 --> 25:36.180
little big planet, and there's so much you can learn about making a game from

25:36.220 --> 25:38.180
developing your own level of little big planet.

25:38.180 --> 25:41.380
Like we have more games now that allow you to make games.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.500
It's a, it's a, it's a very meta world that we're in right now

25:45.500 --> 25:47.220
in gaming in that regard.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.380
Yeah, definitely.

25:50.460 --> 25:54.740
I think it'd be cool to see, like, you know, uh, I would love to see like,

25:54.740 --> 25:57.580
you know, Mario maker and stuff to have that actually a little bit more

25:57.580 --> 26:01.140
advanced to where you could sell level packs and stuff where you can, you know,

26:01.140 --> 26:06.540
kind of advertise your stuff and make, you know, have a marketplace for that

26:06.540 --> 26:07.660
kind of stuff would be pretty cool.

26:08.220 --> 26:11.540
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetware.com many, many chatters

26:11.540 --> 26:13.180
and they're confirming it is logo.

26:13.180 --> 26:14.900
We've got linked to the Wikipedia articles.

26:14.900 --> 26:20.020
That was a, you see, but now see logo meant something else 20 years ago.

26:20.020 --> 26:23.620
And now I'm like, Oh, that's what channel RuPaul's Drag Race comes on as logo.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.500
But you know, now it's a little different now.

26:25.540 --> 26:31.020
Anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, um, talking about,

26:31.020 --> 26:36.780
uh, Akuma JP saying, I hate to say this, but good indie is good, but

26:36.780 --> 26:38.700
too many garbage around now.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.820
I'm kind of sick of it.

26:39.980 --> 26:43.980
Well, that's what the guy was talking about in his, his car in his speech was

26:43.980 --> 26:46.820
that, you know, for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.140
There is a lot of garbage out there.

26:48.140 --> 26:48.300
Yeah.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.860
And there's a lot of garbage even on steam and it's just, it's people.

26:52.860 --> 26:56.300
I don't even, I think I would like to think that it's just

26:56.300 --> 26:58.460
people trying to cash in quickly.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.820
You know, there, there has been in a lot of these developers.

27:02.100 --> 27:06.820
Um, they're not, they're not, they're not professional in their game making.

27:06.820 --> 27:11.220
They're not professional in the way they interact with the community and,

27:11.700 --> 27:13.900
you know, the press and that kind of stuff.

27:13.940 --> 27:20.700
Um, so I think that there's some of those out there, but legitimately, I think a lot

27:20.700 --> 27:25.260
of people are actually trying, you know, to get stuff on there and they're not

27:25.260 --> 27:30.100
trying to just throw some crap together to get people to buy, you know, their game

27:30.100 --> 27:33.580
and then never update it again, just make a quick buck because that's only going to

27:33.580 --> 27:34.340
work once.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.620
I mean, you're not going to be able to pull that trick off twice.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.580
So I don't know.

27:38.580 --> 27:45.020
It's, there, there have been some pretty terrible games, but that's what peer

27:45.020 --> 27:46.300
review, that's reviews for.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.980
That's why they have, you know, ratings.

27:48.020 --> 27:51.820
There is that, but I would even argue that, you know, some people are there just to

27:51.820 --> 27:52.380
cash in.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.140
We know that, but some people can also learn something from a quote unquote,

27:56.140 --> 27:56.860
terrible game.

27:57.140 --> 28:00.500
Like look at some of the like funny little joke projects.

28:00.500 --> 28:04.140
I use, I use that term loosely that we've talked about on OLR lately.

28:04.380 --> 28:07.540
For instance, you know, let's talk, let's talk about Bobby while he's not here.

28:07.740 --> 28:10.580
Cause there was that whole flappy vog thing that he did on the website, right?

28:10.580 --> 28:11.820
Which you can still go and play.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.180
And you know, it was, it was a silly version of flappy bird that we all got to

28:15.180 --> 28:16.980
get involved with and lend our voices to.

28:17.020 --> 28:20.220
But think about everything that he learned from that project.

28:20.380 --> 28:22.460
He learned about developing unity on the web.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.660
He learned about how to interface it with the vog website that he built because, you

28:26.660 --> 28:28.300
know, there's the high score table that's built in.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.580
It does the loot and all that stuff.

28:29.900 --> 28:33.140
Like, you know, he can take that knowledge and use it on something else.

28:33.220 --> 28:33.540
Yeah.

28:33.620 --> 28:37.140
Or even, um, you know, Aaron had called in a couple of weeks ago talking about the

28:37.140 --> 28:41.900
pixel shits game that he made, which we loved because that was, uh, spurned off an

28:41.900 --> 28:45.060
idea here at orange launch radio, which by the way, I have to make sure I give this

28:45.060 --> 28:46.020
a shout out at some point.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.820
I'm so sorry to be so tangenty, but I don't want to forget this.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.300
You have to check out this user on Twitter.

28:51.500 --> 28:57.780
It's a click rocks, C L I C K R O C K S because earlier this week he actually

28:57.780 --> 29:03.260
tweeted a box art that he made for pixel shits for Y Y R in the vein of inventory.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.300
I just brought up here in the studio, it's awesome.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.540
And Aaron saw it and loved it.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.380
I sent it to him on Twitter and that was a learning project for Aaron too.

29:11.420 --> 29:11.580
Yeah.

29:11.580 --> 29:15.900
It's a learning project for him, but it's also another thing too, is it boils down

29:16.020 --> 29:18.980
how simple a game can be and it can be fun.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.860
And sometimes the most simple things look at the games that were on the

29:21.860 --> 29:27.420
Atari's 2,600, they like literally had some of them one objective, you know, and

29:27.420 --> 29:31.860
this one is, you know, make shits on the ground to stop the joggers that, and

29:31.860 --> 29:35.860
that, and that's literally, and a lot of times like the crazy thing about pixel

29:35.860 --> 29:40.220
shits is like, it really is not a bad gift for a joke project.

29:40.620 --> 29:43.220
It's a really authentic 2,600 game.

29:43.260 --> 29:46.940
Like I could have, I mean, I don't think it would have been a game about shit on

29:46.940 --> 29:49.100
the 2,600, but that's what makes it funny.

29:49.100 --> 29:53.340
But I could see this same idea where you're leaving, I don't know, sand traps

29:53.340 --> 29:59.500
on the ground for people, pixel twigs and berries on the ground, you know, I could

29:59.500 --> 30:05.140
see this like as an actual game on the 2,600 pixel squish, pixel squish, the

30:05.140 --> 30:07.180
family channel version of the game.

30:07.260 --> 30:10.300
Anyway, tangenty, but, uh, but good stuff.

30:10.740 --> 30:11.100
All right.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.660
Um, there you go.

30:12.660 --> 30:16.620
So, uh, we would invite your emails on this, uh, at a future date over

30:16.620 --> 30:19.900
at, uh, participate at orangeontrader.com.

30:19.900 --> 30:22.820
If you want to email us on that, but in the meantime, we got to get to tonight's

30:22.820 --> 30:26.660
news and I also want to start off tonight's show as we always do talking

30:26.660 --> 30:30.340
about how was your gaming week and what video games have you been playing this

30:30.340 --> 30:32.820
week, dark Sakura, I have two weeks worth of games.

30:32.860 --> 30:37.180
Um, I have dragon age inquisition, of course, which I'm starting over because

30:37.180 --> 30:40.180
I might've screwed up my soulless romance, which I know is going to make me cry.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.420
It's already been kind of spoiled for me.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.860
Um, but that's okay.

30:43.860 --> 30:44.900
Cause I'm doing it anyway.

30:45.020 --> 30:49.060
Um, I'm playing a, uh, elven mage.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.140
So that was fun.

30:50.660 --> 30:57.700
Uh, I also have been, uh, I actually played some final fantasy 14 earlier last week,

30:57.700 --> 30:59.900
but I haven't touched it since inquisition came out.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.860
Um, I played some other stuff though.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.980
Um, I played some, uh, bejeweled.

31:06.540 --> 31:09.820
I got that ingress thing, but I'm too lazy to go walk around my neighborhood.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.740
So I haven't done anything with it.

31:13.660 --> 31:14.500
It was just pretty.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.700
So I just started looking at the colors for awhile and it was like, Oh, going crazy.

31:18.860 --> 31:20.020
Did you really get into that?

31:20.260 --> 31:21.260
I just got the game.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.980
I haven't done much in it as in anything.

31:24.020 --> 31:25.540
You signed up for green team, right?

31:26.020 --> 31:26.460
Yes.

31:26.500 --> 31:26.780
Good.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.300
Um, cause I remember you saying that you hated the Smurfs.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.500
I, I did that then.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.100
Um, there's some listeners of the show.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.020
I know play ingress and happen to be service.

31:39.340 --> 31:41.100
I don't want to hate Smurfs.

31:41.140 --> 31:42.260
Hey, it's a strong word.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.340
They just annoy me.

31:43.540 --> 31:46.340
And there's one guy here locally that really annoys me.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.900
Ah, that's the game.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.420
That's the game.

31:49.420 --> 31:49.940
That's the game.

31:50.300 --> 31:50.820
Okay.

31:50.860 --> 31:56.540
Um, I also picked up, um, crap now I forgot the name of it.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.580
Um, and it's not injection or something.

31:58.580 --> 32:05.940
It's, um, I can remember what the, it was something I got actually for, uh, my, uh,

32:05.980 --> 32:08.420
for Mac and now for the life of me.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.700
I can't remember what it was called, but it's on steam as well.

32:11.140 --> 32:16.220
And then, um, I picked up, uh, crap, man.

32:16.220 --> 32:16.860
I forgot what it was.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.340
Oh yeah.

32:17.380 --> 32:18.460
A game called mountain.

32:19.140 --> 32:21.220
It's 99 cents and it's not really a game.

32:21.620 --> 32:27.020
You're just a mountain, a mountain floating in the sky and you can spin

32:27.020 --> 32:33.660
around and you can move all around the mountain, but it's a mountain.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.180
Just floating there.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.780
You're a mountain in the mountain.

32:38.980 --> 32:42.780
No, you are, you are the mountain mountain, but you can spin.

32:42.980 --> 32:44.180
How does a mountain spin?

32:44.220 --> 32:45.380
It's floating in the air.

32:45.580 --> 32:46.460
It's a floating mountain.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.020
All right.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.620
The clouds, it has clouds too.

32:48.620 --> 32:49.460
And rain noises.

32:50.420 --> 32:53.580
It's just, it actually is super relaxing.

32:53.860 --> 32:54.660
I'm surprised.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.500
I would think a game like volcano would be more up your alley.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.180
Uh, that would be my version of it.

33:00.220 --> 33:00.580
Yeah.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.340
But no, it's 99 cents.

33:04.660 --> 33:08.220
It's worth the dollar just to look at it for the novelty sake.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.540
You paid a whole dollar for that whole dollar for that.

33:10.940 --> 33:19.980
I Rob, I spent $4 on you today and a dollar on Allen, but I'm worth it.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.620
A mountain though, mountains you climb.

33:23.900 --> 33:24.140
All right.

33:24.140 --> 33:26.020
Anyway, enough about the mountains.

33:26.020 --> 33:26.940
Let's talk to Loki.

33:26.940 --> 33:27.700
How was your gaming week?

33:28.340 --> 33:33.340
My gaming week is now involving me filling out that claim form for free red bowl.

33:33.380 --> 33:34.220
Hell yeah.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.060
They'll say it was months ago.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.700
Well, I just remembered about it and you can still fill it out.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.340
So maybe I'll have to do that too.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.700
Uh, anyways, so this week I played a few things.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.420
I did get around to playing some call of duty.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.300
So I played that.

33:49.300 --> 33:56.100
I think it leveled up cause they had double XP this weekend from like 19 to I think 25.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.540
So that was pretty fun.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.380
Um, I actually played on a few maps.

33:59.380 --> 34:02.700
I haven't played yet, so I thought I had seen them all because it, I guess it just

34:02.700 --> 34:04.500
doesn't cycle through them very well.

34:04.940 --> 34:08.060
But I have got the two different maps that I haven't played.

34:09.220 --> 34:15.060
And then, um, I played actually quite a bit of Lego Marvel superheroes.

34:15.460 --> 34:19.300
Um, I think I went through about three or four levels, mainly because my son kept

34:19.340 --> 34:25.060
making me watch there's this, um, has like, was it maximum overload and Lego

34:25.060 --> 34:29.980
Marvel superheroes, maximum overload, which is a, it's like a web series slash movie.

34:29.980 --> 34:34.340
It's like 20 minutes long and he's watched it about 10 times in the last three days.

34:34.860 --> 34:42.300
And, um, so it's hilarious and Troy Baker is, you know, in it.

34:42.300 --> 34:43.900
So, you know, Troy Baker, all the things.

34:43.900 --> 34:47.020
And, um, you know, apparently he actually, I didn't realize he does

34:47.020 --> 34:49.340
several voices in the game.

34:49.340 --> 34:53.660
So he does Loki and he also does, uh, Hawkeye.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.060
So cool.

34:56.220 --> 35:00.700
And, um, the story's weird, but I'm going with it.

35:00.780 --> 35:04.140
And, uh, so yeah, I played that and enjoying it.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.420
Although once I'm done, I'm probably never gonna play it again.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.860
And then Grand Theft Auto five, I played a little bit of that, got through some

35:09.860 --> 35:12.780
more missions on that and, uh, I was trying.

35:13.740 --> 35:17.260
So this is the only thing I don't like about the PlayStation four and it's good

35:17.260 --> 35:19.820
for, it's probably good for this reason.

35:19.820 --> 35:26.140
But for me, you know, the hacking, cracking, modding type, I don't enjoy it

35:26.180 --> 35:32.980
because there's no way to remove updates from games, um, unless you, so I have to

35:32.980 --> 35:37.700
delete the whole game and redownload it in order to remove updates because there

35:37.700 --> 35:42.020
was an exploit that you could do with the stock market where you can basically buy

35:42.020 --> 35:46.060
and sell some stock that's negative and it keeps giving you money and I wanted the

35:46.060 --> 35:48.620
cheat so I can get more money so that, you know,

35:48.780 --> 35:51.380
But they sell money online, right?

35:51.660 --> 35:55.260
Well, they do sell money for Grand Theft Auto online, but not for the single

35:55.260 --> 35:58.260
player game. And here's the thing though, is actually, that's not such a big deal

35:58.260 --> 36:03.140
because I, I did pre-order the game, um, digitally.

36:03.140 --> 36:08.500
So I'm supposed to get $500,000 for my characters, but I haven't gotten to the

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
point in the game where it gives me that.

36:10.540 --> 36:15.900
So, um, it would be nice to have that now, but whatever.

36:16.220 --> 36:19.180
I guess later on, once I get all three characters and it's going to give it to me

36:19.180 --> 36:20.340
for all three characters.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.740
Is this the downside to you having bought digitally?

36:22.740 --> 36:25.980
Because if you'd bought that game on disc, you could have just unplugged yourself on

36:25.980 --> 36:27.540
the internet and done that, right?

36:28.180 --> 36:29.940
Uh, never updated the game.

36:29.940 --> 36:31.660
And no, it's still a download the update.

36:31.660 --> 36:34.980
I would probably be able to download the app or delete the update and it would be a

36:34.980 --> 36:36.540
lot faster to just be able to install it.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.540
But now I have to redownload, you know, 50 gigs worth of game.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.940
And honestly, it's just not worth it.

36:40.980 --> 36:45.380
I just, I'll play it, you know, the regular way, but it's just, I've played the game

36:45.380 --> 36:48.020
before a hundred percent and completed everything.

36:48.020 --> 36:52.420
And I know how long it takes and I'm kind of like, you know, I want to get a hundred

36:52.420 --> 36:56.060
percent so I can start doing, you know, the Easter egg hunting stuff again, cause that

36:56.060 --> 36:56.700
was kind of fun.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.380
And hopefully they have more, you know, it's actually finished in this version of the

37:00.380 --> 37:06.380
game, but you know, I, I don't really want to have to do everything again.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.980
I want it to be as quickly as possible.

37:07.980 --> 37:11.220
I want to cheat through everything because I've already done it and I just don't want

37:11.220 --> 37:14.420
to have to, you know, work through getting a hundred percent on everything again.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.540
Cause it was a pain in the ass the last time.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.940
So yeah, that's, that's why I'm doing that.

37:20.380 --> 37:23.140
But, um, whatever, I'll just play it.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.180
I'm just, I haven't been going back to it very much.

37:25.180 --> 37:27.700
So that's the thing is I thought I'd be really playing a lot more of it.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.380
I still haven't even played Grand Theft Auto online.

37:29.380 --> 37:33.420
You haven't transferred my characters over yet, but I probably will at some point.

37:33.940 --> 37:37.540
Um, but I just, I'm kind of waiting for them to put out an expansion.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.940
They're supposed to do it now that, you know, the new games come out, maybe when the

37:40.940 --> 37:44.100
PC version comes out, but I really need a single player expansion.

37:44.860 --> 37:45.380
All right.

37:45.540 --> 37:46.540
Crossing my fingers for you.

37:46.820 --> 37:50.140
I did also forget about playing Smash Brothers on Wii U.

37:50.260 --> 37:50.620
Oh yeah.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.580
How did you enjoy that?

37:51.860 --> 37:53.380
It was eight players of madness.

37:54.060 --> 37:58.020
Eight players is kind of crazy on like, it depends on how big your TV is, I suppose.

37:58.020 --> 38:00.860
But I seem to remember you guys have a pretty big TV, but imagine playing eight

38:00.860 --> 38:02.940
players on our littler TV in there.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.180
It's, it's kind of crazy.

38:04.180 --> 38:07.660
We tried doing that and it's like, oh my gosh, just four players is great.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.260
Eight players.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.660
You got to have the right setup for that.

38:09.740 --> 38:10.940
Yeah, but I forgot to mention it.

38:11.060 --> 38:16.300
That's, that's where, um, Jonas's and Diego's, uh, anime game room team can get

38:16.300 --> 38:18.340
us a projection screen or something that's big enough.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.220
That's that would be my hope.

38:20.460 --> 38:24.220
Um, let's see, a chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:24.220 --> 38:28.460
Johnny B 79 says, Rob, are you playing final fantasy 14 and wow.

38:28.620 --> 38:29.820
Plus dragon age.

38:29.820 --> 38:31.500
Geez, you got a hectic schedule.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.740
Um, actually the answer to that question is kind of yes.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.860
Um, I did play some dragon age inquisition this week, but not a lot.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.980
Uh, that game took a little bit of a back seat this week.

38:42.020 --> 38:47.020
Um, and yeah, luckily I've not had work since Thursday.

38:47.060 --> 38:51.700
Cause, uh, my office job affords me, you know, the four days that, um, a lot of,

38:51.940 --> 38:54.020
you know, banks and so forth get for this holiday.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.660
So I've had a lot of time to kind of sit on my butt and play

38:56.660 --> 38:57.820
video games, which has been great.

38:57.820 --> 39:00.540
So yeah, I have been able to play a couple of MMOs.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.380
So let's talk first about that.

39:02.380 --> 39:06.620
If you follow me on Twitter, uh, then you probably saw earlier this week.

39:07.100 --> 39:10.940
I did succumb to the fact that I knew I was going to be going back to

39:10.940 --> 39:13.580
world of Warcraft because I've heard nothing but great things about this new

39:13.580 --> 39:14.220
expansion.

39:14.540 --> 39:18.420
So yes, I re signed up for world of Warcraft and I've been playing that

39:18.420 --> 39:20.020
quite a bit over the past few days.

39:20.260 --> 39:23.140
Um, which is funny cause I know Irene was here last week.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.620
I'm filling in for Jamie.

39:24.620 --> 39:28.060
We, we had a bit of a deep discussion that kind of went to a dark place

39:28.060 --> 39:29.420
a little bit on world of Warcraft.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.900
We're talking about some of the negatives of it.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.780
Cause I believe Irene said.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.940
She, she didn't say the word hate.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.380
She's another very strong word.

39:36.380 --> 39:39.460
And she used to play Warcraft all the time, but now she couldn't stand it.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.900
And it was just kind of interesting to talk about that and the social dynamic,

39:42.900 --> 39:47.140
but all that stuff aside, I've been hearing nothing but great things about

39:47.140 --> 39:47.980
Warlords of Draenor.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.300
So I was like, all right, what the hell?

39:49.540 --> 39:51.060
I've got some time here off work.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.500
Blizzard has announced their Black Friday sales.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.860
Warlords of Draenor isn't on it.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.180
So let's just, let's just buy the damn thing.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.140
Let's get in there and see what's going on.

39:59.140 --> 40:05.340
So, um, I have leveled an Alliance character up to 94, just shy of 95 and a

40:05.340 --> 40:09.300
Horde character up to about 91, um, just because I wanted to get my garrison

40:09.300 --> 40:10.620
triggered on the Horde character.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.660
Um, and, um,

40:13.020 --> 40:15.260
Is it you didn't use your redemption code?

40:15.340 --> 40:17.900
I, my 90 boost, I haven't yet.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.140
No, the, my character to get boosted to 90.

40:20.380 --> 40:25.780
I'm waiting to see what I want to do with that because I have a tune on one server,

40:25.780 --> 40:30.300
Proudmoore, where I used to know a lot of people that played, but almost everybody

40:30.300 --> 40:32.540
that was on Proudmoore left for another server.

40:32.980 --> 40:37.580
Um, so I have my Alliance tune on a server, Blade's Edge, and that's where the guys

40:37.580 --> 40:39.940
from gamebuoy.org play and some of their friends.

40:40.180 --> 40:43.940
So that's why I've kind of been focusing on that server because I know people that

40:43.940 --> 40:44.940
are actively playing there.

40:44.980 --> 40:46.460
I know who you're playing.

40:46.540 --> 40:46.820
Yeah.

40:47.460 --> 40:51.140
Uh, and so my holy pally, yes, that's, that's the character I'm working on right

40:51.140 --> 40:51.340
now.

40:51.620 --> 40:57.140
So my 90 boost, what I'm sitting on that is maybe I'll find out I have some friends

40:57.140 --> 40:57.780
somewhere else.

40:57.780 --> 41:01.140
In fact, already on Twitter, another podcasting friend of mine is like, you

41:01.140 --> 41:04.220
should come to Earthen Ring because we have a guild over here on Horde side.

41:04.540 --> 41:08.260
So I'm saving that 90 boost for when I need a character on a server.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.220
That way I don't have to pay to transfer one of the ones I have, if that makes

41:11.220 --> 41:11.380
sense.

41:11.380 --> 41:11.860
That makes sense.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.580
So, um, just waiting for that to happen.

41:14.900 --> 41:19.540
I kind of want to don't get super, I don't really want to get super married to Wow

41:19.540 --> 41:20.180
though.

41:20.340 --> 41:24.900
I don't know if I want to get into the whole rating a couple of times a week and

41:24.900 --> 41:25.580
all that again.

41:25.820 --> 41:31.100
I just don't know if my life is compatible with that anymore, but I will say just

41:31.140 --> 41:35.940
on the pure standpoint of the expansion leveling from one to, or excuse me, from

41:35.940 --> 41:39.740
90 to a hundred and the whole bit, I am pretty impressed at this expansion.

41:39.740 --> 41:43.500
This expansion really is the best one they've had since at least Lich King.

41:43.540 --> 41:47.740
It knocks the other two, Cataclysm and Pandaria knocks them out of the water.

41:47.900 --> 41:52.300
Um, and a lot of that is that they've really made the experience very cinematic.

41:52.500 --> 41:57.980
I was very surprised by, you know, you get right into the action and then you're in

41:58.060 --> 42:02.620
an arena fighting a hundred people and fighting them off and then somebody's

42:02.620 --> 42:04.780
yelling, run, run to the docks.

42:04.780 --> 42:07.540
And you, you're having to get your characters, who's got a speed boost and

42:07.540 --> 42:09.940
running through all this madness as fast as possible.

42:10.140 --> 42:14.420
Like they've really taken some steps in this very old engine to make it very

42:14.420 --> 42:15.060
cinematic.

42:15.340 --> 42:20.380
And, um, you know, when you get introduced to the orcs that make up the iron horde

42:20.380 --> 42:24.180
and the important players in the storyline, now the camera will pan by them and the

42:24.180 --> 42:27.060
title will come up and you know, it'll be like Khadgar, you know?

42:27.100 --> 42:30.300
And so, so you have a little bit of a name to a face and that whole thing.

42:30.300 --> 42:34.460
So there's a very cinematic approach to it, which is something that I've really

42:34.460 --> 42:36.340
loved in Final Fantasy 14.

42:36.700 --> 42:41.300
So I kind of love that, you know, Warcraft is upping the ante in that regard.

42:41.780 --> 42:45.220
Um, I've done a little bit of the dungeons.

42:45.220 --> 42:49.900
I did the first two dungeons, the iron docks and the slag mines, I think it's

42:49.900 --> 42:50.260
called.

42:50.620 --> 42:54.740
Um, that's the only downside to the expansion I can think of so far.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.900
It's not that the dungeons were necessarily bad.

42:57.180 --> 43:00.780
But it's that there is still a lot of toxic people playing World of Warcraft.

43:00.820 --> 43:04.460
And I know we just had a story last week about World of Warcraft subscribers

43:04.460 --> 43:05.380
numbers are back up.

43:05.540 --> 43:10.260
Well, I think a lot of the toxic people came back because I was running with, uh,

43:10.500 --> 43:13.300
talking about gameboy.org, I was running with Captain Spike and First Mate

43:13.300 --> 43:13.740
Slidekick.

43:13.740 --> 43:17.180
We were running one of those dungeons together and Slidekick hadn't tanked a

43:17.180 --> 43:18.460
dungeon in a very long time.

43:18.460 --> 43:23.420
So he was taking it a little bit slow and somebody spoke up and said, you know, um,

43:23.460 --> 43:26.100
well, if this retarded tank would go any faster.

43:26.500 --> 43:31.500
And I was just, I just typed in all caps, dude, like, calm down.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.660
So we're going a little slower.

43:33.660 --> 43:35.700
It's not like a snail's pace.

43:36.020 --> 43:39.580
Like, do you have to jump out and start like yelling at people and calling them

43:39.580 --> 43:40.220
names?

43:40.260 --> 43:41.740
And it's like, oh my God.

43:41.740 --> 43:42.740
That's just when they vote kick.

43:42.780 --> 43:43.460
Well, we do.

43:43.540 --> 43:44.940
Here's the other crazy part.

43:45.060 --> 43:47.700
We tried to vote kick because we have three people, right?

43:47.700 --> 43:49.340
So we should be able to go get a vote kick through.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.740
No, you need four.

43:50.740 --> 43:52.700
And the other pug voted against it.

43:53.260 --> 43:54.900
So we weren't able to kick the person.

43:55.380 --> 43:59.300
So not only, I mean, it would be one thing if there was a toxic player and everybody

43:59.300 --> 44:02.580
else was like, fuck you boot, but this guy was able to stay around.

44:02.780 --> 44:07.620
Now I realized I can't really point and say this is Blizzard's fault because it's

44:07.620 --> 44:12.220
not, you know, it's the toxic environment and it's the people that need to be dealt

44:12.220 --> 44:12.460
with.

44:12.460 --> 44:17.540
But I have to call it out as something that made me a little bit sad because I feel

44:17.540 --> 44:23.900
like when WoW was at its worst, the player base that stuck with it, God love them at

44:23.900 --> 44:26.340
least would not resort to this kind of crap.

44:26.660 --> 44:30.740
So just don't be a dick if you're playing these online games or any game in general.

44:31.060 --> 44:32.140
Just don't be a dick.

44:32.180 --> 44:32.420
What?

44:32.420 --> 44:34.620
It's going to take five more minutes to get through a dungeon.

44:34.620 --> 44:36.180
Calm your tits.

44:36.980 --> 44:41.540
Anyway, so otherwise though, they expect the Garrison's super addicting, even though

44:41.540 --> 44:43.700
it's kind of like a big Facebook game that they've worked into.

44:43.700 --> 44:44.100
Wow.

44:44.340 --> 44:47.740
It's great that as you're working on your Garrison or as I call it, Mr.

44:47.740 --> 44:49.500
Garrison, as I'm working on my Mr.

44:49.580 --> 44:55.900
Garrison, that I will get rewards like gold or I will get rewards like experience for

44:55.900 --> 45:00.860
my character or that I can build this enchanting hunt that will disenchant my

45:00.860 --> 45:04.660
things for me and give me, it's like even though I didn't level this profession, I

45:04.660 --> 45:05.940
could have access to it anyway.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.420
So it really simplified a lot of things in that regard.

45:08.420 --> 45:11.300
So there's a lot of really neat things that they did in Draenor.

45:11.780 --> 45:15.100
Overall, at the end of the day, though, am I going to run away from Final Fantasy 14?

45:15.100 --> 45:18.940
No, because the games are really different and there's still a lot, a lot, a lot I

45:18.940 --> 45:20.780
really enjoy about Final Fantasy 14.

45:21.060 --> 45:25.020
Like, you know, I talk about World of Warcraft being very cinematic, but there's

45:25.020 --> 45:27.340
never going to be anything in World of Warcraft.

45:27.340 --> 45:31.220
There's just not going to be anything in it like the introduction to the Shiva battle

45:31.260 --> 45:35.740
for the most recent Final Fantasy 14 patch, which was so fucking epic.

45:35.740 --> 45:36.620
Or the music.

45:36.660 --> 45:38.460
I mean, WoW has great music.

45:38.820 --> 45:43.700
I'm sorry, 14 with the dynamic soundtrack and everything like is, is a step above.

45:43.860 --> 45:44.660
And it really is.

45:44.740 --> 45:45.780
No fat chocobos.

45:46.500 --> 45:46.860
That's right.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.940
WoW does not have fat chocobos, unfortunately.

45:49.100 --> 45:50.380
It does have pet battles though.

45:50.700 --> 45:54.460
And then, but Final Fantasy 14 is not perfect.

45:54.740 --> 45:59.820
You know, I would, the cross realm server and the flex rating and all that stuff

45:59.820 --> 46:02.940
really changed WoW for a really, in a really, really good way.

46:03.380 --> 46:05.980
And I really wish that was in Final Fantasy 14.

46:05.980 --> 46:09.380
Like it is a little silly that we're all isolated on this one particular island.

46:09.580 --> 46:11.540
And I can't play with these people over here.

46:11.540 --> 46:13.060
You know, I would really like to be able to do that.

46:13.300 --> 46:16.900
I'm hoping that is something they will work on as they get to their expansion,

46:16.900 --> 46:17.860
Heavensward and all that.

46:17.860 --> 46:20.820
But our UK friends can play on our servers.

46:21.700 --> 46:22.500
Ooh, good point.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.100
Good point.

46:23.100 --> 46:23.540
You're right.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.940
Our UK friends in Final Fantasy 14 can play on our servers.

46:25.940 --> 46:27.940
We can go play on theirs and we can go play on the Japanese servers.

46:28.220 --> 46:29.700
And we have an auto translator.

46:29.740 --> 46:30.300
That's right.

46:30.340 --> 46:34.420
That is, that is an advantage of Final Fantasy 14 versus WoW.

46:34.700 --> 46:40.540
At the end of the day, you can make macros for working with other, you know, countries.

46:40.580 --> 46:44.580
That's also the advantage of having, you know, Final Fantasy 14 being developed

46:44.580 --> 46:46.860
by a Japanese company versus an American company.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.100
You know, they're just different.

46:48.100 --> 46:51.780
And I realize Final Fantasy 14 is what, only a quarter the size of World of Warcraft.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.740
So it's tough to really compare the two games.

46:53.740 --> 46:54.300
Or is it a British company?

46:54.300 --> 46:55.420
I guess it's a British company.

46:56.140 --> 46:56.580
I don't know.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.860
It's an English speaking company.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.420
There you go.

46:59.420 --> 47:02.820
Anyway, so anyway, the competition is good.

47:02.860 --> 47:05.620
I, you know, cause I see things in this new WoW expansion.

47:05.620 --> 47:10.020
I'm like, I'm pretty sure that was lifted from Final Fantasy 14.

47:10.020 --> 47:11.780
I'm pretty sure that came out of 14.

47:12.220 --> 47:15.380
But at the same time, Realm Reborn would not fucking exist

47:15.380 --> 47:16.860
if it's not for World of Warcraft.

47:17.020 --> 47:20.500
I mean, Final Fantasy 14 1.0 is a hot fucking mess.

47:20.740 --> 47:25.860
And luckily Yoshi P, the producer, played a lot of World of Warcraft and took a lot

47:25.860 --> 47:30.700
of the great things that WoW did and made Final Fantasy 14 a playable game because of it.

47:30.700 --> 47:36.060
So as long as the competition between the two and other players, Wildstar, Guild Wars,

47:36.060 --> 47:40.620
Elder Scrolls, as long as the competition is a good, healthy thing and keeps these games

47:40.620 --> 47:43.420
on their toes and getting better, great.

47:43.420 --> 47:44.020
We all win.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.020
FYI, our wallets lose.

47:46.140 --> 47:46.380
What?

47:46.380 --> 47:47.500
I have a red chocobo.

47:48.420 --> 47:49.340
Congratulations.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.340
His name is Hot Wings.

47:52.100 --> 47:52.820
Congratulations.

47:53.020 --> 47:56.700
Uh, Pow in our chat room saying, I'm still trying to get my mountain Final Fantasy 14.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.220
I love the game, but I get lost all the time.

47:58.220 --> 47:59.460
I have no sense of direction.

47:59.820 --> 48:03.300
Uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, I think this was a bad luck scenario.

48:03.460 --> 48:06.140
Usually you'll be able to kick someone for being an asshat.

48:06.500 --> 48:13.500
It's just really unfortunate when time is more important to somebody when you're playing one

48:13.500 --> 48:15.500
of the, being a decent human being, a decent human being.

48:15.620 --> 48:20.820
Like when you're playing one of the biggest fucking time sync games in the universe, which

48:20.820 --> 48:22.380
World of Warcraft is in a way.

48:22.620 --> 48:23.180
So anyway.

48:23.460 --> 48:23.860
All right.

48:23.940 --> 48:25.540
I've just been like, stop being a shit.

48:26.340 --> 48:27.260
Pretty much, pretty much.

48:27.460 --> 48:27.820
Anyway.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.900
And now for something completely different, because there is one other game I've spent an

48:30.900 --> 48:34.660
awful lot of time playing this week that actually has nothing to do with MMOs or swords and

48:34.660 --> 48:35.780
sorcery or any of that stuff.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.380
And that is on the PlayStation 4.

48:37.660 --> 48:43.820
I've been playing quite a lot of Geometry Wars 3, which came out on the PlayStation 4 just

48:43.820 --> 48:48.860
this past week, uh, developed by Lucid Entertainment, which is made up, as I understand

48:48.860 --> 48:51.780
it, of some of the key players that used to be with Bazaar.

48:52.020 --> 48:58.340
And now it's published under Activision's new indie banner Sierra, which is not really a new

48:58.340 --> 48:58.660
banner.

48:58.660 --> 48:59.460
It's an old banner.

48:59.780 --> 49:02.740
But anyway, you don't care about who made it.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.380
You just want to know, is the game good?

49:04.620 --> 49:08.780
And I have to say, yes, the game is, is awfully good.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.900
I'm really enjoying Geometry Wars 3.

49:11.180 --> 49:18.420
Um, it is quite the departure from Geometry Wars 1 and 2 visually, but gameplay wise, not

49:18.420 --> 49:18.900
really.

49:19.260 --> 49:23.980
Um, obviously the big trick in Geometry Wars 3 is that now a lot of the grids are in three

49:23.980 --> 49:24.700
dimensions.

49:24.900 --> 49:27.020
And because of that, they're in different shapes as well.

49:27.260 --> 49:31.260
Now, differently shaped grids is nothing new for Geometry Wars, because if you ever played

49:31.260 --> 49:36.060
the Geometry Wars game that was on the Wii, which was really underplayed and underrated,

49:36.260 --> 49:39.500
there was different shaped maps, maps in that as well.

49:39.700 --> 49:43.980
So the different shapes of the stages and so forth are nothing new for Geometry Wars.

49:44.140 --> 49:48.220
But in the three dimensions, certainly you have to kind of think about the way you're

49:48.220 --> 49:52.500
moving can really change what you can see on a stage.

49:52.500 --> 49:53.580
Let me, let me put it this way.

49:53.580 --> 49:59.140
So imagine you're playing on a stage that looks like a giant log, like a big, big cylinder,

49:59.140 --> 50:02.540
you know, type of log that's very long, but very narrow.

50:02.820 --> 50:05.820
Well, if you're playing on the stage, but you're playing in three dimensions, you can

50:05.820 --> 50:11.420
imagine as you get to the bottom of the log, if you don't make a complete 180, if you take

50:11.420 --> 50:17.180
more of a 90 degree turn, now you're going to flip that so that it's shaped more like a

50:17.180 --> 50:17.780
tree.

50:17.900 --> 50:22.540
And now it's the long, it's, it's tall on your screen and narrow.

50:22.540 --> 50:23.740
Does that make sense what I'm saying?

50:24.100 --> 50:29.660
Like you can flip the stage on its side, but that is very, that can really control how much

50:29.660 --> 50:32.620
you can see of the ships that are coming and what's attacking you.

50:32.660 --> 50:35.700
So if you go in certain directions, it might roll down the stairs and over your neighbor's

50:35.700 --> 50:35.980
dog.

50:38.300 --> 50:39.340
Fuck off.

50:41.180 --> 50:46.620
Anyway, but what's really great about this game is that not only do you have that adventure

50:46.620 --> 50:51.300
mode where you have all these different shapes, stages to play and so forth, but you also

50:51.300 --> 50:55.580
have, you know, classic mode where a lot of the same stuff from Geometry Wars 2 comes

50:55.580 --> 51:00.660
back, such as pacifism mode and king mode and all this stuff is available for you to

51:00.660 --> 51:01.100
play.

51:02.100 --> 51:07.380
They added a little twist now where you have little companions with you that you can either

51:07.380 --> 51:11.740
have be like additional firepower, or they can go and collect the little multiplayer

51:11.740 --> 51:12.660
bonuses.

51:12.860 --> 51:14.300
They can lay down mines.

51:14.300 --> 51:15.500
They do all these other things too.

51:15.500 --> 51:18.780
So I like a lot of the enhancements that they made to the game.

51:18.780 --> 51:21.180
It still definitely feels like a Geometry Wars game.

51:21.180 --> 51:25.420
And if you just want to play like old school Geometry Wars, you kind of can.

51:25.660 --> 51:29.820
And what I, what I mean by that is you can play with the old rules and the old enemies,

51:29.820 --> 51:31.740
but it is still in the new graphics.

51:32.380 --> 51:36.060
But that's okay, because the new graphics for the most part are very good.

51:36.340 --> 51:42.220
The only time I get a little overwhelmed is that sometimes I think my little partnership

51:42.220 --> 51:45.460
guy that's floating around with me, the one that goes out and collects all the multipliers,

51:45.740 --> 51:47.500
I keep thinking that he's an enemy.

51:47.540 --> 51:50.420
So I try to shoot him and avoid him, but it's like, no, that's your friend.

51:50.420 --> 51:52.860
Don't, you know, you can, you can run up and give him a hug.

51:52.860 --> 51:57.340
So sometimes you get a little overwhelmed graphically in that regard, but, um, I'm

51:57.340 --> 51:58.140
enjoying the game.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.940
I think, uh, I think it's pretty awesome.

52:00.500 --> 52:00.820
Let's see.

52:00.820 --> 52:05.940
Robert M in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I've heard a lot of comparisons to

52:05.940 --> 52:06.940
Super Stardust.

52:07.180 --> 52:10.860
Well, if you think about it, Super Stardust was kind of inspired a little bit by the

52:10.860 --> 52:11.980
original Geometry Wars.

52:11.980 --> 52:13.820
So it's not that far of a stretch.

52:13.860 --> 52:17.860
I mean, a lot of twin stick shooters, uh, you know, owe a lot to Geometry Wars.

52:18.060 --> 52:19.540
So there you go.

52:19.540 --> 52:22.100
Those are, those are the two big games that have been taken up my week.

52:22.140 --> 52:26.540
In, in, in addition to the old regulars, I've actually been playing a lot of Diablo

52:26.540 --> 52:29.500
3 this week as well, just with Alan has been playing a lot.

52:29.500 --> 52:30.660
He's probably playing it right now.

52:30.860 --> 52:34.660
He's been playing a lot of Diablo 3 and we're leveling seasonal characters together

52:34.660 --> 52:38.260
because I really want to get him to 70 before they pull the plug on season one so

52:38.260 --> 52:39.620
he can get his transmog armor.

52:39.780 --> 52:41.500
So we've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 as well.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.780
Anyhow, enough about our gaming weeks.

52:44.780 --> 52:49.340
Let's get to the news right after some housekeeping, a very important housekeeping

52:49.340 --> 52:50.100
note for the show.

52:50.100 --> 52:54.060
Don't forget next week, December 7th, that is our next episode.

52:54.340 --> 52:58.820
That is going to be the early show, meaning we are going to be broadcasting at

52:58.820 --> 53:03.420
vognetwork.com at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

53:03.620 --> 53:07.180
And for those of you guys overseas in the UK, this is great news for you because

53:07.180 --> 53:09.500
that's going to be eight o'clock at night for you guys.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.260
So no excuses.

53:11.260 --> 53:14.060
You can be here and participate with the show and call in.

53:14.060 --> 53:18.220
We'll try to open up the phones a little earlier than usual so that those of you

53:18.220 --> 53:20.660
guys in the UK, more of you guys can call in and participate.

53:20.660 --> 53:22.300
We really look forward to hearing from you guys.

53:22.660 --> 53:26.140
Certainly if you're here in the States and you happen to be around at noon or 3 PM,

53:26.140 --> 53:28.620
you can still tune in and still participate and all that good stuff.

53:29.900 --> 53:34.620
The other thing to note is that it will be rebroadcast at six o'clock after Bobby

53:34.620 --> 53:38.140
Black Wolf. For those of you guys that are kind of used to hearing it at six

53:38.140 --> 53:40.940
o'clock, it will be rebroadcast, but it will not be live.

53:41.660 --> 53:45.900
Some of us have some holiday commitments we're going to in the evening, so we're

53:45.900 --> 53:46.780
not going to be around.

53:47.300 --> 53:53.580
But yeah, next show will be December 7th at noon Pacific, eight o'clock in the UK.

53:53.580 --> 53:59.300
Check your world clock and convert noon San Francisco time on Sunday to your local

53:59.300 --> 54:01.300
time to figure out when we will be on.

54:02.180 --> 54:02.620
All right.

54:03.340 --> 54:07.260
Otherwise, twitter.com slash OLR and facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio are

54:07.260 --> 54:12.620
always the places to find us and friend us and be a fan of the show and keep

54:12.620 --> 54:14.300
independent broadcasting alive.

54:14.300 --> 54:15.340
We really appreciate it.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.500
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

54:17.620 --> 54:21.260
It's been a slow week, but there's still been some pretty, pretty big news to come

54:21.260 --> 54:22.300
out of this week, right, Loki?

54:22.580 --> 54:28.660
Yeah, Sony has had to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that

54:28.660 --> 54:32.220
it produced false and misleading advertisement during the launch of the

54:32.220 --> 54:40.460
Vita. And apparently, if you happen to purchase the Vita before June 1st, 2012,

54:40.620 --> 54:45.500
you can either get $25 cash or credit refund or a $50 voucher for select games

54:45.500 --> 54:46.420
and services.

54:47.580 --> 54:51.980
And basically, some of the examples, you know, they were saying that were kind of

54:51.980 --> 54:56.700
misleading. For example, they said, you know, they claimed that the Vita could

54:56.700 --> 55:01.180
pause any PS3 game at any time and continue to play on the on the Vita.

55:01.340 --> 55:05.380
I think they were showing that off with like MLB, one of the MLB games.

55:05.460 --> 55:06.140
I remember that.

55:06.860 --> 55:11.860
It'll be the show, which I think it was available on that one, but it's not, you

55:11.860 --> 55:15.100
know, it kind of implies that you can deal with everything, which you couldn't.

55:15.100 --> 55:19.700
And also, you know, seeing that if you own the 3G version of the device that you

55:19.700 --> 55:24.220
could engage in, they're seeing live multiplayer games through the 3G network,

55:24.220 --> 55:26.980
which, God, no, that's definitely not possible.

55:27.180 --> 55:31.380
And to be perfectly frank, there's really no reason to own a 3G Vita.

55:31.380 --> 55:32.580
Do they even make them anymore?

55:32.620 --> 55:33.820
They don't make them anymore.

55:33.820 --> 55:35.100
And I bought a 3G Vita.

55:35.100 --> 55:35.740
Me too.

55:35.740 --> 55:41.900
Because at some point in the whole thing, Amazon had it like a bundle deal that was

55:41.900 --> 55:45.340
cheaper if you got the 3G model or like maybe it was like $10 more.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.700
So I got the one that came out slightly earlier.

55:47.700 --> 55:51.740
I think it was like a week, it was out a week earlier, but it was the price ended

55:51.740 --> 55:54.220
up being pretty good based off what it was.

55:54.340 --> 55:57.460
You got a memory card in there and it was not so bad.

55:57.460 --> 56:00.780
But, you know, now that I think about it, I was like, you know, they did kind of say

56:00.780 --> 56:01.060
that.

56:01.060 --> 56:06.180
And then I remember that the 3G really did nothing except, oh, you can manage your

56:06.180 --> 56:11.700
friends lists and send messages and do Twitter and Facebook on your Vita if you

56:11.700 --> 56:12.420
really want to.

56:12.420 --> 56:17.740
But in this age of smartphones, it didn't really make sense because they had like

56:17.740 --> 56:22.180
asynchronous multiplayer is basically the only thing you do, which multiplayer over

56:22.180 --> 56:23.860
3G would not be fun.

56:24.100 --> 56:29.020
Anyway, for most, you know, Sony PlayStation experiences.

56:29.020 --> 56:34.420
I mean, I suppose if you were playing a Scrabble-like game on the Vita, then that

56:34.420 --> 56:34.540
would work.

56:34.540 --> 56:37.940
Man, how the fuck did we do multiplayer then back in the days of dial-up?

56:37.940 --> 56:41.700
I mean, shit, you know, I remember playing some dial-up multiplayer games like

56:41.700 --> 56:44.420
Command & Conquer and stuff that it was able to handle that.

56:44.420 --> 56:46.300
Actually, you've got a good point.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.700
Maybe it could have done more over 3G than we give it credit for.

56:49.700 --> 56:54.220
I mean, there are iPhone and Android games that do multiplayer that run pretty

56:54.220 --> 56:54.500
decently.

56:54.500 --> 56:58.940
I mean, there's MMOs on the freaking iPad, you know, so they work pretty easily.

56:58.940 --> 56:59.980
But whatever.

57:00.980 --> 57:07.660
So, cool, $50, you know, I'm looking forward to getting another rebate because I

57:07.660 --> 57:11.860
did buy one, although I don't have my system anymore, but I did pay for one.

57:11.860 --> 57:14.660
So I mowed my $50, right?

57:15.380 --> 57:17.700
Yeah, this news kind of caught me by surprise.

57:17.700 --> 57:22.500
I mean, I was like, all right, I guess if they're going to be giving me, what, $50 in

57:22.500 --> 57:25.020
merchandise or whatever, then I just hope...

57:25.020 --> 57:26.500
I'll take $50 in merchandise.

57:26.500 --> 57:26.900
I hope...

57:27.900 --> 57:31.100
Does $50 in merchandise mean like a gift certificate for the PlayStation Store?

57:31.100 --> 57:32.180
Because that'd be awesome.

57:32.180 --> 57:36.980
I'd rather buy like a PS4 game than a Vita game, which I think says a lot about my

57:36.980 --> 57:38.380
Vita, my poor Vita.

57:40.220 --> 57:44.300
But I guess I was just kind of taken by surprise because I didn't realize that this

57:44.300 --> 57:47.380
was something that the FTC was going after Sony for.

57:47.660 --> 57:52.260
And it's not like I've necessarily been sitting here going, Sony's lied to me and

57:52.260 --> 57:55.020
Sony had all these issues and dah, dah, dah.

57:55.260 --> 57:59.540
But I think we've all kind of been sitting here going, you know, the Vita, the Vita

57:59.540 --> 58:01.580
didn't really turn out the way we all thought it was going to.

58:01.580 --> 58:02.300
Let's be honest.

58:02.300 --> 58:09.780
I mean, people have sued and won against Red Bull for claiming that it doesn't give

58:09.780 --> 58:11.140
you the ability to fly.

58:11.140 --> 58:16.300
So, I mean, I'm not surprised that, you know, that they...

58:17.780 --> 58:19.500
It doesn't really give me wings?

58:19.620 --> 58:21.180
No, it doesn't give you wings.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.300
Does it give me horns?

58:24.580 --> 58:28.900
So, you know, I just I guess I'm not surprised that they did this.

58:30.460 --> 58:35.460
Cool. I mean, hey, you know, if I can get in on this and sure, yeah, I'll take, you

58:35.460 --> 58:36.260
know, some merchandise.

58:36.260 --> 58:39.300
Was that just because you're like, oh, hey, free shit or is this...

58:39.300 --> 58:39.780
Exactly.

58:39.940 --> 58:40.660
Hey, free shit.

58:40.660 --> 58:41.900
Nah, oh, I was duped.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.620
I mean, it was kind of underwhelming some of the stuff that they came out with.

58:45.620 --> 58:49.620
Like, you know, I was hoping that the Call of Duty game was going to be good and I was

58:49.620 --> 58:53.500
hoping, you know, that they'd have a Grand Theft Auto game on the Vita or, you know,

58:53.500 --> 58:54.540
Resistance and stuff.

58:54.540 --> 58:56.020
And all those games kind of were lame.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.300
And it's not necessarily Sony's fault.

59:00.020 --> 59:04.580
But it's just it didn't really come through with the promise of this portable gaming

59:04.580 --> 59:07.460
platform that was going to be so much better than the PSP was.

59:07.620 --> 59:11.260
And it just really kind of turned out like the PSP, if not maybe a little bit worse.

59:11.900 --> 59:16.060
I would definitely, you know, say there's a part of me, though, that although I didn't

59:16.060 --> 59:21.500
necessarily have a problem with the Vita per se, I mean, that was rooted in these

59:21.500 --> 59:23.900
issues that they got slapped on the wrist over.

59:23.900 --> 59:27.180
I mean, my issue is just that they weren't really putting out games on it.

59:27.180 --> 59:29.820
They had a pretty strong launch and then it dried up.

59:29.820 --> 59:32.900
And it's not even like the Wii U where they trickled out.

59:32.900 --> 59:36.500
And now the Wii U has a pretty impressive backlog of good games to play.

59:36.660 --> 59:40.140
But the Vita never even it was like, oh, you could just, you know, play your PlayStation

59:40.140 --> 59:40.540
four.

59:40.540 --> 59:44.660
We have we have a lot of indie games that are on every other platform down with getting

59:44.660 --> 59:50.140
one again, if I could play my PlayStation four games over the Internet, you know,

59:50.140 --> 59:54.100
through my work's Wi-Fi, if it was going to be fast enough to do that.

59:54.100 --> 59:55.220
But I don't think it is.

59:55.220 --> 59:58.860
So, you know, unfortunately, I just can't see myself doing that.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.180
But there is a part of me that goes, you know what?

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.340
They did say you'd be able to do 3G multiplayer and you can't do that.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.380
And they did really make it seem like you were going to be able to pick up all your

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.300
PlayStation games and do the streaming.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.780
You can do that.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.500
So there is a part of me that's like, you know what?

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.980
Some some people do need to get slapped on the wrist for all these outrageous claims.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.740
What about I mean, what about I guess it's concept, though.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740
But what about the Kinect?

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740
I mean, the same type of thing.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.300
They said they promised me I'd be able to scan in my skateboard and be able to use that

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.260
skateboard in the game.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.580
Oh, but that game got canceled.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.500
Right. No, that you know, they have that feature, but it ended up being, oh, yeah, you

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.100
can scan in a picture, but it's just going to pick up the color and it's going to be

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.060
for, you know, was it that Kinect car racing game?

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:44.140
And now every color that you'd scan to be like pink because that camera was shit.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.660
Now, Loki, on Xbox one, you can scan your face and put it in.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.460
Oh, yeah, that's so much better.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:53.820
Yeah, that's not an impossible task.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.740
You know, you have to have like the proper lighting and professional studio set up and

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.900
yet, you know, multiple shots of your face.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.620
And it still looks like fucking Quasimodo when you're done.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.780
So, yeah, no thanks.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.660
I'm OK, I don't need my face in the game.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.860
Dark Sakura, do you believe the Sony should have been slapped on the wrist about this

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.180
whole thing, the way they're being?

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.220
Yeah, false advertising.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.220
Yeah, really. I mean, they might probably put it out with the expectation that it was

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.340
going to be able to do that, but reality and expectation can be two different things.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.260
So at the very least, I think that.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.300
Having some sort of compensation for the lack thereof is a good idea.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.180
Yeah. Boy, so more bad news about the Vita for Sony.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:46.060
I mean, it really seems like that platform is going kaput, unless that PlayStation Vita

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:50.780
TV or whatever can really turn that can really do well for him, because, I mean, I can

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.660
only see the price of that going down.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.580
And honestly, it's a good alternative.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:59.180
If you're looking for something to stream Netflix on or something, it's not bad.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.300
And plus, if you're looking like to get in on some of these digital games and if you

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.900
have PlayStation Plus, you already have a library for that thing.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.700
And there are those few Vita games that you really do need to play.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.460
It's like there's Persona 4, right?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.180
I mean, there are some Vita games that you are missing out on by not having it.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.980
I mean, you could probably count them on one hand, but you could have a place to play

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.660
those, you know.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.900
Well, Persona 4, that was just on PlayStation 3.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.300
Isn't the Vita one the definitive version that they add extra stuff to it or something?

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.180
I don't know.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:35.020
Yeah, but yeah, I mean, it's not a bad platform and, you know, at least it's region

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.460
free.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:36.940
That's true.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.740
There is always that.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.180
It's your only region free handheld at this point, because, thank you, Nintendo.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.620
Well, speaking of Nintendo and handhelds, actually, Nintendo filed a very interesting

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.700
patent this week.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:54.300
One of the posters over on the big NeoGAF forum found this, that there was actually a

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:00.660
patent filed by Nintendo, which regards emulation of classic Game Boy titles on

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:06.100
various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.900
And you could see all the blah, blah, blahs if you, you know, really want to kind of

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.700
read through this.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.700
But essentially, at the end of the day, it talks about emulation of the Game Boy on

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.220
smartphones, tablets, other types of screens.

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.620
Like, think about, like, when you're on an airplane and, you know, you could, do you

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.340
know, you can play, like, games on those TV, depending on what airline is.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.660
You can, like, play games now on those airline TVs.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.500
You know, it covers all sorts of things like that.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.660
So this has a lot of people going, is Nintendo.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.020
I mean, Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure from investors to do more with

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.780
iPhones and Android devices because mobile's where it's at, right?

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.020
Even though for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.700
Or is this a way to get, you know, strikes against people that make emulators for those

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.300
platforms?

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.540
Well, and that's what I wonder as well, is that, is it really about Nintendo wants to do

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.140
something in themselves or they want to stop other people from doing it so that people

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.300
have to buy a 3DS?

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.340
But can they patent that?

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:05.460
I mean, if, you know, other people have come up with emulators, but I mean, they, I would

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:09.140
say other people came up with emulators before Nintendo came up with an emulator for

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:09.980
those things.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.100
It'd be kind of hard to patent that.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.780
I would, it's hard to patent software.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.300
Yes, but at the same time, Nintendo probably patented it, you know, or Nintendo probably

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.460
invented the emulator while the Game Boy hardware was still under patent.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.340
Because, you know, hardware patents expire after a certain amount of time.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.060
That's why you have devices like the Retron console that will play all that stuff, because

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.260
technically they're allowed to do that.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.340
It's kind of a gray area legally, but it's one of those things.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.500
I'm surprised we haven't seen like a Retron type console for handhelds.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.300
The Retron 5 takes Game Boy Advance, which means Game Boy regular as well.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.940
It's, that's one of the five systems that it takes.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.740
So, and if you think about it, you could always run it through a Super Game Boy, do it

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.180
that way.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.540
So in a way it does.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.220
Which, there you go, that would have been the first Game Boy emulator, right?

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.500
Would have been the Super Game Boy.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:07.140
Sort of, I guess, but that's a hardware emulator versus like a software emulator.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.100
I mean, it's actually, you know, emulating the hardware through hardware versus like a

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.260
program, like where it's all emulated through a program.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.420
See, it's tricky, but you're probably right.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:20.900
This is probably a preemptive strike to make sure that nobody tries to put like a Game

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.980
Boy, like Pokemon Yellow or something.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.500
Are they on the market?

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.540
Coming up on that, was it, you know, the Retron 5 stuff, you know, where they have all

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.420
that available.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.900
Is that because, you know, after a while the patents expire and they become, you know, not

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:38.940
public domain, but I don't know how exactly they do that legally.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.060
But is that because maybe the Game Boy ones coming up available, maybe people, maybe

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.660
they're thinking that maybe someone's going to be able to legally emulate that stuff?

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:52.180
Well, or not necessarily emulate, but like come up with like some sort of, I don't know, I

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.820
don't know what their thought process is.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.820
I think part of the reason why the Retron 5 has avoided Nintendo's wrath and these other

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.660
companies' wrath is because you still have to have all the original cartridges to play the

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.140
games.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.580
But if you're talking about downloading something to your phone, those aren't going to

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.420
take cartridges.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.740
So now we're talking about the precious, precious software is going to have to be, you

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.380
know, digital.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.740
And that's what Nintendo is really trying to prevent.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.580
You know what I mean?

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:19.260
Again, it's about preventing Pokemon, yellow, red, blue, what other Game Boy games, all

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.100
the, Metroid 2 and all that showing up as downloads.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.460
I guess they could do it on phone.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.580
I mean, obviously they've done it on phones already.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:28.300
I just, touch screens, man.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.620
It's just not the same.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:30.420
Yeah.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.180
DarkTitsuya in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, I think they're just

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:38.220
legally covering their asses as far as putting emulators on the various digital

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:38.900
stores.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.260
Tigerclaw says, people can download paid versions of apps that will work on their

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.740
devices when they sideload it.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.860
So Nintendo making games on it, people will just pirate it.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.420
And DarkTitsuya says, I found a few emulated GBA games on the Windows phone store.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.140
I'm just saying.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:03.780
I got, one time I got a MAME emulator on the iTunes because it was a public domain

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:08.500
game that had slipped under the radar and Apple approved it, I guess, for, for

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.780
publishing on the iTunes.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.140
But what it was, it was a MAME emulator.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.140
So if you had any, and you didn't have to jailbreak your phone, you have any type of

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:19.820
file tree browser, like, um, what's that program, iPhone box or whatever, you could

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.380
just plug in your iPad and dump ROMs into the directory.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.780
And this game would load all of the ROMs and you could basically turn your iPhone or

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.140
iPad into a MAME emulator.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.820
And this thing was up on the iTunes store for like two weeks before Apple pulled it.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:39.140
So what I'm saying is that if things like that can sneak through, there'll be Game Boy

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.580
emulators that sneak through as well.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.940
And that's what they've already implemented.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.100
They have stuff like that, but yeah, I don't know.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:48.820
I've just, I wouldn't hold out that this means that Nintendo is going to put out, you

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.660
know, like an official Game Boy emulator or something like that, you know, or virtual

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.140
console.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.780
It'd be nice if they had virtual console on mobile.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:08:01.780
I mean, I just think their concern is that, and surprisingly or not, their concern is

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:08.820
that it wouldn't play as well as it would on, you know, like a console or a handheld.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.820
So I think that's why they're not, you know, doing anything like that because there's no

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.300
way to guarantee you're going to get that same type of gameplay.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.780
And you just can't do that with touch screen only.

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:18.580
All right.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:19.860
All right.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.820
Well, we'll see what happens if Nintendo ends up going after anybody in the coming weeks.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.300
We'll see.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.460
But meanwhile, we have more news, right, Darcacra?

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.580
Well, we have another company doing the dance of accountability.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.740
And that is Ubisoft, of course.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.620
We know about the debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.020
Well, they finally put out a formal apology.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.500
In fact, the apology comes from Yanis Malat, who is the CEO of Ubisoft Montreal.

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:53.060
Basically, the quote goes, I want to sincerely apologize on behalf of Ubisoft and the entire

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.580
Assassin's Creed team.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.260
These problems took away from your enjoyment of the game and kept many of you from experiencing

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.260
the game at its fullest potential.

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.580
To show our appreciation for your continued support, we're making the upcoming Assassin's

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.860
Creed Unity Dead Kings DLC free for everyone.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.860
For season pass holders, we will also offer the choice of one additional game from the

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.620
selection of Ubisoft titles for free.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.580
And that's the direct quote.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.020
So if you got the game, you get some free DLC.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.700
If you have the season pass, you get a free game.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:29.540
Free DLC is an interesting slippery slope, though, because, I mean, they never had to

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.460
charge that DLC in the first place.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.500
But I don't know.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.940
I suppose at the same time, if you're kind of accustomed to Assassin's Creed games at

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.580
this point, you knew you were going to be paying $10, $15 for, you know, expansions

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.540
at some point down the line.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.140
It's the business model nowadays.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:43.620
Yeah, it is.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.420
It really is.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:49.780
They have what maybe just happened to have, you know, DLC set aside as an apology.

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.340
Yeah.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.940
You know, that could be entirely possible.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.660
I think it was actually supposed to be the first legit part of the season pass.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:01.940
This isn't necessarily like when BioWare apologized over Mass Effect 3 and created

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:06.820
DLC to give away for free, which in turn delayed all the rest of the DLC.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:07.700
But, you know, that's...

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.980
Well, they said they haven't necessarily canceled the season pass.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.300
They're just giving this away for free and season pass holders are going to be compensated

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.060
for what they've spent.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.900
Because those people took a huge leap of faith and many of them ended up disappointed because

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.220
that, you know, that lady was missing a fucking face.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:24.420
Yeah.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.460
And they're being compensated by way of free games.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.820
Dear NPC lady, sorry we forgot to give you a face.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.700
Love Ubisoft.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.980
I think, uh, pal, I think you're misunderstanding.

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.620
The season pass has not been canceled.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.860
In our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:40.660
Yeah.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.740
The season pass is not canceled.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.220
They did not say it was canceled.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.460
They just said that they are giving season pass holders an alternative.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.300
Which really the alternative should be Far Cry 4.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.460
You should really get Far Cry 4.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.500
Well, Far Cry 3 maybe, but I don't think you're getting Far Cry 4.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.980
No, Far Cry 4 is one of the games that they're allowing you to get.

01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.940
Is it really?

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:03.460
Yeah, so the games The Crew, which is, you know, the...

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.180
We'll get into that.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.260
So these are new Ubisoft games.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:12.340
So The Crew, Far Cry 4, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed, Black Flag, Rayman Legends, Just Dance

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:12.900
2015.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.940
Okay, don't do Rayman Legends because that's probably dirt cheap now.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.780
Just Dance 2015 wasn't a full price game anyway, so really you're left with four games.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:21.860
Far Cry 4 is probably the best.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.260
I don't know.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.700
I really like to dance, Loki.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:25.700
It's not a full price game.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.860
Utilize your full free benefit.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.380
I'm not smart shopping.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.500
You're not smart shopping.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.220
Yes, exactly.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.060
Get the full price game free.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.820
Buy the other game at a discounted price.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.200
All right.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.620
Well, what do you guys think?

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.380
Is this a sufficient apology?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.060
Is this something Ubisoft had to do?

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.740
I think it's nice that they're doing that.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.020
Uh, what they could have done is, I don't know, don't release a fucking buggy ass game

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.500
at launch, especially with, I think Far Cry 4 has got some issues too, but it's not as

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:02.260
bad and we're going to get into their next game that's coming out, which could possibly

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.620
have same issues because they're hiding behind some sort of excuse.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.220
So we'll see.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:12.660
And it was already delayed as it was, you know, so I don't know.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.940
This is one of those things where Ubisoft certainly didn't have to do it.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:23.940
It's a good face saving move, pun intended, but I'm kind of curious, what is the long

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.580
term strategy to make sure this doesn't happen again?

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.460
That's what I'd really like to kind of hear out Ubisoft because you know, you're right,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.020
Loki.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.900
A lot of this is probably really rooted in the fact that the game was rushed.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.940
So I would just like to see Ubisoft say, you know what?

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:40.500
We're going to take our, this is the steps we're taking to patch the game, but they do

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.220
have that blog.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.580
So I think they're doing some of that.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:51.140
This is entirely EA 2013, you know, or even 2014 to some extent, because for example,

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:55.940
Battlefield 4 was a fucking mess and it took a fucking long time to fix.

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.460
And so what did they do with their big franchise games?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.380
They delay them to make sure they were OK.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.260
Dragon Age Inquisition, as far as I'm aware, doesn't have any issues.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.140
Got great reviews.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.660
Battlefield Hardline's been delayed to March to give it more time so they can have that

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:15.860
game polished and make sure that it runs significantly better than Battlefield 4.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.020
So I think that they kind of learn their lesson and you need to take more time and get your

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:24.500
games right the first time instead of launching them and just like hoping that there's not

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.140
big bugs.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.140
I mean, how do you miss bugs like that?

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.180
I don't think they did.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:35.060
I think what it came down to is that they launched it and they're like, well, we'll

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:35.780
just fix it.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.620
You know, we'll fix it in a day one patch or we're hopefully going to get this patched

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.180
up in time.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.660
I think they just did this to get it out so that they can, you know, because they had

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:49.620
already delayed it once, you know, from the end of October to come in, you know, at the

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.860
same time as Assassin's Creed Rogue and whether that was just a timing thing so that there's

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.780
not two Assassin's Creed games coming out two different times or if it was just they

01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.580
needed more time.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.420
This is something that has to be fixed at a much higher level, I think.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.420
Yeah, because honestly, I mean, we're all kind of sick of playing beta testers for this,

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:17.700
you know, you have a team of testers for these games, bugs where the face is missing shouldn't

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.780
be something that I mean, I can see there could be a bug where if you do something really

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:26.740
obscure that, oh, OK, you know, something weird happens and exploit more like, yeah,

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:31.060
like some weird glitch or something or maybe some weird AI behavior every now and then.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.180
And that's fine.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:37.940
But like, you know, fate just testing with this stuff, it doesn't make any sense that

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.980
you wouldn't catch this, especially if it's in all versions of the game.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.340
I don't know.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:43.780
All right.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.860
Well, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:46.820
All right.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:55.140
So speaking of different companies with issues, I don't even know why they're I know why they're

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.380
doing this, but it doesn't make any sense.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.180
Activision.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:04.500
So they've been issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos for Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:10.980
Now, that doesn't make much sense if you think about it, but they're only doing that on videos

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.420
that they claim are promoting cheating or unfair exploits.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.820
So some of these games have glitches in them.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:21.380
You know, you'll see lots of glitch videos and stuff from Call of Duty, you know, some

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.580
of the past games and everything.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:29.700
But now instead of, you know, taking the time to fix these glitches, they're punishing the

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.620
people that are finding these glitches and recording them in videos.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:41.460
So they're basically, you know, I guess Machinima was warning its members that, hey, Activision

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:46.420
is being vigilant about Call of Duty videos lately, issuing strikes on videos showing

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.060
glitches.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:52.420
If you post videos highlighting these glitches, your channel may be liable to receive copyright

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:52.740
strikes.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.020
So please be careful.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.300
I'm sorry, but that's not what DMCA is for.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:02.420
DMCA is for stopping copyrighted footage from going out there, not because you don't like

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.180
the video's content.

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.340
So this is a slippery slope where, oh, okay, we don't want this video showing glitches

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.300
in the game.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.940
Oh, well, we don't want this video coming out later on.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.900
You know, let's take a step further.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:16.820
Oh, we don't want this video out there because it shows a bad review of the game or something

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:17.300
like that.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.740
That is the, you know, kind of the direction they're going here.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.620
And I'm sorry.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.100
You know what?

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.980
Spend the time to fix it instead of punishing fans of your game showing these types of videos

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.140
out.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.820
Hey, you know what?

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.340
You're probably finding out about these glitches from these videos, so take the time to fix

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.500
it instead of, you know, now you don't have to pay your testers that much more because

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.020
you're having people test for you.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:39.300
I don't know.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:44.020
I just don't understand why they're punishing people that are doing YouTube videos of their

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.060
video, you know, games.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:50.180
And you're absolutely right when you say that this is not an appropriate use of DMCA.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.180
That's not what it's for.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:57.300
And I would, I don't know, obviously it's going to be hard for like, you know, an independent

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:00.180
YouTuber to fight back against it because, you know, they're not going to take...

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.820
Because YouTube always sides.

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.340
YouTube does not...

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.220
And this is part of what pisses me off so much about YouTube.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.300
And this is warning, rant incoming, but there's...

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.780
You look back at the history of YouTube and all this stuff we've talked about before and

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:19.780
the other takedown notices they have and the copyright strikes, the way you fight it, they

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.940
never side with the people that put them in the place that they're at.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.660
That is so fucked up.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.100
Like, why is there not a legit competitor out there to YouTube?

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.100
It's probably because of the bandwidth and all that other stuff.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:39.940
But like, people need another place because YouTube constantly sides against its own users.

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.860
And they know that for a fact.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:46.100
I bet you, you know, their legal department knows that this is not the proper use of DMCA,

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.460
but who's going to fight them on it?

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.700
No one is going to fight them on it because they have so many lawyers and so much money

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:52.420
to throw at it.

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.060
It doesn't matter.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:53.540
They're going to...

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.020
They can shoot down anybody that tries to take them up on it.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.020
And I'm sure someone would argue that YouTube has to be against its users and up all these

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.220
other companies asses because that's how they stay legal and avoid a lawsuit and copyright

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.700
suits would be worse and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.540
But I just, I kind of also think you're living in a fantasy world with some of that.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.340
Like, I get, like, if somebody is going to take an entire episode of The Walking Dead

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.780
and upload it to YouTube, that that has to be taken down or whatever.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:23.700
But some of these other things that are in more of a legal gray area, like what you're

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.300
talking about, you know, where it's essentially, you know, fair use and criticism.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:32.180
What they need to have is like actual punishments for, you know, false DMCA.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:32.740
Yes.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:37.220
Because they have, you know, puns, you know, we've even seen this with like, you know,

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.780
don't want to go there, but like, you know, some of the gamergate stuff and some of the

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.340
other.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:47.460
You'll see a lot of people taking using DMCA to try to take down videos they don't like,

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:51.940
you know, whether it be independent developers who are questionable that want to take down

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.380
bad reviews of their games or bad let's plays or whatever.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:00.100
Or, you know, publishers trying to take down, you know, videos of, you know, glitches or

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:00.900
something in their games.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.660
You can't do that.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:07.140
You either let the videos all go through or you don't let any of them go through.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.980
I mean, that's the way I think it should be.

01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:12.020
I am so down with the idea that strike should apply both ways.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:13.940
There there should be.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:19.780
Well, it's hard to see who would mediate that, though, who would determine, you know, whether

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.300
it's fair use or not.

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:21.780
I don't know.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.460
Anyway, let's move on.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.500
We're going to talk about a story.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.900
Maybe this has to be mediated, too.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.300
I don't know.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.820
But GameStop has opened their mouths and said that they are worried that digital games are

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:41.780
starting to become too cheap, and it's deterring customers from buying games at retail.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.020
This is a comment from Tony Bartell, who is GameStop's president.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:50.020
We want to help ensure that our industry does not make the same mistake as other entertainment

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:54.900
categories by driving the perceived value of digital goods significantly below that

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.100
of a physical game.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.100
When the free digital token programs end, we believe that the industry will need to work

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.820
together to continue to price goods in a way that sustains profitability and encourages

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.900
a great innovation that this category needs.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:11.860
He also said that research indicated that the average price a consumer pays for a full

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:14.340
AAA game download is $22.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.900
Consumers expected to pay about $35.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.340
Um, it's supply and demand.

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.660
I mean, if they're going to get it cheaper elsewhere, then they're going to get it cheaper

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.060
elsewhere.

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.060
That's why you don't sell PC games anymore.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:34.580
Well, they probably don't sell PC games very much anymore because you can get it cheaper

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.060
on Steam or elsewhere at Origin.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:43.220
They're not always, it's not always the cheapest way to go on these digital stores.

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:48.500
I would say even like on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace, a lot of times

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:52.020
you're not going to see those deep discounts because there's no competition.

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.980
It's you either get it on PlayStation Network or you buy it physical and that's it.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.100
Those are your two options.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:03.060
You're not going to be able to buy, you know, a code for some game cheaper on another

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.700
marketplace like, you know, Amazon or something like that.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.860
They're not going to really have it discounted.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.780
It's going to be the same price across the board.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:12.660
Jamie, what do you think?

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:18.740
I honestly think that it's just another symptom of relying a little bit too much on

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.380
consumerism.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:24.580
If you want to have something that the consumer is going to buy, you put it at the price

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.940
the consumer is going to afford.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.500
Right.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:34.660
And there's a big advantage to going away from printed media and the fact that you are

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.260
creating less waste.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:37.860
It takes up less space.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.020
You're actually dealing with something that is not just more economically viable.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.980
But environmentally viable.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:50.020
Something that's going to be an ongoing sustainable model as, you know, the technology

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:50.740
just improves.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:57.300
And I really do think that GameStop has also made the poor decision of oversaturating

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:57.780
the market.

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.500
You can't, it's like seeing Starbucks everywhere.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:06.260
And unfortunately, not everybody needs to buy a video game twice a day.

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.940
Like some of us are with our coffee.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:16.820
So it doesn't, you know, as digital distribution is becoming more and more prevalent, it's

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:21.220
basically what we ran into with Blockbuster versus having the Redboxer versus Netflix.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.180
It's going to be obsolete before too long.

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.540
They're on their way to obsolescence and they see it coming.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.940
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says, well, GameStop, you wouldn't

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.180
have to worry if you didn't oversaturate with retail stores and dick people on trade-in

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:38.660
prices.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.540
Kind of part of what you said.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.060
Dungeon Buster says, too cheap.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.740
Let's not forget the GameStop tried to get into digital distribution with impulse.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.300
And yeah, on the PC side and that, or I don't know if it's just PC, but yeah, it just

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.420
doesn't work out too well.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.820
I think that they're still viable as far as, you know, old games work.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.420
I mean, catalog is where it's at.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.100
They're not going to be able to make a ton of money, new release.

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.100
And if everything goes digital, there's not going to be that market anymore.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:14.420
And I think, and I've said this before on the show, is that my incentive to go digital

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.780
has to be because it's cheaper or there's some other value in it.

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.060
Because when I buy a physical copy, that's mine.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:26.420
And the way the games work today and what we all fought for, yes, we fought for this

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.740
because when Microsoft threatened to break this mold, they got dragged through the fucking

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.380
coals and they still haven't recovered in many ways.

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:39.940
We fought for that we would be able to have a game, it's my game, I own it, my physical

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:45.700
copy, and I can give it to somebody else and loan it and much like a DVD or a VHS tape

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.620
and they can play it and use it too.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.740
You have that equity.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.900
I buy the game and I have this and someday I could sell it back or give it to somebody

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:56.980
else just as I sell a CD back or something like that.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.740
So it has to be about to tear me away from that physical copy.

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:07.140
If you charge $59.99 for physical and $59.99 for digital, then I better see what's the

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.660
fucking perk of getting it digitally.

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.260
Now, for some people it's, oh, well, the game releases earlier.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.380
They will trade in the equity to play the game 24 hours sooner, which is not good enough

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.220
for me, but for some people it is.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:19.780
That's fine.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.460
Um, I got my DLC bonus for Dragon Age.

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:23.780
Yeah.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.660
Sometimes it's getting more stuff, uh, like free DLC when you buy digitally.

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.460
And the game was installed and ready to go when I got home.

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.020
Right.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:32.260
Yeah.

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:38.180
But for me, I'm like, I still prefer physical unless digital is way cheaper, like a steam

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.380
sale or something like that.

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:39.700
Yeah.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.260
And I wish that they had the dynamic that they do.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:46.180
And they probably, I guess I would say maybe the publishers don't wish that they have this,

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:50.820
but I wish that they had that dynamic where you could have the PlayStation Network and

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:57.300
stuff as a place where you redeem stuff and then you can buy that, those codes elsewhere

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.180
for different prices.

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.860
Like say I want a digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:06.900
You know, Amazon may have it for $39.99 or something one day and then, you know, Target

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.900
has it for $59 or, you know, this other place has it for $49.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.420
You know, having those sales in different locations, you know, that'd be pretty nice,

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:18.900
but they don't because it's, you know, I don't know, I guess the regulation that they have

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:23.380
on there where you can't mark it down in one location and I haven't marked down another

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.340
location, I guess.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.300
I don't know what the case may be, but I do wish digital games were a little bit cheaper

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:35.380
because I, in like with Grand Theft Auto, see I bought digitally just because I wanted

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.740
to play it early as possible.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.020
Also, I knew I wasn't going to sell it back, so I didn't really want to worry about that.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.180
And you weigh the pros and cons with every game.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.300
Yeah, and like, you know, I don't know.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:52.100
And plus, oh, and also because I was getting $15 back, you know, for buying a couple full-price

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:56.580
games, I was going to buy Call of Duty digitally because I got it on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.860
4 for paying the same price.

01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.140
So essentially got a free game.

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.020
And then I bought Grand Theft Auto.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.060
And so after I purchased that, I got $15 back on top of it.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:10.980
So it made it, you know, averaging out the cost, it made it cheaper than buying it at retail.

01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:16.500
So you granted later on, I could have bought those all at retail and then traded in.

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:21.620
I think one other very important thing to consider with the whole physical versus digital

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.700
is that, you know, with digital, we're still at the mercy of the cable companies and our

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.460
internet connections at the end of the day.

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.820
And there's still a lot of that that seems very volatile.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:35.700
And we've heard about, you know, Comcast testing these 300 gigabyte bandwidth caps and so

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:35.780
forth.

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:39.300
I mean, 300 gigabytes ain't going to get you a lot of PlayStation games.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.780
And that's because you do nothing else the rest of the month, which I bet you play a

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:44.900
lot of those games online.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.500
You get any bandwidth for that too.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:53.140
So my worry is, you know, what if the shit hits the fan with these monopolies in cable

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.020
internet service?

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.020
Because in most towns, it's a monopoly.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.220
You have one choice.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:01.620
And if they make a decision that's going to really screw you over, digital may no longer

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.420
be an option.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.100
So it's kind of like, I'm going to need that physical copy to exist.

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:10.420
So that's another reason why I don't want to see digital necessarily take over, because

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:16.500
right now we have an unregulated, you know, I know there's a big push for things to go

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:16.820
the other way.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.340
And I think this is part of why it's important.

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.900
But right now we have an unregulated data industry.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:26.180
Well, and also on top of this, you have the other factor, which is, you know, GameStop.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.500
Yeah, you have all these nice retail games and everything.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.140
And then granted, sometimes they do sell digital codes, which, you know, don't get me wrong.

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:40.260
I don't really see why you would buy digital code from GameStop unless you unless you're

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:44.660
trading in, you know, store credit that you have from trading games towards this code.

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:49.220
I don't see a reason why you would purchase like, say, a season pass for something like,

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.660
oh, I'm going to buy Assassin's Creed.

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:54.340
I'm going to buy the season pass because all you're getting is a fucking code that's printed

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.420
on our receipt that you're going to redeem anyways.

01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:01.460
I don't know why you would pay for that from them and pay tax on top of that or whatever.

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.100
But you also have all these indie games.

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:09.460
Once again, a lot of these indie games that are digital only that GameStop can't sell

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.020
or even steam games, you know, GameStop can't really sell that.

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.260
They can only sell steam cards or, you know,

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:19.860
occasional box games that happen to have a steam code in them or whatever.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:25.300
So that's kind of a good percentage of the market that they're not able to touch.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.020
It would be nice to be able to resell some of the games.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.460
I have a lot of steam games that I got up to 90%

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.420
because of all those games I've been buying of unplayed games.

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.100
Well, it is interesting to see some of the things

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.540
that steam is doing to give more equity to those downloadable games.

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.900
And maybe steam isn't allowing you to sell those games yet,

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.500
but with, you know, the family share and some of the other things they're doing,

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.180
they're trying to sweeten the pot a little bit.

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:52.420
I mean, family share isn't something I can do right now with a physical game.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.020
If I'm not sitting, you know, right near the person, you know what I mean?

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.180
Like I can family share across a great distance,

01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.620
which I can't do with a physical game right now,

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.340
which is funny because that's what Xbox was going to do.

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.420
But we rejected it.

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:11.220
Well, you know, actually, with iOS, you have family sharing now already built in.

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.780
There's a family sharing thing for all iOS apps.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:20.100
Oh, so like if I buy an app, then, you know, if my kid has an iPad, they can get it too?

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:25.220
You basically, you add their Apple ID into your family sharing plan.

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:31.540
Whatever they buy, it is attached to their Apple ID, but anybody in the family can play it.

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:32.180
Oh, interesting.

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:35.860
And parents can control whether or not their kids can actually make the purchase.

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.580
Interesting.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.460
And so you can also hide some of your purchases from each other,

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:43.860
but that way family members will have the ability to make use of everything.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.940
Well, like say, you know, mom.

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.900
So the kids don't need to see that mom and dad have been on Tinder?

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.120
Yeah.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.240
You know, well, at any rate, you know, say this, say that you're playing, you know,

01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:01.000
some violent game that you don't want the five-year-old to be poking at,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.520
then you can hide that and they won't have access to it.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.960
But I mean, but that's, it's actually been existing and working rather

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.400
smoothly now for the past few months.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.800
Or the subscription to Playboy magazine that they might have, you know, for the articles.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.960
Or, you know, bouncing boobs the app.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.120
Ideally, like I would like to see Apple approve that.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.800
I don't know.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:24.920
Ideally, I would like to see once that PlayStation Now service gets more in the swing,

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:30.120
you know, swing of things where you have like PlayStation 4 games or something that you buy.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.760
Like, for example, Dragon Age Inquisition,

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.880
one of the games I was thinking about purchasing digitally over the weekend.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.600
But I kind of stopped myself a bunch of times because,

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.560
you know, I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna have to download that.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.480
And that, you know, I want to play it now,

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.000
but then I'm not gonna be able to actually play it until, you know, tomorrow or something like that,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.680
because it's gonna have to download overnight.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.200
It really didn't take that long to download.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.280
All right, let's move on though, because we're running a little long.

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.480
We still got plenty of ground to cover.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.720
So I'm gonna go to the next story over with Dark Sakura.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.200
Well, back to Ubisoft.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.840
It looks like they are learning their lesson with some of this too, because for the crew,

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.960
the online racing game that's going to be coming out,

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:14.840
they're basically not giving reviewers any early access.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.480
Everyone reviews it after the game is already out.

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.000
Um, the servers are going to go on at exactly the same time for everybody.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:30.440
There is no embargo, but they are requesting that people put 40 to 50 hours into the game,

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.400
so they get a quote, a full experience.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.840
And they do have a warning about early reviews to quote.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.000
It says, while we fully anticipate that you might see some reviews immediately at launch,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.920
largely built around the preview sessions we facilitated during the past months,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.640
or the limited contents of the closed and open betas,

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.760
they won't be based on optimal conditions or reflect the finished game.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.520
There is something a little concerning there about Ubisoft saying,

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.800
don't read the early reviews of the game.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.160
They're going to be wrong because they haven't experienced it.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.440
Where could a red flag possibly be in that line of thinking?

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.200
Except if you think about it this way,

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:14.680
there are features that change during beta editions and when you get the later ones.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.520
You know, in some cases have we played, um, how many of us have been in betas?

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.560
They're like, Oh man, this beta sucks ass.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:23.960
Yeah.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.800
And then the game's been finished and come out and has been decent.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.080
Warcraft was that for me.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.280
I didn't like the beta at all.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.640
Okay, but let's be fair here.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.200
Okay.

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.160
The beta for this game, the open beta was this week.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.680
The game comes out on Tuesday.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.320
So how much can you really change in like two days?

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.480
I mean, I don't think that's going to be night and day different to be honest.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:48.040
I think final fantasy fourteens beta only had the one zone.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.360
And then the whole thing opened up when the launch came out.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.840
So, I mean, I don't know if it's anything like that,

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.880
but there can be things that dramatically change.

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:59.720
It had other zones a bit further into it,

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.320
but no one could level up high enough to make use of the zones.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:03.720
Yeah.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.240
Cause remember I went exploring one day, high, you know,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.520
running past all the agro stuff and found Costa del Sol.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:11.880
I was like, Oh my God.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.160
I've got the whole, everything's level 35 here.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:15.800
What do I do?

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:16.920
You know, but I'm just saying.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:22.440
And then I got, uh, uh, stabbed in the face by, uh, like the Imperial folks.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.200
So, well, I'll be very curious to see what the reviews look like,

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.040
because I don't think, you know, reviewers are going to necessarily go negative just

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.920
because of this whole thing, but it'd be interesting to see, you know,

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.120
was the game kind of a stinker and is that why Ubisoft was holding out?

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:36.440
I don't know.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.800
I missed the beta just because of all the other games I've been talking about.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.080
I wanted to check it out, but oops, I missed the chance.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:43.400
Bummer.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.200
They won't turn that into a free demo or anything like that.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.720
Dungeon buster and chat says, I really hope they stop calling things a beta when

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.480
it's really that close to release.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.480
I can sort of forgive it because of the game that needs such an online stress

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.560
test, they need to give it away for free so that a lot of people will hammer the

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.480
server and they can accurately test the stress.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.560
You know, the stress that is kind of needed.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.840
Maybe they can call it a gamma.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:13.000
Yeah, that is, that is a term we don't use enough in game is, is gamma or a zeta.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:14.840
All right.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.120
Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.960
I believe things have slowed down dramatically, but I think there's still a

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.760
few things here and there.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:23.240
Right, Loki?

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:27.000
Uh, they're, they did have, you know, it has slowed down dramatically as we get

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.720
into December, which is typically a very dead month.

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.120
But, uh, this week, of course, as we just mentioned, the crew is coming out on

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.400
PlayStation four, Xbox one, PC, and Xbox three 60 as well.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.840
Also on PlayStation three, kingdom hearts, 2.5 remix limited edition be coming

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.080
out, AKA the last PlayStation three game.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.320
A lot of people plan on buying a tradeable pin.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.040
We, this is what we ordered it so I could put that on my lanyard.

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:55.880
Fair enough.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:02.280
Uh, also the disc versions of Terraria on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:07.400
Then on Friday, ultimate NES remix for 3DS, uh, NES remix pack for the

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.960
Nintendo Wii U and captain toad treasure tracker on the Wii U.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.440
That's it.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:14.360
All right.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.520
Let's travel over to Japan on the 4th of December in Japan.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.120
Call of duty, advanced warfare.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.360
The dubbed edition comes out there.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.680
Guilty gear XRD sign in regular and limited edition is out on PlayStation

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.160
four as is Puyo Puyo Tetris available on the PlayStation four.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.160
I don't know how our crossover between Puyo Puyo and Tetris works, but it's

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.200
like a versus.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.080
It looks interesting.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:37.880
Yeah, it's like a versus.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.200
One person plays Tetris while the other place Puyo Puyo, which, uh, what Dr.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.560
Robotniks mean, mean machine.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.360
A lot of you probably know Puyo Puyo as Kirby's avalanche.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.480
Also available on the PlayStation four, the crew and little big planet three

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.800
getting their Japanese releases this week.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.960
Xbox one also sees Puyo Puyo Tetris and the crew this week.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.800
Also on December 4th.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.040
Yes.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.440
The Xbox one is out in Japan, uh, on the PlayStation three little big planet

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.560
three, getting its release as well as call of duty, advanced warfare, the

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.600
guilty gear game I mentioned before and common rider summon ride comes out on

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.960
the PlayStation three this common rider on the Xbox three 60 call of duty this

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.160
week in Japan on the Wii U common rider summon ride and Taiko no Tatsujin

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.600
controller pro.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.880
I don't know if that is to support an upcoming game or if I missed a Taiko

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.480
no Tatsujin release, but this is just the controller is not the game itself.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.560
So maybe if it's like actual Taiko size, I wonder if there is, if there

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.280
isn't something that's on the marketplace, this looks like it's in a

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.160
neat little like plastic wood looking stand.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:41.960
Oh, that is nice.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.240
This is a nice looking little thing.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.440
So I wonder where the game is.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:49.720
Maybe I missed when that was released, but I could also be something that's

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.000
like download.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.560
Like, cause I could see that it's probably something you could download

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.480
and then the Wii U touch pad could be a drum.

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.720
Did any of the deluxe Bimani controllers come with the game?

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.220
I don't know.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.120
Anyway, uh, let's see.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.640
Also on the Wii U there's a lot of stuff coming up on the sixth.

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.320
A lot of it happens to be accessories though, but, uh, the big, big, big one,

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:15.400
of course, uh, smash brothers for Wii U gets its Japanese release on the sixth.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.560
So a lot of people probably hearing about us eating that game up and looking

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.240
forward to playing it themselves.

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:24.360
So you've got to look forward to, uh, there's still more to go on the Vita

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.840
this week, Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3 comes out as well as Diablolic

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.960
Lovers Van Dead Carnival in regular and limited edition.

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:34.600
Cause the Vita gets way more in Japan than it does here.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.440
Uh, the culture is very, very different.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.720
A lot of the Japanese games.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.120
And in fact, I was looking kind of at some of the stuff coming out next

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.000
year and there's a bunch of Atlas games I hadn't realized that were coming

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:43.560
up.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.080
Uh, also of note on the 3DS, Shingeki no Kaijin, Genri Saigo no Subasa

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.120
Chain and Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3, Derby Stallion Gold.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.960
Also on the 3DS.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.800
Wait, what was the last one?

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.760
I just closed it.

01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.480
Derby Stallion?

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.720
Oh no, listen, it's an Attack on Titan game.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.120
Yeah.

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:02.760
So that's cool.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.560
That's cool.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.200
How about the UK?

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.840
Uh, just Call of Duty on like damn near everything.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:16.440
And, um, Never Alone, uh, Kishima, um, now this is actually in, um, one of the,

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.920
uh, uh, I forgot the name of the particular Eskimo dialect.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:27.080
Um, but it's, uh, Kishima Ingichuna, which is called Never Alone.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:31.640
And I've actually, uh, it's on my, my wishlist on Steam actually.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.760
Um, but it's a, uh, it looks really pretty.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.520
So I want people to buy this game.

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:39.480
I want it to do well.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.320
It's on PS4, Xbox One and PC.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.240
All right.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:43.640
That's it.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.720
Yeah.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.200
All right.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.800
I said it was slow, didn't I?

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.600
I guess so.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.320
I didn't think it was that slow.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.040
No, I didn't.

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:50.920
Loki did.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.440
Oh, all right, fine.

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:52.680
All right.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.040
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.080
And then the classic game of the week, but first Loki.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:57.400
All right.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:04.360
So the human rights campaign has recognized EA for promoting LGBT quality by, um, awarding

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.800
them with a 100% score in the latest corporate equality index.

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.240
And it's, I guess the third year that they've received the perfect score.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.040
So good job EA.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.800
At least you can get some things, right?

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:23.320
Yeah, it is very interesting how the quote unquote worst company in America yet does

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.160
some things so, so, so well.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.600
And, uh, yeah, I mean, it does seem like any pride parade I've been to, EA's had a presence

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:30.840
there.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.720
It's equal opportunity forced labor.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:36.360
They just, they, they just don't fuck over their employees.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.960
Like they fuck over their consumers, I guess.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.880
They just fuck over all of their employees equally.

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.040
That's, that's all any of us want.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.640
We all want to be screwed equally.

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:53.800
Everyone needs to have equal access to mandatory overtime and spousal abuse.

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.080
I'm kidding.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.720
Jokes, jokes, calm down.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.200
No, at the end of the day, that is, that is a great thing.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.360
I know EA was a sponsor of the first gamer acts and they do a lot with the community

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.000
and so forth.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.360
And let's, let's talk about diversity and dragon age inquisition.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:11.960
Cause it's pretty, it's actually still pretty sad.

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.600
Well, it's not shoved in your face either, which I think some people unfortunately who

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.520
are like, why is it matters?

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.160
All this stuff and dragon age, it's like, well, it's not exactly shoved in your face.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:28.680
Like it's all just diversity of people you run into.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.640
I still think it's absolutely hilarious.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.080
So one of the pairings happen if you don't romance certain characters.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.200
Yeah.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.960
I think it's adorbs.

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.680
No spoilers.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:39.640
All right.

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:40.760
Let's move on.

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.800
Talk about this before the classic game of the week, those smash brothers game cube

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.400
adapters, uh, did you know they're selling like crazy here?

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.480
Uh, this is, this is a mess.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.000
I mean, they're impossible to find.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.360
And of course everybody's jacking up the price of the Amazon resellers.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.520
Nintendo sells something that's impossible to find with artificial shortages because

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.440
they couldn't anticipate the demand.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.040
Do you think it's artificial?

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.040
Do you think it's artificial shortage?

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.680
Because I would almost argue that I don't think it's artificial shortage so much as

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:15.400
it's, you know, I think they really didn't know that this would sell so crazy.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.000
Well, then they didn't anticipate the demand so that you would think that we'd get it

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.200
right by now, considering that, you know, they seem to miss guess that's across the

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.560
board regardless.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:30.120
Now I did mention that the game is coming out in Japan and some people have resorted

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.360
to importing the Japanese controllers as kind of a workaround.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.920
So I thought that was kind of a clever way of doing it.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.920
So, all right.

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.240
Well, let's travel back to a classic time in video game history.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.680
Maybe, maybe it's something that you could actually play on a GameCube.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.000
But I actually, even though the classic game of the week only has to be 10 years old or

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.040
more, I think this one actually goes a little further back than that.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.560
More like 20 or even 25 years old.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.560
The classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault and

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:07.560
find a game that she thinks, hey, forget all that newfangled shit like your Warcraft and

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.520
your Dragon Ages.

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.080
Play this instead.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:11.580
Yeah.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.320
And I was actually, I will dedicate this one to one of my favorite video casts, Classic

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:23.640
Game Room, because I'm picking dude's favorite game that he uses for every, every display

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.840
and test of controller ever.

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:26.520
Trexton!

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.360
Anyone ever played this?

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.680
I definitely have not played this game before.

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.560
Trexton came out in Japan as Tatsujin.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.400
It came out in 1988.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.800
It's a vertical spoiler shoot-em-up.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:50.760
And it was by Toaplan, which came out later on the Mega Drive and PC Engine in Japan.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.120
It is set in outer space and you are a spaceship.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.840
You get power-ups, go through different planets.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.680
You have an eight-way joystick on the arcade version and a shot and bomb button.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.600
You've got five levels and they're bosses, but they loop forever.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.040
And you get, of course, more and more difficult as you go in.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.040
And this gives us some fucking great music.

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:12.760
Rob, would you mind?

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.840
Yes, I will turn it up.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:27.080
Anyway, it's basically you start off with a power shot as your weapon.

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.560
You get different icons.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.360
You can get S to increase your speed.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.120
You get Bs for your bombs.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:37.320
In the Japanese one, it's Tatsujin bombs.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.080
In the US, it's Destroyer bombs.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:50.040
And then you basically start with every bomb that you use.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.640
You get a smart bomb.

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.760
The ones that are dropped near the ship and destroy anything in range.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:02.520
And then you also have other bombs that will damage items further away on the screen.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.240
By the way, every time you start a new life, you get three bombs.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.320
You also get Ps, which are your power-ups.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:14.200
I told Dan that he had a lot of P earlier because he was playing this.

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.800
You can get other icons up to 10.

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.080
And the icons will carry over your lives.

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:30.760
If you die, you would actually be able to spend your icons so that you can power up again.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.280
They put this into one of their other games called Fire Shark.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:41.880
You also get one up or two up icons, which will increase the number of lives of which you get.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.840
And these are covered by shooting certain objects.

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.680
You get different weapons.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.520
You get the red, which is the power shot.

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:52.040
So you get red projectiles going forward, which is pretty balanced.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:58.120
Green is the Tatujin beam, or the Truxtun beam, that's green moving lasers.

01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.240
And it's the strongest weapon per projectile.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.040
But it doesn't have much spread.

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.680
And then you have blue, which is the Thunder Laser,

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.560
which basically just has blue lightning that goes all over the screen.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.600
Almost kind of like the lightning attack from Raiden 2.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.080
But not quite as effective.

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.760
It doesn't like loop and latch onto them.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:24.120
And of course, if you get extras of those, once you're fully powered up, you get another 5,000 points.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.920
It's really a good game.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.040
I mean, in easy mode, it's super easy.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:36.120
But when you get into normal mode, it's actually got a decent amount of challenge to it.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:39.400
Of course, it gets a lot harder in the other difficulties.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:45.240
But it's one of, I would say it's up there as one of the best space shooter games.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:49.640
So, again, dedicated to one of my favorite video casts.

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.760
Thank you, Classic Game Room, for sharing this one with me.

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.160
Because it was a game I did not play when it was new, but I played it as an adult.

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.040
So, thank you.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:58.520
There you go.

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.920
As people should do with the Classic Game of the Week.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.280
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.400
Truxtun, which I admit is a game I have not played myself.

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.880
But it looks like, it definitely looks like a competent shooter of that era.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.240
Pretty much.

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:11.560
Alright.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.920
1988.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.680
Alright, 1988, yo.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.640
Alright, there it is.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.920
Classic Game of the Week.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.680
We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.160
I know we're running long so far, but we still have plenty of show.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.760
We have rapid fire news.

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:25.000
The Fugal Question of the Week, of course.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:25.880
Emails.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.840
That contest from Jackbox Games we'll get to when we get back.

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.680
The FUs of the Week.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:36.520
And plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:46.440
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.880
Live on this Sunday night.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:54.120
November the 30th, 2014 with the 577th episode of our program.

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:56.680
Thanks for tuning in.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.040
If you happen to be here live.

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.320
If you're listening on the podcast or whatever to get you through the week.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.360
In the car.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.240
Via Stitcher.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.600
Via the iTunes store.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.560
Via TuneIn.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.680
Whatever it is you use.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.640
Thanks for participating.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.760
We really appreciate it.

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.480
And a big thank you to those of you that participated in our contest last week.

01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:15.400
If you missed it.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.600
You missed it because it was only a one week deadline to get in there.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:24.840
But we asked for your best Drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:28.120
And Drawful, of course, is one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack.

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.800
Which is available on PS3, PS4, and Xbox One.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.880
And we all are big fans of what they are doing over at Jackbox Games.

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.880
And big thanks to them for giving us a code to give away here on the program.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.400
And we asked you guys to submit your drawings of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.600
You only could use MS Paint in the spirit of Drawful.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.000
And DarkSakura, I promised you guys.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.480
She would come back from her week off and be like.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.840
What did you guys do to the mailbox?

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.120
She filled it up with a bunch of stuff.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.880
But I explained to her what's going on.

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.400
And she picked a winner.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.880
And DarkSakura, would you describe what the winning

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.960
Orange Lounge Radio artwork looks like here?

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.840
It's an orange.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.200
On a couch.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.960
With headphones on.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.360
Thinking about arrows and shit.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.480
It's the poop that really won it over for me.

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.160
So poop wins, right?

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:15.640
Poop wins.

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:16.600
So congrats.

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.960
I'm four years old.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.920
So congratulations.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.840
It is literally a pixel shit.

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:32.040
A good old poop joke won it for Master of the Claw or MXC was our big winner there.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.680
So check your email if you happen to be listening.

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.240
Master of the Claw and check that out.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.480
And a big thank you to all you guys that participated.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.760
We had a good time going through and looking at all your horrible, horrible drawings.

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:45.640
But they cracked us up.

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.000
MXC is in chat right now.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:47.500
Oh, is he?

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:51.160
Oh, then check your email because I sent you something.

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.360
Yay, MXC.

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.160
Your shit won.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:56.840
Well, enjoy a non-shitty.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.040
I did, however, enjoy the other two quite well.

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.520
They were very well done.

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.640
But if you want to win, you have to have dicks or shit in it.

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:08.680
All right.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.180
There it is.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.480
Let's move on.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.800
We've got some more show to get into here.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.560
And, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.000
But first, some rapid fire news.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:23.640
Loki.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.880
So this is probably good news for those looking to play some more Dark Souls.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:35.720
Dark Souls is coming back as part of the Dark Souls, was it, the Scholar of the First Sin,

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.640
which will be coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:43.960
Now also Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.040
It's going to be, I guess, an expanded edition of the game.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.360
And they're going to have some new balance tweaks, new NPCs, and a new expanded story.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.320
Plus, well, I guess if you're on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, also enhanced visuals.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:59.480
And it'll be the first time you can play it on the system.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.800
So that's pretty cool.

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:04.600
Let's see.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.200
Do they have a date for this yet?

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.800
April 7, 2015 is when it's expected to come out.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.760
So and that's in North America, of course.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.240
And then, of course, since we're just literally, well, we just started December

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.840
or we will be starting December and a little bit here.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.960
Let's look at the games with gold that we have coming out as well.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:36.120
So for this month of December, we've got some pretty cool stuff.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.120
Let's see, the Raven Legacy, the Master Thief,

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:45.160
which is going to be from December 1st through the 15th for Xbox 360.

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:53.240
And then the 16th on through the end of the month, SSX, which looked pretty cool.

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.800
I like SSX, so yeah, worth checking out.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.520
And then for Xbox One, what are we getting for Xbox One?

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:07.160
Worms Battlegrounds is going to be the game that you get that month.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.480
Okay, cool.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:14.600
And then, let's see, for PlayStation Network, of course, they've already kind of talked

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.160
a little bit about some of the stuff that you're getting on PlayStation 4.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:23.080
They mentioned was Injustice Gods Among Us was going to be the first full PlayStation 4 title,

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.320
retail disc PlayStation 4 title is going to be on PlayStation Plus.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.880
So that'll be coming, as well as Secret Ponchos.

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:34.120
And then on PlayStation 3, they're going to have Deadly Premonition,

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.920
the Director's Cut, Hitman HD Trilogy.

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.760
Also the, I guess, re-release of Hitman 2 and Hitman Contracts.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.920
Oh, I'm sorry, that's part of the HD thing.

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.280
I thought that was coming to Vita as well.

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:52.760
No, for the Vita, I guess they're getting Final Horizon and a shooter called Titan Attacks.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.480
So not bad.

01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.400
All right.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:57.640
Yeah.

01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.640
Free stuff, sort of.

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:01.960
Free with an asterisk, because you're paying a monthly fee for it.

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.920
I'd be nice to check out Injustice.

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.360
It'd be nice to have another game.

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.960
Already bought Injustice on the sale.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.920
Well, it sucks for you.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.720
Yeah, it sucks for me.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.280
Well, I mean, honestly, who thought that that would have been, like,

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.600
one of the first titles that they put on that service?

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:12.840
I mean...

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.760
I would have thought it would have been Knack, for sure.

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:15.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:19.400
I'm quite surprised that Knack isn't on there yet, because it's worth nothing at this point.

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.360
Or even Killzone.

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.240
You know, Killzone would have been, you know, interesting to see on there.

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:26.840
Well, perhaps one of these titles will be the next one to be given away for free,

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.880
because there's a Black Friday sale going on on PlayStation.

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:32.120
If you're listening live, you can probably still get it on this.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:34.520
If you're listening on podcast, you're probably a bit too late.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.560
I'm not going to read everything that's on sale, but some of the highlights.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.960
Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls Ultimate Edition, only $20 on PlayStation 3.

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:45.560
$35 on PlayStation 4, which is a pretty good deal, because that game's pretty recent.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.720
Borderlands, the pre-sequel on PS3 for $39.99.

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:55.000
See, Shadow of Mordor, only $30 on PS3 or PS4.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.920
MLB 14, The Show, only $20.

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.920
And Transistor on PlayStation 4, only $8.

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:03.080
Although that was a PlayStation Plus title not that long ago.

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:06.440
I think that's the game I bought on Mac.

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.000
Oh, it is.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:07.960
It was Transistor.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.160
It's supposed to be pretty good.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.440
I haven't played it myself.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.200
I haven't started it, but that's the game I got.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.640
I kept looking at Shadow of Mordor, but I just don't know if I want to play that game.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:19.480
I mean, it looks good, but I just don't know.

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:23.160
It's one of those, like, I don't know if I really want to play this type of thing.

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.880
You know, because it's like Assassin's Creed.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.400
They keep comparing it to Assassin's Creed.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.000
I really don't like Assassin's Creed.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.920
Well, we'll see which one of those titles ends up the next big sale.

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:36.280
And plus, if they're discounting it that much now,

01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.080
you know that they're going to continue to discount that thing going forward.

01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:43.480
So this is not going to be the first time that that's discounted that low.

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.320
Now, it should be noted that Square Enix is also doing a massive sale,

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:50.280
but you probably don't ever shop at their online store.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:57.160
If you look at their site directly, that's store.na.square-enix.com,

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:00.200
or if you Google Square Enix store, you'll probably find it.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.280
There's a lot of stuff, like 50, 60% off on their store,

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:08.040
and I would name them all, but we're talking like over 200 games.

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.800
But you can get things like newer titles like Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn,

01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.800
I believe was $16 on PlayStation 4.

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.560
Let me tell you, that's a pretty freaking good deal.

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.280
I mean, granted, that game has a monthly fee,

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.600
but for an MMO, that's a really, really good deal.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.080
You can also get things like Thief and Tomb Raider.

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.320
I wanted to say, I saw like Final Fantasy II on PSP was like $4.

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:28.440
Something like that.

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:31.400
They're really trying to unload some of their inventory there.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:33.000
So if you are a Squeenix fan, check it out.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.120
I just want the full four thing with the extra chapters.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.000
That's the big thing I was looking for.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:37.880
On the PSP?

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.680
No, no, no, no, no.

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.520
I want the PC iteration of that.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.120
It's down to $6.40 from $15.99.

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.320
The PSP version though, right?

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.440
No, PC.

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:46.920
Oh.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:47.240
Yeah.

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.720
So I'm going to be probably ordering that.

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.160
Does that have the after years in it?

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.640
It just says Final Fantasy IV.

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.240
Nah, it doesn't have the after years in it.

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.600
That's the DS version.

01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:59.160
Yeah, the after years is the one that I want to play.

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.840
After years, they never put into 3D.

01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.520
After years, it's only in the 2D.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.640
So, yeah.

01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:05.960
So just throwing that out there anyway.

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:07.640
So check that out.

01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.080
Coming up this week, the Game Awards.

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.560
One of those, this moved really fast type of things.

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.720
You know, it was just last week you were talking about it was announced

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.840
and the nominees were out.

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:18.440
Now they're coming up.

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.480
They're on Friday.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:22.360
So I heard that we're going to have one of our listeners there.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:27.880
So I'm hoping to get a Man on the Street report from the Game Awards.

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.800
But in the meantime, some of the things that we have to look forward to at the Game Awards.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:36.680
One is that Metal Gear Online is going to be there.

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.240
That's right.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:39.320
Jeff Keeley tweeted out,

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.440
Hideo Kojima will join us at the Game Awards to world premiere Metal Gear Online.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.480
So that's something you can look forward to at the Game Awards.

01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.360
But they already had Metal Gear Online.

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.040
On the PSP, right?

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:55.160
No, it was part of the PS3 versions of Metal Gear Solid 3.

01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:55.960
Oh, that's right.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:58.840
It was like the other game, but they shut down the servers.

01:55:58.840 --> 01:55:59.960
So it's not there anymore.

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.640
So I don't know.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.240
So they're bringing the servers back?

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:03.640
I don't know.

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.000
Maybe it's probably a more robust experience than what they have before.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.840
Well, we'll find out, won't we, Loki?

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.040
We'll find out.

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.040
I'd rather have another trailer for you.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.960
No Man's Sky, to be honest, but whatever.

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.000
Well, Jeff Keeley is teasing also on Twitter because he invested a lot into this.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
This Friday night, we will showcase more than a dozen world premieres at the Game Awards.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.400
So Metal Gear Online is one of them.

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.400
What could the other 11 be?

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.560
Metal Gear Online 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.040
Who knows?

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.240
There could be some big stuff here.

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:35.640
We don't know.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.440
I mean, some big games got revealed at the Game Awards in the past.

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:44.760
Skyrim was unveiled, or sorry, when it was the Spike TV Awards or whatever they were called.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.280
But, you know, the previous iteration.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:48.280
I know they're not going to do another Elder Scrolls game.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:49.800
It's going to be Fallout next, but...

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.880
Well, Fallout 4 could be one of the announcements.

01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:53.800
It seems about the time.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:01.640
So, uh, Elder Scrolls Online never going to come out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.800
You know, it got pushed back to April.

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.480
Didn't we have a story on it a couple months ago?

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.440
I think it was pushed back.

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.000
No one cares.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.760
That's a problem, I think.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.680
Yeah, maybe an expansion will be out.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.320
Who knows?

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.640
So yeah, a dozen world premieres coming for that.

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:18.520
And lastly, you know, if you prefer to just have your games free, then one that I've recommended

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.200
before is a game called Path of Exile, which is a bit of a Diablo clone.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:24.040
It's a very Diablo-esque sort of game.

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:29.480
But if you haven't checked it out, Path of Exile just got a content update to 1.3.0.

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.920
It does a lot of changes with PvP, but there's also some new challenge league as well.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.240
The Torment and the Bloodlines Challenge League.

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.480
So if you haven't checked out Path of Exile, this is something you might want to check out.

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.120
There's also an updated passive skill tree.

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:48.360
And if you've never seen the skill tree in Path of Exile, good lord, that thing is a mess.

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.120
I don't know what to do.

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:51.880
I'm so overwhelmed when I look at it.

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.240
Anyway, there it is.

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.200
Path of Exile is 1.3.0.

01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:58.040
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for rapid fire news?

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:03.480
Well, there's a game that I should have mentioned in my classic game that I did not,

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.920
because I finally did the entire full playthrough of Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.720
And I'm happy that now everybody else gets to experience the crack

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:17.800
and the weird feels and the what the fuckness of it.

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.720
Because it's going to be on PS4 and Vita in early 2015.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:28.680
It is a game where you date pigeons, but it really goes a lot deeper than that.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:32.040
It has this whole alternate world thing going on with it.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:39.160
And a statement by Hatomoa, who is a manga artist who created the game,

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:43.240
says she was really, really happy to see it come out on PlayStation.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.160
She never thought that it would be out.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.360
And all you need is Dove.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.240
So there's that one.

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:58.520
Also, in other news, if it ever loads, the GameCube controller for

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:07.400
there's going to be a Super Smash Brothers edition for the UK, but it's being delayed.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:15.320
There was a report on NeoGaf that they got emails from Amazon UK and ShopTo saying that

01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:21.080
the GameCube controller Super Smash Brothers edition is being delayed until sometime later

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:21.720
next week.

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.240
So sorry, folks in the UK.

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.160
They have to shift more of that inventory here our way.

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:31.640
Yeah, we're being greedy Americans again.

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:32.600
Sorry.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.160
Not sorry.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:43.080
And last but not least, there is an item being removed on December 31st, and that will be

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:45.880
Tetris being removed from the eShop.

01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:51.080
So if you want it, I guess you better get it now.

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:54.840
Not really sure.

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:57.400
Nintendo hasn't said anything, but I don't know.

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.400
I kind of think I might be going to get some Tetris.

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:04.040
I mean, it's not like you can't play Tetris one of 50,000 other ways with all the various

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.080
Tetris games that are out there.

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:07.560
But the Game Boy version is really one of the greatest.

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:08.680
Well, I'm not sure.

02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.560
This just says Tetris.

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.240
It doesn't say it's the Game Boy version.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.360
I think it is the Game Boy version.

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:12.600
It is.

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.640
Okay, because my favorite.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:15.640
I really do like the NES one better.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:21.320
So NES one or the Tetris DS was really like one of the best ones they ever did was so

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:21.800
good.

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:22.200
Yeah.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.640
I don't know if you ever check that version out.

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:25.640
The Sega Tetris arcade was pretty good.

02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:26.040
Yeah.

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.960
Oh, the one with the gigantic joystick.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.000
No, no, no, no.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.320
It was just a regular arcade iteration.

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.080
Oh, I think it only came out in Japan.

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.440
I was gonna say, because didn't Atari do the Tetris game here in the arcade way back when?

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:40.120
There was the huge mungus controller edition.

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:40.520
Yeah.

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.280
But there was also just an arcade iteration that Sega put out.

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:45.560
So much Tetris.

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.840
Yeah, that one was really good.

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.680
It was kind of difficult, but really good.

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:48.920
Yeah.

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.920
All right, well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:05.160
Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:11.080
You can find us on Facebook at facebook.com orange launch radio and google.com plus orange

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.160
lounge radios where you can find us on social media.

02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:17.960
You take Facebook and you take Google and you slam those words together, you get foogle.

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.480
It's the foogle question of the week.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.560
And this is in line with the story that Jamie read us earlier about the crew.

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.280
The press will be receiving advanced copies of an upcoming Ubisoft game.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.280
While it might be easy to peg this on the recent debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity,

02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.200
Ubisoft says that this is due to the necessity of needing a full experience with other players

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:37.000
online.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.520
What are your thoughts on hearing this?

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.840
Do you believe more game reviews should be held back so that a game can be fully absorbed

02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.640
on launch?

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:47.560
Do you think game companies should hold games back more often or do you use reviews to determine

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:49.880
if you will buy a game in its launch window?

02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.640
Now we got a lot of good answers tonight and a lot of them are pretty lengthy, so I'm going

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.000
to have to be a little picky choosy tonight, so I apologize.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.760
If you do want to see all the answers though, I encourage you to check our communities.

02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:04.760
I'm going to start with Google Plus and Brozime who responds and says,

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.480
I personally won't buy games without a review unless I have the utmost faith the company

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.000
will deliver as promised.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:19.160
With Ubi's current trend of poorly optimized or buggy releases, I know I need information

02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.080
to buy anything they release.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.880
It's also worth noting Activision and EA regularly put up servers for reviewers to play

02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.160
online with other reviewers before they release games.

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:31.000
Why can't Ubisoft do the same?

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:36.440
Well, without discounting your point because I believe you raised some good ones, I do

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.160
believe Ubisoft came out and said it's not going to be enough people.

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.320
The press and all that would not be enough.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.200
There has to be more.

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:46.440
It's got to be more and more and more people for the experience that they're going for.

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:49.400
That would be also assuming that a lot of people buy the game though.

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.000
Just saying, just saying.

02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.160
Over on Facebook, let's see.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.560
We have Fabrice A replies and says,

02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.080
Holding back a game is to hide a bad game.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:09.320
I read several reviews anyway unless it's a game I know is going to be a good game.

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:11.560
Andy R. replied and said,

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.080
As someone who reviews games as a hobby, I definitely agree that a game review should

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.240
be held until the game can be absorbed enough.

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.960
I usually review JRPGs and because I work full time outside this hobby, I don't always

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.560
feel like I have a good handle on the game in the week or the two that I have the game

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.840
before it comes out.

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:30.200
In those cases, I'd rather hold my review than release something that's not helpful

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.400
to anyone reading it.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.840
That said, I do think it's in the best interest of the companies to try and allow reviewers

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.240
to get reviews out before the game comes out.

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.760
Obviously, if they can have a good game that's getting good reviews before launch, that helps

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.400
sales.

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.800
I feel that a lot of the onus should be on the reviewers to not release half-baked reviews.

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.080
Sadly though, most of the big review sites seem to care more about getting their review

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.080
out first so they can get clicks than about releasing a proper critique.

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.920
Unfortunately, in these days where online components make up large portions of games,

02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:01.160
publishers holding review copies until launch might be the only way to get some of these

02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.280
websites to behave.

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:03.640
Let's see.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.240
Hits Done replies and says,

02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:10.120
I no longer trust sites that accept terms from publishers to get review copies of games

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:10.920
before launch.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.600
I will wait for word of mouth from my friends or from independent media before I drop any

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:17.880
cash myself.

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.960
Reviews ought to be based on the experience I would get if I bought the game, bugs and

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.800
all, so this is a good thing for me.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.520
Lastly, Ursa Being Slurpy says,

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520
Ubisoft is definitely up to no good.

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.840
I generally watch YouTube reviews for games I'm not sure about, but some games I'll buy

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.880
regardless of reviews just because I enjoy the story, etc.

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.600
Elder Scrolls, Witcher, Psy, Warcraft.

02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.600
Remember how I said I wouldn't be to re-subbing to WoW?

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.080
Well, my orc shaman is half a level away from 100.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:44.520
I feel your pain.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.320
I feel your pain.

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.920
So there you go.

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.800
It seems like a lot of people are kind of like, here's something shady going on here,

02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:53.560
and I do use reviews.

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:56.920
But, you know, we have that very strongly worded one there from Hits Done saying that

02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:01.000
I will not trust a site that buys into the publisher's reviews.

02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.480
So it does seem like more and more sites are starting to push back, though.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:09.080
I mean, after the whole mess with Assassin's Creed, you know, a couple of the big ones

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:14.040
came out and said we will no longer adhere to embargo dates that are after the launch

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:14.540
of the game.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.640
And so I guess this was Ubisoft's way of responding saying, well, then you will not get the game

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.080
until the game is released.

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.960
So it's this interesting push and dance that's going on here.

02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:28.360
We'll see how it affects the sales of the game.

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:32.760
I kind of think, I don't know, the crew is coming out at kind of a bad time.

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:33.960
It missed Black Friday.

02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:37.240
I mean, I realize there's still a lot of shopping needs left, but people are so consumed with

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:38.440
a bunch of other stuff right now.

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:43.720
If it comes out and it's fine, then I don't think it's going to be an issue.

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:48.520
If it comes out, it's all broken, then it's going to be an issue.

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:52.040
It's going to be a big issue with Ubisoft because that level of trust, you've already

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:55.320
fucked up a few games in a row that have come out.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.600
Now, it's like we can't really trust you with this.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:03.480
And we know that this is because of some sort of issues with the game.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:07.000
And you kind of knew they were going to be there and you're trying to stop people from

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.720
canceling their preorders, if you know what I mean.

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.520
And I just have a feeling even though they are beta testing this stuff, I mean, they've

02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:21.000
been tested other games before and it still was a pain in the ass to play that day one.

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:25.240
The crew, thankfully, I don't think is going to be as high demand to say like, you know,

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.120
Destiny or something.

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:29.080
So maybe it won't be so bad, but I don't know.

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:31.560
All right.

02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:32.360
Well, what's that?

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.840
I read the first response I read was from Google.

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.080
I did not read all of the responses tonight because a lot of them were lengthy and were

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:42.040
running a little long.

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:47.000
So I thank everybody for replying and I encourage everybody to go read all the answers on our

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.640
Google Plus and our Facebook pages.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:54.920
They're facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash or excuse me,

02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:58.280
google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:58.280 --> 02:06:58.840
Blah, blah, blah.

02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:00.120
I got a little tongue tied there.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:02.440
So yeah, some weeks we have time to read them all.

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:06.280
But tonight I didn't because some of you guys got really, really, really lengthy.

02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:09.320
So all right, let's move on.

02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:10.760
Let's get into some more news.

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:11.400
Loki.

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:17.160
So Sony now is planning on shifting their focus towards PlayStation as regard in regards

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:23.880
to, you know, their income, because right now they were, I guess, kind of sharing some

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:25.080
of that with smartphones.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:27.960
But I don't think their smartphone division is doing that great.

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:32.360
They're saying that right now they're expecting to lose 30 percent of the sales by next spring.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.320
And, you know, basically, you know, the PlayStation division's been up and they're up by 25 percent,

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.720
I guess, as much as 13.6 billion dollars.

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:47.320
So maybe, I don't know, it makes sense.

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.840
I mean, go with what's working.

02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:54.280
I mean, if you're going to try to do mobile and that mobile market's kind of saturated,

02:07:54.280 --> 02:08:00.840
then maybe it's, you know, focus all your, you know, focus most of your money towards

02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:01.800
what's working for you.

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.000
That's cool.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.760
Maybe we'll see some better stuff out of the PlayStation side because of that now that

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.200
they're focusing more resources.

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:12.920
Maybe, I don't know, maybe something that has to do with Morpheus when it comes out.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:14.520
I don't know.

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.640
It can't be a bad thing that they're putting more focus on PlayStation.

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.840
Don't forget, you know, what else is happening this weekend is that PlayStation experience

02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:23.320
is happening.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:30.760
So, I mean, even though this is traditionally a slower news period, I can't imagine Sony

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:34.920
doesn't have at least one big thing they're going to pull out of their hat at the PlayStation

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.320
experience.

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.000
You know, there's got to be something they're going to get that crowd really excited about

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.080
that, oh yeah, I got to play this.

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.680
You know, there's going to be something there that's going to have everybody really excited,

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.080
I think.

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:46.600
So, we'll see.

02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:50.040
I'd be down with a better version of PlayStation All-Stars.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.240
Oh, you think that's worth revisiting?

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:53.880
I think so.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:58.840
I don't think, I think if they got, I mean, I think the hard part is, you know, memorable

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.280
characters because, you know, there are a lot of PlayStation franchises, but it's not

02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:05.480
anything like the Nintendo, but I think if you get the gameplay there, then it won't

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.360
be so bad.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.280
Hell, throw some indies on there.

02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.360
You know, that would be pretty cool.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.120
Yeah, we'll see.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:15.080
Well, indies made a pretty good showing at E3, so we'll see.

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:18.920
I mean, maybe that's just because there wasn't a lot else to show for the rest of this year

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:22.680
because the titles on PlayStation have been a little light, but we'll see.

02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:23.320
We'll see what happens.

02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:29.960
Moving on, this would be a game I bet a lot of you would love to see at the PlayStation

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:30.520
Experience.

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.760
Unfortunately, I doubt it, but you never know.

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:40.920
Final Fantasy XV, actually, I don't know how many of the other companies Sony got to buy

02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.200
into this, but considering that this demo is supposed to be, what, April next year,

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:49.160
it would not be far-fetched that they might have something at PlayStation Experience.

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.760
This is Final Fantasy XV.

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:56.760
Final Fantasy XV, more and more has been coming out on this game, which, of course, a lot

02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:59.960
of people have been joking is the Broad Trip Final Fantasy, because that's pretty much

02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:00.460
all we've seen.

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.760
But anyway, there is, of course, the promotion where you can get the demo if you pre-order

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.160
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which most Final Fantasy fans will be getting anyway.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:17.400
But also noting that the demo will be two hours' worth and possibly up to four if you

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.880
are one of those people that explores everything.

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.320
Like, if you're still in the Hinterlands in Dragon Age, you'll probably get four hours

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.200
out of that right there.

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:27.960
That's just like a Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pains right there.

02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:28.600
Right?

02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:29.880
Or the Ground Zero or whatever.

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:35.000
That's, you know, the experience that some companies charge $20 for.

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:39.720
It's Final Fantasy XV episode Duske.

02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.840
Is that how you say that?

02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:41.640
Duska?

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:42.120
Duske?

02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.400
Duske?

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:44.440
I don't know.

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:45.320
How's it spelled?

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:47.480
D-U-S-C-A-E.

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:49.640
Duske.

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:50.840
Duske.

02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:51.800
Episode Duske.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.080
Type 0 launches on March 17th.

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:57.960
The demo will come after that, not necessarily at the same time.

02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.640
I thought it was like April or something.

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.040
So not far-fetched that you might see something about this at PlayStation Experience, though.

02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:08.680
But don't forget that this game is also going to be on Xbox One, right?

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:08.920
Yeah.

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.280
Final Fantasy XV is on Xbox One.

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.280
It's just not going to have the same promotion because I don't believe Type 0 is on Xbox

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:14.520
One.

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:16.040
So there you go.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.120
All right.

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.120
Coming soon, but not soon enough.

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.800
Let's move on with some more stories.

02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.760
Dark Sakura.

02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.840
Well, get ready to be pissed at Verizon again.

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.880
I know that we've been touching back and forth on the whole net neutrality issues going on.

02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:44.280
And there's been talk with the FCC over reclassifying broadband and mobile broadband to common

02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:47.640
carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:54.280
Well, Verizon says that if the FCC doesn't reclassify it, they won't sue.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:55.240
Yeah.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.120
Everyone who's using Verizon, listen up.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.280
Talk to the company that you were using the service of.

02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:07.000
Send them letters or change your service if they're going to be acting this way.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.040
They've already sued the FCC and won once.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.520
But if this reclassification goes through, they're not going to have any grounds to stand

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:14.680
on it.

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.520
They're going to try to suit to have it changed back to what it is now so that they can keep

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:24.040
gouging their prices and form as close to legal a monopoly with other companies that

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:24.440
they can.

02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.560
Or more of a trust.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.640
So keep your eyes on them.

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:33.720
I remember what I talked about earlier, the whole fact that we're buying all these digital

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:38.840
games, yet, you know, the service that's really delivering that to us is unregulated.

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.760
So we'll see.

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.960
It's I think it's still risky until we have some resolution on this.

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.400
So I think I think a big rude awakening is going to come in for some of these companies

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.440
in the next couple of years, though.

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.240
We'll see.

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:51.560
We'll see.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.000
Meanwhile, lucky.

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.520
All right.

02:12:54.520 --> 02:13:01.640
So I don't I'm pretty sure this is not legit, but there's been some videos going around

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:07.320
and pictures showing that an amiibo figure is being used to open the Moscow Metro gates

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:10.520
using the near field communication.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:17.720
My guess, since the video is not playing for me, is that either somebody put the actual

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:24.040
NFC chip from one of those cards from the metro in the amiibo, which I've heard people

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.240
doing similar things with other types of things, you know, like they put the card in there

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.360
just look fancy.

02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:34.360
But I don't think it's legit that, you know, an amiibo figure is actually opening those

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:34.680
gates.

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.160
I'll be hilarious if it was, though.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.080
Not that I would encourage the stealing of free rides, but it'd just be really funny

02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:44.600
if the systems were so similar, but I just can't imagine that's how it works.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:45.640
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:46.840
I'd be very curious, though.

02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.560
Like, I'm surprised nobody's hacked one of those on a PC yet, or is that just happened

02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.240
and we just are not hearing about it.

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:56.680
That somebody's because they have to have those readers for PC, right?

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.760
So somebody's reading one of those figures on a PC.

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.520
You don't even need a PC to read those.

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.880
You can use read them with a cell phone.

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:04.600
My cell phone can read your field communication stuff.

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:05.080
That's right.

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:09.480
Now with the fancy-dancy 6+, I think you can do that, too, because it's how Apple Pay works,

02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:09.720
right?

02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.720
So my phone can read it.

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:13.320
So you can read them, but you can't.

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.080
It's hard to write to them, I think, is what the problem is.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:22.280
And you also, I don't know if they have it encrypted or, you know, how exactly that works.

02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:27.400
And I can't imagine the amount of data that's on there is very, you know, big, but it's

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:28.680
probably just like stats.

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:29.320
I don't know.

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:30.280
It'd be kind of weird.

02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:32.280
I don't know what exactly they store on there.

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.520
Yeah, I'd be very curious what that looks like.

02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.960
If you could get in there, you might be able to figure out what else they're going to use

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.920
it for in the future.

02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:44.680
Although they also probably use some type of proprietary compression that, I mean, even

02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.200
if you could pull the data, that doesn't mean you could decompress it.

02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:53.000
If I were Nintendo, that's how I'd try to keep it safe is that I would have compressed

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.760
data on those things that decompresses when it comes over to the Wii U, which would be

02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:02.920
another reason why I don't think the subway trick is really, oh, you buy this figure and

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:04.120
you get free subway rides.

02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:04.840
I think you're right.

02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:07.000
It's somebody replaced the chip or what have you.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:12.680
Well, because if you imagine if they figured out how to do that, just in devil's advocate

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.080
here, imagine they figured out how the amiibos work.

02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:22.280
Someone puts a smartphone app or whatever that, oh, look, your phone's amiibo now.

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:22.760
Boop.

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:25.880
You know, that's an amiibo and it's any amiibo that I want.

02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:30.680
And I can store all the things or I can mod my stats or, you know, all sorts of exploits

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:31.400
you could do with that.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.720
Sg100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, my girlfriend has her Boston Metro pass

02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:38.520
as a ring.

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.760
She got it from a Kickstarter and it's pretty useful.

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.680
So yeah, some people put these chips in all sorts of things.

02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.800
I wouldn't even think to put that in jewelry.

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:48.600
That's so crazy.

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:49.100
Oh my gosh.

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:54.040
I think they don't, they sell also now though, those like life alert bracelets, do something

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.040
like that where now instead of, you know, remember the whole life alert thing?

02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:03.320
They actually will have a programmable thing using the Bluetooth coming from a smartphone.

02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:03.480
Yeah.

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.080
Like some of them are like USB devices now that could have like some of your medical

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.640
records on it if need be or just all the information.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:14.040
So yeah, I've actually, well, I mean, I use the same function on my iPhone, but yeah.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.540
Yeah.

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:15.800
So interesting.

02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:16.860
All right.

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:24.920
And Sg100Matt linking to the ring, which apparently is part of the MBTAgifts.com website.

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.800
I didn't even know that was the thing.

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:27.000
That's pretty cool looking.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:27.500
Yeah.

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:29.480
The Sesame ring.

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:29.980
That's great.

02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:32.520
The wearable Charlie card.

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:33.020
Wow.

02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:37.720
I love how this guy in this is looking like a power ranger when he's using the, I bet

02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:42.840
Shane would like that power ranger there and make that picture with a fist anyway.

02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:43.080
Yeah.

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.000
And then to kind of go back on them hacking that, uh, apparently there was a guy that

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.720
actually did that with Skylanders and got seasoned assisted pretty fast.

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:52.600
Really?

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.100
Yeah.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.440
Oh, come on though.

02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:55.960
It's gotta, it'll show up somewhere else.

02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.600
So the trick, and this is, this is goes for anybody that's wanting to do this out there.

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:03.080
You don't talk about it until you have it working.

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:06.680
You upload to the internet, you get your cease and desist and too bad it's on the internet.

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:08.040
Too bad it's already on the internet.

02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:08.540
Right.

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.240
Get it on some video site or hosted in another country.

02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:13.400
Yeah.

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.920
Don't talk about it until you're done.

02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.120
Yeah, that's how you do it.

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.880
That's and that, that can also go for anybody that's making a fan game or anything, or,

02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.440
you know, doing translations or something that, you know, one of those companies might

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:29.000
sue you because you're using their properties and, you know, just don't, don't say anything

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:29.500
until it's done.

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.840
Well, we were talking about what could possibly be revealed at the PlayStation experience.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.680
Well, we don't know maybe something that soon, but we do know something that's supposed to

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.760
be coming at E3 next year as far as PlayStation is concerned.

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:45.320
It's coming from Level 5.

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.120
This is the studio that made Ni No Kuni.

02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.880
They also made Yokai Watch.

02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:54.840
And you may have heard of White Knight Chronicles, which was, I think that game was probably

02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:57.320
a little bigger in Japan, but it was a pretty neat game.

02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.280
White Knight Chronicles 1 and 2 were released here in the States, and they were almost a

02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.480
little too complicated.

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.080
They had a lot of online stuff.

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.640
It felt a little bit MMO-ish, but there was a White Knight Chronicles live stream that

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.280
happened recently, and the president of Level 5, Akihiro Hino, said that they have been

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.080
working on a PlayStation 4 title, and it will be unveiled at E3.

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.640
He said he wants to create a game that exceeds the White Knight Chronicles titles developed,

02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:26.600
and White Knight Chronicles, of course, was developed in collaboration with Sony Computer

02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:27.560
Entertainment Japan.

02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:32.920
If you're a PlayStation Plus member in Japan, you can get White Knight Chronicles 2 for

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:33.560
free, actually.

02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.720
It's one of their PlayStation Plus titles right now.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:42.040
There was also a White Knight Chronicles PSP prequel developed by Matrix, who made Final

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:43.960
Fantasy III on the Nintendo DS.

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:48.440
So we don't know what they're making, but this makes it sound like it could be another

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:50.600
epic RPG of sorts.

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:52.600
Hopefully the demo won't suck.

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.960
IkumaJP is in chat just going, no, nope, nope, nope.

02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:00.520
Oh, he really wasn't a fan of that, though, if I remember right.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:03.800
Yeah, but he likes Yo-kai Watch, which I want.

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:04.840
There you go.

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:09.560
All right, so we'll see what comes out of that.

02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.960
IkumaJP says White Knight Chronicles not big.

02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:16.920
Well, it wasn't really big here either, and somehow it got a sequel, so I assumed it

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:17.880
had to be big somewhere.

02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:19.160
Is it big in Europe?

02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.360
I don't know, it was one of the sequels that kind of surprised.

02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.600
Maybe it was because Sony was invested in it, I don't know.

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.600
I just remember the sequel to White Knight Chronicles had the original in it because

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.320
you had to play the first, I mean, you could start the second game, but it was way harder

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.080
to start the second game at the base level they gave you than to level a character through

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:37.880
the original game.

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.200
So, interesting.

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.160
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:45.000
Every week, you guys email us.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.480
Participate at orangelaungerated.com is the place to send those emails, and Dark Soccer

02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.520
will dive into the mailbag and pull out the emails she believes are worth reading tonight.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:56.280
Gross.

02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:56.780
Ew.

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:00.600
All right, Dark Soccer, read some emails.

02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:02.120
All right, words.

02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.360
All right, first one is a skeezy's question.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:06.520
What's up, Orange Lounge?

02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:07.880
Sorry I haven't emailed in a while.

02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:09.240
I've been really busy working.

02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.160
Anyway, my question is pretty simple.

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:14.360
In Mario Party, which character do you always seem to pick and why?

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:14.860
Lol.

02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.000
Hope you guys are doing well.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.120
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.240
EA skeezy.

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.080
Um, I usually get stuck with Daisy.

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:26.600
Um, which I'll either use her or Waluigi, just because Waluigi is kinda lanky and weird.

02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:31.240
Um, you guys?

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:33.000
Sorry, quickly, what was the question again?

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.400
Who do you get stuck using in Mario Party and why?

02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:39.400
I always elect to use Peach because Peach is the winner.

02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:43.640
If I can't play Peach, I stomp and throw a fit.

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:45.880
Like, there's no other, there's no other character that I'll play.

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:47.640
Do you stomp your little foot and pout?

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:48.140
I do.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.280
You've played Mario Party with me.

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:53.160
What about you, Loki?

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.760
Um, probably just like the same characters I normally pick.

02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:59.720
And, um, Mario Party, to be honest.

02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:01.800
So probably, like, Yoshi.

02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:04.860
There you go.

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:07.560
Next email.

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.880
Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.

02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:14.040
I just wanted to give you guys a brief update on the situation with Galaxy as the educational

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:18.280
game that you guys reported on having partnered with the New York Academy of Sciences to bring

02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:19.640
wholesome education to children.

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.360
Oh no, I can only imagine what this is gonna be.

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:27.720
Apparently half of the team has been let go, reducing their headcount from about 15 employees

02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:28.520
to seven.

02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:33.000
This includes the company's creative director who co-founded the studio along with the CEO

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.920
and was, from what my roommate tells me, the only person who was actually able to keep

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.000
the project together and keep the tyrannical CEO in check.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.640
Now that they are gone, they're down to only one programmer and no one is there to make

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:49.880
sure the CEO doesn't verbally beat everyone in the company into a figurative pulp.

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:53.640
It seems that most of the remaining team is seeking other employment and prospects for

02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:58.760
the game ever releasing, much less being at a high enough quality to teach children science

02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.720
are bleak.

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:03.160
I know that most of the listeners have probably already forgotten about the company, but since

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:07.240
you guys initially reported on it with high hopes and I chimed in with my perspective

02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:10.920
on the matter a few months ago, I figured I would close the loop and assure you guys

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:15.400
that Galaxies will undoubtedly be a miserable failure.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.080
Yours truly is HP.

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:30.520
P.S. I'm a few episodes late, but here's a tribute to OLR for episode 575, Rob Jamie

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:33.000
Loki, the only show where every gamer has a voice.

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.520
But these guys way high up like the CEO, the creative director don't.

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:04.760
Yeah.

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:07.160
So the creative director probably knew what he was doing with the CEO.

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.840
Unfortunately, didn't last email hot mess.

02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:11.800
Sounds like hot mess.

02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:12.360
The game.

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.440
I have to read you the subject first.

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:15.480
Are you?

02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:16.600
Wait, sorry.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.280
Just one other quick thought on that last email.

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:22.520
Whoever, you know, that's involved with that whole thing should like at least write a book

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.360
or something like at least a manifesto, at least a blog post.

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:26.600
Yeah.

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:29.000
At least an angry blog post or something.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:29.560
Do the thing.

02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:34.600
Are you having issues with explosive projectile diarrhea?

02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.040
Join the support group today.

02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:36.440
Lols.

02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:37.560
What?

02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:39.720
That's an email we got.

02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:39.960
Really?

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:40.920
That's an email.

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:41.480
Hi, gang.

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:42.040
And you read it?

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:44.680
Oh, there's more.

02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:45.000
Okay.

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:47.000
Now I have to burp.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:47.400
Thank you.

02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:52.920
Well, at least you don't have to projectile whatever that thing is.

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:53.320
What?

02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:54.680
Explosive projectile diarrhea.

02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:55.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.160
That would be a messy support group.

02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:58.520
Hi gang.

02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:02.840
It's that time of year again where people watch a ton of football.

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:03.400
Yuck.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.240
Stuff their faces with food like no tomorrow.

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:06.920
Followed by shopping.

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.280
That being said, that brings up my topic for this email.

02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:13.880
What geek-centric stuff did you three buy within the past few days,

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:19.080
be it gadgets, games, music, et cetera, either in a brick and mortar store or online?

02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:23.160
Personally speaking, I did all my shopping online on Wednesday.

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:28.120
I had spent a personal record breaking $90 on Steam's fall sale, bought 17 items,

02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:32.600
and spent $30 on iTunes, which went toward the Medal of Honor Frontline soundtrack,

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:39.320
the bulk of Sleepy Hollow season two, Crazy Chocobo from the Final Fantasy 13-2 OST,

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:41.960
and the Halo Suite from Halo CE OST.

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.080
This email is brought to you by Crazy Chocobo, the greatest song ever,

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:46.440
despite what Act Deft would say.

02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:49.080
That's for you to start a fight.

02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:51.000
What, Loki?

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.680
I was going to say going to projectile explosive diarrhea or whatever.

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:55.400
Oh my God.

02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:59.320
That'd be a great subtitle for the sequel to Pixel Shits.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:02.920
Pixel Shits 2, projectile explosive diarrhea.

02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:03.960
Or explosive projectile diarrhea.

02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:05.720
Let's do the 8-bit edition.

02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:06.360
I love it.

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:10.360
I didn't really buy much of anything.

02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:12.520
I did buy games for other people.

02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:13.640
Nothing really for myself.

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:19.640
I bought a couple of things, but mostly I ended up finding an M-Flow album on iTunes

02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:21.720
that I didn't own, and I bought that.

02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:23.560
I bought the...

02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.600
I pre-ordered Greg Proops' book, The Smartest Book in the World.

02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:30.920
I didn't realize he was doing a book.

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.120
He was just here in Sacramento.

02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:32.680
We missed him.

02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:37.160
But he took a picture with that cat, the local celebrity cat.

02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:37.960
Oh, really?

02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:38.680
I forgot the name.

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:39.000
Norm.

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.760
Norm, the big fat cat.

02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.960
It would put Sharmi to shame.

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.600
How funny.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:43.480
That was a funny picture.

02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.120
It was on Facebook.

02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.360
Honestly, the only thing that I ended up buying was the Warlords Draenor expansion.

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:49.080
Isn't that enough?

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.480
Because it's being expected.

02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:54.520
Addict.

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:56.920
And the Sega Humble Bundle.

02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:59.080
I guess I did buy that in the past couple of days.

02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:06.760
But no, when you get down to the fact that you spent probably about less than $5 on how

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:07.320
many games?

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:10.440
Yeah, that's less than lunch.

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.200
I'm still trying to pay off my credit card from all the other tech shit I've bought throughout

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:16.600
the year.

02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:18.600
Now is just not a good time.

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:23.400
You know, so that's what I got.

02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:27.000
I got to pay off the credit card before I can think about any other big tech geeky purchases

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
such as the Xbox One that I want.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.120
And I was tempted.

02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:30.920
I was tempted.

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:32.440
I'm getting my present tomorrow.

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:33.400
Lucky.

02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:39.400
My extreme wonderful present that I can't really tell many people about because it might

02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:40.120
tell people where it works.

02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:41.640
Why would you say it now?

02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.960
Just because I'm super excited about it and I wish I could.

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:46.520
But it's going to be so awesome.

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:47.560
Tease of a teaser.

02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.680
All right, any other emails?

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:51.000
Um, no.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.680
All right, then that means it's time to get into the FUs of the week.

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:16.360
If you try to just say pronounce FUs like it's just spelled, it would be FUS, which

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.320
means we have a short way.

02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:19.080
Absolutely.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:20.680
So what is your FUs of the week?

02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:22.840
Fuck you to Mercy Medical in Daphne, Alabama.

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:27.800
I don't know without going too much into detail on this.

02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:35.240
It's where my grandmom was being kept and apparently she has been very much neglected

02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:35.480
there.

02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:40.600
And so if I could teleport there and punch every single one of you that works there in

02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.120
the face, I would do it.

02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:45.960
But since I cannot, I'm encouraging my mother to sue the ever living shit out of me.

02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:47.720
Just let me know.

02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:50.120
Um, yeah.

02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.680
So the state that my grandmom is in right now, I put directly blame on them.

02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.280
So fuck you.

02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:57.480
Fuck you a lot.

02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:03.080
And, um, it's really difficult.

02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:04.280
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:13.720
Loki, fuck you to my cat for deciding to vomit on all the things that we enjoy.

02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:19.800
Um, I understand cats, you know, have hair balls and they spit up and stuff like that,

02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:23.960
but she always picks like shit that's really annoying.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:31.000
Like, for example, my son's remote that he chews on is in the middle of the floor and

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.960
you know, she fucking walked over to vomit on it.

02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:35.160
And so she did that.

02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:39.800
Or like, for example, our Christmas tree, which is in the garage in a box.

02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:43.000
She hopped up on the box to vomit in the box.

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:49.080
And now today we have like an Afghan on the, um, couch, you know, that we've been using

02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:52.200
this like, and she's been actually laying in it and she fucking threw up in that.

02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.760
I'm like, what is your problem, cat?

02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.560
Seriously, throw up on the floor so I can clean it up there instead of, you know, on

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.520
things that we use.

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:01.980
That's it.

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:09.080
Uh, my, a few of the week goes to a recent bout of Twitter drama that I'm seeing unfolding

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:09.720
tonight.

02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:15.000
Now, look, I don't watch the walking dead, but I respect that some people out there watch

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.880
their shows and they don't want to get spoiled on their shows.

02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:20.920
So some of y'all need to check your East coast privilege.

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:23.000
You need to check your East coast privilege.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:23.400
That's right.

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.480
I'm looking at you, New York city and Boston OL army members.

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:33.400
Not that I think you ever would spoil TV shows here in the chat or whatever, but, uh, seriously,

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:38.040
if you're going to post spoilers on Twitter and Facebook, not cool.

02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:42.520
And don't fucking tell your West coast friends where you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter.

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:45.880
No, you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter posting that stuff.

02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:48.840
Rude, rude a tease.

02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:53.320
There should be like a 24 hour period, at least on spoilers.

02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:59.160
It's fine if you want to post like OMG or I can't believe it or WTF BBQ LOL.

02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:03.480
But I'm just saying like, I could tell you what happened on the walking dead tonight.

02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:04.920
I don't even watch the fucking show.

02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:07.480
So some of y'all need to stop.

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:08.360
You're ruining it.

02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:10.200
All right.

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:10.600
That's it.

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.040
Yeah.

02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:15.240
And, uh, some people saying the walking dead Facebook page gave it away.

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:16.200
That was really stupid.

02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:18.680
I hope they get raked over the coals for that one.

02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:19.800
That was not cool.

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:21.080
All right.

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.080
Uh, let's move on a few more stories for you guys.

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:26.680
Then we'll open up the Skype line for some calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:31.240
username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word, uh, your calls in just a minute

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:32.440
here after a couple more stories.

02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:42.840
So the head of X-Box Japan, uh, Takashi Sensui has resigned and he basically will stay with

02:30:42.840 --> 02:30:47.320
Microsoft, but he's going to be working at the US headquarters instead.

02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:55.720
And, um, you, of course, this doesn't help the fact that the X-Box one hasn't really

02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:57.800
been selling that well in Japan.

02:30:57.800 --> 02:30:59.240
Not much of a surprise.

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:06.120
They're saying that they've only sold three or was it 38,461 units since September.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:14.760
Um, and I guess the vast majority of the units were sold the first four days, but it hasn't

02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:16.120
really picked up since then.

02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:21.880
I've never really been doing much over there anyways, as far as like promoting.

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:25.480
I don't think any of the really exclusive games that they've been kind of showcasing

02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:26.520
for it have come out yet.

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:36.280
Um, so I guess now they're saying that the X, the X-Box Japan, um, lead is now going

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:45.560
to, uh, Yoshinami, uh, Takahashi, who I guess has been there for 20 or who joined the company

02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:49.800
in July and has been there or previously before that at 24 years at Sony.

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.000
So, hey, you know what?

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:51.960
He's been at Sony.

02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:54.680
He knows how to sell consoles, you know, in that territory.

02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:59.400
Maybe, uh, maybe it'll help, but I'm not expecting miracles.

02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:01.480
Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room saying too bad.

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:03.640
He's a very, very smart man.

02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:09.080
Um, unfortunately he could be the smartest guy in the world, but, uh, it's, uh, if the

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:14.840
X-Box one isn't selling, then, uh, that's going to be an issue because I doubt it's

02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:16.680
just this one dude's fault.

02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.640
No, obviously not.

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:20.520
No, it's not one person's fault that it's not selling.

02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:24.200
It's, I don't think there's a lot of factors that go with to that.

02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:30.680
And the fact that he's going to the US side of it, um, maybe can be better use elsewhere.

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:31.240
I don't know.

02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:31.480
Yeah.

02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:37.000
I mean, they released the system way late there and they didn't really have anything

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:39.080
Japanese exclusive out there.

02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:43.480
They were kind of relying more on the fact that it's kind of the reverse thing for what

02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:44.120
happens here.

02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:47.240
Like there's a lot of games we go, Ooh, we want to import that from Japan cause that

02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:47.960
looks awesome.

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:51.560
Well, there's a few things that there's, there are some Japanese gamers that want to import

02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:53.160
stuff from here in the US.

02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:57.320
Cause we've got, you know, things like halo and call of duty and stuff, you know, but

02:32:57.320 --> 02:33:02.840
I don't just don't think it's a big enough crowd to, uh, carry a whole system.

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:03.640
That makes sense.

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:04.680
Yeah, it does make sense.

02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:04.920
Yeah.

02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:09.400
And I would bet the crowd that I just talked about with that as much smaller than the ones

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.400
here that want to import from Japan.

02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:18.520
So anyway, um, moving on into one more story for you guys tonight, and this has a lot of

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:20.760
people talking on social media and so forth.

02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:21.640
It's not spoilers though.

02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:22.440
Don't worry.

02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:28.280
And this has to be a Nintendo essentially commenting on an interview with GameSpot that

02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:33.320
Toad and Toadette don't have set sexes or genders.

02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:36.680
Just sit on that for a minute.

02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:41.560
Toad and Toadette may not actually be gendered characters the way you think they are.

02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:44.760
If they are mushroom people, then that would make sense, right?

02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:46.680
Because mushrooms reproduce by spores.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:50.920
Quote, this is maybe a little bit of a strange story, but we never really went out of our

02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:56.360
way to decide on the sex of these characters, even though they have somewhat gendered appearances.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:59.880
But I think what I can say is that Toadette and Toad are not siblings.

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:03.320
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they are adventure pals.

02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:06.280
And that's certainly true here in Captain Toad.

02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:15.000
So, you know, I think, yeah, a mushroom is a plant and in a way I'm oversimplifying things,

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.440
but a mushroom is a plant and, you know, not, not everything necessarily has to, you know,

02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:23.320
have, it's a plant.

02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:25.960
I don't know.

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:31.560
I think some people think way too much about this stuff, but at the same time, I do understand

02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:36.120
and I've known people, you know, on the internet and from the years that I've done Rocky Horror

02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:39.720
Picture Show and some of the other conventions I've gone to in the past, I understand that

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:45.800
some people feel like they don't fit in on the gender spectrum on one side or the other.

02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:50.440
So that's where you get, you know, things that they call, you know, Jamie might have

02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:53.960
to help me out here with some of the terms because I've heard gender queer as one of

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:59.720
those self identifying or I've seen by gendered, agendered, agendered.

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:01.480
That's, that's the other one I was trying to think of.

02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:02.760
So there's certainly those folks.

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.160
So I think it's kind of nice.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:07.080
Representation is always nice.

02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:11.480
It's always nice to know you're not alone and that goes for anybody who's in any sort

02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:12.440
of minority, right?

02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.160
And that's why there's been calls for more diversity in video games because there's so

02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:19.000
many diverse people that enjoy video games.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.560
So I think if you are one of these folks, it's, it's maybe nice to hear that, you know,

02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:27.400
there's characters out there where gender is not really an issue.

02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.920
I think just in this case though, I think Nintendo is kind of saying, you know, if you're

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.720
sitting there thinking about how does toad reproduce, maybe you should, maybe you really

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.320
don't need to be worrying about that right now.

02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:41.560
This is mushrooms reproduced by spores.

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:42.120
That's right.

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:48.040
And typically when you see a mushroom cap, it's actually part of a much larger system

02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:49.240
of a single organism.

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:51.800
Just saying, just saying, just saying.

02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:55.560
So, uh, pay attention in biology.

02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:56.120
There you go.

02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:06.040
Uh, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, SSG100Matt in chat saying, isn't Berto

02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:06.920
a guy?

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.920
That was a whole, that was a whole nother thing that Nintendo kind of got into and the

02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:14.120
whole thing ended up being, wasn't it like a mistranslation or something like that?

02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:18.520
Originally, but now I think they've kind of gone with it, but hey, uh, poison's a guy.

02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:19.880
Yeah.

02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:25.080
And, uh, the poison is technically not transgendered, but is transvestite.

02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:29.960
And there's a, but there is a transgendered character for sure in the new dragon age,

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:30.600
uh, as well.

02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:32.520
Cause Jennifer Hale voices him.

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:35.160
And it's, um, it's a pretty cool story.

02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:38.840
If you, uh, read, uh, I mean, I know you're probably trying to avoid spoilers, but, uh,

02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:41.400
they, they get into it a little bit and explain it a little bit.

02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:43.800
Actually, the solace stuff has already been spoiled for me.

02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.680
So I spoiled myself on the iron bull stuff just because it's too weird.

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:52.520
Raginator in chat says, guy, technically mushrooms aren't plants.

02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:53.640
They're fungi.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:54.680
Plants have chlorophyll.

02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:55.640
Mushrooms don't.

02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:56.520
You know what?

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:58.360
I said I was oversimplifying things.

02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.480
So sit down, please.

02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:00.840
So there you go.

02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:02.600
Rob's a fun guy too.

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:06.840
Actdeft in chat saying, I think adventure pals means other stuff.

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.560
Um, you're thinking of like our toad and toadette friends with benefits.

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.080
I think you're thinking a little hard on, I think you think you're way too into this.

02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:15.240
Yeah.

02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:17.720
They sit in the closet or at least their spores together.

02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:20.520
Ooh, it's shiny.

02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:25.880
Uh, I don't care what gender or whatever toadette is.

02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:30.360
I still think toadette is, um, not a character I enjoy seeing in Nintendo games.

02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:30.760
Just saying.

02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:34.840
Double dash ruined toadette forever for me.

02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:35.240
Just saying.

02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:37.880
All right, let's move on.

02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.160
We're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:43.880
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:48.040
If you'd like to give us a call and be on the show, that would be awesome sauce.

02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:48.840
We'd love to have you.

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:52.680
If you have more comments on anything we've talked about tonight or something, maybe we

02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:57.720
didn't get into again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

02:37:57.720 --> 02:37:58.120
Radio.

02:37:58.120 --> 02:37:58.840
All one word.

02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.840
While we wait for some calls to come in.

02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:03.000
I'm trying to find the blue shell haiku.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.080
I'm going to check on any, uh, it was just something like, fuck you, blue shell.

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:08.120
I will fucking wreck you.

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:08.520
Fuck you.

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:09.320
Fuck you or something like that.

02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:09.480
Yes.

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:10.680
All right.

02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:12.280
It was totally perfect.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.280
Any last minute stories, Logie?

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:14.520
Yeah.

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:20.920
If you're into nostalgia and you happen to also like looking at code, the complete source

02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.440
code for Doom on the 3DO has been released.

02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:31.400
And you can actually check it out now at github.com slash old dash school.

02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:32.520
And it's spelled really weird.

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:39.000
So O-L-D-E dash S-K-U-U-L slash Doom 3DO.

02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:41.800
So pretty cool.

02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:43.480
And you can check it out.

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.960
I guess it's, you know, the C source code there.

02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:49.880
So that is kind of rad.

02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:54.440
I, even though I don't really understand source code, like what all goes into it, I think

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:57.960
sometimes that kind of stuff can be really fun to read about and try to look into.

02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:58.520
Did you?

02:38:58.520 --> 02:38:58.920
Yes.

02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.360
A haiku about Mario Kart.

02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:02.120
Are you kidding me?

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:03.560
Who the fuck threw that blue shell?

02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:04.440
I will fuck you up.

02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:05.880
There it is.

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:07.560
Perfect.

02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:08.600
All right.

02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:12.200
Again, it's 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:14.920
I thought I saw a call come in, but I missed it while Loki was talking.

02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:16.680
So give you another chance there.

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.240
No, that's fine.

02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.200
You have a right to do your thing.

02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:22.600
Do you have any other stories while we wait for the phone to light up again?

02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.760
No, but I know that there's that Call of Duty online that's in China.

02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:31.960
And so I'm actually going to check out, see if I can play that this weekend or next week

02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:32.920
because it looks pretty cool.

02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:37.800
It's basically like the modern Call of Duty stuff in the old Call of Duty Modern Warfare

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:40.680
maps, which is basically what I want to play.

02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:43.400
New Call of Duty on those awesome maps.

02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.400
So there you go.

02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:46.200
I want to check that out.

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:46.440
All right.

02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:47.880
Let's go to the phones because it's lighting up.

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:48.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:49.320
Who's this?

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:50.920
Pal here.

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:51.400
Hey, Pal.

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:51.880
How you doing?

02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:53.240
Pretty good.

02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:54.360
Packing, packing.

02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:55.640
So, but everything okay.

02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:56.840
What's that?

02:39:56.840 --> 02:39:58.280
You packing.

02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.920
I need, I'm moving in a month or so.

02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:06.440
So I'm just packing and pack the video games last.

02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:07.560
Pack the video games last.

02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.920
You'll need something to entertain yourself.

02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:10.120
Yep.

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:10.520
What's up?

02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:17.480
I was going to recommend a Vita game that I bought recently.

02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:22.840
Ah, since early in the show, we were talking about the Vita settlement and we were kind

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.600
of talking about, eh, there's not, it doesn't seem like there's a lot, a lot on the Vita

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:27.720
right now to make it worth it.

02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:30.360
But you, you think there's something that is worth checking out.

02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:31.000
Tell us about it.

02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:35.400
I don't think it's amazing, but I'm really enjoying it.

02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:40.040
It's called a Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1.

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.200
I'd say three times faster.

02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:43.080
I've heard of this.

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:43.580
Okay.

02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:46.440
I'm enjoying it more than I expect.

02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:55.160
It's basically JRPG with a lot of anime looking, you know, graphics.

02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.880
But I kind of really enjoying it.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:03.640
It's kind of like, it's self-aware.

02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:05.480
So I'm not too sure that some people might like it.

02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:11.320
Some people might not, but it's basically four goddesses who represent each of the

02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:13.800
consoles in the nineties.

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:19.240
So one is supposed to be PlayStation, Sega, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:19.740
Really?

02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:25.640
And they're literally fighting a war that is called Console Wars.

02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:29.880
And they're fighting for such a long time that they don't remember what they're fighting

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.200
for.

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:38.200
So it's really silly and absurd, but at the same time, the fighting system is pretty interesting.

02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:44.440
Since in some point you can modify your own engines and even you kind of create your own

02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:45.480
quest if you want to.

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.120
So it's extremely self-aware.

02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:52.360
If you like anime, you might like it.

02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:57.240
But I think it's kind of something nice to have on the go.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.680
So it's not around 10 minutes you can finish a quest.

02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:02.360
So it's pretty fast.

02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:04.120
There is some text.

02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.520
It takes like two minutes between quests.

02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:08.680
So it's not that huge dialogue.

02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:10.680
You know, I've heard of this game before.

02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:11.800
I just didn't know a lot about it.

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:16.280
I knew it was a JRPG, but that sounds really funny how it's all the different games.

02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:20.840
I'm assuming it's not so in your face, but it's very subtly these different consoles

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:21.800
involve the Console Wars.

02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:22.680
That sounds kind of awesome.

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.000
Two important things regarding the game.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:33.080
One is if people want to check it out, be extremely aware of the title.

02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:36.920
Be sure you get one that says dimension Obtunia.

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:39.640
The one that says at the end Rebirth 1.

02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.400
Because that's the remake done for the beta and it's much better than the previous version.

02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.520
So be sure you don't buy the previous one by accident.

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:56.120
Because I even see big main websites using the wrong captures for the review.

02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:57.320
They have the wrong pictures.

02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:59.720
They have the wrong content.

02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:00.840
It's pretty awkward.

02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.800
Shame, shame.

02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:02.600
They should know better.

02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.760
And the second thing just to finish.

02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:07.880
There is some dialogue.

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:13.080
There's some big sexualized and there's some soft erotic moments.

02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:20.040
But if you're the kind of person that gets really turned on by that, be aware there's

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:22.120
some dialogue.

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:29.800
Even though it looks kind of magical girl type of thing, it's definitely not for kids.

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:30.360
I see.

02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:33.240
You broke up a little bit there, but I think I caught mostly what you were saying.

02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:38.440
Some of the dialogue is a little salty if you're not necessarily into that.

02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:40.440
Looking at our chat room, some comments here.

02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.120
Act F saying, I heard that Natunia is one of the games that's actually good for the

02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:46.440
Vita, but it can be hit or miss from what I've read.

02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:48.920
Maybe that depends on the version, Act F.

02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:51.720
Maybe not everybody's looking at the right version.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.400
Dark Tetsuya asking, didn't Kenji and Afune have a cameo in one of those games?

02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:56.280
Yes, he did.

02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:57.400
Yeah, that's cool.

02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:04.680
I think during this week, it's on sale for 30 bucks in the store in the US and no other

02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:05.400
regions are.

02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:05.900
Is it?

02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:09.960
I might have to check this out because my Vita needs a little love.

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.400
I don't even know if it's charged right now.

02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:13.080
All right.

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.200
So that's it.

02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:14.440
All right.

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:16.040
Well, thanks for the recommendation.

02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:19.160
It's good to know a little more about that game and something that we should be checking

02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:19.800
out on our Vitas.

02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:20.280
Thanks, pal.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:21.320
Thank you.

02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:22.040
Have a nice night.

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:22.280
All right.

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:22.600
Take care.

02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:23.240
Thanks for calling.

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:25.080
All right.

02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:26.840
And just make sure you get the right one there.

02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:28.520
The one that has that subtitle at the end there.

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:29.640
Very important.

02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:30.280
Big difference.

02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:30.920
Big difference.

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:34.360
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:36.760
Hey, if you think there's a game that's not getting enough attention out there, like,

02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:40.360
pow, just kind of say, or the people are getting it straight up wrong, go ahead and

02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:41.960
give us a call and clear the air.

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.720
Or any of the other news items we talked about tonight.

02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:48.280
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:52.520
I am trying to bring up the Twitters real quick here because I thought I saw a few tweets

02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:53.400
come in.

02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:57.880
Again, we try to get to some of your questions at Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:04.040
Sometimes I lose things in between the other stuff that gets tweeted to us and retweeted

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:05.480
and so forth.

02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:11.960
But I do see a tweet from Soutor that says, anybody at OLR into the Harvest Moon games?

02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:13.880
I've only played the handheld ones, though.

02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:17.480
I just ordered Harvest Moon, a new beginning for the 3DS.

02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:19.880
In all honesty, no.

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:23.800
I tried playing one of them because somebody told me it was very similar to Animal Crossing.

02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:25.240
I think it was on the GameCube.

02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:27.000
I couldn't really get into it at all.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:27.560
No.

02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:30.520
The milking the cows, the tending to the fields.

02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.920
It's like Farmville, pre-Farmville.

02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:33.640
Yeah.

02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:34.200
But I understand.

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:36.280
I don't want to make it sound, oh, and it's horrible.

02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:38.120
No, I get why some people are into it.

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:40.440
But it just wasn't something that really grabbed me.

02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.320
It's very impressive that it has stayed going so long as it has.

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:47.720
So there you go.

02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:51.640
Flaco Jones responding to last week's Classic Game of the Week.

02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:52.600
Dark Soccer, you weren't here.

02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:54.680
Did you see what I picked for last week?

02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:56.040
Uh, I did.

02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:56.920
And then I forgot.

02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.400
Well, Flaco says, Ghostbusters is one of my favorite Commodore 64 games.

02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:03.480
Of course it's Commodore 64.

02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:06.440
Well, to be fair, though, Ghostbusters had a port on the Sega Master System.

02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:09.960
So one could say I was trying to pull a Jamie last week.

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:13.160
No, I had to show a little love to the Commodore 64.

02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:14.600
All right, we do have another call coming in.

02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:15.320
So let's get to it.

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:16.440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.320
Who's this?

02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:17.960
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:18.680
This is Kaijuto.

02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:19.240
Hey, Kaijuto.

02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:20.440
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:23.960
And I just want to comment real quick on the story you mentioned earlier about GameStop

02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:26.840
complaining about the digital versus the physical.

02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:29.000
Yes, I think there's a lot of strong opinions on this.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:29.500
What's up?

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:34.940
I don't necessarily think that there's actually a problem with the digital versus the physical.

02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:37.100
I think people are still buying physical.

02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:38.140
I'm one of them.

02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:43.260
But a lot of times, people are buying off of Amazon and other places.

02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:46.140
I don't think it necessarily has to deal with the price.

02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:47.740
It's just the availability.

02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:49.180
I love GameStop.

02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:52.780
But one of the things I noticed with them, I'm a person that loves to buy my games new.

02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:55.980
I don't subscribe to their user, you know, their used game stuff.

02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.940
And they don't ever restock stuff.

02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:05.820
They'll get not any of the big games, not like Grand Theft Auto or any of the NBA games

02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:06.540
or anything like that.

02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:07.580
I mean, they always restock those.

02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:10.780
But any of the smaller games, they never restock them.

02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:14.620
They get them that first week, sell them all out, and then they don't restock them.

02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:21.100
Like if they really want to make sales, I think they need to look more into new games

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:22.220
and restock.

02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:24.060
And maybe people wouldn't be going to Amazon.

02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:28.220
Because half the time, the main reason I like going to Amazon is because usually they don't

02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:29.500
have the game that I'm looking for.

02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:33.100
So I have to go on Amazon to find that game physically and buy it.

02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:36.780
Yeah, you know, Kaishudo, I think you just hit the nail on the head, a big part of the

02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:39.180
reason why I personally stopped going to GameStop.

02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:42.380
Like I haven't gone into one in a while.

02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:47.260
And a big part of the reason is that I remember going into a GameStop, and I remember what

02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:48.300
the game was.

02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:50.060
But it was something that just came out on release day.

02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:53.820
And I went to the GameStop, and I asked for the game that had just come out that day.

02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:55.340
And they were like, well, did you pre-order it?

02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:56.780
And I'm like, no.

02:47:56.860 --> 02:47:59.420
And the guy kind of like shamed me a little bit.

02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:03.660
Like, you know, like, well, you know, it's a popular game, so you should always pre-order

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:06.140
games, and we don't have any for people that didn't pre-order it.

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:07.420
And I was like, all right.

02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:14.220
So I walked to the Target in the exact same shopping center, and they had a bountiful

02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:15.820
amount of copies of the game.

02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:17.420
And that's when I said, you know what?

02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:18.780
Fuck it.

02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:23.820
I don't need to go into a store and fucking get a lecture about not buying into this whole

02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:27.740
pre-order bullshit that I know is just a profiteering scheme for you guys.

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:33.900
That was the same with a PSP, I think, where they said, you know, good.

02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:35.180
Like, it was at the launch of the PSP.

02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:35.900
They're all good luck.

02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:36.700
Find it anywhere.

02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:37.660
It's sold out everywhere.

02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:38.380
Went to Best Buy.

02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:40.460
They had like a whole bunch of them just sitting there.

02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:42.940
I'm like, oh, OK, I'll just get it here.

02:48:42.940 --> 02:48:46.140
And this is all over because I experienced the same thing.

02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:52.140
A lot of games that I go looking for, like I remember just recently I went to get a Pokemon

02:48:52.140 --> 02:48:52.700
Black 2.

02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:55.340
Black 2 and White 2.

02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:57.180
And GameStop didn't have it.

02:48:57.900 --> 02:48:59.820
The guy told me, you know, it's a really old game.

02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:02.860
He hasn't seen it in a while.

02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:05.420
I went right over to Target, got both of them.

02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:08.380
It's just like, you know, you start to do shit, man.

02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:09.740
That's all you got to do.

02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:11.740
What did that just instill in me for the future?

02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:15.660
I can either go to GameStop and get a lecture, or I can go to Target and get my game and

02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:16.780
no questions asked.

02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:21.100
Because it's one of those cases where I actually kind of prefer that the people selling me

02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:23.260
the game at Target aren't game enthusiasts.

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:24.400
Yeah.

02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:28.140
Yeah, I got into a big debate one time about all that.

02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:33.420
A lot of people were saying that when it comes to GameStop, that they prefer, you know,

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:35.900
people should know about gaming and blah, blah, blah.

02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.780
I'm like, for me, all they need to know is the price.

02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:41.980
All they need to tell me is the price and that they have it in stock.

02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:43.900
I can do all my research online.

02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:46.140
You know, I don't need a video game expert to work in the store.

02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:47.900
I know people got to make money.

02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:50.220
Not everybody has time to learn about video games.

02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:51.580
They just got to make that quick dollar.

02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:53.020
So that's all they need to know.

02:49:53.020 --> 02:49:54.460
They just need to know what's in their store.

02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:57.500
And I don't necessarily, and to make it clear, because I know we have a lot of people who

02:49:57.500 --> 02:49:59.340
listen to the show who do work at GameStop.

02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:03.580
And I just want to remind you guys, like my problem isn't necessarily with the frontline

02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:07.500
workers, although there's always going to be a few bad apples in every barrel and there's

02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:08.860
a few at every company.

02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:13.580
But I think a lot of times that attitude that I got, because you just said you got that

02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:16.620
same attitude, you live in a completely different part of the country than I do.

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.500
That clearly then comes from the top down.

02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:22.780
That's an attitude that's passed on in the corporate environment.

02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:25.580
And that's not something I necessarily fault the people on the front lines.

02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:30.300
The reality is, though, again, that's not going to convince me to come back into the

02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:33.980
store when I can get the game without a lecture somewhere else.

02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:34.220
Yeah.

02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:37.020
But to that guy's defense, like he wasn't lecturing me.

02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:39.660
He actually sounded upset by it.

02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:42.140
He was just saying that, you know, it's an old game, hasn't been around.

02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:45.100
But it wasn't like, you know, see, you should have got it early.

02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:45.900
It wasn't like that.

02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:47.740
I never got any of that type of treatment.

02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:48.780
But I know what you're talking about.

02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:49.900
Wish I could say the same.

02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.060
Yeah.

02:50:50.060 --> 02:50:50.940
Still love GameStop.

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:51.820
Still support them.

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:57.660
I think that they're a major reason why games were selling like hotcakes back in the mid

02:50:57.660 --> 02:50:58.460
2000s.

02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:01.660
You know, so I credit them for a lot of where gaming is now.

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:03.660
I don't agree with that guy you're talking about.

02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:05.420
The guy who said we're in the golden age.

02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:06.460
We're not in the golden age.

02:51:07.420 --> 02:51:08.380
Definitely not in the golden age.

02:51:08.380 --> 02:51:09.820
I don't know what he's talking about.

02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:11.260
But why not?

02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:12.060
Quickly, why not?

02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:17.260
Just for the simple fact, it's like, you know, we have the same games being reproduced.

02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:18.540
Not a lot of like new games.

02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:19.740
A lot of things are sequels.

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:25.900
Really what I think is the place that's experienced in the golden age is probably the indie game

02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:26.140
scene.

02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:31.180
Like I see the whole indie game scene the same way that I see.

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:35.820
Remember back in like in the mid 90s when Hollywood went indie and all those indie movies

02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:37.900
were picking up Oscars and all that type of stuff.

02:51:37.900 --> 02:51:39.180
We're in that type of situation.

02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:42.860
I don't see AAA doing really well or any of that type of stuff.

02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:45.020
I think all that stuff is going downhill.

02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:47.020
But as far as the indie scene, yeah, we're getting a lot of stuff.

02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:50.460
And of course that also feeds into the digital thing.

02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:54.380
Because a lot of these indie games, they don't make CDs or anything.

02:51:54.380 --> 02:51:58.780
So that's another reason why people may not be going into that GameStop.

02:51:58.780 --> 02:52:01.900
Because they have to buy these games digitally online.

02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:03.660
Because that's the only way they can get it.

02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:06.780
That's a very interesting comparison with the film industry.

02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:08.860
Because I know we've kind of addressed this before.

02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:14.220
But movies had to go through similar growing pains when it became easier for anybody to

02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:15.020
shoot their own movie.

02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:17.740
When camcorders became more and more popular.

02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:22.060
And that was probably about the time was the mid 90s when anybody could shoot something

02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:23.020
on VHS.

02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:24.380
And we got what?

02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:25.820
The Blair Witch Project out of that.

02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:29.500
Which, you know, whether you loved or hated that movie, it was one of the biggest independent

02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:30.620
smashes of all time.

02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:35.660
And that was, you know, literally people running around in the forest at night on their camcorders.

02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:37.500
So yeah, very good point.

02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:38.140
All right.

02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:39.260
Take care, my friend.

02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:39.660
All right.

02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:39.900
All right.

02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:40.300
Bye bye.

02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:41.420
Bye bye.

02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:11.020
But that's all right.

02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:11.420
I understand.

02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:12.700
I didn't touch it since.

02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:16.780
No, I looked at the logs over the last few months and there's been no one on it.

02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:18.860
So as far as I can tell.

02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:21.900
So we'll just have to move to PlayStation 4 or something.

02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:23.100
Anyway, we do have another call coming in.

02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:24.060
So let's get to it.

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:25.020
Hi on Orange Launch Radio.

02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:25.900
Who's this?

02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:26.620
Hey, it's Dave.

02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:27.340
What's going on?

02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:28.380
Hey, what's up, Dave?

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.100
How you doing?

02:53:29.100 --> 02:53:29.820
Not much.

02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:32.140
Just called in to ask you guys a question.

02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:33.900
See if anybody else felt this way.

02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:37.020
I guess it's just more negativity from me after that last call.

02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:43.100
But is it just me or does it feel like over the last, I don't know, like half decade or

02:53:43.100 --> 02:53:50.140
something Black Friday sales have just gotten crappier and crappier and crappier?

02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:57.340
Black Friday itself just seems to have transformed in the past five years.

02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:00.220
And I think that's kind of leading into it a little bit.

02:54:00.220 --> 02:54:03.980
Like what you're saying where like the sales are getting crappier and crappier because

02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:08.700
I think there's more of that expectation there that, you know, you have to have these

02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:11.420
huge doorbuster sales and so forth.

02:54:11.420 --> 02:54:15.020
And the stores have to be open on quote unquote,

02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:17.820
Gray Thursday, which the rest of us call Thanksgiving.

02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:21.500
Like that wasn't a thing when I was a kid.

02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:24.620
I don't even remember Black Friday being a big deal when I was a kid.

02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:28.460
I remember you don't go to the mall that weekend because it's the biggest shopping

02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:29.260
weekend of the year.

02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:30.060
But it wasn't like...

02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:31.580
They never really called it Black Friday.

02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:32.300
It was just like...

02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:36.460
It was called that by the employees because, oh my God, consumerism.

02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:40.860
Or, you know, if you want to get technical, it's the day where the stores would finally

02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:43.500
be in the black for the year after running in the red for the whole year.

02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:45.340
That's really where the name comes from.

02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:49.660
But now it's Black Friday because somebody's going to get a black eye fighting for a toaster.

02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:55.820
I mean, you know, maybe it's just that I'm getting older and, you know, I care less about

02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:56.060
stuff.

02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:57.740
I just don't get excited about things.

02:54:57.740 --> 02:55:01.820
But I remember, you know, when I was in high school and like CompUSA stores were still

02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:02.220
around.

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:04.300
Oh, I wish those were still around.

02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:08.940
But they had sales and I'd always be like, oh, there's like, you know, two or three things

02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:10.220
that I really, really want.

02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:11.180
That's really cool.

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:17.020
Now I'm old and cranky and I see sales and I go, I want just one thing.

02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:19.900
And that I don't even see one thing like not even on Steam.

02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:25.100
And maybe that's part of the iterativeness that the last caller was talking about.

02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:28.940
It's just the same game with a different name on it every year.

02:55:28.940 --> 02:55:29.420
Right.

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:34.940
I want, you know, I want like a Baldur's Gate again where I'm like, I pay 50 bucks and I

02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:37.100
feel like I really got my money's worth out of this.

02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:44.300
Well, that's a whole nother problem that really has nothing to do with Black Friday.

02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:46.220
And that has more to do with DLC.

02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:47.580
But that would be a whole nother episode.

02:55:47.580 --> 02:55:49.340
You can probably see where I'm going with that.

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:51.260
That would be a whole nother episode of OLR.

02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:54.780
But I think with the Black Friday stuff is concerned.

02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:55.900
Yeah.

02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:58.380
I mean, I had my eyes set on one thing as well.

02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:00.140
The Warlords Draenor expansion.

02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:01.740
I wanted to get that cheaper somewhere.

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:02.700
Wasn't going to happen.

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:03.900
Nobody put it on sale.

02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:05.740
So yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.

02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:11.100
But at the same time, you know, we live in a culture now where it seems like we've got

02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:16.220
sites that really make it their business to have things on sale all year long.

02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:18.220
And that would be like Walmart.

02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:21.500
That would be Amazon would be an excellent example of this as well.

02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:24.380
Like buying into the wholesale culture.

02:56:25.020 --> 02:56:28.300
I mean, Steam kind of does this too with games in a way.

02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:34.300
But you have to kind of ask yourself, does the quality necessarily match something that

02:56:34.300 --> 02:56:35.260
I'm getting on sale?

02:56:35.900 --> 02:56:38.940
An example of that would be televisions on Black Friday.

02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:41.580
You know, I'm sure Walmart was selling some TV for what?

02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:45.900
Like probably like a full 100 inch TV for like 30 bucks, right?

02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:47.180
I don't know what kind of things they sell.

02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:48.540
They sell crazy shit on Black Friday.

02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:54.060
But the problem is the TV probably is missing something that you're probably used to seeing

02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:54.780
on a TV.

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:56.460
Like it probably doesn't have component cables.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:00.780
It's probably like HDMI only or some of these HD TVs.

02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:03.820
I don't think they do this so much anymore, but a couple of years ago you could get the

02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:07.180
cheap HD TVs, but they only did 720p.

02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:08.140
They didn't do 1080p.

02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:17.420
They had some like a really cheap cheapo laptops, tablets that they were selling for like sub

02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:17.820
$100.

02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:25.740
Oh, I walked into Best Buy and yeah, I remember seeing a tablet and the tablet was unbranded.

02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:29.980
I didn't know that you could sell a tablet that didn't have a brand.

02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:32.940
It just had a Microsoft logo and it was a seven inch tablet.

02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:40.140
Yeah, I think really at the end of the day, I'm just grumpy that I'm not seeing anything

02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.380
on Steam that I'm really excited to buy.

02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:48.460
To be fair though, we all know there's going to be another sale coming at the end of the

02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:49.100
year.

02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:54.460
So if everybody didn't blow their load on Thanksgiving so that they could get a few

02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:59.260
more sales before the big holiday, and then you're going to have that big after holiday

02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:02.540
sale, I can sort of see why we're in that position.

02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:06.060
I think Steam is uniquely positioned in a different way.

02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:10.060
Well, if you can get Dragon Age Inquisition to go on sale for that one, then I'll be happy.

02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:17.900
Sadly with a game like that, oh, well, since you bring that up, it's not going to go on

02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:20.540
sale on Steam any early.

02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:23.420
It'll be on sale on Origin before any of those other sites.

02:58:23.420 --> 02:58:27.580
You're right, I don't think I've given Origin any money yet.

02:58:28.460 --> 02:58:29.980
I'm really trying to hold out.

02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:34.540
I know, but then I think an excellent example of this, Dave, would be Titanfall.

02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:39.660
I finally bought Titanfall on the PC because it went on sale for like half as much.

02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:40.300
Where?

02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:41.180
On Origin.

02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:43.740
Yeah, it's like $10 right now or something.

02:58:43.740 --> 02:58:44.860
Now it is, yeah.

02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:47.660
Because it's not as good of a game as they hyped it up to be, unfortunately.

02:58:47.660 --> 02:58:50.140
My brother's upset because he paid full price for that.

02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:51.100
I know, I know.

02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:52.860
But that's what happens.

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:55.340
I'm sure Mass Effect is dirt cheap on Origin right now, too.

02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:59.260
Which means you can go buy every single version in existence, too.

02:58:59.260 --> 02:58:59.820
Yeah, that's right.

02:58:59.820 --> 02:59:02.380
You can probably get the whole damn trilogy for $20, I'm sure.

02:59:03.660 --> 02:59:07.340
Alright, well, Dave, my friend, thank you for your call, even if it was a little grumpy

02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:09.020
cat, but you know, I understand.

02:59:09.020 --> 02:59:11.820
Sometimes not all the news is sunshine and rainbows.

02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:13.260
Yep, you guys have a nice night.

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:14.060
Alright, you too, my friend.

02:59:14.060 --> 02:59:14.380
Take care.

02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:15.260
Alright, bye-bye.

02:59:15.260 --> 02:59:16.060
Bye-bye.

02:59:16.060 --> 02:59:19.660
And here's the thing that'll inevitably happen to Dave, too, is whatever that game is that

02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:20.700
he wants, he has his eye on.

02:59:20.700 --> 02:59:22.380
Let's say Dragon Age Inquisition.

02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:23.660
You know what's going to happen.

02:59:23.660 --> 02:59:26.300
He's going to buy it, and then what's going to happen the very next day?

02:59:26.940 --> 02:59:28.140
It'll go on sale.

02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:29.820
So I have a last minute story, if you want.

02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:31.500
Sure, real quick, let's do one more story here.

02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:32.940
I am going to shut down the Skypline, though.

02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:35.020
Thanks to those of you guys who called and got through.

02:59:35.580 --> 02:59:37.820
To those of you that didn't get through, I'm sorry.

02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:38.780
Thank you for trying.

02:59:38.780 --> 02:59:40.220
Please send us an email with your thoughts.

VOG Network dot com.

02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:48.700
I know I don't always read those every- I read them.

02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:52.060
I don't necessarily always read them on air, but I always appreciate those of you that

02:59:52.060 --> 02:59:53.420
leave a comment on the episode.

02:59:53.420 --> 02:59:53.920
Loki.

02:59:54.300 --> 03:00:00.780
Valve has changed the rules for Steam gifts for trading stuff like that.

03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:07.420
So for example, all new games purchased as a gift and placed in the purchaser's inventory

03:00:07.420 --> 03:00:09.660
will be untradeable for 30 days.

03:00:10.860 --> 03:00:15.580
We've made this change to make trading gifts a better experience for those receiving the

03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:15.980
gifts.

03:00:15.980 --> 03:00:21.020
We hope- we're hoping this lowers the number of people who trade for a game only to have

03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:25.260
the game revoked later due to issues with purchaser's payment method.

03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:35.260
Oh, so there's people out there that buy the game, sell the code on eBay or whatever,

03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:39.340
put it in the other person's Steam account, and then flip the charges on the company or

03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:39.660
so.

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:41.340
I see what the- I see what the exploit is.

03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:43.420
I would have even thought of that.

03:00:43.420 --> 03:00:44.220
That's shady.

03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:45.900
That is very shady.

03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:48.620
But that's also annoying though, if you're buying somebody a gift.

03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:49.260
Yeah.

03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:52.300
Well, no, you just don't put it in your own inventory first.

03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:53.420
Oh, you just send it straight to them?

03:00:53.420 --> 03:00:55.420
That's the- yeah, you can send it straight to them.

03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:56.460
Well, okay.

03:00:56.460 --> 03:01:00.300
Yeah, but you can buy something as a gift and drop it in your own inventory first if

03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:03.260
you don't necessarily know who you're going to give it to, or you're going to save it

03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:04.380
for trade fodder.

03:01:04.380 --> 03:01:07.900
Like, you could trade a $2 game for a bunch of trading cards or something.

03:01:07.900 --> 03:01:09.900
Like, that's the whole idea behind it.

03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:14.060
But yeah, if I want to buy you a gift, Loki, if I want to buy you a game, like let's say

03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:18.620
you love Civ V so much, I'm going to get you Civ Beyond Earth for Christmas.

03:01:18.620 --> 03:01:20.060
I could just drop that right in your inventory.

03:01:20.060 --> 03:01:20.780
I'm not going to have a problem.

03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:22.540
I'm not going to have to sit on that for 30 days.

03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:28.380
That would be silly of Valve to do because the whole reason they built that wishlist

03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:30.780
thing in is so that they can tell you.

03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:35.580
Like, if I'm looking at a certain store page, hey, Loki has this game on his wishlist.

03:01:35.580 --> 03:01:36.860
It's on sale.

03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:38.620
You haven't gotten him a gift yet.

03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:39.820
Buy, buy, buy.

03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:41.580
They want me to be able to drop that in your inventory.

03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:42.140
That makes sense.

03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:43.420
They just want to buy a password.

03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:44.860
They buy it for me first.

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:49.180
So act deft, confirming you can still gift it, just not trade it.

03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:51.820
They're saying that that's supposed to deter resellers.

03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:56.220
So people that, you know, are selling games, they, they probably need to do that.

03:01:56.220 --> 03:01:58.700
There's a lot of shady stuff that happens with the steam reselling.

03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:01.340
So I see why they're, they probably haven't been resort to that.

03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:01.980
It makes sense.

03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:02.540
All right.

03:02:02.540 --> 03:02:04.780
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:07.260
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.

03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:09.580
Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.

03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:12.700
And if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or three

03:02:12.700 --> 03:02:13.500
about the show.

03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.860
Help spread the word.

03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:19.020
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you got to give us more of those voices

03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:20.380
so we can get the news out there.

03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:21.340
Don't forget guys.

03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:26.220
Next week's show, December 7th, noon is when it will actually be live.

03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:30.780
So this is the chance for those of you guys overseas or in a different time zone to participate

03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:31.500
with the show.

03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:36.380
Of course, if you're, if you're the other way on the globe, like I know Akuma JP is

03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:38.140
like, that's like 3 a.m. for me.

03:02:38.140 --> 03:02:39.740
I'm not going to be able to, sorry, sorry.

03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:45.340
Maybe, maybe another week we'll do, we'll do a show at 3 a.m. for those of you guys

03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:46.380
on that side of the globe.

03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:49.500
Maybe, well, maybe, maybe we'll see.

03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:49.820
All right.

03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:51.500
Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.

03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:53.740
We'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:55.100
So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.

03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:55.900
Your final thought tonight.

03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:58.780
So apparently there was this thing going on in Microsoft store.

03:02:58.780 --> 03:03:03.260
If you purchase Connect Sports Rivals for the Xbox One, you can purchase another game

03:03:03.260 --> 03:03:03.820
for free.

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:08.060
Oh, so for example, Connect Sports Rivals was $24.99.

03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:11.820
And you could add Grand Theft Auto 5 for free on the Xbox One.

03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:14.620
Uh, it wasn't supposed to work that way.

03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:15.100
Oops.

03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:19.100
Uh, so now that's, that's closed, but yeah.

03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:21.980
So, um, that's silly.

03:03:21.980 --> 03:03:25.100
But, um, yeah, so hopefully I'm working more on my game this week.

03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:30.940
I started rewriting the engine again and, uh, hopefully this will be the last time.

03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:35.900
And yeah, I'm going to look at maybe shutting down the Minecraft server, even though it's

03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:39.660
only like five bucks a month, it's just, nobody's playing it.

03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:42.380
That's just, that's five bucks a month that you're spending on a Team Fortress 2

03:03:42.380 --> 03:03:43.340
server or something else.

03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:48.300
It's even, I'm not playing it and I have no desire to go back and play it cause it's

03:03:48.300 --> 03:03:50.220
just like, I don't know.

03:03:50.220 --> 03:03:53.500
I can't dedicate a lot of time to one game.

03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:55.820
Jamie, Jamie, do you have a suggestion for the money?

03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:57.900
I could just give you five bucks every month.

03:03:58.940 --> 03:04:03.340
Well, I've kept it running for like, you know, years, a couple of years, a couple of

03:04:03.340 --> 03:04:05.420
years, and it's just not my Normandy out of it.

03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:07.900
It's just not, I mean, I could, I'm going to back up everything.

03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:11.500
You copy the server and then that way people can have their own local copies of it.

03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.820
Maybe I can, I can download the server and stuff.

03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:14.460
That's fine.

03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:18.780
You know, that's what I'm, of course I'm going to do that, but like, I think it's

03:04:18.780 --> 03:04:23.980
more advantageous to like, if we were going to do something like that, to go to a public

03:04:23.980 --> 03:04:26.940
server or something where we could all go to the same one.

03:04:26.940 --> 03:04:31.340
So if we're not playing, there's actual people on the server to play with instead

03:04:31.340 --> 03:04:33.420
of just it being dead.

03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:33.980
You know what I mean?

03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:35.100
That, that was always the problem.

03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:40.540
Yeah, I'd play on it, but I'd be the only one on for an hour and I may see somebody

03:04:40.540 --> 03:04:43.740
once in a while, but it's not like it's always packed with people.

03:04:45.100 --> 03:04:45.740
All right.

03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:46.860
That was a long final thought.

03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:48.140
That's all right.

03:04:48.780 --> 03:04:52.780
My final thought for the night is I've had a really good restful period of being able

03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:54.620
to sit on my big butt and play video games.

03:04:54.620 --> 03:04:58.540
And I'm, I'm sad that it's coming to an end, but I am thankful that, you know, I

03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:01.820
have a job to go to tomorrow and, and all that good stuff.

03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:07.100
So, um, I just want to say thanks for tuning into the show on a holiday weekend

03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:09.820
and, uh, hope your holidays went well.

03:05:09.820 --> 03:05:11.980
And, uh, hope your winter holidays will be going well.

03:05:11.980 --> 03:05:15.340
I know a lot of the celebrations begin for that in the coming week.

03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:19.180
So, um, I hope whatever you're doing for the holidays is great.

03:05:19.180 --> 03:05:20.860
And thanks you guys so much for your support of the show.

03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:22.860
Uh, dark soccer, your final thought.

03:05:23.740 --> 03:05:25.500
Um, don't be a dick.

03:05:26.060 --> 03:05:26.540
That's right.

03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:27.260
Don't be a dick.

03:05:27.900 --> 03:05:28.140
All right.

03:05:28.140 --> 03:05:30.380
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:34.220
We will be back in seven days at a different time to do it all over

03:05:34.220 --> 03:05:36.780
again and talk about whatever should come up in the news next week.

03:05:36.780 --> 03:05:37.820
PlayStation experience.

03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:41.500
I imagine is going to be coming up the game awards and whatever is unveiled there.

03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:45.180
So, uh, even though it's a slow retail, well, it's a fast retail period, a slow

03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:48.380
retail release period, uh, there's still going to be a lot of stuff coming out in

03:05:48.380 --> 03:05:51.100
this past week, so we will see you in seven days to do it all again.

03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:52.380
Thanks you guys so much for tuning in.

03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:53.180
Have a wonderful week.

03:05:53.180 --> 03:05:53.420
Bye.

03:05:54.140 --> 03:05:56.780
