00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight is a very special number for us and we'll explain why. Also, there's PlayStation updates galore for both the firmware and a popular game on the console. Did they do harm as well as good? Find out next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 2nd of 2014, episode number 573 of our program. That is a number with some special significance, but I will get into that in just a moment.

00:51.000 --> 01:04.000
First, let's go around and introduce ourselves. My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle every week with my co-host. Say hello over there. Welcome back. She was out last week, but she's back this week. DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Moving is shit.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Moving is shit. But it's done.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I now live in Grandpa's house.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
I wasn't going to say last week, but so yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It's fine. I live in Grandpa's house.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Not the house he's living in, but the other house that he lived in.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Right now it's still Grandpa's house, but it will be our house.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Funny how all that VoG network stuff kind of comes together in the end.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, now it involves real estate.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I love how you were like, you should come over and see my place, except well you've already seen it.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
You've already been there.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
And I like this. I love this. You're the one that moves, yet you brought me a housewarming gift tonight.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And I believe the listeners should be clued in to what it is.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Bitch, I made that for me. I'm just sharing with you.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
So what is this that you brought?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
It's hooch.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It's a peace offering.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's Jamie Hooch.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay, it's not actually hooch because I didn't, you know, make make it.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Not like out of juicy juice and some yeast on an air conditioner or something like my friend Roy used to do.

02:04.000 --> 02:19.000
It's Blackberry Manischewitz, Coin Tro, which is a really good expensive orange liqueur, pomegranate vodka, brandy, and then this really good lime juice and sugar cane mixer.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Normally this stuff is like way expensive. I got a really good deal. I mean, you can drink this stuff straight. It's so good.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
So if I sound a little out of it or disconnected tonight, now you know why. It's Jamie's fault. So there you go.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Grandpa came over here on Wednesday. He didn't bring me hooch. You would expect that drunkard to bring me hooch, but you brought me hooch.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
You won't bring you hooch because he was busy drinking it.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's true. That's very true.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, I had some in the car. It's gone now. We let Victoria drive.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
So I appreciate that and happy move to you and may you get all settled in and all that.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Midna is ecstatic. I thought she was going to move into her litter box for a year like Shermy did.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh no. That cat's like sniff, sniff. I'm home. Let me shed on everything.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Nice.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And so she also has learned how to headbutt the cabinets in the bathroom to get them open.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah. Our cat learned how to open doors too. That was interesting.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
You know how like sometimes if you don't push a door all the way, it might be closed, but not be like latched.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
So I learned that if you don't push them all the way, she'll headbutt her way in the room.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Mine will be shut all the way and she'll be like, boom, boom.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
And then when the door to the bedroom is closed, you like see little black paws peeking out like, Mom.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
All right. Well, also an owner of some cats who I'm sure has stories to contribute to this conversation.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Thankfully only one cat, but she tried to learn how to open doorknobs.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
She knows that the doorknob is what opens the door and she'll paw at it, but she has no way to grab the doorknob.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
See, if we were dumb and had those, you know, doorknobs that have like the kind of handle on them.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, she'd be going through the house wherever she wants.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
That's an interesting thing we all have in common. We all only have one cat.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
But here's the thing, though, is I put a cat door in my garage and she stays out in the garage now.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
She, because we have our old sofa out there, she just snaps on the sofa all day long.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
Tiger call on our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
And Tiger call on our chat says, maybe you can teach the cats how to use the toilets properly.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
They just need to learn how to flush.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I've seen the kits. No, I'm not going to do that.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
The first thing when we moved into this house that caught me off guard is that Sanrio started drinking from the toilet.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And that was nothing, that never happened in the old place.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
But like in this place, yeah, Sanrio, I caught her one day, I was like, what are you doing? Don't do that.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And Alan's like, well, it's fresh water. And I'm like, ew.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
It's not really fresh water.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Not really.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
So, yeah, that was one of those quick lessons, even though two men live here, to keep the seat down at all times.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
All right. Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
And I'm going to get into tonight's kickoff topic by giving you guys a little background and a reintroduction to Orange Lounge Radio.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
As I like to do every few months, as I know, we're fortunate enough being in a podcast that has a pretty decent-sized listener base.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Thank you guys very much for your support.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
We do get new listeners every now and again.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
So just a reintroduction of our show.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
The three of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, we all met actually at an arcade playing a little video game at the time called Dance Dance Revolution.

05:35.000 --> 05:45.000
And Dance Dance Revolution, of course, was a video game that was made by Konami that was part of their Bimani series, or beat mania, if you will, or beat matching types of video games.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
And there was a whole sorts, and I'm giving this really kind of Cliffs Notes version of it.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
Some of you guys that have been music game enthusiasts for a long time will know that I'm cutting corners here, but bear with me for the sake of showtime.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
There were a lot of other games involved in this too.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
BeatMania 2DX, Guitar Freaks, which was before Guitar Hero, and so on.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
And we used to gather at a local arcade here known as Roseville Golf Land, and we would play the game.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
You know, coin up on the machine whose turn it's going to be, play the game.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Sometimes we travel to the Bay Area to meet up with friends there and play the game there.

06:17.000 --> 06:29.000
And then we might, you know, when the home version started coming out, we learned how to mod our PS1s, either with a paperclip or for a little cartridge that went in the back, or the disc swap trick, or whatever it is used.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
So we could play the import Bimani games like DDR Third Mix and have like little house parties and so forth.

06:35.000 --> 06:45.000
And most importantly, after these Golf Land parties, we would play Dance Dance Revolution, we would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
And we all sit together and just, you know, get to know each other a little more through talking shit about one of our favorite pastimes, video games.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
And so that's what OLR essentially became, is it was this big meeting at the dinner table inviting all you guys to chomp on some mozzarella sticks.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And now you know why we talk about food so much.

07:02.000 --> 07:13.000
Right, right, exactly. To chomp on some mozzarella sticks or whatever it is that's going to make you fat and talk some smack about video games with us at the world's biggest diner table.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
That's what OLR is.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Now Orange Land Radio started exclusively dedicated to the music gaming community.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Although a good 90% of that was Bimani in that series.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
But certainly there's a lot of love for the Bust a Move, Bust a Groove series depending on what country you're in.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Parappa the Rappa, Vibribin, which we got all excited about with the re-release a couple weeks ago, right?

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
Even In the Groove in the later years of the show being a Bimani exclusive sort of thing.

07:42.000 --> 07:54.000
Now when things sort of slowed down in the DDR community and the arcade scene unfortunately started to take a little bit of a tumble as Xbox Live and these sorts of things are gaining more and more precedence.

07:54.000 --> 08:02.000
We had started originally a spin-off podcast dedicated to all video games at large because we kind of all sat down and realized, you know what?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
We love video games most of all.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Like our love of music games is a part of that, yes, and that's something we all have in common.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
But we all love video games.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
Dark Sakura has a gigantic vault with all sorts of crazy ass import games.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
It's already being rebuilt as we speak.

08:21.000 --> 08:32.000
I have a deep love of PC gaming and things that date back to the Commodore 64 and Atari 2600 and some prior radio experience from college and so forth.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Loki likes to get in there and break shit and mod shit.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
He likes to take the video game and make it his own.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And now he's programming his own game.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So that's kind of where we are today.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
At some point we made our general show about video games, kind of the overarching show.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And that's the same show you're listening to today.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
573 episodes later after episode number one in June of 2002.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
So why do I give you this big ass backstory?

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
Because the number 573 holds some significance if you're a fan of these Beatmania and Bamani games.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Dark Sakura, would you care to elaborate with our audience a little bit?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
What's so special about 573?

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Well, to give you a small Japanese lesson.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
First of all, there are two different ways of listing numbers in Japanese.

09:29.000 --> 09:37.000
For standard, you know, everyday counting, you have like Hitotsu for one.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
The word for three would be Mitsu instead of San.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I was like, grammar, Japanese words.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
It's fine. I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
But the rest of them are basically we have Go for five, Nana for seven.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
And then Mi for Mitsu for three.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
So Go, Na, Mi, Konami.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Yep.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So 573, Go, Nana, Mi.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
And so you see that number oftentimes as little jokes in a lot of Konami games.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
Like I remember recently I was playing on Virtual Console on Super Nintendo.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Or sorry, it was a Super Nintendo game originally, but I was playing it on Wii U.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
And you remember how Legend of the Mystical Ninja had all these little houses with minigames,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and one of them was the quiz show?

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, it asked a question and the answers were one, two, or 573.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It's like that number makes no sense.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
But now looking back, it's like, oh, that was their little in-joke for the little Konami.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
How about something else too?

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
Did you know that Mitsubishi stands for three of those little diamond shapes?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
So three diamonds.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Interesting.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Isn't Namco have a similar story behind it?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I wasn't sure.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The words.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I think so.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I think there's a similar thing going on there.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
But anyway.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
And some of the arcade hardware that games like DDR and so forth ran on.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
So System 573.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, it was System 573.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
So, you know, even though, you know, I don't want you guys to think we have a bias towards Konami.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Because in some ways, our love of those series makes us hold their feet to the flame even more.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
Like, you know, I'm kind of sad that DDR kind of isn't what it used to be.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
But like all things, it's, you know, kind of come and gone and had its thing.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
But yeah, Jamie?

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
Actually, Act of Death said high scores in a lot of Konami games have 57,300 is the high score.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yes, yes.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Very, very good point.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
So yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
The interesting thing is 765 according to Dark Tetsuya.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
There you go.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So yeah, there's, you know, a lot of those sorts of jokes and everything.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
But, you know, we obviously, if it weren't for this series of games, this show wouldn't exist.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Plain and simple.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I mean, I don't know if I would have ever met Loki or Dark Soccer.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I mean, maybe, you know, nerds are kind of a small circle.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Maybe at a con somewhere down the line.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
But things probably wouldn't have played out the way they did.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I'd be throwing stuff at you at Rocky.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, right?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
You probably would have found me that way eventually.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I would have found you through Rocky.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Who knows? Who knows?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Like, it would just be like a totally different circle.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
Like, so we do owe a lot to that, you know, despite the way things are 12 years later.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You know, we owe a lot to that.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
So here on this episode 573, we definitely want to tip our hat and say thank you to Bomani and the people that made it possible.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
You know, we made a lot of our friends through playing this game.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Some of them went to go on to work on the game.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You guys know Shane, one of my best friends.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
He's on the show a lot.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
He actually worked at Konami for a short while in some games.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
We have a lot of friends at the show, people like Mel B and so forth.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
What I had hoped to do tonight for episode 573 was try to get some of those people together and have a little bit of a party and reminisce a little bit.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Unfortunately, just everything I had going on in my personal life with my final Rocky Horror show after 16 years last week.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Or sorry, actually that was on Friday.

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
And BlizzCon coming up next week and Vegas a couple of weeks ago, it's just like this was the worst possible time for this number episode to have fallen for me personally.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
So unfortunately we'll have to kind of just table some of that to a future episode.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Either something for like 20 November or maybe like episode 600 or something later down the line.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
But we still want to make something like that happen in the future.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And I apologize, I couldn't make it happen tonight.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But you know, busy life.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
And Flaco, didn't Flaco, well he was working at Konami, but I don't know if he worked on DDR.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, he did work at Konami for a short time. I don't remember if he was DDR or not.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I know the Winx was his big thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah, I remember those stories.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
But yeah, that was part of it too.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
So anyway, Dar Tetsuya actually compiled some of this stuff together about where is Bomani now.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
So I thought we would take a walk down memory lane and catch up with our favorite music based video games.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
What do you guys think? Do you even know where DDR is today you guys?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I can't even.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
You can't even possibly. Let's take a trip down memory lane.

14:21.000 --> 14:28.000
DDR 2014 is out in Japan. It's pretty much a software update, changing the interface and adding new songs.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
They do get events via EMUs, including things like Bomani Stadium, which had a baseball theme to it.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Each game in the Bomani series had its own team logo, and you could play special songs and charts.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
But if you want to play Extra Sage, you have to use Konami's pay-to-play service, Paselli.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
That's the norm for releases in Japan nowadays, apparently.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
BeatMania 2DX is up to 2DX 22, or Pen Jewel.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
It has like a light-dark theme that switches between two time periods.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
What time of day and the date that you play factors into some of the unlocks. That's kind of interesting.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
Some of the songs have a new difficulty chart to them called Legendaria with a little cross.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
There's actually a Coca-Cola Cross Bomani crossover in the game, and you unlock skins with different Coca-Cola brand logos.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Like there was a green lane cover with a Sprite logo on it. I had no idea that was a thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Did you know that you can have Soda branded 2DX lanes now, apparently?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Is there a Surge branded lane?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Maybe. One can only hope.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Pop and Music, as of the 21st game, they've stopped numbering them.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
The one that's out now is Lapistoria.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
They've also stopped using genres for the song titles, but that's just for this new game.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Guitar Freaks and Drummania is up to Gita Dora Overdrive.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
There's no longer long version songs.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Sorry, they were taken out at one point, and they just came back in Overdrive.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
So, that's that.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Dance Evolution, which is their take on the Kinect-style game.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
They had that game as a Kinect launch game.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
There's an arcade version in Japan.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
The arcade game got several song updates and some more crossovers from other Bomani games.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
U-Beat, which a lot of people mispronounce Ju-Beat because it has a J, but the J is actually silent.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
It's Yu-Beat.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
U-Beat has a game called U-Beat Saucer for Film.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That was the last one they did there.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Reflect Beat is up to Reflect Beat Groovin', which is like a music game in air hockey,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
and I believe that's out on the iPad if you want to try that out in iOS.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And Sound Voltex is up to Sound Voltex 2.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And there's a third installment that's been announced called Gravity Wars.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
So, Bomani ain't dead.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
It's just a little different now than it used to be, and I kind of stopped following it as closely as I once did,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
especially when they stopped releasing all the home versions.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Like, do you know how bad I want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4?

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
But then I realized I'm probably one of the only people that would want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Well, they should do a digital version or something.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
You would think, or I don't know, but then how do you get the controller?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Like, you could do it through PlayStation Now or something, but then how do you do the controller?

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
Remember trying to play BeatMania 5 key with a PlayStation controller? Because you could do it.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Not very well.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
And there's that horrible, horrible, horrible 360 remake of popin' music called Beat and Groovy

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
that looked like it was literally half-finished when they released it, that you had to use the controller.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
There was no popin' music controller ever released for it.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So, there it is.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, Bomani is dead, yo.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
BeatMania 2DX, 24 Doritos.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, I mean, also Konami did a lot of downscaling, right?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
They closed the office that was in the Bay Area.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I think they closed the one in Hawaii some time ago, right?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
That's gone. And that's where a lot of the DDR was coming from stateside.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
So, you know, and you look at Konami now, and we've even joked about this in the past,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
like, what do they have going right now besides Metal Gear and, you know, soccer?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Well, P.T. came out of nowhere, to be fair.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And P.T. looks pretty fuckin' amazing, which is Silent Hill, obviously.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That looks pretty awesome.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
But, you know, Konami isn't really crankin' out the games like it used to.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It's the Kojima Soccer Machine.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, it's the Kojima Soccer Company, in a way.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
They should really change the name.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
There you go. Do you guys have a, just before we get into some longer-form news

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and Housekeeping and all that and what we've been playing,

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
do you guys have, like, a favorite memory looking back on the years and years of O.L.R.,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
especially the music game days?

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
Do you have a memory of what kind of music games did for you?

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know. I just like coming to the parties. That was fun.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I was just here for the parties.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
Lugging my StepMania computer setup, you know, that was fun.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I remember when you built a custom machine for Roseville Golf Land,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
and they had it for all of, like, a week.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, then they charged me $300 in taxes for my work.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Oh, so awful. So awful.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah, they suck ass.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
Because it was $1,000 for that machine to buy all the hardware for it and stuff,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
and they paid me for it, but then they also gave me a tax form.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
So I was like, but I just purchased things. I didn't actually do any labor,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
so why are you taxing me? Oh, well, we have to give this to you in no way.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
What I should have done is given them a wrong Social Security number,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
but I was dumb, so.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That would be wrong.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
BlackDeftInChat says, Konami should do something like PT for Bimani.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
They could call it BT, Bimani Teaser.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
BlackWolf says, Konami is now mostly a casino company.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
The gambling games is what makes them their money.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
That's true. You know, when I was at the Final Fantasy Fan Fest,

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
I saw this giant machine there. It was like this huge rotating wheel,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
you know, pretty little thing at the Rio, and it had the Konami logo there in the corner.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
And we didn't sell the licensing rights in for some of that stuff,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
because that would be awesome to, like, offload the licensing rights

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
to somebody that would actually make games for it.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
It's iOS now. That's where they're making some of their money back,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
is YouBeat on iOS and ReflectBeat and all that stuff, whatever.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
DarkSakura, do you have a favorite memory,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
kind of looking back on the years and years of music gaming?

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
I remember when I finally passed my first 7 in 2DX.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I think I squealed and broke people's eardrums.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I think I was there when that happened.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Wasn't it, like, WarGame or something?

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
It was 250 BPM. That was a lot of people's first 7.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't 250.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
No, you did pass something else, and then, like, I want to say-

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
And then I did 250 BPM.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, you played that, like, as your next song, and then you passed that too,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
and you're like, I am awesome!

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It was something really bizarre, though.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And then my third one was Last Message. Remember?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Because it had that little drum bar heart that was my favorite.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
And then, of course, you know, I remember passing my first 9s, my first 8s.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
I remember the birthday party we had on the floor by the fourth mix machine,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
where Jessica brought cake, and I had my box of candy from Japan,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
and we sat on the floor and ate fucking cake with our fingers.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And, like, nobody at Golf Land seemed to care.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
They're like, oh, it's them.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Oh, it's them.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And then the no shadowing party, the no shadowing thing,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
so we decided to shadow everybody.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
On Para Para.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
That's right.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
When they tried to make that a rule that there was no shadowing allowed.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
And so everyone did it.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Everybody did it in protest.

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
And then how it actually became my goal every trip to have somebody kicked out.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And I did. Damn those Roseville kids.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I used to have a really slow laptop that I'd have Dex Drive hooked up to

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
that'd make custom DDR edits.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
My favorite contest that ever happened on this show was Loki's Make Edit Get Porn.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
That was the thing in the early episodes of OLR.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
He had a big box of porn that he gave away to some kid.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Whatever happened to that guy?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Some kid that made an edit.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
His life was forever changed.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, right.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Do you remember-

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
He was 18.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
When I say kid, I meant younger than me.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Do you remember the edit I made for Tengoku? Or .59?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah. It was like-

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Called Another.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
And it was all the background offbeat stuff.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Somebody actually passed it.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
I said, if anyone can pass this, I will buy you dinner.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And it was passed by-

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Was it Rick?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
No, no, no, no. Rick didn't pass it.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
It was passed by Bran of DDR Freak.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Ah.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
In Las Vegas.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Nice.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I didn't buy him dinner. He said it was okay.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
But he bought it and then said I was-

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
He beat it and then said I was evil.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
He used to love him.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
I remember we went to that Konami event thing and they were talking about all the different-

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
It was Metal Gear Solid 3. I think they were showing off Metal Gear Online or whatever.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
But I was more excited about the machine that they had there.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I was like, oh, I'll play that.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
You were the first non-Konami person in America to play Supernova.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah. And I had Naoki watching me.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
That was really awesome.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
That was definitely a moment of like, oh shit, this little show we started in the spare bedroom to extend our conversations.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
This is like a thing. It was a moment.

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
I remember I took the trip to San Diego to play Max when it was new.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
I was already in San Diego, but I made it a point I have to go to this arcade and I have to play Max.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
And so that was- They also had a 2DX sub stream at that mall.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Oh gosh. Good times.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
I would say one of my favorite memories, being a little self-referential here, but I don't care.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
Probably the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio that we did, because remember I lived in that house with a friend of mine from high school.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
And OLR was originally set up to have a very different tone because it was like every week was almost like a little bit of a house party,

23:56.000 --> 24:05.000
which is why it didn't last very long that way, where we had people in the background playing 2DX and passing songs and people would be in the other room playing DDR.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
And it was like, it really was every week like a celebration, especially in the early years.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
And that was just a lot of fun, just getting everybody together, even though the sound quality was such shit.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I remember-

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Going back and listening to it now.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I remember the amazing migraine I had.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Oh, that was awful.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
That's all I remember about that show is the migraine and the king of iron fingering.

24:25.000 --> 24:32.000
I remember from the very first show when you were- I actually think I have a clip of it.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh god, no.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I have a clip, because remember we used to do the teasers?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, but please don't play that because-

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
When OLR was the station?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Please, please, please, no.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Aww, why not?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Because I sounded stupid.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
No, you didn't. I thought it was hilarious.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Fine. I was trying to talk about the Tetsujin, which I meant the Iron Man thing, and it was-

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
No, no, it wasn't that. That's not the clip. This is a different clip anyway, so don't worry about that. It's not the iron fingering.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
That was a later episode, and I don't remember which one it was, but it is-

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I thought it was the first one.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
No, it was not the first one. The first one was this one.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh my god.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Okay, you ready? You ready to hear this?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
No.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
Wait for the sound quality here, and I'm gonna warn you guys. This is a 40-second clip. This is a commercial that used to be-

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
OLR was a station for a little while that had the highlight show every Sunday night. Here it is. A flashback for episode one.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Any arcade.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh yeah, baby.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
And many different arcades.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
She gets around.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I am such an arcade whore.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Mother, your child. Jamie will.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not gonna do your job, goddammit, I will.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Join us every Sunday night from seven o'clock until nine o'clock.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
See? The times change, but not much else has changed.

25:45.000 --> 25:54.000
You know, and now that I think about that, I don't want to be somebody else's child's parent, because I don't even have my own.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Why the fuck would I want somebody else's kids?

25:56.000 --> 26:04.000
That was when we were having, I was having to go around and tell people not to change their diapers on the keyboard mania, because that's fucking disgusting.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Why would you even have to do that? I mean, seriously.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
Because this is California and people are stupid and think that they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
That's a changing table, not a piano.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
No, because this is California and people feel like they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want to and it's fucking stupid.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Alright, how about, how about one more before we get into our game movies? One more.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It better not be the fingering.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
No, because you weren't here for episode two. This is episode two.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
That was when I was in the gay frat house.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I have no idea.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I was at 69.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
I knew, I knew what the episode one bumper was with that, but I have no idea what this one is.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
So, uh, this could be anything. This might be stupid for all I know. We'll see.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Who was the last person to put their coin up?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm going after that person. The hell with the rescue.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
A little, I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
When I, I got up there and said, I'm playing.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
Because this person put their token up. She starts talking about, no, he's mine, he's mine, I'm going to cut you.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm going to kill you in the face. I'll kill my mommy on you.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Where, where is your mother? Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you. Go away.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Mommy's on the corner. She's earning dinner money.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh, my. The views and opinions of Chris Conley and Julia.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
She's looking for daddy.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Join us every Sunday night from 7pm.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Once again, not much has changed. Loki making inappropriate jokes.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
She's on the corner making dinner money.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Good times. Good times.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
That actually reminded me of when I was at, um, Country Club Lanes.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
And the drunk guy tried to punch me and Dan got in a fight with him.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I don't remember that. Oh, my God.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
Yeah. I boycotted, uh, Country Club Lanes and went on a big tirade about them on DDR Freak.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Oh, my gosh.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
I remember going there, like, at midnight to play at three in the morning.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
Because they're open 24 hours a day and play DDR Fifth Mix because they have Fifth Mix.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
This is back when they still had the first one. The US first one.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh, yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
And, um, this little kid kept trying to get up on the pad while I was playing doubles, which is back in the day when I was playing doubles.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
And I was like, you're going to get hurt. You're going to get hurt.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
And so she runs off. Next thing I know, her daddy comes and says, what are you trying to hurt my kid?

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I was like, I was trying not to, dumbass, which is pretty much what I said.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
And he was drunk and he's like, well, I'm going to take a swing at you.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
And he did. And I blocked him and it hurt him, not me.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
And then Dan comes running in, getting all in his face, and the guy gets thrown out by off-duty cops.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
I love that here we are, episode 573, and it's the exact same thing as episode one, bitching about unsupervised children.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
You know what? If it wasn't such a big problem, we would have to complain about it.

28:52.000 --> 28:59.000
Bobby's saying that we should have, uh, you know, last week on whatever, you know, for all of our, um, podcasts.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
You know what we need is some sort of algorithm that it does it automatically. It may make no sense whatsoever, but it would still be funny.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
It just cuts a random clip out of the show, like who knows what.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah, or just sections.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Probably be me burping.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
We're about to get into, um, how was your gaming week, but Alan just walked into the studio. What's going on here, Alan?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Hello, I'm home early from work.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Hi, welcome home early. What is this you're carrying in your hands?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm about to give you a whole bunch of candy.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
Yay. Just what I need. Candy, candy. Oh my gosh.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
So somebody brought all their leftover Halloween candy to work. Good times.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
That's what I did.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Nice. Oh man, a Reese's peanut butter pumpkin. Those things are so good.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
Trick or treat. Oh, you know who likes these? Give these to Shane. Shane loves these.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah. All right.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Are those what I think they are?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Andy's mints.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I require two.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
The reason why I say give them to Shane because like he's like, Oh, the Olive Garden's awesome because they give you that mint at the end.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm like, you know, that's just an Andy's mint, right? Anyway, tell, tell him their Olive Garden mints.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
All right.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
These are the best things ever.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
I know, right?

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
I got rid of all of my candy at low cat and everybody was like, no, we don't want anymore.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh no, I told my, my, uh, we weren't the only ones who discovered that soul caliber could be played with a Sega Dreamcast fishing controller.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
I think we actually broke one of them when the two slammed together during a heated match.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
It still worked, but it doubled as baby rattle afterwards.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
This is what I was doing in college rather than studying.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
Now I'm going to let you in on something I was planning to create as my first Unity 2D project, the title Grammar or Death.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
At the start of the game, a poor stick figure is trapped in a dungeon tied to a chair.

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
The player must choose grammatically correct phrases from never ending series of multiple choice questions with continuously decreasing time limit.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
One wrong answer will result in a gruesome, gory death of the stick figure, complete with one of many loud screams.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Possibly con, uh, contributed to the game by one Rob Roberts.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
But I've decided to scrap all of that because after listening to last week's OLR or last, last week's OLR, whatever you like to call it.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
My idea, um, I now have a much better and more amusing idea.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And literally I will say it wasn't my idea.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
So thank you for that.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
I will say no more.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Now excuse me while I rub my hands together while gloating.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
All my love, Aaron Yyr.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Uh oh.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Uh oh.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Uh oh.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Budgie Ferret grammar.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't, what, what did we say last week?

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I said I wanted another dream game, but I don't remember what it was.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Oh no.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
We weren't here last week.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
This is last, last week.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah, because it was the rod caliber episode, which came up a couple shows ago.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
So, you know, some people catch up, they binge listen to OLR.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Like you binge watch chat rooms.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
We trust your memory cause we don't remember half the shit we do.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Tell, tell me what I said.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Um, I still, I like the grammar or death idea.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I think our soccer would have been all about that.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I'm all about that.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
No, too violent.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Too violent.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Well, cartoony death might be okay.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Like stick figure death is okay.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
That's okay.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So this is not too realistic.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Yyr, I love you.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
I want you to be my, my, uh, eternal, not soulmate.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
Are we getting the steam version of, uh, Budgie Ferret tossing?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Yeah.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Maybe, uh, maybe you need to postpone work on all these other games until we get Budgie

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
Ferret tossing on green light and we can, uh, unethically beg for upvotes.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Greetings, OLR.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, serious turtle.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
I was wondering if any of you had tried civilization beyond earth yet.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Rob, I'm looking at you.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Yes.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
At first glance at some let's play videos, it really looks like a reskinned Civ 5, but

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
worse.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Any thoughts?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
And on the topic of Forex games, Rob, have you tried Endless Legend yet?

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
It is unbelievably fun, beautiful, great music, cool stories, and actually adds a lot of new

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
concepts to the Forex gaming front.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
And the price is a nice change too.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I will look it up based on your recommendation.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Now is a really busy period, but I will, uh, especially with the price.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Rob is a busy bee.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Excuse me, the price is right.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
Um, well, things are going to come, like, everything kind of built up to this weekend

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
and once BlizzCon is done, then my calendar clears up, so you, excuse me, hiccups.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
Uh, I blame Jamie's, uh, stuff in the flask for that.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
But, um.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
My hooch.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Your hooch.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Um, but anyway, uh, I will check that out.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
As far as Beyond Earth, yeah, I mean, it's easy to compare it to Civ 5 because they look

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
the same because they're on the hex grid.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
But when you really get down to the nitty-gritty rules and the fact that, you know, the tech

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
tree isn't a tree, it's a web, that right there changes things.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And there's, you know, a bunch of other stuff that's different too.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
And the whole, um, harmony versus, what is it, like superiority and purity or something

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
like that.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Like that throws a whole other monkey wrench into how you win the game is completely different.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Rob's got a Civ boner.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Um, I actually, I'm going to be honest, and I said this last week on the show, I don't

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
think Beyond Earth is as strong as 5, but it's not bad at all.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
And I still think I'm enjoying Beyond Earth probably more than I ever enjoyed Civ 3, which

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
I never got into at all.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Like, that's the Civ people don't really talk about ever is Civ 3.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
So.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
All right.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
There's more to this email.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Jamie, have a taco on Rob tonight.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
No.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
No.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
I think I got that in one of those, like, bundles.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
I don't want to eat a taco on Rob.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
They had like Civ 3 for like a buck ninety-nine points.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't know if he's clean.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Loki, I'm pretty excited about GTA 5 for PC in January, but be honest with me.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Will the use of the N-word ruin the game for me?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm pretty sensitive to cursing in games.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
No.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
It's, it's not, it's really not that bad.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
I mean, cause you're only, it's really, it's really only, uh, Franklin's friend that just

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
keeps, you know, you know, he just keeps using that over and over because that's the character.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean, and it's funny though.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Actually that, that guy that did the voice acting for that, he does, there's a car commercial,

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
like a, a local used car commercial that you can find him doing that for.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
And it's hilarious.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
He's just like, he's exactly like his character.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Um, but no, it, the language in the game is not that bad actually.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It's, it's pretty, pretty tame.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It's not, it's not like San Andreas.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Okay.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Oh, sorry.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
If you can watch a movie that has course language, then course.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
I like that.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah, it's course.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It's like sandpaper.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
Like me when I get upset, except that's not a word I would use, but I'll use words that

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
start with F.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I'm going to use course all the time.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's all about Trevor anyways.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Trevor is awesome.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Seriously.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
Can I finish reading this email?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Yup.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
OLR as always, I love the show.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
Look forward to the podcast every Monday minus the cursing.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
I guess the content and opinions more than make up for it.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I'm really effing sorry about my mouth.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You know what?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Language only has power.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
If you give it power, you probably like the Bobby black Wolf show.

35:45.000 --> 35:53.000
I, you know, I don't, I, I respect that some individuals prefer not to use that language,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
so that's, that's fine.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.000
Just bear with me cause I was raised differently, so sometimes I let them fly.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Yeah.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
I just remember the one day that I nearly dropped my mouth open when my mom said one

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
day I'd end up up shit Creek.

36:10.000 --> 36:17.000
I was like, mom, since then has been just the one time she ever cursed in front of me

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
while I was a kid.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I was like, wow, mom.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Congratulations on.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Okay.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
This one comes from hit Stan.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Um, congratulations on your new high score.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I have a question.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
When you return to a familiar music game, what kinds of music do you play on?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Do you go back to license songs or old video game tunes?

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
You know, do you try to full combo and easy song or challenge the games?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Infinitely heart songs right away.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
I normally look for Prague rock with fast patterns and tempo changes.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
It's hard to read those note charts, but conquering that makes me, excuse me.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I have hiccups makes me feel like a boss.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I would like to not have hiccups.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Hi.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I gave them to you.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Coffee flavored hiccups.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Um, I usually just go back and do the ones that were the most fun to me, even if I get

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
past them.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
If I'm playing a new game, like, um, an example I could give is that I actually was playing

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Hatsune Miku on PS3 cause it was on sale a couple of weeks ago while I was at fan fest.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
So that actually was like a new to me anyway, music game that I was playing.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
And I just would listen to a little previews and usually I tend to, uh, uh, drift towards

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
a trancy songs in that game.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And I wish I could remember the name of that one song.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
There's one song in there.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
There's one song in there I really, really liked.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
It's kind of trancy.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
It's one of the other characters.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
It's not Hatsune Miku, but I love that you can put the other characters in the video,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
including the men.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
So they can do all these very like, you know, uh, female oriented motions or, and he can

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
do vice versa.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
You can have females do the guy parts and it's fun.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I think I just had something really offensive in chat.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Did you?

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I want to say the song was called die, but D Y E I think it was the song I liked.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Ciel said Rob needs Jesus.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
You're nasty.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
You saw what I said.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yes, I did.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm not repeating it on the air.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
All right.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
That's why I don't finish the email.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Was that, was that?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
No, there's more.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Okay.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Remember even when the given choices suck, there's always another option.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Vote for Hollick.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
This email is brought to you by Columbus, Ohio, home of the never ending freeway construction.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
I've been listening to OLR since the to go edition in October 9th, uh, October, 2005.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And it always helps me pass the time on my commute every week.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Keep on going until you break the counter.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Oh, that was sweet.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
That is, that is a long time to be listening stuff too.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Last email.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Yay.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Last email.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Hi folks.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
It's the rage nator.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
I thought I'd send a quick email to ask a question and to impart some info.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
First things first, the info for those who are PC gamers via via steam origin, et cetera.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
I found a site that aggregates news about game giveaways.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Here is the link and it's, um, actually at, uh, epic bundle.com.

38:51.000 --> 38:59.000
Um, it's a much longer link, but I think you can get there just by going from epic bundle.com and I'm not getting struck by lightning because I'm a good Jewish girl.

38:59.000 --> 39:08.000
Um, if you take a look at, uh, if you take a look at the page, two thirds of the way down the page, there's a yellowish newsfeed box that's regularly updated.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I suggest keeping an eye on this.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Now, considering that Halloween was two days ago, I thought I'd pose this question.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
What classic games do you traditionally like to play around Halloween?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
There's a Halloween feel to it.

39:19.000 --> 39:26.000
Personally, let's play super ghouls and ghosts, Castlevania one and four, medieval nightmare creatures, frozen evil one through three and hexen.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
It's actually funny.

39:27.000 --> 39:34.000
We had, um, Dan just put on like all of the, uh, uh, Makamura music.

39:34.000 --> 39:43.000
The Daimakaimura music, cause that's really the best, but he had like different iterations from different systems and then, uh, played some Castlevania music for all the kids come into the door.

39:43.000 --> 39:57.000
And, but, um, honestly, uh, I like to play like really bad scary games, like the nightmare on a little street game, which is laughably stupid and the Friday the 13th game, which is also laughably stupid.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
And, uh, I kind of liked Friday the 13th on NES.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, that was laughable.

40:03.000 --> 40:10.000
Um, I don't, I mean, keep in mind, I've had a very different Halloween tradition for about the past 16 years.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
So I don't really have a video game related tradition.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
Um, I will be looking to start one soon, I guess. I don't know.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I sadly, I can't really answer this question.

40:20.000 --> 40:29.000
I mean, I play scary video games whenever, well, I don't like to play them a lot because, you know, my heart can only take so much and I get scared really easily.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Have you played Among the Sleep yet?

40:30.000 --> 40:43.000
No, but I was gifted by a kind, generous listener named ActDeft a copy of Five Nights at Freddy's saying, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, you should stream this sometime.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
And I'm like, I'm, I want to say thank you for your kindness.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm afraid of getting that game.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
I want to say thank you for your kindness and generosity and thinking of me.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
But on the other hand, I want to say, fuck you.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
You know what?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Sorry to the guy who doesn't like story.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You know what? I think that would make an awesome movie.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
What, Five Nights at Freddy's?

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Yeah.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
You know the sequel's already-

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Oh yeah, already greenlit.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yep.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It didn't need a campaign to make that happen.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
And I'll tell you, people are already cosplaying. It's crazy.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
That's just furries looking for an excuse.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
No, no, no, no. That's-

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
No disrespect.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
That's all the Rocket Raccoon cosplay.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Or, does Groot count, maybe?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Alright.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
That'd be more leafies.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Woodies.

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
Woodies. Yeah, that's what I'm going to call plant cosplay woodies.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
So that's it.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Alright.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
That's it for the mailbag.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
If you want to participate in a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

41:56.000 --> 42:06.000
FU to the ongoing pain in my left ear.

42:06.000 --> 42:14.000
It's not like a deep ear infection. I actually did go to the doctor, but it's like, when you press on one part of it, it hurts.

42:14.000 --> 42:23.000
And it's not as bad as it was, but when I yawn or open my mouth, because it feels kind of like TMJ, except it pulls on my ear and makes my ear hurt.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
So when I turn my head a certain way, it hurts.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I've been getting headaches because of it.

42:29.000 --> 42:39.000
My doctor gave me ear drops. He said that the eardrum looks fine. I didn't have an infection, but it looks really red and horrible in there.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And I work on the photos.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
Which is why many people are ever going to find out where I work.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Except for the people that I've actually told.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
And no, I'm not pressing on it, but sometimes I roll over and lean on things.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
It was hurting on my pillow. That's how bad it was.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
FU number two to the manic panic that only took on a little bit of my hair.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
That means I have to re-dye my ends, which I was going for red and purple.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
And I had another FU, but fuck it.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Alright, Loki.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
I guess FU two, this headache that hasn't gone away and I've been taken since and stuff for it just doesn't seem to go.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
But, I'm actually going to use this for another thing.

43:19.000 --> 43:28.000
I wanted to mention that if you are interested in Five Nights at Freddy's, that they do have it as part of the Halloween Humble Bundle.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
You pay over the average, which as of right now is $5.32.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
You get it.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Along with a bunch of other games.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
That's good for another three days.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
Alright, my FU of the week goes to I'm With You, headaches, because I had a really bad one at a really, really, really bad time.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
And yeah, FU to headaches, that's for sure.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
FU to panic attacks.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I'm pretty sure I had another one of those in the past week.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
That's no fun.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
And then FU to being thrown under the bus.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.

44:09.000 --> 44:16.000
Let's move on with some more gaming news while I figure out why the oven won't stop beeping.

44:16.000 --> 44:24.000
Because it's completely possessed by Satan.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Satan, yes.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I don't believe in Satan.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
So this is kind of cool, we talked about this a little bit.

44:30.000 --> 44:38.000
That there was this lawsuit from Manuel Noriega who was attempting to sue Activision because of his portrayal in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

44:38.000 --> 44:47.000
You know, being portrayed as some sort of dictator and an all-around bad guy.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Kidnapped murderer, enemy of the state type thing.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Well, kind of is that.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
But anyways, the lawsuit has been dismissed.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
So, too bad, so sad.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
You don't get any money.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
But, I don't know.

45:07.000 --> 45:17.000
It's interesting, actually it was funny because me not following politics or anything, I had no idea that the character in the game was actually a real person.

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
Because they make up a lot of fictional villains in these games, so it's hard to tell them apart.

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
It's okay, you were pretty young in the 80s and I think that guy was all, his name was all over the place, you know.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
So, I forgot about that lawsuit though until you brought it back up.

45:37.000 --> 45:44.000
Anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
And that has to do with the second chance at a game you might have missed.

45:48.000 --> 45:55.000
Valkyria Chronicles was a Playstation 3 game, which I don't think a lot of people really checked out.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
Because it didn't really come up on a lot of people's radars, but it was a pretty good tactical game.

46:00.000 --> 46:11.000
It's getting a second chance on the PC, which is interesting seeing more and more of these companies put out titles that were once on console, like I know Square has been doing this a lot lately too, on PC.

46:11.000 --> 46:21.000
So, Valkyria Chronicles will be coming out on PC on November 11th for $20 or 20 Euros depending on where your region is.

46:22.000 --> 46:31.000
This is also interesting. You get, I think there was some DLC that was included as well, although that's not in this particular story I'm looking at.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
I'm assuming that's, you know, everything together. You can find some deals on the internet, by the way.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Some sites are offering it for $13.86 or $14.99, so just look around.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
So, there you go. That's a pretty darn good deal for a game I think a lot of folks might have missed, Valkyria Chronicles.

46:47.000 --> 46:55.000
I only played a little bit of it. I think Alan owned the game, so I played a little bit of it, but unfortunately didn't get into it too much and I certainly didn't beat it.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
It's just one of those games where probably some MMO got in the way and I never did end up beating it.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Alright, anyway, we are going to open up Skype line. It is that time. Let's take some calls.

47:04.000 --> 47:13.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to call and participate with our program on whatever topic you'd like to bring up.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
Or maybe there's something we didn't get to tonight that you want to bring up. Perhaps a game that you've been playing that you want to review or something along those lines.

47:21.000 --> 47:28.000
Looking quickly at our Twitter over at Twitter.com slash OLR, Dark Tetsuya tweeted us during the show here saying,

47:28.000 --> 47:36.000
Try as I might to locate the Orange Bats DDR routine on YouTube. I'm afraid the search has ended in failure, Frowny.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
Don't worry, I'm sure DarkSakura is probably rejoicing a little bit for that. Alright.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I actually have it on a desk somewhere in my house.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
Do you really? You should bring that up. Anyway, we're going to go to the phones. We have a call coming in.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Hey, how are you doing? It's me, Pau here.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
Hey, Pau. Wow, I don't think you've called into the show before and we see you. How are you doing?

47:58.000 --> 48:06.000
Pretty good. I've been just thinking about calling, not calling for almost three, four weeks, but I wasn't really sure and I decided to do it.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Where are you from, Pau?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I was born in Spain.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Oh, okay. Where do you live now? In the States? Canada?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, I'm in California now.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh, you're in California. What part?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Yeah, Palm Springs.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
Okay, Palm Springs. Oh, that's where all the fun parties happen. Alright.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
All my neighbors are like 70s, so super quiet.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
There's a lot of old people in Palm Springs, quite a few.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy? You made the decision to call into the show. Glad you did. What's up?

48:35.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah, I was wondering with so many games coming out and with just so many releases at the same time, I was wondering for you guys so far, what was the biggest surprise of the year?

48:47.000 --> 48:54.000
Like, which game? You were not really sure and then you realized that you just can't stop playing it.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Ooh, this is a tricky question to get put on the spot with. Alright, let's see. Do you guys have an answer for Pau's question?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
And I invite the chat room to answer this too.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Sure, put it off on everyone else, Rob.

49:06.000 --> 49:16.000
Well, no, it seems like Pau is taking a poll. I don't know if he's trying to catch up on some games that he might have missed, but what are some games this year that surprised you?

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I started playing Off this year. I was surprised at how good it was.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Off?

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
Off. You play as the batter and you're an avatar and you have to go on this holy adventure, but you walk around with a bat.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
It's a weird French game and it's got a translation out. That and I did expect to love Hataful Boyfriend as much as I do.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
There you go, Hataful Boyfriend. Loki, anything you can think of?

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
Sadly, most of the surprises this year have been games that have been a lot more terrible than I thought they were going to be.

49:45.000 --> 49:56.000
You know, like, I guess Watch Dogs wasn't as good as I had hoped. Elder Scrolls Online, at least based off the beta, wasn't that great?

49:56.000 --> 50:04.000
I would say that probably in the positive, maybe, I was surprised, I haven't played it yet, but Far Cry 4 looks really good.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
I wasn't expecting it at Far Cry 4 this year and, I mean, that looks pretty fantastic.

50:08.000 --> 50:19.000
So, they'll be coming out in just a couple weeks here and, I don't know, Destiny's kind of okay, I guess.

50:20.000 --> 50:28.000
I don't know, Sunset Overdrive, I guess, would be a good surprise. Once again, I haven't played that.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
Call of Duty, I was kind of expecting to be good, so that wasn't really much of a surprise.

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
I don't know, maybe Bayonetta 2? I mean, I haven't played that, but it looks good.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
I'm having a hard time thinking of stuff that was out this year that's not, like, obvious.

50:43.000 --> 50:50.000
Like, I could say, oh, the Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 4, because that turned out really, really well, but I feel like that's kind of a cop-out answer.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
Or I could say the Diablo 3 expansion. The Diablo 3 expansion, because it fixed all the problems of the game.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
How about Shovel Knight?

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
I was going to say Shovel Knight! You cut me off! Damn you! He took my answer. Shovel Knight.

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
Shovel Knight was really fun, I played it. For me, I think it was probably Bayonetta 2.

51:10.000 --> 51:17.000
I was cautiously optimistic, because when that game has that kind of, you know, now get cancelled and then goes back again.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
I was cautiously optimistic, but I just played and I just had so much fun.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
I cannot remember the last time that I played a game and I genuinely loved what I was playing.

51:30.000 --> 51:40.000
From the first second, when she just says, well, I just need some shoes that don't have guns on them, the lines were so ridiculous, but so good.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
The controls were improved, the camera was improved, so I think it just improved everything on the original.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Even the online mode worked good, I mean.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
I don't know about you, but I just laugh and laugh and laugh playing that game, because it's so over-the-top.

51:53.000 --> 52:00.000
Even from the very beginning, in the opening sequence with the New York City Christmas, it's just so over-the-top.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
I can't help it. I always scream laughing at some stuff. You know what that is, when you start screaming laughing.

52:06.000 --> 52:16.000
I think it's also just so hard and so refreshing to see a feminine character that at the same time is really feminine, but at the same time is extremely aggressive.

52:16.000 --> 52:30.000
I think it's really challenging sometimes to write, so I thought they showed them making off to promote the game, and it was really clear that it was written with a girl developer.

52:30.000 --> 52:40.000
I just think the mix was just really, really good. I thought the writing was just really, really funny. Even the online mode worked great.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm looking at our chat room to see if there's some votes in there.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
Dungeon Buster says Alien Isolation is good if you're an Alien fan. I've heard that's a good, scary game, too.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
A lot of folks are telling me to play that one and stream it to watch me pee my pants live.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
Let's see, some folks in the chat room, a couple of people saying Wolfenstein was really fun.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Yeah, I heard that was really good.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
I've heard that, too. I haven't played it myself, but I have a friend-

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
I feel like Downsize the Hero is really short. That's why I didn't buy it, but I do want to buy it.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
That's a really good feedback.

53:09.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, I sort of go, oh, it's another reimagining of this game that had its limelight back in the 90s, but apparently it is really good.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
Well, you may remember, they have re-released- not re-released it, but tried reimagining it a few times now.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
So, I don't know. It's not entirely new.

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
All right. Well, there you go, pal. There are some of our suggestions here from the chatters and us in the studio.

53:31.000 --> 53:37.000
All right. Well, thank you for having me, and I hope that Dark Sakura gets better with her ear issues.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
I have some chronic issues on my left one, so I understand her pain.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Thank you. I appreciate that. It's thankfully getting better.

53:45.000 --> 53:52.000
Just, I thought that it was completely better today, so I went without my medication, and IKEA ruined me.

53:52.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh, and my recommendation is if you can avoid it and don't use good headphones like this one, because I have chronic problems.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
They always make it better if it's painful.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
I have to use the work headphones, but other than that, I don't really use them, so yeah. But thank you.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
All right. Well, thank you for having me.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
Healing vibes to you both. Take care. Anytime, pal. Don't be a stranger.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Bye. Bye.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
I always like hearing from new people here on Orange Laundry. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love our serial collars as well.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Is that his icon? His icon looks like him.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Yeah, I think that was a little me. Let me bring that up again here.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Oh, that's cool.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
So, you can see that there.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh, yeah. That looks just like him. Well done.

54:28.000 --> 54:36.000
No, I like when people do avatars with preset stuff, and they actually get it to look like them. Like, mine looks like me, I think.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Do you think my me looks like me?

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
Yeah. He's got your weird, you know, nose. I'm kidding.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
My weird nose?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
I like your weird nose. It's very Dutch.

54:45.000 --> 54:53.000
Do you know that when, just to see, do you know that when I was born, apparently, when I, you know, came from the place that babies come from.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
When you squelched forward.

54:55.000 --> 55:03.000
The first thing my mom said was, he has the blank her maiden name. He has the blank nose.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
Dan has the family nose. I think it's really a Dutch thing, you know?

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Might be, might be. Let's get to some more calls. Skype's lighting up tonight, but we have time to get a few more in here.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Hey, Akdeft. How you doing, buddy?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Really good, really good.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
What's in your mind?

55:22.000 --> 55:34.000
Well, since you brought Steam during most of some of the show, I also wanted to talk about something Steam did recently.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Oh, sure. What's that?

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
They changed the currency in Mexico to pesos.

55:40.000 --> 55:51.000
I had seen you tweeting about this. So, since a lot of our listeners probably don't have that perspective from not living in Mexico, tell us about, like, what this change is and what it means.

55:51.000 --> 56:06.000
Well, some background first. And I have said this before on the show, that most of the games here sold on stores and that stuff cost way more than they cost in the United States.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Right.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
Basically because of conversion and import fees and taxes and all that stuff, all that good stuff.

56:13.000 --> 56:20.000
Well, it's just like here if you want to buy a game that was released in Japan, we pay a shit ton of extra money for that.

56:20.000 --> 56:33.000
Yeah, basically, but at least that's a real import, but like the stuff that was released in the United States or in America, basically, it costs a lot.

56:33.000 --> 56:42.000
Only a few companies like Microsoft and sometimes Sony do match price, at least don't go a higher price.

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
Nintendo stuff here sells a really high price.

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
Yikes. So, what did Steam do to help this get better?

56:52.000 --> 57:08.000
First, a lot of people, including me, thought that Steam was going to turn for the worse, that they were going to charge high prices or they weren't going to be at least that affordable, maybe.

57:08.000 --> 57:23.000
But they came and it actually surprised me a lot because not a lot. Most of the games, like 99% of the games, cost way cheaper than the United States prices.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Wow, interesting.

57:26.000 --> 57:45.000
Like, for example, Civilization Beyond Earth, it costs $50 on Steam in the United States. Here it costs 440 pesos. In the conversion, it's more or less like $40.

57:45.000 --> 57:52.000
Well, that's not fair. I'm opening up a Mexican account and I'm going to buy all my games with pesos. It's no fair.

57:53.000 --> 58:06.000
Everyone should do that. And it's something curious because it's not only here that happens. It's also on places like Russia and I think Brazil also have cheaper prices than the United States.

58:06.000 --> 58:18.000
That's something that, and I didn't know this until a few months ago, that a lot of people buy from Russians or people on other places just to buy cheaper.

58:18.000 --> 58:29.000
I have heard of this before. In fact, I think this is how friends I know got cheap copies of Mass Effect 3 was like Russian keys or something like that from doing it that way.

58:29.000 --> 58:38.000
And then I like how I'm talking about getting cheaper games. I'm sure my friends over in the UK are like, shut up, because everything's more expensive over there.

58:39.000 --> 58:53.000
Do you think that maybe part of Steam wanting to start accepting the pesos in the community and so forth is to try and foster more of the trading card and the marketplace?

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
Did that all recently open up for you guys too? Because I'm wondering if that might be a motive.

58:58.000 --> 59:15.000
No, no, that's something we have always had. Even the market, I could sell the cards or even items from like Pink Fortress 2 and we got the amount in dollars, but now I get pesos.

59:15.000 --> 59:25.000
But that's something that we always have done. It's not something that is region locked. Something really curious though, especially carrying to the market.

59:26.000 --> 59:45.000
Like for example, you can now pay, not like credit, but it's something that you purchase the game on Steam, but you don't necessarily have to use a credit card or a gift card for example.

59:45.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You need to go to a convenience store like 7-Eleven just to make an example. We have a convenience store called Oxo. Oxos are everywhere. You can go to every corner and you can find one.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So you can basically go there and pay your game and that's it. So yeah, it's really convenient too for people that don't have a credit card or even a PayPal account. So you can basically just go to the store and pay for your game and that's it.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Interesting. Well, thank you for giving us a little insight as to how it works in other countries because sometimes we are very blinded by what we've got here locally. It's always interesting to hear what goes on in other countries.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And having to deal with the conversions, but not anymore on Steam and now you're getting the better end of the deal.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Alright, enjoy it while it lasts.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Hopefully it never ends.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Alright, well take care my friend and we'll let you go to get some more calls.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Okay, looking forward to you playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Alright, bye my friend.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Bye.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Alright, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Alan's the best, he just brought me pizza. He's so cool.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Alan can bring me pizza.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Alright.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Alan, pizza.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Or 1877 game OLR.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Yeah, you had a burrito.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I can tease if I want to Rob.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's your party and you'll tease if you want to.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Uh, that sounded wrong.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Alright, well let's get to the phones. It's lighting up tonight, oh my gosh.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's the one and only Rama.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I see you Rama. Uh oh, what's in the glass?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Uh, it's a little bit of rum and coke.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Good times.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I was going to ask if you were drinking antifreeze.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Not as good as the hooch I had.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No, I'm drinking in honor of a good friend, so.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Alright, well I'll drink to them too.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Good, good, good.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Alright, what's on your mind my friend?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Well, first of all I want to second act deaf and yeah, you have to do a live stream of Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I don't like peer pressure, but I do like this pizza.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Rob, I will watch you play, I will come over while you play Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Will you hold my hand?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I will hold your hand.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yay.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And then I will fucking laugh my ass off.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Wow, Jamie, you're a good friend.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm the best.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I know, right?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
We'll see, after Blizzcon, after Blizzcon.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh, don't even get me started off at Blizzcon. I got a friend of mine, she's going nuts with her cosplay, getting it done for Blizzcon.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm like, that's not...

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Is this our same friend?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
No, different friend.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Okay.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Rob is popular, he has lots of friends.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
By the way, did you see Kayla's costume?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Yes, I did.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The disciple?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
That was fucking gorgeous.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Everyone needs to not give her a hard time for doing Homestuck cosplay.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000
We give everybody shit for every single cosplay that they do.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's just, but I do understand where you're coming from though.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I do understand though.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Alright, so what's on your mind tonight? Is it just to peer pressure me into live streaming, or is it something else?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Well, that too, but I called in to say congratulations for hitting episode 573.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Thank you, I realize you understand what that means.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Yeah, and then when you were talking earlier about how you got into the Bimani scene, and so I started thinking about how I got into it.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And then I remember that one phone call where... Can I remember her name?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
She was on the show, Jason's old lady, and I said if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have...

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Well, what about you guys? You gave her shit for that, and I do remember that.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I remember that as well, yes, yes.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And I think about that, I'm like, well, to be perfectly honest, if it wasn't for my last girlfriend who I was with 10 years back,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I never would have known about all of this, because I go to the con, and I'm like, I see this dance pad sitting here, and I'm like, what the hell is this?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And I step on it, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, I walk away, and then at the time I'm flirting with her, she's like, do you play DDR?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I'm like, what's that? And she's like, well, does she describe what it is? I'm like, yes, I do play DDR!

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, where the fuck am I going to find an arcade machine so I can play so I don't know exactly what I'm doing?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
That is, that is funny. Well, you know, we always say at the end of every episode, tell a friend about the show, and it works!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
We would not have Rama if somebody was not telling a friend about the show. There's a reason we do it.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Mm-hmm, got that right.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the congrats for episode 573, I appreciate that very much.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Hey, I'm going to put you on the spot, because we asked earlier, everybody, if you had to pick one song licensed, well, the two, one licensed, one unlicensed,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
best Bamani song ever licensed and unlicensed.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Okay, I did answer that, but I had two answers, but they're both licensed titles, so can I give them?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I don't know, judges?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Sure, I'll allow it.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:24.000
The first song is My Sweet Darling by Wildside, because that song was so catchy and so awesome, so I went looking to find the full version of the song.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Come to find out, it's a cover by a J-pop artist by the name of Yida Hitomi, who is one of my favorite artists, I listen to her albums on a regular basis.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Nice.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And my number two song is Tiggy Freckles, because when I first heard this song, I'm like, why does it sound familiar to me?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And I'm like, I know this song from somewhere, and then out of the blue, I just happen to be watching Kenshin, and I'm just like, this song, oh my God, it's a cover of Sobokazu by Moroni Kenshin.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I know that song as the song that makes it really easy to get max 300.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Well, then you remember how I would sing it while playing, but I only knew the Japanese lyrics, so I'd be like, I still to this day don't know the English lyrics to it, because I still run through the really high-pitched Japanese vocals in my head.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
What am I gonna do when I get, something like that.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You'll find that someone has taken the English soul and just remixed it to Kenshin, I think it's pretty cool.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh my gosh.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Alright, well Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks as always for the call.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Hey, no problem.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Listen to Anime Jam Session, but oh, not this week, you guys are on repeat this week, right?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000
No, we recorded an episode at Zenkai Con, so we'll be putting that in with some extra songs, and you know, we're gonna keep it fresh for everyone.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
That's it, so it's taped in advance, but still, it's live, not live from a convention.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Alright, check it out.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Alright, thanks my friend, take care.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
You too, and instead of staying black, stay fabulous.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I always will, and I snap, and glitter has exploded everywhere.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Pao and I need to talk.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Have a good one.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
By the way.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
What?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Pao and I need to talk, because once the live-action Kenshin movie, with English subtitles, I know where to find it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You know where to find it, alright.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Anyway, we are way past time tonight, we gotta wrap up, because, you know, tonight's a school night.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
So, I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through on Skype, please consider sending us an email.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTradia.com, but be prepared to be put on the spot.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:42.000
If you're emailing us to talk about episode 573, be prepared to answer the question about your favorite licensed and non-licensed, and you can only pick one.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
We are not waiving it for anybody else.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Dark Sakura was being very kind and generous to Rama.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Anyhow.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Just keep, I am stacking up lots of favors that I'm going to redeem in the form of a ticket to New York, and a place to crash.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Maybe you can cash that one in for, like, an authentic taco from New York City.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Oh, I'm already doing big, big favors.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
That thing I told you I'm working on?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Oh yeah, right, right, right.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Oh yeah.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
There you go.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Cash those checks, girl.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Cash those checks.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I save them up.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Let me just quickly check in with Loki for any quick last minute headlines here, before we sign out.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Last minute headline, I'm on level 1,964 clicker heroes.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Oh god, I forgot to try that game, that's probably a good thing.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Don't try it.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I won't.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It's pointless.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I don't know why I'm still playing this, just for no reason.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Because you have problems.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I do have problems.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Because I also don't have to look at the screen to play it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It plays itself.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
It plays itself.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Just like cookie clickers.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Alright, well then that being said, we are going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Hey, thank you guys for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It was a very diverse episode tonight.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:02.000
We had some good old fashioned debate and we had some good old fashioned memories looking back on some of the great foundations of where our show came from.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
What's that?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I was reminding you that we have a special cookie tonight.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I still have to bring it up.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But that's just for the live listeners.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The podcasters sadly don't get that part.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Because that's where we play things that don't necessarily belong to us.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So anyway, thank you guys very much for listening to the show and supporting independent podcasting.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Remember, if you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, then support another show.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
But if you did like Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five or fifty about the program.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Who knows?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You might know the next Rama.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Just like somebody referred Rama to this show.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
You might know them.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and keep this the place where every gamer has a voice.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And where we can engage in a lively debate respectfully.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I think that's one thing I really like about what we've been able to do here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That's my thought.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So let me go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'll start with my actual final thought, which would be this pizza is delicious.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Nom nom nom.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Reject false icons.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Oh, look at you going for a classic there.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
My final thought is I am done playing cookie cooker today.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Sure, you say that now.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Well, I'm level two thousand one, so I should be good enough.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
How many of the achievements have we gotten?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Eighty four percent.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
It's not a hundred percent.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
All right.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We will be back next week.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Podcasters, you don't have to do anything different.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
The show will show up on the feed just like you're used to.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Live listeners, keep in mind, we may be a little bit delayed.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Stay tuned to our Twitter for updates.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And Bobby Black Wolf will also provide updates live at VOG.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
But I will be literally walking in the door.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
This also means that next week's episode will be produced by Loki.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
This will be interesting.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
It won't be. It'll be just like it normally is.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
He pretty much gives me three quarters of the stories that go on the show anyway.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So it'll be just like any other week at OLR.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So we will see you next week.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I'll be back to talk BlizzCon.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Those of you that will be in Anaheim on Thursday,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I hope to see you at World of Podcasts.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Have a good night everybody. See you next week.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
