17320	20060	aplenty, assuming what you want will actually be in stock.
20060	23500	Enjoy the splendor of the season and join us for the next few hours of news, your comments
23500	30500	and more, right here on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
30500	34540	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34540	36300	where every gamer has a voice.
36300	44340	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 30th of 2014 with the 577th episode of
44340	45620	our show.
45620	50100	I hope those of you in the states had a wonderful thanksgiving, thanks for joining us either
50100	53940	the Sunday after if you happen to be here live, or the week after if you happen to be
53940	58140	listening to us in the car, on your commute, at your desk at work, or however it is that
58140	60300	you consume Orange Lounge Radio each week.
60300	61940	Thank you guys so much for listening.
61940	66140	We will be talking about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, probably food
66140	69240	and random tangents as well over the next few hours.
69240	73140	My name is Rob Roberts here in studio, also known as Skie, where you can find me on Twitter
73140	75660	S-K-I-E, joining me as always.
75660	78900	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
78900	79900	Hi.
79900	80900	How are you?
80900	81900	Um, alright.
81900	82900	Yeah?
82900	83900	Did you have a good thanksgiving?
83900	84900	It was very chill.
84900	85900	It was awesome.
85900	86900	Yeah, that's it.
86900	88020	It didn't involve going to anybody's house.
88020	89020	Yeah.
89020	90020	Or family drama.
90020	91020	Mm-hmm.
91020	92020	Or drama at all.
92020	93020	Right.
93020	94220	It involved me, Dan, the cat, and turkey sandwiches.
94220	95220	No, I hear you.
95220	96220	You know what?
96220	101140	Thanksgiving was just me, Alan, and my parents, and that is totally cool because no more family
101140	106320	dramas and it's, we go out to a restaurant now, we don't even cook or any of that.
106320	109260	My parents are too old to cook and I'm not going to subject anybody to my cooking.
109300	110300	And it was great.
110300	116020	We just got a little turkey roast and roasted it, chopped it up, put it on some bread, threw
116020	117620	on some cranberry sauce.
117620	118620	Yum.
118620	119620	Called it good.
119620	120620	See, I told you it would be about food tonight.
120620	123980	But, I mean, Thanksgiving, it's like we have a holiday to worship food in the state.
123980	126740	I guess there's other stuff, history, but it's food.
126740	130980	Let's celebrate giving an entire indigenous population diseases.
130980	131980	Right.
131980	132980	With turkey.
132980	133980	Anyway.
134580	140000	Also yesterday was Dan's birthday, so I got a Boston cream pie because he said don't get
140000	146880	me a cake, but I didn't want to get pie, so I got the true essence of cake pie, Boston
146880	147880	cream pie.
147880	148880	Well, there you go.
148880	151220	Well, happy birthday, Dan, even though he doesn't listen to this show, but I know that's
151220	154500	why you were out last week because the family had thrown him a party or something, right?
154500	160660	We went to Chicago Fire and ate pizza and it was a maze.
160660	161660	Pizza is a maze.
161660	162660	You know what?
162660	163660	Stuffed gross pizza.
163660	164660	Uh huh.
164660	165660	Pretty damn good.
165660	166660	Pretty damn good.
166660	167660	Also pretty damn good.
167660	169460	Also eating pizza on tonight's program.
169460	170660	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
170660	172780	Yeah, I'm not eating Chicago Fire pizza.
172780	173780	I know.
173780	174780	Nothing that fancy here at OLR.
174780	175780	Oh, no.
175780	176780	I'm sorry.
176780	177780	Fancy?
177780	182500	If you meant by fancy, terrible, then yes, that would be an accurate description of Chicago
182500	183500	Fire's pizza.
183500	185940	Now, I realize we are a worldwide show.
185940	189460	We are fortunate to have listeners in countries all over the world and all across America,
189460	193980	so not everybody may be familiar with this chain round table, but I consider them to
193980	195740	be on the higher end of pizza chains.
195740	198900	They're also on the higher end of prices.
198900	201900	I kind of think you get what you pay for with them.
201900	202960	The pizza's pretty good.
202960	205060	It's way better than like fricking Papa John's or something.
205060	206060	Sorry.
206060	207860	The stuffed gross pizza is actually pretty good.
207860	210020	The garlicky, chickeny one.
210020	212300	Chicago Fire is like a restaurant pizza.
212300	213460	That's even a step above.
213460	214460	That's where you got to get a booth.
214460	215460	I don't like their pizzas.
215460	216460	I really don't.
216460	217460	I hate their pizzas.
217460	220740	Because I've had several different types of their pizzas and everyone like swears by
220740	222780	them and I just, I can't understand.
222780	225180	Now on the other hand though, their garlic fries are fucking awesome.
225180	226660	That is right.
226660	230040	So their garlic fries, props to them that, who would have thought that a pizza place
230040	232660	had you know, bitchin' garlic fries.
232660	234180	The pesto strips are pretty good too.
234180	237980	I love how it's the Thanksgiving episode of Orange Laundry or the post Thanksgiving episode
237980	239280	I suppose of Orange Laundry.
239280	242140	And here we are talking about pizza.
242140	244700	I think I already know the answer to this, but I will.
244700	245700	America.
245740	248420	I think I know the answer to this here in studio, but I'll pose the question anyway
248420	250980	and I'll ask it to you guys in our chat room as well.
250980	254180	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern
254180	258460	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and you can participate with our show by heading
258460	264260	over to live.vognetwork.com and you can join the chat room and we read comments on the
264260	269260	air and take your questions and so forth as the show is going on.
269260	273420	We usually tape right after the Bobby Blackwell show, however he had the night off, partially
273420	276400	due to the holiday, partially due to football.
276400	280120	So Bobby was off tonight, but he'll be back next week.
280120	285580	So asking you guys, did you do anything for Black Friday?
285580	286960	I went to work.
286960	287960	Did you?
287960	288960	You had to work on Black Friday?
288960	290580	Well, I guess a lot of people do.
290580	295140	I normally work on Fridays, so I had to work.
295140	297500	I guess I'm thankful for my office job.
297500	301020	I also refused to spend money on that day altogether.
301020	302020	So I spent nothing.
302020	304420	Good for you.
304420	309220	So it's been five years in a row where I haven't spent anything on that Friday.
309220	311260	I didn't get gas.
311260	312340	I got free air.
312340	315100	I'm trying to think if we bought anything on Black Friday.
315100	316100	I did not go out.
316100	321980	I will not fight crowds, but I will go to like Target at 8 o'clock at night because
321980	323180	it's just like a normal day.
323180	326460	After all the crazies have hit it up in the morning, then at like 8 o'clock at night,
326460	329740	like if I need to get like bread and eggs, it's just a normal day.
329740	330740	You know what I mean?
330740	332020	Whenever I get at Target.
332020	333360	We didn't go this time.
333360	336460	We usually go at night, but this year we managed to stay home.
336460	337900	Loki, how about you?
337900	339380	Did you get caught up in any of that madness?
339380	340860	No, I licked at stuff.
340860	342700	Window shopping, I guess.
342700	344260	But no, there's nothing really I need.
344260	349700	I mean, I don't need an Android tablet for $20 or whatever it is, you know.
349700	353980	I mean, I guess I could get one for my son to trash, but there may be one for my other
353980	354980	son to gnaw on.
354980	359020	But other than that, I didn't really need anything.
359500	365100	Well, taking it to video games, which is in theory what this show is about, you know,
365100	370540	there's a lot of game sites having sales like, what, Blizzard was selling World of Warcraft
370540	376900	for like five bucks and the Diablo games for 20 a pop, the expansion.
376900	377900	What else was out there?
377900	381980	Steam having a big sale, which was to be expected, I'm sure.
381980	384300	Even I was looking at, oh, only $10 for Gauntlet.
384300	387500	There's supposed to be a big square sale with a lot of the Final Fantasy titles.
387500	388500	There is.
388500	391220	I think we have a story on that coming up a little later, so yeah, but that is the thing
391220	396380	as well where, you know, if you want to get Final Fantasy XIV's, another big MMO, I think
396380	400900	was like 15 bucks, or you could go back and get like Tomb Raider for dirt cheap or what
400900	401900	have you.
401900	404980	So, were you able to resist all the online temptations as well?
404980	410040	I only bought one game and, you know, as the Steam sale rules, you never buy anything unless
410040	416380	it's at least like 75% off or something like that or I don't remember what the number is,
416380	421060	but I waited until something was, I bought Civ V just because, you know, everybody's
421060	425660	been recommending it and I know a few people play it, so I just figured, okay, I'll get
425660	426660	that.
426660	430500	But honestly, I was looking at the Steam sale stuff and even kind of went through my wishlist
430500	435880	and stuff and I, you know, scrolling down the page now because I don't really like how
435880	439780	they did all the recommendations now because it's, a lot of stuff repeats on there, but.
439780	443020	Yeah, I kind of don't like the new Steam layout compared to the old one.
443020	445140	I get what they're trying to do with the personalization.
445140	446140	I don't like it.
446380	451340	Seriously, they even be like, you know, here's Fez and here's Fez two spots down and here's
451340	456940	Fez again in this side and it's like, okay, one, it already says it's in my library, so
456940	460700	I don't need to really see that, but that was the thing, it's like all these games on
460700	464980	sale, you know, a lot of them were in my library already and so I'm like, eh, I don't really
464980	466380	need to buy these.
466380	470980	And then also the other games, like some of the newer games that just come out, my laptop
470980	475020	probably can't run those very well, so if I'm looking to buy any like new age, you know,
475020	482420	new games like say, Dragon Age or, you know, I don't know, even, oh, what the hell's that
482420	483420	Namco game?
483420	487060	I don't know, one of the other ones, but if I'm going to buy any of those, I'm going to
487060	491260	buy them on console where I know that these are going to run okay, so I'm not really going
491260	495860	to try to, you know, get, you know, was it, I know they had really insane discounts on
495860	498420	like, you know, the Shadow of Mordor.
498420	501660	Yeah, I was just going to say, I was almost tempted with the Shadows of Mordor, but it's
501660	504500	like, I've got enough stinking games to play right now.
504500	507260	We'll talk about our gaming lease in a minute, but it's like, I got enough right now.
507260	512300	Yeah, I got Civ V and then the only other thing I bought because it was just a decent
512300	516380	price is I paid, I beat the average on the Sega Humble Bundle.
516380	517780	Oh yeah, I got that too.
517780	523100	So that was like $350 for a ton of fucking games, including, you know, like the Dreamcast
523100	525700	Collection and fucking Knights and shit like that.
525700	530300	I somehow did not have Space Channel 5 on PC, so when I saw that that was in that Humble
530300	532660	Bundle, I was like, gotta get that.
532660	537260	So yeah, I mean, that's really the only thing, and I'm, I don't know about you, Rob, you
537260	540980	might want to look, they have, was a weekly one now, is Pinball FX 2 tables.
540980	542220	I heard that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
542220	546380	So I mean, I was like, eh, I don't really play pinball, but I'm like, eh, maybe.
546380	547380	Maybe.
547380	548380	But I didn't.
548380	549660	So that's really, that's all I bought.
549660	555740	I did hover several times over purchasing Dragon Age Inquisition, but it's still full
555740	557900	price, and I just didn't want to do it.
557900	568260	And also Diablo 3, but on PlayStation 4 digitally, but I just didn't do it, because I just have,
568260	570860	I already have two games on Disa I haven't played yet.
570860	575740	I still have another one that I'm only partway through, and I have, you know, a few other
575740	580100	digital games I just bought that I don't need to buy anymore games.
580100	583700	It's gonna end up being like the Steam library in my PlayStation Network.
583700	585300	Yeah, that's where, that's where things are going.
585300	588620	I was gonna say, wait till Christmas, though, in the post, you know, winter holidays, it'll
588620	593380	get even cheaper, I bet, with all the unsold inventory that's still left.
593380	597620	Plus there's like fucking games that like, I backed on Kickstarter that I completely
597620	601660	forget have, you know, not come out yet, that I get keys for and stuff.
601660	602660	Yeah.
602660	603660	So I don't know.
603660	605500	I'm just not buying a ton of stuff right now.
605500	607580	Let's look at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
607580	611620	Raginator says, Sky, Sky, Sky, dude, there's no such thing as enough games.
611620	614420	I suppose that's a good point there.
614420	615420	Let's see.
615420	617060	Raginator also saying, I went balls to the wall in the Steam sale.
617060	619020	I spent a record $90.
619020	620020	Yikes.
620020	624980	Tigerclaw saying, I didn't buy anything on Black Friday, but I did buy today Smash Brothers
624980	629340	Wii U and a Fox McCloud Amiibo.
629340	634220	He put an extra O on it and says Amiibo, but yeah, one of those Amiibos.
634220	637800	So he has a lot of people jumping on that, especially with, you know, Nintendo's kind
637800	640580	of big comeback or whatever you want to call it.
640580	641580	Let's see.
642580	645540	My dad went out for Black Friday for a toaster.
645540	648300	No one was at his local mall, surprisingly.
648300	651460	I'm really surprised because it seems like every time I log into YouTube after Black
651460	656260	Friday, it's like people dragging each other through the parking lot of Walmart for a $5
656260	657260	crock pot.
657260	659980	I almost wanted to buy a toaster this weekend because our toaster, one side of it's really
659980	663020	derpy and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
663020	665700	What's the big fucking deal with toasters this Black Friday?
665700	668060	Well, it's just, I meant to buy one.
668060	672760	It's not necessarily because it was Black Friday, but I just wanted to get a toaster
672760	675620	because I don't know.
675620	679700	Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture in chat, saying, figures that two weeks after I buy
679700	685460	an Xbox One, Best Buy has it 20 bucks less and a discount on a second controller.
685460	689860	Managed to get them to price match, but it was a hassle.
689860	694820	I was really close to getting an Xbox One when I saw that it was now like another $20
694820	697740	cheaper for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and all that.
697740	699900	Oh my gosh, I really had to resist.
699900	700900	Really had to resist.
700900	705340	Well, it's not that, and I just want to be clear, I want to get an Xbox.
705340	708560	I want to support Microsoft's platform and get some of the exclusive games.
708560	710340	It's purely a financial thing.
710340	712340	You're still talking about dropping $300 plus.
712340	714700	And also I'm looking at the exclusive games right now.
714700	718060	Forza Horizon 2, I haven't played it yet and honestly I haven't missed it.
718060	722180	To be honest, I haven't missed Drive Club either.
722180	726180	Luckily there's so much else out right now to divert my attention.
726620	727620	I'm not missing it either.
727620	730780	When Crackdown comes out, that's going to be pretty tough.
730780	732020	Same with the Wii U.
732020	737620	When Zelda comes out, that's going to be kind of tough to not justify purchasing that system.
737620	742100	It's like, God, I really want to play that.
742100	746360	Right now I'm hoping, we have a contest at my work right now where they're giving away
746360	748060	an Xbox One as one of the prizes.
748060	750500	I'm like, eh, that would be kind of cool if I win that.
750500	752180	Probably not going to, but it would be kind of cool.
752180	755700	That's like people are like, I have so much debt, but I bought a lottery ticket.
755700	759820	Unfortunately it's Assassin's Creed bundle, which I fucking hate Assassin's Creed.
759820	762900	You're being like one of those people that's like, I'm so in debt right now, but I bought
762900	763900	a lottery ticket.
763900	764900	Here's hoping.
764900	767700	But see, I'm not spending any money.
767700	771460	It's a free contest, so you know, no risk.
771460	775660	Now before I get into our official kickoff topic tonight, SG100Matt is clarifying the
775660	776660	toaster situation.
776660	782420	SG100Matt in chat says, his toaster was borked and couldn't toast bagels properly.
782420	784740	This is a serious problem in a Jewish household.
784740	787940	That's why you get a toaster oven.
787940	789260	I know we have a toaster oven.
789260	791740	I'm like, we're not a Jewish household per se.
791740	793640	We just really fucking love bagels.
793640	795140	So we have a toaster oven.
795140	796140	So just saying.
796140	801500	Are you one of those, like they have seriously the fancy one at work where it's the one,
801500	804320	like they have almost like the bagel shop where you put it into one side and it rolls
804320	805820	across the little oven.
805820	810400	And we'll look at you, mister, I was laid off and now I got this new job and they have
810400	811400	fancy toaster ovens.
811400	812960	They have a fancy cafe.
812960	818640	They have fancy cafes there that I buy my fancy Red Bulls during the day.
818640	822480	We have a fancy cafe too at Locat.
822480	823480	Not where I'm at.
823480	826880	We have a cafe, but I wouldn't call it fancy anyway.
826880	827880	Enough talk about that.
827880	829880	Wood fired pizza, Rob.
829880	833260	I wish we have, I can get like a chicken strip basket.
833260	834260	Is that a delicacy?
834260	835260	I don't know.
835260	838360	I'm going to take you guys to my work one day and just feed you.
838360	840640	All right, moving on.
840640	842780	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
842780	847400	This is an interesting article that was making the rounds on the blogs this week and it originally
847400	855200	comes from the site MCVUK.com and they ran a story about the co-founder of the games
855200	858800	workshop and the government's creative industries champion.
858800	864040	This is Ian Livingstone and some comments that he made this week at the first BFI video
864040	865880	games day in London.
865880	868680	This was the interesting quote he said.
868720	871400	Because you just bought Civilization V, Loki.
871400	873840	See if you catch the reference here.
873840	876920	Now is the second golden age of games.
876920	880560	As you know, when your civilization enters the golden age, you get increased production.
880560	881560	Oh, forget it.
881560	882560	Forget it.
882560	883560	All right.
883560	884560	Now is the second golden age of games.
884560	889880	Anybody can make a game in their own creative, cultural way in a less formulaic way than
889880	894220	some console games in order to find new audiences.
894220	898780	He went on to talk about games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Minecraft,
898780	904800	even Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans, which is a big one on the iOS and I believe Android,
904800	910460	talking about games that have broadened gaming's audience and brought more people into gaming,
910460	913100	especially when you talk about something like Candy Crush Saga.
913100	917100	I would even add games like Words with Friends and Farmville to that list, bringing in a
917100	921940	demographic that wasn't always a quote-e-quote gamer.
921940	927220	He did say that there is still work to be done, saying games have always had a bad press.
927220	931340	Since the invention of chess, history has not been kind to games.
931340	935660	Grand Theft Auto V was the absolute embodiment of science meeting art.
935660	939220	It should have been put at the forefront of the British games industry as a success, but
939220	943340	instead it was castigated by the mainstream press.
943340	945260	So there you go.
945260	950060	And he also mentioned the mobile market as a cause for concern, saying, I love this quote,
950060	955060	for every Angry Birds, there's 20 million dead birds out there.
955060	959380	Meaning all those clones and knockoffs and everybody wants a piece of the pie when something
959380	960380	gets big.
960380	966740	But let's go back to his comments about, we are in a second golden age of video games.
966740	968220	What do you guys think of when you hear that?
968220	970900	And I'm going to pose this to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
970900	972980	What do you guys think when you hear that?
972980	976780	Do you tend to agree that we are experiencing a second golden age of games?
976780	980900	Because I know for a while there, like even just a year or two on this show, we were talking
980900	987140	about that it seemed like another video game crisis or crash akin to what we saw Atari
987140	989180	go through in 84 was imminent.
989180	990820	Are we in a golden age?
990820	991820	What do you think, Logie?
991820	994420	I don't think we're going to have a crash because there's just too many independents.
994420	995420	That's the thing.
995420	998380	You don't have, you know, big publishers kind of ruling everything.
998380	1002500	Now you have, you know, people just fucking fed up with publishers and they're leaving
1002500	1006060	their development companies and starting their own developing companies and hell,
1006060	1011700	you know, it's easy now, you know, probably way easier than it was back in the 80s, you
1011700	1015340	know, to start your own development house and build your own games because you don't
1015340	1017140	fucking have to build motherboards anymore.
1017140	1023300	You just fucking download a game engine or learn a language and you can output to, you
1023300	1028500	know, iOS or Android or PC and relatively easy.
1028500	1031860	And so you can kind of take those creative ideas and run with them.
1032380	1033380	DarkSocker, what do you think?
1033380	1035580	Are we in a golden age of gaming?
1035580	1037460	I wouldn't necessarily say a golden age.
1037460	1049700	I just say that we're in a, I would probably say a, a hybrid metal stage, hybrid metal,
1049700	1052700	semi-precious.
1052700	1056340	I think that it's, it's exactly what Logie said.
1056340	1061780	I think that we've got definitely a lot of, uh, I'm going to say it's actually the
1061820	1066940	age of the small business in gaming where you've got independent developers getting
1066940	1070140	in, basically sticking it to the man and being successful.
1072140	1075460	I was just gonna say, yeah, cause you can have like a company try to do, you know,
1075460	1081380	really shady, stupid things like EA, um, and you know, have that totally flop in
1081380	1083340	the whole industry is not going to crash because of it.
1083340	1087500	To be fair, EA has kind of been sitting in the background this year.
1087540	1091460	I think EA took their licks and they're kind of, you know, they, they've let other
1091460	1095100	guys take a beating this year, you know, and it, and we've even talked about this
1095100	1099140	before where it seems like all the big companies kind of cycle through and
1099140	1099980	somebody's getting a beat.
1100020	1100300	Yeah.
1100420	1100900	Okay.
1101020	1102460	Who's had it worse this year, Logie?
1102460	1103540	EA or Ubisoft?
1103580	1108260	Recently within the last few months, Ubisoft, EA, let's look at the track record here.
1108260	1113180	They implemented their wonderful, uh, EA service where you pay $30 to get demos of
1113180	1118060	games now, and also they've basically blocking their games from being part of,
1118060	1122980	you know, any of the free deals that you get on PlayStation network or on, um, you
1122980	1128020	know, games of gold because, you know, they want pieces of the pie, of course.
1128060	1133660	And because of them, they're probably gonna see more, you know, um, segregation
1133660	1137940	with, you know, different, I can totally see Ubisoft and Activision following suit
1137940	1142060	and having their own services where, you know, XML money per year, nobody's
1142060	1142900	to get their games.
1143300	1149500	Um, so there's that, yes, I understand that Ubisoft's games, the least last
1149500	1154740	couple of them have been pretty Rocky at launch, but I just think that there's
1154740	1160060	just, I don't know, especially in the mobile side, you know, cause you don't
1160060	1163300	see that with Ubisoft that much and mobile site, there's some really shady
1163300	1166780	shit that they've done, you know, with the whole, um, now I'm not sure if this is
1166780	1172180	last year at this point, but you know, with fucking, um, was a dungeon keeper
1172700	1173740	and that kind of stuff.
1173780	1179580	I mean, it just really, they really hoard those microtransactions and I
1179580	1186260	guess they, they can do it, but it's kind of, you know, soils, some of these, you
1186260	1189820	know, popular franchises that they're bringing back lots of comments in our
1189820	1191980	chat room, uh, over at live.vognetware.com.
1191980	1194180	Dungeon buster saying there wasn't going to be a crash.
1194180	1197220	The market's too diversified for it now because the tools
1197220	1198540	are in everyone's hands.
1198860	1202780	ActDef saying, I think we're in a video game Renaissance right now.
1202820	1203580	I like that word.
1203900	1207820	Um, Johnny B 79 saying, I don't think we have another golden age going.
1207820	1209020	Wait until 2015.
1209020	1211060	Maybe it's the Indies age.
1211580	1214940	Uh, S200Matt saying gaming has its many problems, but I don't
1214940	1216180	think it will crash as a whole.
1216300	1217340	Are we in a golden age?
1217340	1217780	I don't know.
1217780	1221060	I think we won't know about that until time has passed enough for
1221060	1222900	us to look back at this time.
1222900	1225180	Well, and look at like, you know, look at what these big
1225180	1226740	companies are putting out now.
1226740	1231740	I mean, it's basically franchises, yearly franchises seem to be the
1231740	1236140	case, you know, like with Ubisoft and Sasses Creed and near the kind
1236140	1240100	of trying to get new franchises that they can have yearly additions of
1240300	1243620	because they think that's, what's going to sell, but look at some of
1243620	1246860	the, you know, these indie games that are getting a ton of attention.
1246860	1250380	Like even with, you know, the E3 press conferences and stuff,
1250380	1253180	Indies seem to be the forefront of a lot of these presentations
1253180	1255660	because they're unique games.
1255660	1256540	It's different.
1256580	1258540	You're not going to see, Oh, cool.
1258540	1260700	Madden's out again this year or, Oh, cool.
1260700	1263940	You know, another call of duty or, you know, Oh cool.
1263940	1267460	Another, I don't know, Loki Kevin Spacey though.
1267900	1269180	Hey, Kevin Spacey's awesome.
1269340	1271620	People got pretty excited about Kevin Spacey.
1271620	1272420	He's pretty awesome.
1272460	1277660	And you know, the game is fun, but comparing it to last year's game.
1277660	1282580	I mean, that was a really, you know, low mark the hit cause Ghost wasn't very good.
1283180	1285540	Uh, whereas black ops two is pretty good.
1285540	1288620	And if I was to compare this to black ops two, it's pretty similar, you know,
1288620	1293180	the style of game, but, you know, they've added a few different, you know, mobility
1293180	1297180	things that make it a little interesting, but it's not completely new game.
1297180	1299060	It's just a little different.
1299220	1299460	Right.
1299460	1304220	So, um, but you know, and, and I applaud, you know, like battlefield, you know,
1304220	1306860	doing battlefield hardline, you know, that's kind of cool.
1306900	1307580	It's different.
1307580	1310580	You know, instead of just throwing out another military shooter again.
1310740	1314900	Um, so I'm kind of down with that, but it's still though.
1314900	1317900	They're trying to, a lot of the times they're just put out these yearly
1317940	1320740	releases and it just seems like not a lot of efforts going into them.
1320740	1325020	And it kind of shows in the reviews even like, um, you know, I think NBA
1325020	1327900	live though this year did a little bit better than last year, but it was just
1327900	1331340	kind of, eh, you know, it's like, why even bother with some of these?
1331820	1335500	I sort of feel like video game right now is at a bit of a crossroads.
1335500	1340620	I definitely see the whole rise of indie development and it does seem
1340620	1344380	like it's so much more accessible now for people to go in and create their
1344380	1348620	own games because you, it's not just that the tools are there to necessarily
1348620	1351980	create games because the tools to create games have been there for a very long
1351980	1352340	time.
1352340	1356460	Like I think of, you know, going all the way back to the Apple two E and the
1356460	1360780	Commodore 64 days, you know, the stuff that us 30 something's played when we
1360780	1362140	were in elementary school, right.
1362380	1365700	You know, I remember you could type in and you could make your own programs.
1365700	1369420	So we even learned about doing things like, um, what was that drawing program
1369420	1370060	with the turtles?
1370060	1370740	That logo?
1370820	1371100	Turtle.
1371900	1372980	Or is it just called true?
1372980	1374060	I thought that it might have been logo.
1374060	1377340	I don't remember programming writers, logo writers, something like that.
1377500	1380540	I mean, but that was, that was how we learned logic and programming at a young
1380540	1381220	age, right?
1381220	1382260	Was, that was the big thing.
1382260	1384140	I don't even know if that's something they still do.
1384180	1384860	I hope they do.
1384860	1385820	That's pretty awesome.
1385820	1390180	And I completely retained none of that, but, uh, you know, what was the name of
1390180	1393420	that game that really influenced me as a child, Oregon trail?
1393460	1396260	I remember going to the computer labs, you know, with the monochrome green
1396260	1399740	screens and stuff, but, uh, yeah, it was just, it's like logo.
1399780	1403780	Don't even remember that it was all, you know, Carmen, San Diego and Oregon trail.
1403780	1405220	I mean, that, that's all we played, right?
1405580	1409540	Yeah, but, but learning how to program in, in logo and the turtle drawing and all
1409540	1414020	that stuff is, is so important because learning about like, if then and logic
1414020	1418540	and things like going into my job that I do now or, or something I used to a few
1418540	1420980	years ago, I don't do it so much now, but I used to write a lot of policy
1420980	1424860	documents and a lot of that same like logic gating comes into play.
1424860	1426660	And it's like, you learned that at a young age.
1426660	1430220	I think it would be cool if they did teach, have even just like a programming
1430220	1432780	course in and, and do with games.
1432780	1434180	I think games would be a good way.
1434180	1438020	Cause it's something that's interesting to that age group.
1438020	1438780	Cause they kind of do that.
1438780	1441420	Logie, I think like in my junior high school, that was like an
1441420	1442660	elective we were able to take.
1442740	1442940	Yeah.
1442940	1444100	Cause I don't know if they do that.
1444460	1447380	Oh, at least when I went to high school, they didn't have anything like that.
1447620	1452380	Uh, they only had like typing, you know, it was like typing and typing too.
1452380	1455740	And, and so it's like, okay, you know, that's kind of dumb, but it would be
1455740	1458780	cool if they had that, um, I'd be down with that anyway.
1458780	1460260	I got a little tangenty, sorry.
1460300	1464900	Um, so I feel like on computers, that's always been something we could do, but
1464900	1467820	you know, when consoles came out, when like, like, let's say even the Atari
1467820	1471260	2600 or the Nintendo entertainment system, like, No, you couldn't
1471260	1473220	just make your own Nintendo game.
1473260	1477700	I mean, some people did and could, but that was something you really had
1477700	1479580	to have the tools to be able to do.
1479940	1484500	But now you're seeing more and more as we enter this more digital era where,
1484500	1488060	you know, even on, you know, PlayStation four, not only is the marketplace more
1488060	1493180	opened up for these smaller publishers to put their own creations directly on
1493180	1500420	the store, be that Apple's app store, Android store, um, uh, steam, you know,
1500420	1502700	those types of services, or even now you're seeing more and more of it on
1502700	1505780	Wii U, PlayStation, Xbox, like those are really opening up as well.
1506700	1510700	And it just seems like even within games themselves, there's
1510700	1512300	more tools to create games.
1512500	1516140	And I'm talking about things like things like twine, right?
1516140	1519980	Which, you know, is a big, popular, uh, people create their own text
1519980	1521260	adventure games and so forth.
1521540	1523940	Or even something like little big planet.
1524220	1527620	I would argue in a way as a game creation, like just last week, we were
1527620	1530900	talking about that somebody had what recreated final fantasy seven within
1530900	1536180	little big planet, and there's so much you can learn about making a game from
1536220	1538180	developing your own level of little big planet.
1538180	1541380	Like we have more games now that allow you to make games.
1542140	1545500	It's a, it's a, it's a very meta world that we're in right now
1545500	1547220	in gaming in that regard.
1548260	1549380	Yeah, definitely.
1550460	1554740	I think it'd be cool to see, like, you know, uh, I would love to see like,
1554740	1557580	you know, Mario maker and stuff to have that actually a little bit more
1557580	1561140	advanced to where you could sell level packs and stuff where you can, you know,
1561140	1566540	kind of advertise your stuff and make, you know, have a marketplace for that
1566540	1567660	kind of stuff would be pretty cool.
1568220	1571540	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetware.com many, many chatters
1571540	1573180	and they're confirming it is logo.
1573180	1574900	We've got linked to the Wikipedia articles.
1574900	1580020	That was a, you see, but now see logo meant something else 20 years ago.
1580020	1583620	And now I'm like, Oh, that's what channel RuPaul's Drag Race comes on as logo.
1583620	1585500	But you know, now it's a little different now.
1585540	1591020	Anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, um, talking about,
1591020	1596780	uh, Akuma JP saying, I hate to say this, but good indie is good, but
1596780	1598700	too many garbage around now.
1598700	1599820	I'm kind of sick of it.
1599980	1603980	Well, that's what the guy was talking about in his, his car in his speech was
1603980	1606820	that, you know, for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.
1606980	1608140	There is a lot of garbage out there.
1608140	1608300	Yeah.
1608300	1611860	And there's a lot of garbage even on steam and it's just, it's people.
1612860	1616300	I don't even, I think I would like to think that it's just
1616300	1618460	people trying to cash in quickly.
1618820	1621820	You know, there, there has been in a lot of these developers.
1622100	1626820	Um, they're not, they're not, they're not professional in their game making.
1626820	1631220	They're not professional in the way they interact with the community and,
1631700	1633900	you know, the press and that kind of stuff.
1633940	1640700	Um, so I think that there's some of those out there, but legitimately, I think a lot
1640700	1645260	of people are actually trying, you know, to get stuff on there and they're not
1645260	1650100	trying to just throw some crap together to get people to buy, you know, their game
1650100	1653580	and then never update it again, just make a quick buck because that's only going to
1653580	1654340	work once.
1654420	1656620	I mean, you're not going to be able to pull that trick off twice.
1656980	1658580	So I don't know.
1658580	1665020	It's, there, there have been some pretty terrible games, but that's what peer
1665020	1666300	review, that's reviews for.
1666340	1667980	That's why they have, you know, ratings.
1668020	1671820	There is that, but I would even argue that, you know, some people are there just to
1671820	1672380	cash in.
1672380	1676140	We know that, but some people can also learn something from a quote unquote,
1676140	1676860	terrible game.
1677140	1680500	Like look at some of the like funny little joke projects.
1680500	1684140	I use, I use that term loosely that we've talked about on OLR lately.
1684380	1687540	For instance, you know, let's talk, let's talk about Bobby while he's not here.
1687740	1690580	Cause there was that whole flappy vog thing that he did on the website, right?
1690580	1691820	Which you can still go and play.
1692020	1695180	And you know, it was, it was a silly version of flappy bird that we all got to
1695180	1696980	get involved with and lend our voices to.
1697020	1700220	But think about everything that he learned from that project.
1700380	1702460	He learned about developing unity on the web.
1702660	1706660	He learned about how to interface it with the vog website that he built because, you
1706660	1708300	know, there's the high score table that's built in.
1708300	1709580	It does the loot and all that stuff.
1709900	1713140	Like, you know, he can take that knowledge and use it on something else.
1713220	1713540	Yeah.
1713620	1717140	Or even, um, you know, Aaron had called in a couple of weeks ago talking about the
1717140	1721900	pixel shits game that he made, which we loved because that was, uh, spurned off an
1721900	1725060	idea here at orange launch radio, which by the way, I have to make sure I give this
1725060	1726020	a shout out at some point.
1726020	1728820	I'm so sorry to be so tangenty, but I don't want to forget this.
1729140	1731300	You have to check out this user on Twitter.
1731500	1737780	It's a click rocks, C L I C K R O C K S because earlier this week he actually
1737780	1743260	tweeted a box art that he made for pixel shits for Y Y R in the vein of inventory.
1743300	1746300	I just brought up here in the studio, it's awesome.
1746500	1747540	And Aaron saw it and loved it.
1747540	1751380	I sent it to him on Twitter and that was a learning project for Aaron too.
1751420	1751580	Yeah.
1751580	1755900	It's a learning project for him, but it's also another thing too, is it boils down
1756020	1758980	how simple a game can be and it can be fun.
1758980	1761860	And sometimes the most simple things look at the games that were on the
1761860	1767420	Atari's 2,600, they like literally had some of them one objective, you know, and
1767420	1771860	this one is, you know, make shits on the ground to stop the joggers that, and
1771860	1775860	that, and that's literally, and a lot of times like the crazy thing about pixel
1775860	1780220	shits is like, it really is not a bad gift for a joke project.
1780620	1783220	It's a really authentic 2,600 game.
1783260	1786940	Like I could have, I mean, I don't think it would have been a game about shit on
1786940	1789100	the 2,600, but that's what makes it funny.
1789100	1793340	But I could see this same idea where you're leaving, I don't know, sand traps
1793340	1799500	on the ground for people, pixel twigs and berries on the ground, you know, I could
1799500	1805140	see this like as an actual game on the 2,600 pixel squish, pixel squish, the
1805140	1807180	family channel version of the game.
1807260	1810300	Anyway, tangenty, but, uh, but good stuff.
1810740	1811100	All right.
1811140	1812660	Um, there you go.
1812660	1816620	So, uh, we would invite your emails on this, uh, at a future date over
1816620	1819900	at, uh, participate at orangeontrader.com.
1819900	1822820	If you want to email us on that, but in the meantime, we got to get to tonight's
1822820	1826660	news and I also want to start off tonight's show as we always do talking
1826660	1830340	about how was your gaming week and what video games have you been playing this
1830340	1832820	week, dark Sakura, I have two weeks worth of games.
1832860	1837180	Um, I have dragon age inquisition, of course, which I'm starting over because
1837180	1840180	I might've screwed up my soulless romance, which I know is going to make me cry.
1840540	1842420	It's already been kind of spoiled for me.
1842900	1843860	Um, but that's okay.
1843860	1844900	Cause I'm doing it anyway.
1845020	1849060	Um, I'm playing a, uh, elven mage.
1849100	1850140	So that was fun.
1850660	1857700	Uh, I also have been, uh, I actually played some final fantasy 14 earlier last week,
1857700	1859900	but I haven't touched it since inquisition came out.
1860700	1863860	Um, I played some other stuff though.
1863860	1865980	Um, I played some, uh, bejeweled.
1866540	1869820	I got that ingress thing, but I'm too lazy to go walk around my neighborhood.
1870500	1872740	So I haven't done anything with it.
1873660	1874500	It was just pretty.
1874500	1878700	So I just started looking at the colors for awhile and it was like, Oh, going crazy.
1878860	1880020	Did you really get into that?
1880260	1881260	I just got the game.
1881260	1883980	I haven't done much in it as in anything.
1884020	1885540	You signed up for green team, right?
1886020	1886460	Yes.
1886500	1886780	Good.
1888020	1890300	Um, cause I remember you saying that you hated the Smurfs.
1892700	1894500	I, I did that then.
1894980	1897100	Um, there's some listeners of the show.
1897100	1899020	I know play ingress and happen to be service.
1899340	1901100	I don't want to hate Smurfs.
1901140	1902260	Hey, it's a strong word.
1902260	1903340	They just annoy me.
1903540	1906340	And there's one guy here locally that really annoys me.
1906340	1907900	Ah, that's the game.
1908700	1909420	That's the game.
1909420	1909940	That's the game.
1910300	1910820	Okay.
1910860	1916540	Um, I also picked up, um, crap now I forgot the name of it.
1916580	1918580	Um, and it's not injection or something.
1918580	1925940	It's, um, I can remember what the, it was something I got actually for, uh, my, uh,
1925980	1928420	for Mac and now for the life of me.
1928420	1930700	I can't remember what it was called, but it's on steam as well.
1931140	1936220	And then, um, I picked up, uh, crap, man.
1936220	1936860	I forgot what it was.
1936900	1937340	Oh yeah.
1937380	1938460	A game called mountain.
1939140	1941220	It's 99 cents and it's not really a game.
1941620	1947020	You're just a mountain, a mountain floating in the sky and you can spin
1947020	1953660	around and you can move all around the mountain, but it's a mountain.
1954460	1955180	Just floating there.
1956100	1958780	You're a mountain in the mountain.
1958980	1962780	No, you are, you are the mountain mountain, but you can spin.
1962980	1964180	How does a mountain spin?
1964220	1965380	It's floating in the air.
1965580	1966460	It's a floating mountain.
1966540	1967020	All right.
1967220	1968620	The clouds, it has clouds too.
1968620	1969460	And rain noises.
1970420	1973580	It's just, it actually is super relaxing.
1973860	1974660	I'm surprised.
1974700	1977500	I would think a game like volcano would be more up your alley.
1978260	1980180	Uh, that would be my version of it.
1980220	1980580	Yeah.
1981860	1984340	But no, it's 99 cents.
1984660	1988220	It's worth the dollar just to look at it for the novelty sake.
1988260	1990540	You paid a whole dollar for that whole dollar for that.
1990940	1999980	I Rob, I spent $4 on you today and a dollar on Allen, but I'm worth it.
2000940	2003620	A mountain though, mountains you climb.
2003900	2004140	All right.
2004140	2006020	Anyway, enough about the mountains.
2006020	2006940	Let's talk to Loki.
2006940	2007700	How was your gaming week?
2008340	2013340	My gaming week is now involving me filling out that claim form for free red bowl.
2013380	2014220	Hell yeah.
2016580	2018060	They'll say it was months ago.
2018100	2020700	Well, I just remembered about it and you can still fill it out.
2020700	2022340	So maybe I'll have to do that too.
2022820	2025700	Uh, anyways, so this week I played a few things.
2025700	2028420	I did get around to playing some call of duty.
2028420	2029300	So I played that.
2029300	2036100	I think it leveled up cause they had double XP this weekend from like 19 to I think 25.
2036300	2037540	So that was pretty fun.
2037660	2039380	Um, I actually played on a few maps.
2039380	2042700	I haven't played yet, so I thought I had seen them all because it, I guess it just
2042700	2044500	doesn't cycle through them very well.
2044940	2048060	But I have got the two different maps that I haven't played.
2049220	2055060	And then, um, I played actually quite a bit of Lego Marvel superheroes.
2055460	2059300	Um, I think I went through about three or four levels, mainly because my son kept
2059340	2065060	making me watch there's this, um, has like, was it maximum overload and Lego
2065060	2069980	Marvel superheroes, maximum overload, which is a, it's like a web series slash movie.
2069980	2074340	It's like 20 minutes long and he's watched it about 10 times in the last three days.
2074860	2082300	And, um, so it's hilarious and Troy Baker is, you know, in it.
2082300	2083900	So, you know, Troy Baker, all the things.
2083900	2087020	And, um, you know, apparently he actually, I didn't realize he does
2087020	2089340	several voices in the game.
2089340	2093660	So he does Loki and he also does, uh, Hawkeye.
2093700	2096060	So cool.
2096220	2100700	And, um, the story's weird, but I'm going with it.
2100780	2104140	And, uh, so yeah, I played that and enjoying it.
2104500	2106420	Although once I'm done, I'm probably never gonna play it again.
2106700	2109860	And then Grand Theft Auto five, I played a little bit of that, got through some
2109860	2112780	more missions on that and, uh, I was trying.
2113740	2117260	So this is the only thing I don't like about the PlayStation four and it's good
2117260	2119820	for, it's probably good for this reason.
2119820	2126140	But for me, you know, the hacking, cracking, modding type, I don't enjoy it
2126180	2132980	because there's no way to remove updates from games, um, unless you, so I have to
2132980	2137700	delete the whole game and redownload it in order to remove updates because there
2137700	2142020	was an exploit that you could do with the stock market where you can basically buy
2142020	2146060	and sell some stock that's negative and it keeps giving you money and I wanted the
2146060	2148620	cheat so I can get more money so that, you know,
2148780	2151380	But they sell money online, right?
2151660	2155260	Well, they do sell money for Grand Theft Auto online, but not for the single
2155260	2158260	player game. And here's the thing though, is actually, that's not such a big deal
2158260	2163140	because I, I did pre-order the game, um, digitally.
2163140	2168500	So I'm supposed to get $500,000 for my characters, but I haven't gotten to the
2168500	2170500	point in the game where it gives me that.
2170540	2175900	So, um, it would be nice to have that now, but whatever.
2176220	2179180	I guess later on, once I get all three characters and it's going to give it to me
2179180	2180340	for all three characters.
2180380	2182740	Is this the downside to you having bought digitally?
2182740	2185980	Because if you'd bought that game on disc, you could have just unplugged yourself on
2185980	2187540	the internet and done that, right?
2188180	2189940	Uh, never updated the game.
2189940	2191660	And no, it's still a download the update.
2191660	2194980	I would probably be able to download the app or delete the update and it would be a
2194980	2196540	lot faster to just be able to install it.
2196780	2199540	But now I have to redownload, you know, 50 gigs worth of game.
2199540	2200940	And honestly, it's just not worth it.
2200980	2205380	I just, I'll play it, you know, the regular way, but it's just, I've played the game
2205380	2208020	before a hundred percent and completed everything.
2208020	2212420	And I know how long it takes and I'm kind of like, you know, I want to get a hundred
2212420	2216060	percent so I can start doing, you know, the Easter egg hunting stuff again, cause that
2216060	2216700	was kind of fun.
2216700	2220380	And hopefully they have more, you know, it's actually finished in this version of the
2220380	2226380	game, but you know, I, I don't really want to have to do everything again.
2226420	2227980	I want it to be as quickly as possible.
2227980	2231220	I want to cheat through everything because I've already done it and I just don't want
2231220	2234420	to have to, you know, work through getting a hundred percent on everything again.
2234580	2236540	Cause it was a pain in the ass the last time.
2237060	2239940	So yeah, that's, that's why I'm doing that.
2240380	2243140	But, um, whatever, I'll just play it.
2243180	2245180	I'm just, I haven't been going back to it very much.
2245180	2247700	So that's the thing is I thought I'd be really playing a lot more of it.
2247700	2249380	I still haven't even played Grand Theft Auto online.
2249380	2253420	You haven't transferred my characters over yet, but I probably will at some point.
2253940	2257540	Um, but I just, I'm kind of waiting for them to put out an expansion.
2257540	2260940	They're supposed to do it now that, you know, the new games come out, maybe when the
2260940	2264100	PC version comes out, but I really need a single player expansion.
2264860	2265380	All right.
2265540	2266540	Crossing my fingers for you.
2266820	2270140	I did also forget about playing Smash Brothers on Wii U.
2270260	2270620	Oh yeah.
2270620	2271580	How did you enjoy that?
2271860	2273380	It was eight players of madness.
2274060	2278020	Eight players is kind of crazy on like, it depends on how big your TV is, I suppose.
2278020	2280860	But I seem to remember you guys have a pretty big TV, but imagine playing eight
2280860	2282940	players on our littler TV in there.
2282940	2284180	It's, it's kind of crazy.
2284180	2287660	We tried doing that and it's like, oh my gosh, just four players is great.
2287660	2288260	Eight players.
2288260	2289660	You got to have the right setup for that.
2289740	2290940	Yeah, but I forgot to mention it.
2291060	2296300	That's, that's where, um, Jonas's and Diego's, uh, anime game room team can get
2296300	2298340	us a projection screen or something that's big enough.
2298860	2300220	That's that would be my hope.
2300460	2304220	Um, let's see, a chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.
2304220	2308460	Johnny B 79 says, Rob, are you playing final fantasy 14 and wow.
2308620	2309820	Plus dragon age.
2309820	2311500	Geez, you got a hectic schedule.
2311740	2314740	Um, actually the answer to that question is kind of yes.
2314780	2318860	Um, I did play some dragon age inquisition this week, but not a lot.
2318900	2321980	Uh, that game took a little bit of a back seat this week.
2322020	2327020	Um, and yeah, luckily I've not had work since Thursday.
2327060	2331700	Cause, uh, my office job affords me, you know, the four days that, um, a lot of,
2331940	2334020	you know, banks and so forth get for this holiday.
2334180	2336660	So I've had a lot of time to kind of sit on my butt and play
2336660	2337820	video games, which has been great.
2337820	2340540	So yeah, I have been able to play a couple of MMOs.
2340820	2342380	So let's talk first about that.
2342380	2346620	If you follow me on Twitter, uh, then you probably saw earlier this week.
2347100	2350940	I did succumb to the fact that I knew I was going to be going back to
2350940	2353580	world of Warcraft because I've heard nothing but great things about this new
2353580	2354220	expansion.
2354540	2358420	So yes, I re signed up for world of Warcraft and I've been playing that
2358420	2360020	quite a bit over the past few days.
2360260	2363140	Um, which is funny cause I know Irene was here last week.
2363180	2364620	I'm filling in for Jamie.
2364620	2368060	We, we had a bit of a deep discussion that kind of went to a dark place
2368060	2369420	a little bit on world of Warcraft.
2369420	2370900	We're talking about some of the negatives of it.
2370900	2372780	Cause I believe Irene said.
2373300	2374940	She, she didn't say the word hate.
2374940	2376380	She's another very strong word.
2376380	2379460	And she used to play Warcraft all the time, but now she couldn't stand it.
2379460	2382900	And it was just kind of interesting to talk about that and the social dynamic,
2382900	2387140	but all that stuff aside, I've been hearing nothing but great things about
2387140	2387980	Warlords of Draenor.
2387980	2389300	So I was like, all right, what the hell?
2389540	2391060	I've got some time here off work.
2391260	2393500	Blizzard has announced their Black Friday sales.
2393500	2394860	Warlords of Draenor isn't on it.
2394860	2397180	So let's just, let's just buy the damn thing.
2397660	2399140	Let's get in there and see what's going on.
2399140	2405340	So, um, I have leveled an Alliance character up to 94, just shy of 95 and a
2405340	2409300	Horde character up to about 91, um, just because I wanted to get my garrison
2409300	2410620	triggered on the Horde character.
2410940	2412660	Um, and, um,
2413020	2415260	Is it you didn't use your redemption code?
2415340	2417900	I, my 90 boost, I haven't yet.
2417900	2420140	No, the, my character to get boosted to 90.
2420380	2425780	I'm waiting to see what I want to do with that because I have a tune on one server,
2425780	2430300	Proudmoore, where I used to know a lot of people that played, but almost everybody
2430300	2432540	that was on Proudmoore left for another server.
2432980	2437580	Um, so I have my Alliance tune on a server, Blade's Edge, and that's where the guys
2437580	2439940	from gamebuoy.org play and some of their friends.
2440180	2443940	So that's why I've kind of been focusing on that server because I know people that
2443940	2444940	are actively playing there.
2444980	2446460	I know who you're playing.
2446540	2446820	Yeah.
2447460	2451140	Uh, and so my holy pally, yes, that's, that's the character I'm working on right
2451140	2451340	now.
2451620	2457140	So my 90 boost, what I'm sitting on that is maybe I'll find out I have some friends
2457140	2457780	somewhere else.
2457780	2461140	In fact, already on Twitter, another podcasting friend of mine is like, you
2461140	2464220	should come to Earthen Ring because we have a guild over here on Horde side.
2464540	2468260	So I'm saving that 90 boost for when I need a character on a server.
2468660	2471220	That way I don't have to pay to transfer one of the ones I have, if that makes
2471220	2471380	sense.
2471380	2471860	That makes sense.
2471940	2474580	So, um, just waiting for that to happen.
2474900	2479540	I kind of want to don't get super, I don't really want to get super married to Wow
2479540	2480180	though.
2480340	2484900	I don't know if I want to get into the whole rating a couple of times a week and
2484900	2485580	all that again.
2485820	2491100	I just don't know if my life is compatible with that anymore, but I will say just
2491140	2495940	on the pure standpoint of the expansion leveling from one to, or excuse me, from
2495940	2499740	90 to a hundred and the whole bit, I am pretty impressed at this expansion.
2499740	2503500	This expansion really is the best one they've had since at least Lich King.
2503540	2507740	It knocks the other two, Cataclysm and Pandaria knocks them out of the water.
2507900	2512300	Um, and a lot of that is that they've really made the experience very cinematic.
2512500	2517980	I was very surprised by, you know, you get right into the action and then you're in
2518060	2522620	an arena fighting a hundred people and fighting them off and then somebody's
2522620	2524780	yelling, run, run to the docks.
2524780	2527540	And you, you're having to get your characters, who's got a speed boost and
2527540	2529940	running through all this madness as fast as possible.
2530140	2534420	Like they've really taken some steps in this very old engine to make it very
2534420	2535060	cinematic.
2535340	2540380	And, um, you know, when you get introduced to the orcs that make up the iron horde
2540380	2544180	and the important players in the storyline, now the camera will pan by them and the
2544180	2547060	title will come up and you know, it'll be like Khadgar, you know?
2547100	2550300	And so, so you have a little bit of a name to a face and that whole thing.
2550300	2554460	So there's a very cinematic approach to it, which is something that I've really
2554460	2556340	loved in Final Fantasy 14.
2556700	2561300	So I kind of love that, you know, Warcraft is upping the ante in that regard.
2561780	2565220	Um, I've done a little bit of the dungeons.
2565220	2569900	I did the first two dungeons, the iron docks and the slag mines, I think it's
2569900	2570260	called.
2570620	2574740	Um, that's the only downside to the expansion I can think of so far.
2574740	2576900	It's not that the dungeons were necessarily bad.
2577180	2580780	But it's that there is still a lot of toxic people playing World of Warcraft.
2580820	2584460	And I know we just had a story last week about World of Warcraft subscribers
2584460	2585380	numbers are back up.
2585540	2590260	Well, I think a lot of the toxic people came back because I was running with, uh,
2590500	2593300	talking about gameboy.org, I was running with Captain Spike and First Mate
2593300	2593740	Slidekick.
2593740	2597180	We were running one of those dungeons together and Slidekick hadn't tanked a
2597180	2598460	dungeon in a very long time.
2598460	2603420	So he was taking it a little bit slow and somebody spoke up and said, you know, um,
2603460	2606100	well, if this retarded tank would go any faster.
2606500	2611500	And I was just, I just typed in all caps, dude, like, calm down.
2611500	2613660	So we're going a little slower.
2613660	2615700	It's not like a snail's pace.
2616020	2619580	Like, do you have to jump out and start like yelling at people and calling them
2619580	2620220	names?
2620260	2621740	And it's like, oh my God.
2621740	2622740	That's just when they vote kick.
2622780	2623460	Well, we do.
2623540	2624940	Here's the other crazy part.
2625060	2627700	We tried to vote kick because we have three people, right?
2627700	2629340	So we should be able to go get a vote kick through.
2629500	2630740	No, you need four.
2630740	2632700	And the other pug voted against it.
2633260	2634900	So we weren't able to kick the person.
2635380	2639300	So not only, I mean, it would be one thing if there was a toxic player and everybody
2639300	2642580	else was like, fuck you boot, but this guy was able to stay around.
2642780	2647620	Now I realized I can't really point and say this is Blizzard's fault because it's
2647620	2652220	not, you know, it's the toxic environment and it's the people that need to be dealt
2652220	2652460	with.
2652460	2657540	But I have to call it out as something that made me a little bit sad because I feel
2657540	2663900	like when WoW was at its worst, the player base that stuck with it, God love them at
2663900	2666340	least would not resort to this kind of crap.
2666660	2670740	So just don't be a dick if you're playing these online games or any game in general.
2671060	2672140	Just don't be a dick.
2672180	2672420	What?
2672420	2674620	It's going to take five more minutes to get through a dungeon.
2674620	2676180	Calm your tits.
2676980	2681540	Anyway, so otherwise though, they expect the Garrison's super addicting, even though
2681540	2683700	it's kind of like a big Facebook game that they've worked into.
2683700	2684100	Wow.
2684340	2687740	It's great that as you're working on your Garrison or as I call it, Mr.
2687740	2689500	Garrison, as I'm working on my Mr.
2689580	2695900	Garrison, that I will get rewards like gold or I will get rewards like experience for
2695900	2700860	my character or that I can build this enchanting hunt that will disenchant my
2700860	2704660	things for me and give me, it's like even though I didn't level this profession, I
2704660	2705940	could have access to it anyway.
2706060	2708420	So it really simplified a lot of things in that regard.
2708420	2711300	So there's a lot of really neat things that they did in Draenor.
2711780	2715100	Overall, at the end of the day, though, am I going to run away from Final Fantasy 14?
2715100	2718940	No, because the games are really different and there's still a lot, a lot, a lot I
2718940	2720780	really enjoy about Final Fantasy 14.
2721060	2725020	Like, you know, I talk about World of Warcraft being very cinematic, but there's
2725020	2727340	never going to be anything in World of Warcraft.
2727340	2731220	There's just not going to be anything in it like the introduction to the Shiva battle
2731260	2735740	for the most recent Final Fantasy 14 patch, which was so fucking epic.
2735740	2736620	Or the music.
2736660	2738460	I mean, WoW has great music.
2738820	2743700	I'm sorry, 14 with the dynamic soundtrack and everything like is, is a step above.
2743860	2744660	And it really is.
2744740	2745780	No fat chocobos.
2746500	2746860	That's right.
2746860	2748940	WoW does not have fat chocobos, unfortunately.
2749100	2750380	It does have pet battles though.
2750700	2754460	And then, but Final Fantasy 14 is not perfect.
2754740	2759820	You know, I would, the cross realm server and the flex rating and all that stuff
2759820	2762940	really changed WoW for a really, in a really, really good way.
2763380	2765980	And I really wish that was in Final Fantasy 14.
2765980	2769380	Like it is a little silly that we're all isolated on this one particular island.
2769580	2771540	And I can't play with these people over here.
2771540	2773060	You know, I would really like to be able to do that.
2773300	2776900	I'm hoping that is something they will work on as they get to their expansion,
2776900	2777860	Heavensward and all that.
2777860	2780820	But our UK friends can play on our servers.
2781700	2782500	Ooh, good point.
2782500	2783100	Good point.
2783100	2783540	You're right.
2783580	2785940	Our UK friends in Final Fantasy 14 can play on our servers.
2785940	2787940	We can go play on theirs and we can go play on the Japanese servers.
2788220	2789700	And we have an auto translator.
2789740	2790300	That's right.
2790340	2794420	That is, that is an advantage of Final Fantasy 14 versus WoW.
2794700	2800540	At the end of the day, you can make macros for working with other, you know, countries.
2800580	2804580	That's also the advantage of having, you know, Final Fantasy 14 being developed
2804580	2806860	by a Japanese company versus an American company.
2807020	2808100	You know, they're just different.
2808100	2811780	And I realize Final Fantasy 14 is what, only a quarter the size of World of Warcraft.
2811780	2813740	So it's tough to really compare the two games.
2813740	2814300	Or is it a British company?
2814300	2815420	I guess it's a British company.
2816140	2816580	I don't know.
2816660	2818860	It's an English speaking company.
2818980	2819420	There you go.
2819420	2822820	Anyway, so anyway, the competition is good.
2822860	2825620	I, you know, cause I see things in this new WoW expansion.
2825620	2830020	I'm like, I'm pretty sure that was lifted from Final Fantasy 14.
2830020	2831780	I'm pretty sure that came out of 14.
2832220	2835380	But at the same time, Realm Reborn would not fucking exist
2835380	2836860	if it's not for World of Warcraft.
2837020	2840500	I mean, Final Fantasy 14 1.0 is a hot fucking mess.
2840740	2845860	And luckily Yoshi P, the producer, played a lot of World of Warcraft and took a lot
2845860	2850700	of the great things that WoW did and made Final Fantasy 14 a playable game because of it.
2850700	2856060	So as long as the competition between the two and other players, Wildstar, Guild Wars,
2856060	2860620	Elder Scrolls, as long as the competition is a good, healthy thing and keeps these games
2860620	2863420	on their toes and getting better, great.
2863420	2864020	We all win.
2864420	2866020	FYI, our wallets lose.
2866140	2866380	What?
2866380	2867500	I have a red chocobo.
2868420	2869340	Congratulations.
2869340	2870340	His name is Hot Wings.
2872100	2872820	Congratulations.
2873020	2876700	Uh, Pow in our chat room saying, I'm still trying to get my mountain Final Fantasy 14.
2876700	2878220	I love the game, but I get lost all the time.
2878220	2879460	I have no sense of direction.
2879820	2883300	Uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, I think this was a bad luck scenario.
2883460	2886140	Usually you'll be able to kick someone for being an asshat.
2886500	2893500	It's just really unfortunate when time is more important to somebody when you're playing one
2893500	2895500	of the, being a decent human being, a decent human being.
2895620	2900820	Like when you're playing one of the biggest fucking time sync games in the universe, which
2900820	2902380	World of Warcraft is in a way.
2902620	2903180	So anyway.
2903460	2903860	All right.
2903940	2905540	I've just been like, stop being a shit.
2906340	2907260	Pretty much, pretty much.
2907460	2907820	Anyway.
2907820	2910900	And now for something completely different, because there is one other game I've spent an
2910900	2914660	awful lot of time playing this week that actually has nothing to do with MMOs or swords and
2914660	2915780	sorcery or any of that stuff.
2915780	2917380	And that is on the PlayStation 4.
2917660	2923820	I've been playing quite a lot of Geometry Wars 3, which came out on the PlayStation 4 just
2923820	2928860	this past week, uh, developed by Lucid Entertainment, which is made up, as I understand
2928860	2931780	it, of some of the key players that used to be with Bazaar.
2932020	2938340	And now it's published under Activision's new indie banner Sierra, which is not really a new
2938340	2938660	banner.
2938660	2939460	It's an old banner.
2939780	2942740	But anyway, you don't care about who made it.
2942740	2944380	You just want to know, is the game good?
2944620	2948780	And I have to say, yes, the game is, is awfully good.
2948820	2950900	I'm really enjoying Geometry Wars 3.
2951180	2958420	Um, it is quite the departure from Geometry Wars 1 and 2 visually, but gameplay wise, not
2958420	2958900	really.
2959260	2963980	Um, obviously the big trick in Geometry Wars 3 is that now a lot of the grids are in three
2963980	2964700	dimensions.
2964900	2967020	And because of that, they're in different shapes as well.
2967260	2971260	Now, differently shaped grids is nothing new for Geometry Wars, because if you ever played
2971260	2976060	the Geometry Wars game that was on the Wii, which was really underplayed and underrated,
2976260	2979500	there was different shaped maps, maps in that as well.
2979700	2983980	So the different shapes of the stages and so forth are nothing new for Geometry Wars.
2984140	2988220	But in the three dimensions, certainly you have to kind of think about the way you're
2988220	2992500	moving can really change what you can see on a stage.
2992500	2993580	Let me, let me put it this way.
2993580	2999140	So imagine you're playing on a stage that looks like a giant log, like a big, big cylinder,
2999140	3002540	you know, type of log that's very long, but very narrow.
3002820	3005820	Well, if you're playing on the stage, but you're playing in three dimensions, you can
3005820	3011420	imagine as you get to the bottom of the log, if you don't make a complete 180, if you take
3011420	3017180	more of a 90 degree turn, now you're going to flip that so that it's shaped more like a
3017180	3017780	tree.
3017900	3022540	And now it's the long, it's, it's tall on your screen and narrow.
3022540	3023740	Does that make sense what I'm saying?
3024100	3029660	Like you can flip the stage on its side, but that is very, that can really control how much
3029660	3032620	you can see of the ships that are coming and what's attacking you.
3032660	3035700	So if you go in certain directions, it might roll down the stairs and over your neighbor's
3035700	3035980	dog.
3038300	3039340	Fuck off.
3041180	3046620	Anyway, but what's really great about this game is that not only do you have that adventure
3046620	3051300	mode where you have all these different shapes, stages to play and so forth, but you also
3051300	3055580	have, you know, classic mode where a lot of the same stuff from Geometry Wars 2 comes
3055580	3060660	back, such as pacifism mode and king mode and all this stuff is available for you to
3060660	3061100	play.
3062100	3067380	They added a little twist now where you have little companions with you that you can either
3067380	3071740	have be like additional firepower, or they can go and collect the little multiplayer
3071740	3072660	bonuses.
3072860	3074300	They can lay down mines.
3074300	3075500	They do all these other things too.
3075500	3078780	So I like a lot of the enhancements that they made to the game.
3078780	3081180	It still definitely feels like a Geometry Wars game.
3081180	3085420	And if you just want to play like old school Geometry Wars, you kind of can.
3085660	3089820	And what I, what I mean by that is you can play with the old rules and the old enemies,
3089820	3091740	but it is still in the new graphics.
3092380	3096060	But that's okay, because the new graphics for the most part are very good.
3096340	3102220	The only time I get a little overwhelmed is that sometimes I think my little partnership
3102220	3105460	guy that's floating around with me, the one that goes out and collects all the multipliers,
3105740	3107500	I keep thinking that he's an enemy.
3107540	3110420	So I try to shoot him and avoid him, but it's like, no, that's your friend.
3110420	3112860	Don't, you know, you can, you can run up and give him a hug.
3112860	3117340	So sometimes you get a little overwhelmed graphically in that regard, but, um, I'm
3117340	3118140	enjoying the game.
3118260	3119940	I think, uh, I think it's pretty awesome.
3120500	3120820	Let's see.
3120820	3125940	Robert M in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I've heard a lot of comparisons to
3125940	3126940	Super Stardust.
3127180	3130860	Well, if you think about it, Super Stardust was kind of inspired a little bit by the
3130860	3131980	original Geometry Wars.
3131980	3133820	So it's not that far of a stretch.
3133860	3137860	I mean, a lot of twin stick shooters, uh, you know, owe a lot to Geometry Wars.
3138060	3139540	So there you go.
3139540	3142100	Those are, those are the two big games that have been taken up my week.
3142140	3146540	In, in, in addition to the old regulars, I've actually been playing a lot of Diablo
3146540	3149500	3 this week as well, just with Alan has been playing a lot.
3149500	3150660	He's probably playing it right now.
3150860	3154660	He's been playing a lot of Diablo 3 and we're leveling seasonal characters together
3154660	3158260	because I really want to get him to 70 before they pull the plug on season one so
3158260	3159620	he can get his transmog armor.
3159780	3161500	So we've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 as well.
3162220	3164780	Anyhow, enough about our gaming weeks.
3164780	3169340	Let's get to the news right after some housekeeping, a very important housekeeping
3169340	3170100	note for the show.
3170100	3174060	Don't forget next week, December 7th, that is our next episode.
3174340	3178820	That is going to be the early show, meaning we are going to be broadcasting at
3178820	3183420	vognetwork.com at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.
3183620	3187180	And for those of you guys overseas in the UK, this is great news for you because
3187180	3189500	that's going to be eight o'clock at night for you guys.
3189740	3191260	So no excuses.
3191260	3194060	You can be here and participate with the show and call in.
3194060	3198220	We'll try to open up the phones a little earlier than usual so that those of you
3198220	3200660	guys in the UK, more of you guys can call in and participate.
3200660	3202300	We really look forward to hearing from you guys.
3202660	3206140	Certainly if you're here in the States and you happen to be around at noon or 3 PM,
3206140	3208620	you can still tune in and still participate and all that good stuff.
3209900	3214620	The other thing to note is that it will be rebroadcast at six o'clock after Bobby
3214620	3218140	Black Wolf. For those of you guys that are kind of used to hearing it at six
3218140	3220940	o'clock, it will be rebroadcast, but it will not be live.
3221660	3225900	Some of us have some holiday commitments we're going to in the evening, so we're
3225900	3226780	not going to be around.
3227300	3233580	But yeah, next show will be December 7th at noon Pacific, eight o'clock in the UK.
3233580	3239300	Check your world clock and convert noon San Francisco time on Sunday to your local
3239300	3241300	time to figure out when we will be on.
3242180	3242620	All right.
3243340	3247260	Otherwise, twitter.com slash OLR and facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio are
3247260	3252620	always the places to find us and friend us and be a fan of the show and keep
3252620	3254300	independent broadcasting alive.
3254300	3255340	We really appreciate it.
3255620	3257500	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
3257620	3261260	It's been a slow week, but there's still been some pretty, pretty big news to come
3261260	3262300	out of this week, right, Loki?
3262580	3268660	Yeah, Sony has had to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that
3268660	3272220	it produced false and misleading advertisement during the launch of the
3272220	3280460	Vita. And apparently, if you happen to purchase the Vita before June 1st, 2012,
3280620	3285500	you can either get $25 cash or credit refund or a $50 voucher for select games
3285500	3286420	and services.
3287580	3291980	And basically, some of the examples, you know, they were saying that were kind of
3291980	3296700	misleading. For example, they said, you know, they claimed that the Vita could
3296700	3301180	pause any PS3 game at any time and continue to play on the on the Vita.
3301340	3305380	I think they were showing that off with like MLB, one of the MLB games.
3305460	3306140	I remember that.
3306860	3311860	It'll be the show, which I think it was available on that one, but it's not, you
3311860	3315100	know, it kind of implies that you can deal with everything, which you couldn't.
3315100	3319700	And also, you know, seeing that if you own the 3G version of the device that you
3319700	3324220	could engage in, they're seeing live multiplayer games through the 3G network,
3324220	3326980	which, God, no, that's definitely not possible.
3327180	3331380	And to be perfectly frank, there's really no reason to own a 3G Vita.
3331380	3332580	Do they even make them anymore?
3332620	3333820	They don't make them anymore.
3333820	3335100	And I bought a 3G Vita.
3335100	3335740	Me too.
3335740	3341900	Because at some point in the whole thing, Amazon had it like a bundle deal that was
3341900	3345340	cheaper if you got the 3G model or like maybe it was like $10 more.
3345340	3347700	So I got the one that came out slightly earlier.
3347700	3351740	I think it was like a week, it was out a week earlier, but it was the price ended
3351740	3354220	up being pretty good based off what it was.
3354340	3357460	You got a memory card in there and it was not so bad.
3357460	3360780	But, you know, now that I think about it, I was like, you know, they did kind of say
3360780	3361060	that.
3361060	3366180	And then I remember that the 3G really did nothing except, oh, you can manage your
3366180	3371700	friends lists and send messages and do Twitter and Facebook on your Vita if you
3371700	3372420	really want to.
3372420	3377740	But in this age of smartphones, it didn't really make sense because they had like
3377740	3382180	asynchronous multiplayer is basically the only thing you do, which multiplayer over
3382180	3383860	3G would not be fun.
3384100	3389020	Anyway, for most, you know, Sony PlayStation experiences.
3389020	3394420	I mean, I suppose if you were playing a Scrabble-like game on the Vita, then that
3394420	3394540	would work.
3394540	3397940	Man, how the fuck did we do multiplayer then back in the days of dial-up?
3397940	3401700	I mean, shit, you know, I remember playing some dial-up multiplayer games like
3401700	3404420	Command & Conquer and stuff that it was able to handle that.
3404420	3406300	Actually, you've got a good point.
3406300	3409700	Maybe it could have done more over 3G than we give it credit for.
3409700	3414220	I mean, there are iPhone and Android games that do multiplayer that run pretty
3414220	3414500	decently.
3414500	3418940	I mean, there's MMOs on the freaking iPad, you know, so they work pretty easily.
3418940	3419980	But whatever.
3420980	3427660	So, cool, $50, you know, I'm looking forward to getting another rebate because I
3427660	3431860	did buy one, although I don't have my system anymore, but I did pay for one.
3431860	3434660	So I mowed my $50, right?
3435380	3437700	Yeah, this news kind of caught me by surprise.
3437700	3442500	I mean, I was like, all right, I guess if they're going to be giving me, what, $50 in
3442500	3445020	merchandise or whatever, then I just hope...
3445020	3446500	I'll take $50 in merchandise.
3446500	3446900	I hope...
3447900	3451100	Does $50 in merchandise mean like a gift certificate for the PlayStation Store?
3451100	3452180	Because that'd be awesome.
3452180	3456980	I'd rather buy like a PS4 game than a Vita game, which I think says a lot about my
3456980	3458380	Vita, my poor Vita.
3460220	3464300	But I guess I was just kind of taken by surprise because I didn't realize that this
3464300	3467380	was something that the FTC was going after Sony for.
3467660	3472260	And it's not like I've necessarily been sitting here going, Sony's lied to me and
3472260	3475020	Sony had all these issues and dah, dah, dah.
3475260	3479540	But I think we've all kind of been sitting here going, you know, the Vita, the Vita
3479540	3481580	didn't really turn out the way we all thought it was going to.
3481580	3482300	Let's be honest.
3482300	3489780	I mean, people have sued and won against Red Bull for claiming that it doesn't give
3489780	3491140	you the ability to fly.
3491140	3496300	So, I mean, I'm not surprised that, you know, that they...
3497780	3499500	It doesn't really give me wings?
3499620	3501180	No, it doesn't give you wings.
3502260	3503300	Does it give me horns?
3504580	3508900	So, you know, I just I guess I'm not surprised that they did this.
3510460	3515460	Cool. I mean, hey, you know, if I can get in on this and sure, yeah, I'll take, you
3515460	3516260	know, some merchandise.
3516260	3519300	Was that just because you're like, oh, hey, free shit or is this...
3519300	3519780	Exactly.
3519940	3520660	Hey, free shit.
3520660	3521900	Nah, oh, I was duped.
3522500	3525620	I mean, it was kind of underwhelming some of the stuff that they came out with.
3525620	3529620	Like, you know, I was hoping that the Call of Duty game was going to be good and I was
3529620	3533500	hoping, you know, that they'd have a Grand Theft Auto game on the Vita or, you know,
3533500	3534540	Resistance and stuff.
3534540	3536020	And all those games kind of were lame.
3536020	3538300	And it's not necessarily Sony's fault.
3540020	3544580	But it's just it didn't really come through with the promise of this portable gaming
3544580	3547460	platform that was going to be so much better than the PSP was.
3547620	3551260	And it just really kind of turned out like the PSP, if not maybe a little bit worse.
3551900	3556060	I would definitely, you know, say there's a part of me, though, that although I didn't
3556060	3561500	necessarily have a problem with the Vita per se, I mean, that was rooted in these
3561500	3563900	issues that they got slapped on the wrist over.
3563900	3567180	I mean, my issue is just that they weren't really putting out games on it.
3567180	3569820	They had a pretty strong launch and then it dried up.
3569820	3572900	And it's not even like the Wii U where they trickled out.
3572900	3576500	And now the Wii U has a pretty impressive backlog of good games to play.
3576660	3580140	But the Vita never even it was like, oh, you could just, you know, play your PlayStation
3580140	3580540	four.
3580540	3584660	We have we have a lot of indie games that are on every other platform down with getting
3584660	3590140	one again, if I could play my PlayStation four games over the Internet, you know,
3590140	3594100	through my work's Wi-Fi, if it was going to be fast enough to do that.
3594100	3595220	But I don't think it is.
3595220	3598860	So, you know, unfortunately, I just can't see myself doing that.
3598860	3601180	But there is a part of me that goes, you know what?
3601180	3605340	They did say you'd be able to do 3G multiplayer and you can't do that.
3605380	3608380	And they did really make it seem like you were going to be able to pick up all your
3608380	3610300	PlayStation games and do the streaming.
3610300	3610780	You can do that.
3610780	3612500	So there is a part of me that's like, you know what?
3612940	3616980	Some some people do need to get slapped on the wrist for all these outrageous claims.
3616980	3619740	What about I mean, what about I guess it's concept, though.
3619740	3620740	But what about the Kinect?
3620740	3621740	I mean, the same type of thing.
3621740	3625300	They said they promised me I'd be able to scan in my skateboard and be able to use that
3625300	3626260	skateboard in the game.
3626260	3627580	Oh, but that game got canceled.
3628660	3633500	Right. No, that you know, they have that feature, but it ended up being, oh, yeah, you
3633500	3637100	can scan in a picture, but it's just going to pick up the color and it's going to be
3637100	3640060	for, you know, was it that Kinect car racing game?
3640060	3644140	And now every color that you'd scan to be like pink because that camera was shit.
3644140	3647660	Now, Loki, on Xbox one, you can scan your face and put it in.
3647660	3649460	Oh, yeah, that's so much better.
3649660	3653820	Yeah, that's not an impossible task.
3653820	3658740	You know, you have to have like the proper lighting and professional studio set up and
3658740	3661900	yet, you know, multiple shots of your face.
3661900	3664620	And it still looks like fucking Quasimodo when you're done.
3664620	3666780	So, yeah, no thanks.
3668580	3670660	I'm OK, I don't need my face in the game.
3671420	3674860	Dark Sakura, do you believe the Sony should have been slapped on the wrist about this
3674860	3676180	whole thing, the way they're being?
3676860	3678220	Yeah, false advertising.
3678300	3682220	Yeah, really. I mean, they might probably put it out with the expectation that it was
3682220	3685340	going to be able to do that, but reality and expectation can be two different things.
3686180	3689260	So at the very least, I think that.
3692020	3696300	Having some sort of compensation for the lack thereof is a good idea.
3696580	3701180	Yeah. Boy, so more bad news about the Vita for Sony.
3701220	3706060	I mean, it really seems like that platform is going kaput, unless that PlayStation Vita
3706060	3710780	TV or whatever can really turn that can really do well for him, because, I mean, I can
3710780	3712660	only see the price of that going down.
3712740	3714580	And honestly, it's a good alternative.
3714580	3719180	If you're looking for something to stream Netflix on or something, it's not bad.
3719180	3723300	And plus, if you're looking like to get in on some of these digital games and if you
3723300	3725900	have PlayStation Plus, you already have a library for that thing.
3725940	3729700	And there are those few Vita games that you really do need to play.
3729740	3731460	It's like there's Persona 4, right?
3731500	3735180	I mean, there are some Vita games that you are missing out on by not having it.
3735220	3738980	I mean, you could probably count them on one hand, but you could have a place to play
3738980	3739660	those, you know.
3740460	3742900	Well, Persona 4, that was just on PlayStation 3.
3743060	3746300	Isn't the Vita one the definitive version that they add extra stuff to it or something?
3746340	3747180	I don't know.
3747380	3755020	Yeah, but yeah, I mean, it's not a bad platform and, you know, at least it's region
3755020	3755460	free.
3756300	3756940	That's true.
3756980	3757740	There is always that.
3757780	3762180	It's your only region free handheld at this point, because, thank you, Nintendo.
3762820	3767620	Well, speaking of Nintendo and handhelds, actually, Nintendo filed a very interesting
3767620	3768700	patent this week.
3769700	3774300	One of the posters over on the big NeoGAF forum found this, that there was actually a
3774300	3780660	patent filed by Nintendo, which regards emulation of classic Game Boy titles on
3780660	3786100	various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
3786380	3789900	And you could see all the blah, blah, blahs if you, you know, really want to kind of
3789900	3790700	read through this.
3791300	3796700	But essentially, at the end of the day, it talks about emulation of the Game Boy on
3796940	3800220	smartphones, tablets, other types of screens.
3800220	3803620	Like, think about, like, when you're on an airplane and, you know, you could, do you
3803620	3806340	know, you can play, like, games on those TV, depending on what airline is.
3806340	3808660	You can, like, play games now on those airline TVs.
3808940	3811500	You know, it covers all sorts of things like that.
3812260	3815660	So this has a lot of people going, is Nintendo.
3815660	3821020	I mean, Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure from investors to do more with
3821020	3824780	iPhones and Android devices because mobile's where it's at, right?
3824820	3828020	Even though for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.
3828020	3831700	Or is this a way to get, you know, strikes against people that make emulators for those
3831700	3832300	platforms?
3832300	3835540	Well, and that's what I wonder as well, is that, is it really about Nintendo wants to do
3835540	3839140	something in themselves or they want to stop other people from doing it so that people
3839140	3840300	have to buy a 3DS?
3840300	3841340	But can they patent that?
3841340	3845460	I mean, if, you know, other people have come up with emulators, but I mean, they, I would
3845460	3849140	say other people came up with emulators before Nintendo came up with an emulator for
3849140	3849980	those things.
3850260	3852100	It'd be kind of hard to patent that.
3852100	3853780	I would, it's hard to patent software.
3854340	3859300	Yes, but at the same time, Nintendo probably patented it, you know, or Nintendo probably
3859300	3864460	invented the emulator while the Game Boy hardware was still under patent.
3864460	3867340	Because, you know, hardware patents expire after a certain amount of time.
3867340	3872060	That's why you have devices like the Retron console that will play all that stuff, because
3872060	3874260	technically they're allowed to do that.
3875140	3878340	It's kind of a gray area legally, but it's one of those things.
3878340	3881500	I'm surprised we haven't seen like a Retron type console for handhelds.
3882380	3886300	The Retron 5 takes Game Boy Advance, which means Game Boy regular as well.
3886940	3888940	It's, that's one of the five systems that it takes.
3888940	3893740	So, and if you think about it, you could always run it through a Super Game Boy, do it
3893740	3894180	that way.
3894380	3895540	So in a way it does.
3896340	3900220	Which, there you go, that would have been the first Game Boy emulator, right?
3900380	3901500	Would have been the Super Game Boy.
3902980	3907140	Sort of, I guess, but that's a hardware emulator versus like a software emulator.
3907140	3911100	I mean, it's actually, you know, emulating the hardware through hardware versus like a
3911100	3913260	program, like where it's all emulated through a program.
3913300	3915420	See, it's tricky, but you're probably right.
3915460	3920900	This is probably a preemptive strike to make sure that nobody tries to put like a Game
3920900	3923980	Boy, like Pokemon Yellow or something.
3924340	3925500	Are they on the market?
3925820	3930540	Coming up on that, was it, you know, the Retron 5 stuff, you know, where they have all
3930540	3931420	that available.
3931780	3935900	Is that because, you know, after a while the patents expire and they become, you know, not
3935900	3938940	public domain, but I don't know how exactly they do that legally.
3938940	3943060	But is that because maybe the Game Boy ones coming up available, maybe people, maybe
3943060	3947660	they're thinking that maybe someone's going to be able to legally emulate that stuff?
3947700	3952180	Well, or not necessarily emulate, but like come up with like some sort of, I don't know, I
3952180	3953820	don't know what their thought process is.
3953860	3957820	I think part of the reason why the Retron 5 has avoided Nintendo's wrath and these other
3957820	3960660	companies' wrath is because you still have to have all the original cartridges to play the
3960660	3961140	games.
3961540	3964580	But if you're talking about downloading something to your phone, those aren't going to
3964580	3965420	take cartridges.
3965540	3969740	So now we're talking about the precious, precious software is going to have to be, you
3969740	3970380	know, digital.
3970380	3972740	And that's what Nintendo is really trying to prevent.
3973020	3973580	You know what I mean?
3973780	3979260	Again, it's about preventing Pokemon, yellow, red, blue, what other Game Boy games, all
3979260	3982100	the, Metroid 2 and all that showing up as downloads.
3982100	3983460	I guess they could do it on phone.
3983500	3985580	I mean, obviously they've done it on phones already.
3985580	3988300	I just, touch screens, man.
3988660	3989620	It's just not the same.
3990060	3990420	Yeah.
3991020	3994180	DarkTitsuya in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, I think they're just
3994180	3998220	legally covering their asses as far as putting emulators on the various digital
3998220	3998900	stores.
3999460	4003260	Tigerclaw says, people can download paid versions of apps that will work on their
4003260	4004740	devices when they sideload it.
4004940	4007860	So Nintendo making games on it, people will just pirate it.
4008260	4013420	And DarkTitsuya says, I found a few emulated GBA games on the Windows phone store.
4013420	4014140	I'm just saying.
4015060	4023780	I got, one time I got a MAME emulator on the iTunes because it was a public domain
4023780	4028500	game that had slipped under the radar and Apple approved it, I guess, for, for
4028500	4029780	publishing on the iTunes.
4030100	4032140	But what it was, it was a MAME emulator.
4032140	4035140	So if you had any, and you didn't have to jailbreak your phone, you have any type of
4035140	4039820	file tree browser, like, um, what's that program, iPhone box or whatever, you could
4039820	4043380	just plug in your iPad and dump ROMs into the directory.
4043380	4047780	And this game would load all of the ROMs and you could basically turn your iPhone or
4047780	4049140	iPad into a MAME emulator.
4049300	4052820	And this thing was up on the iTunes store for like two weeks before Apple pulled it.
4053300	4059140	So what I'm saying is that if things like that can sneak through, there'll be Game Boy
4059140	4060580	emulators that sneak through as well.
4060580	4061940	And that's what they've already implemented.
4061940	4064100	They have stuff like that, but yeah, I don't know.
4064100	4068820	I've just, I wouldn't hold out that this means that Nintendo is going to put out, you
4068820	4072660	know, like an official Game Boy emulator or something like that, you know, or virtual
4072660	4073140	console.
4073140	4075780	It'd be nice if they had virtual console on mobile.
4075780	4081780	I mean, I just think their concern is that, and surprisingly or not, their concern is
4081780	4088820	that it wouldn't play as well as it would on, you know, like a console or a handheld.
4088820	4092820	So I think that's why they're not, you know, doing anything like that because there's no
4092820	4095300	way to guarantee you're going to get that same type of gameplay.
4095300	4097780	And you just can't do that with touch screen only.
4098340	4098580	All right.
4099460	4099860	All right.
4099860	4104820	Well, we'll see what happens if Nintendo ends up going after anybody in the coming weeks.
4104820	4105300	We'll see.
4105300	4107460	But meanwhile, we have more news, right, Darcacra?
4107460	4110580	Well, we have another company doing the dance of accountability.
4110580	4112740	And that is Ubisoft, of course.
4112740	4117620	We know about the debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity.
4117620	4120020	Well, they finally put out a formal apology.
4121220	4126500	In fact, the apology comes from Yanis Malat, who is the CEO of Ubisoft Montreal.
4127860	4133060	Basically, the quote goes, I want to sincerely apologize on behalf of Ubisoft and the entire
4133060	4134580	Assassin's Creed team.
4134580	4138260	These problems took away from your enjoyment of the game and kept many of you from experiencing
4138260	4140260	the game at its fullest potential.
4140660	4144580	To show our appreciation for your continued support, we're making the upcoming Assassin's
4144580	4147860	Creed Unity Dead Kings DLC free for everyone.
4147860	4151860	For season pass holders, we will also offer the choice of one additional game from the
4151860	4153620	selection of Ubisoft titles for free.
4155380	4156580	And that's the direct quote.
4156580	4160020	So if you got the game, you get some free DLC.
4160020	4161700	If you have the season pass, you get a free game.
4162980	4169540	Free DLC is an interesting slippery slope, though, because, I mean, they never had to
4169540	4171460	charge that DLC in the first place.
4171460	4172500	But I don't know.
4172500	4175940	I suppose at the same time, if you're kind of accustomed to Assassin's Creed games at
4175940	4180580	this point, you knew you were going to be paying $10, $15 for, you know, expansions
4180580	4181540	at some point down the line.
4181540	4183140	It's the business model nowadays.
4183140	4183620	Yeah, it is.
4183620	4184420	It really is.
4184420	4189780	They have what maybe just happened to have, you know, DLC set aside as an apology.
4189780	4190340	Yeah.
4190340	4191940	You know, that could be entirely possible.
4192500	4196660	I think it was actually supposed to be the first legit part of the season pass.
4196660	4201940	This isn't necessarily like when BioWare apologized over Mass Effect 3 and created
4201940	4206820	DLC to give away for free, which in turn delayed all the rest of the DLC.
4206820	4207700	But, you know, that's...
4207700	4210980	Well, they said they haven't necessarily canceled the season pass.
4210980	4215300	They're just giving this away for free and season pass holders are going to be compensated
4215940	4217060	for what they've spent.
4217060	4220900	Because those people took a huge leap of faith and many of them ended up disappointed because
4220900	4223220	that, you know, that lady was missing a fucking face.
4224020	4224420	Yeah.
4224420	4227460	And they're being compensated by way of free games.
4227460	4230820	Dear NPC lady, sorry we forgot to give you a face.
4230820	4231700	Love Ubisoft.
4232260	4234980	I think, uh, pal, I think you're misunderstanding.
4234980	4237620	The season pass has not been canceled.
4238340	4239860	In our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.
4239860	4240660	Yeah.
4240660	4242740	The season pass is not canceled.
4243460	4245220	They did not say it was canceled.
4245220	4249460	They just said that they are giving season pass holders an alternative.
4249460	4251300	Which really the alternative should be Far Cry 4.
4252100	4253460	You should really get Far Cry 4.
4253460	4256500	Well, Far Cry 3 maybe, but I don't think you're getting Far Cry 4.
4256500	4258980	No, Far Cry 4 is one of the games that they're allowing you to get.
4258980	4259940	Is it really?
4259940	4263460	Yeah, so the games The Crew, which is, you know, the...
4263460	4264180	We'll get into that.
4264180	4266260	So these are new Ubisoft games.
4266260	4272340	So The Crew, Far Cry 4, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed, Black Flag, Rayman Legends, Just Dance
4272340	4272900	2015.
4272900	4275940	Okay, don't do Rayman Legends because that's probably dirt cheap now.
4275940	4279780	Just Dance 2015 wasn't a full price game anyway, so really you're left with four games.
4280740	4281860	Far Cry 4 is probably the best.
4281860	4282260	I don't know.
4282260	4283700	I really like to dance, Loki.
4284420	4285700	It's not a full price game.
4285700	4287860	Utilize your full free benefit.
4287860	4289380	I'm not smart shopping.
4289380	4290500	You're not smart shopping.
4290500	4291220	Yes, exactly.
4291220	4293060	Get the full price game free.
4293060	4294820	Buy the other game at a discounted price.
4295700	4296200	All right.
4297300	4299620	Well, what do you guys think?
4299620	4301380	Is this a sufficient apology?
4301380	4303060	Is this something Ubisoft had to do?
4304020	4306740	I think it's nice that they're doing that.
4307380	4312020	Uh, what they could have done is, I don't know, don't release a fucking buggy ass game
4312020	4316500	at launch, especially with, I think Far Cry 4 has got some issues too, but it's not as
4316500	4322260	bad and we're going to get into their next game that's coming out, which could possibly
4322260	4325620	have same issues because they're hiding behind some sort of excuse.
4325620	4327220	So we'll see.
4327220	4332660	And it was already delayed as it was, you know, so I don't know.
4332660	4335940	This is one of those things where Ubisoft certainly didn't have to do it.
4336180	4343940	It's a good face saving move, pun intended, but I'm kind of curious, what is the long
4343940	4346580	term strategy to make sure this doesn't happen again?
4346580	4349460	That's what I'd really like to kind of hear out Ubisoft because you know, you're right,
4349460	4350020	Loki.
4350020	4352900	A lot of this is probably really rooted in the fact that the game was rushed.
4353460	4355940	So I would just like to see Ubisoft say, you know what?
4356740	4360500	We're going to take our, this is the steps we're taking to patch the game, but they do
4360500	4361220	have that blog.
4361220	4362580	So I think they're doing some of that.
4363060	4371140	This is entirely EA 2013, you know, or even 2014 to some extent, because for example,
4371140	4375940	Battlefield 4 was a fucking mess and it took a fucking long time to fix.
4375940	4379460	And so what did they do with their big franchise games?
4379460	4381380	They delay them to make sure they were OK.
4381380	4384260	Dragon Age Inquisition, as far as I'm aware, doesn't have any issues.
4384260	4385140	Got great reviews.
4386340	4390660	Battlefield Hardline's been delayed to March to give it more time so they can have that
4390660	4395860	game polished and make sure that it runs significantly better than Battlefield 4.
4395860	4400020	So I think that they kind of learn their lesson and you need to take more time and get your
4400020	4404500	games right the first time instead of launching them and just like hoping that there's not
4404500	4405140	big bugs.
4405140	4409140	I mean, how do you miss bugs like that?
4409140	4410180	I don't think they did.
4410180	4415060	I think what it came down to is that they launched it and they're like, well, we'll
4415060	4415780	just fix it.
4415780	4419620	You know, we'll fix it in a day one patch or we're hopefully going to get this patched
4419620	4420180	up in time.
4420660	4424660	I think they just did this to get it out so that they can, you know, because they had
4424660	4429620	already delayed it once, you know, from the end of October to come in, you know, at the
4429620	4433860	same time as Assassin's Creed Rogue and whether that was just a timing thing so that there's
4433860	4437780	not two Assassin's Creed games coming out two different times or if it was just they
4437780	4438580	needed more time.
4443220	4446420	This is something that has to be fixed at a much higher level, I think.
4446420	4450420	Yeah, because honestly, I mean, we're all kind of sick of playing beta testers for this,
4450420	4457700	you know, you have a team of testers for these games, bugs where the face is missing shouldn't
4457700	4461780	be something that I mean, I can see there could be a bug where if you do something really
4461780	4466740	obscure that, oh, OK, you know, something weird happens and exploit more like, yeah,
4466740	4471060	like some weird glitch or something or maybe some weird AI behavior every now and then.
4471060	4472180	And that's fine.
4472180	4477940	But like, you know, fate just testing with this stuff, it doesn't make any sense that
4477940	4480980	you wouldn't catch this, especially if it's in all versions of the game.
4481940	4482340	I don't know.
4483380	4483780	All right.
4483780	4485860	Well, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
4486420	4486820	All right.
4487700	4495140	So speaking of different companies with issues, I don't even know why they're I know why they're
4495140	4497380	doing this, but it doesn't make any sense.
4497380	4498180	Activision.
4498180	4504500	So they've been issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos for Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
4505220	4510980	Now, that doesn't make much sense if you think about it, but they're only doing that on videos
4510980	4514420	that they claim are promoting cheating or unfair exploits.
4514420	4516820	So some of these games have glitches in them.
4516820	4521380	You know, you'll see lots of glitch videos and stuff from Call of Duty, you know, some
4521380	4522580	of the past games and everything.
4522580	4529700	But now instead of, you know, taking the time to fix these glitches, they're punishing the
4529700	4533620	people that are finding these glitches and recording them in videos.
4533620	4541460	So they're basically, you know, I guess Machinima was warning its members that, hey, Activision
4541460	4546420	is being vigilant about Call of Duty videos lately, issuing strikes on videos showing
4546420	4547060	glitches.
4547060	4552420	If you post videos highlighting these glitches, your channel may be liable to receive copyright
4552420	4552740	strikes.
4552740	4554020	So please be careful.
4554020	4557300	I'm sorry, but that's not what DMCA is for.
4557300	4562420	DMCA is for stopping copyrighted footage from going out there, not because you don't like
4562420	4564180	the video's content.
4564180	4568340	So this is a slippery slope where, oh, okay, we don't want this video showing glitches
4568340	4569300	in the game.
4569300	4571940	Oh, well, we don't want this video coming out later on.
4571940	4572900	You know, let's take a step further.
4572900	4576820	Oh, we don't want this video out there because it shows a bad review of the game or something
4576820	4577300	like that.
4577300	4580740	That is the, you know, kind of the direction they're going here.
4580740	4581620	And I'm sorry.
4581620	4582100	You know what?
4582100	4586980	Spend the time to fix it instead of punishing fans of your game showing these types of videos
4586980	4587140	out.
4587700	4588820	Hey, you know what?
4588820	4592340	You're probably finding out about these glitches from these videos, so take the time to fix
4592340	4596500	it instead of, you know, now you don't have to pay your testers that much more because
4596500	4598020	you're having people test for you.
4598820	4599300	I don't know.
4599300	4604020	I just don't understand why they're punishing people that are doing YouTube videos of their
4604020	4605060	video, you know, games.
4605060	4610180	And you're absolutely right when you say that this is not an appropriate use of DMCA.
4611140	4612180	That's not what it's for.
4612180	4617300	And I would, I don't know, obviously it's going to be hard for like, you know, an independent
4617300	4620180	YouTuber to fight back against it because, you know, they're not going to take...
4620180	4622820	Because YouTube always sides.
4622820	4624340	YouTube does not...
4624340	4627220	And this is part of what pisses me off so much about YouTube.
4628420	4631300	And this is warning, rant incoming, but there's...
4632020	4635780	You look back at the history of YouTube and all this stuff we've talked about before and
4635780	4639780	the other takedown notices they have and the copyright strikes, the way you fight it, they
4639780	4643940	never side with the people that put them in the place that they're at.
4643940	4646660	That is so fucked up.
4646660	4650100	Like, why is there not a legit competitor out there to YouTube?
4650100	4652100	It's probably because of the bandwidth and all that other stuff.
4652100	4659940	But like, people need another place because YouTube constantly sides against its own users.
4659940	4661860	And they know that for a fact.
4661860	4666100	I bet you, you know, their legal department knows that this is not the proper use of DMCA,
4666100	4667460	but who's going to fight them on it?
4667460	4671700	No one is going to fight them on it because they have so many lawyers and so much money
4671700	4672420	to throw at it.
4672420	4673060	It doesn't matter.
4673060	4673540	They're going to...
4673540	4676020	They can shoot down anybody that tries to take them up on it.
4676020	4680020	And I'm sure someone would argue that YouTube has to be against its users and up all these
4680020	4685220	other companies asses because that's how they stay legal and avoid a lawsuit and copyright
4685220	4687700	suits would be worse and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4687700	4691540	But I just, I kind of also think you're living in a fantasy world with some of that.
4691540	4696340	Like, I get, like, if somebody is going to take an entire episode of The Walking Dead
4696340	4699780	and upload it to YouTube, that that has to be taken down or whatever.
4699780	4703700	But some of these other things that are in more of a legal gray area, like what you're
4703700	4707300	talking about, you know, where it's essentially, you know, fair use and criticism.
4707300	4712180	What they need to have is like actual punishments for, you know, false DMCA.
4712180	4712740	Yes.
4712740	4717220	Because they have, you know, puns, you know, we've even seen this with like, you know,
4717220	4721780	don't want to go there, but like, you know, some of the gamergate stuff and some of the
4721780	4722340	other.
4722340	4727460	You'll see a lot of people taking using DMCA to try to take down videos they don't like,
4727460	4731940	you know, whether it be independent developers who are questionable that want to take down
4731940	4735380	bad reviews of their games or bad let's plays or whatever.
4735380	4740100	Or, you know, publishers trying to take down, you know, videos of, you know, glitches or
4740100	4740900	something in their games.
4741540	4742660	You can't do that.
4742660	4747140	You either let the videos all go through or you don't let any of them go through.
4747140	4748980	I mean, that's the way I think it should be.
4748980	4752020	I am so down with the idea that strike should apply both ways.
4753060	4753940	There there should be.
4753940	4759780	Well, it's hard to see who would mediate that, though, who would determine, you know, whether
4759780	4761300	it's fair use or not.
4761300	4761780	I don't know.
4763220	4765460	Anyway, let's move on.
4766420	4768500	We're going to talk about a story.
4769380	4770900	Maybe this has to be mediated, too.
4770900	4771300	I don't know.
4771300	4776820	But GameStop has opened their mouths and said that they are worried that digital games are
4776820	4781780	starting to become too cheap, and it's deterring customers from buying games at retail.
4781780	4786020	This is a comment from Tony Bartell, who is GameStop's president.
4786020	4790020	We want to help ensure that our industry does not make the same mistake as other entertainment
4790020	4794900	categories by driving the perceived value of digital goods significantly below that
4794900	4796100	of a physical game.
4796100	4800100	When the free digital token programs end, we believe that the industry will need to work
4800100	4804820	together to continue to price goods in a way that sustains profitability and encourages
4804820	4806900	a great innovation that this category needs.
4807620	4811860	He also said that research indicated that the average price a consumer pays for a full
4811860	4814340	AAA game download is $22.
4815940	4818900	Consumers expected to pay about $35.
4820180	4822340	Um, it's supply and demand.
4822340	4826660	I mean, if they're going to get it cheaper elsewhere, then they're going to get it cheaper
4826660	4827060	elsewhere.
4827060	4829060	That's why you don't sell PC games anymore.
4829060	4834580	Well, they probably don't sell PC games very much anymore because you can get it cheaper
4834580	4837060	on Steam or elsewhere at Origin.
4838660	4843220	They're not always, it's not always the cheapest way to go on these digital stores.
4843220	4848500	I would say even like on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace, a lot of times
4848500	4852020	you're not going to see those deep discounts because there's no competition.
4852020	4856980	It's you either get it on PlayStation Network or you buy it physical and that's it.
4856980	4858100	Those are your two options.
4858100	4863060	You're not going to be able to buy, you know, a code for some game cheaper on another
4863060	4865700	marketplace like, you know, Amazon or something like that.
4865700	4867860	They're not going to really have it discounted.
4867860	4869780	It's going to be the same price across the board.
4871620	4872660	Jamie, what do you think?
4872980	4878740	I honestly think that it's just another symptom of relying a little bit too much on
4878740	4879380	consumerism.
4880820	4884580	If you want to have something that the consumer is going to buy, you put it at the price
4884580	4885940	the consumer is going to afford.
4885940	4886500	Right.
4886500	4894660	And there's a big advantage to going away from printed media and the fact that you are
4894660	4896260	creating less waste.
4896260	4897860	It takes up less space.
4898420	4902020	You're actually dealing with something that is not just more economically viable.
4902900	4904980	But environmentally viable.
4905620	4910020	Something that's going to be an ongoing sustainable model as, you know, the technology
4910020	4910740	just improves.
4911380	4917300	And I really do think that GameStop has also made the poor decision of oversaturating
4917300	4917780	the market.
4918340	4920500	You can't, it's like seeing Starbucks everywhere.
4921220	4926260	And unfortunately, not everybody needs to buy a video game twice a day.
4926260	4927940	Like some of us are with our coffee.
4928020	4936820	So it doesn't, you know, as digital distribution is becoming more and more prevalent, it's
4936820	4941220	basically what we ran into with Blockbuster versus having the Redboxer versus Netflix.
4941860	4946180	It's going to be obsolete before too long.
4946180	4949540	They're on their way to obsolescence and they see it coming.
4950260	4953940	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says, well, GameStop, you wouldn't
4953940	4958180	have to worry if you didn't oversaturate with retail stores and dick people on trade-in
4958180	4958660	prices.
4958660	4959540	Kind of part of what you said.
4961220	4963060	Dungeon Buster says, too cheap.
4963060	4966740	Let's not forget the GameStop tried to get into digital distribution with impulse.
4967860	4973300	And yeah, on the PC side and that, or I don't know if it's just PC, but yeah, it just
4973300	4974420	doesn't work out too well.
4975300	4978820	I think that they're still viable as far as, you know, old games work.
4978820	4980420	I mean, catalog is where it's at.
4980660	4984100	They're not going to be able to make a ton of money, new release.
4984100	4988100	And if everything goes digital, there's not going to be that market anymore.
4988100	4994420	And I think, and I've said this before on the show, is that my incentive to go digital
4994420	4997780	has to be because it's cheaper or there's some other value in it.
4997780	5001060	Because when I buy a physical copy, that's mine.
5001060	5006420	And the way the games work today and what we all fought for, yes, we fought for this
5006420	5010740	because when Microsoft threatened to break this mold, they got dragged through the fucking
5010740	5013380	coals and they still haven't recovered in many ways.
5014900	5019940	We fought for that we would be able to have a game, it's my game, I own it, my physical
5019940	5025700	copy, and I can give it to somebody else and loan it and much like a DVD or a VHS tape
5025700	5027620	and they can play it and use it too.
5027620	5028740	You have that equity.
5028740	5032900	I buy the game and I have this and someday I could sell it back or give it to somebody
5032900	5036980	else just as I sell a CD back or something like that.
5036980	5040740	So it has to be about to tear me away from that physical copy.
5040740	5047140	If you charge $59.99 for physical and $59.99 for digital, then I better see what's the
5047140	5048660	fucking perk of getting it digitally.
5048660	5052260	Now, for some people it's, oh, well, the game releases earlier.
5052260	5057380	They will trade in the equity to play the game 24 hours sooner, which is not good enough
5057380	5059220	for me, but for some people it is.
5059220	5059780	That's fine.
5060260	5063460	Um, I got my DLC bonus for Dragon Age.
5063460	5063780	Yeah.
5063780	5068660	Sometimes it's getting more stuff, uh, like free DLC when you buy digitally.
5068660	5071460	And the game was installed and ready to go when I got home.
5071460	5072020	Right.
5072020	5072260	Yeah.
5072260	5078180	But for me, I'm like, I still prefer physical unless digital is way cheaper, like a steam
5078180	5079380	sale or something like that.
5079380	5079700	Yeah.
5079700	5082260	And I wish that they had the dynamic that they do.
5082260	5086180	And they probably, I guess I would say maybe the publishers don't wish that they have this,
5086260	5090820	but I wish that they had that dynamic where you could have the PlayStation Network and
5090820	5097300	stuff as a place where you redeem stuff and then you can buy that, those codes elsewhere
5097300	5098180	for different prices.
5098180	5101860	Like say I want a digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5.
5101860	5106900	You know, Amazon may have it for $39.99 or something one day and then, you know, Target
5106900	5110900	has it for $59 or, you know, this other place has it for $49.
5110900	5114420	You know, having those sales in different locations, you know, that'd be pretty nice,
5114420	5118900	but they don't because it's, you know, I don't know, I guess the regulation that they have
5118900	5123380	on there where you can't mark it down in one location and I haven't marked down another
5123380	5124340	location, I guess.
5125940	5129300	I don't know what the case may be, but I do wish digital games were a little bit cheaper
5129300	5135380	because I, in like with Grand Theft Auto, see I bought digitally just because I wanted
5135380	5136740	to play it early as possible.
5137380	5142020	Also, I knew I wasn't going to sell it back, so I didn't really want to worry about that.
5142020	5144180	And you weigh the pros and cons with every game.
5144340	5147300	Yeah, and like, you know, I don't know.
5147300	5152100	And plus, oh, and also because I was getting $15 back, you know, for buying a couple full-price
5152100	5156580	games, I was going to buy Call of Duty digitally because I got it on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation
5156580	5157860	4 for paying the same price.
5157860	5159140	So essentially got a free game.
5159940	5162020	And then I bought Grand Theft Auto.
5162020	5165060	And so after I purchased that, I got $15 back on top of it.
5165060	5170980	So it made it, you know, averaging out the cost, it made it cheaper than buying it at retail.
5170980	5176500	So you granted later on, I could have bought those all at retail and then traded in.
5177140	5181620	I think one other very important thing to consider with the whole physical versus digital
5181620	5185700	is that, you know, with digital, we're still at the mercy of the cable companies and our
5185700	5187460	internet connections at the end of the day.
5187460	5190820	And there's still a lot of that that seems very volatile.
5190820	5195700	And we've heard about, you know, Comcast testing these 300 gigabyte bandwidth caps and so
5195700	5195780	forth.
5195780	5199300	I mean, 300 gigabytes ain't going to get you a lot of PlayStation games.
5200260	5203780	And that's because you do nothing else the rest of the month, which I bet you play a
5203780	5204900	lot of those games online.
5204900	5206500	You get any bandwidth for that too.
5206500	5213140	So my worry is, you know, what if the shit hits the fan with these monopolies in cable
5213140	5214020	internet service?
5214020	5216020	Because in most towns, it's a monopoly.
5216020	5217220	You have one choice.
5217220	5221620	And if they make a decision that's going to really screw you over, digital may no longer
5221620	5222420	be an option.
5222420	5226100	So it's kind of like, I'm going to need that physical copy to exist.
5226100	5230420	So that's another reason why I don't want to see digital necessarily take over, because
5230420	5236500	right now we have an unregulated, you know, I know there's a big push for things to go
5236500	5236820	the other way.
5236820	5238340	And I think this is part of why it's important.
5238340	5240900	But right now we have an unregulated data industry.
5241620	5246180	Well, and also on top of this, you have the other factor, which is, you know, GameStop.
5246180	5248500	Yeah, you have all these nice retail games and everything.
5248500	5253140	And then granted, sometimes they do sell digital codes, which, you know, don't get me wrong.
5254100	5260260	I don't really see why you would buy digital code from GameStop unless you unless you're
5260260	5264660	trading in, you know, store credit that you have from trading games towards this code.
5265220	5269220	I don't see a reason why you would purchase like, say, a season pass for something like,
5269220	5270660	oh, I'm going to buy Assassin's Creed.
5270660	5274340	I'm going to buy the season pass because all you're getting is a fucking code that's printed
5274340	5276420	on our receipt that you're going to redeem anyways.
5276420	5281460	I don't know why you would pay for that from them and pay tax on top of that or whatever.
5282100	5284100	But you also have all these indie games.
5284100	5289460	Once again, a lot of these indie games that are digital only that GameStop can't sell
5290900	5294020	or even steam games, you know, GameStop can't really sell that.
5294020	5296260	They can only sell steam cards or, you know,
5296260	5299860	occasional box games that happen to have a steam code in them or whatever.
5301620	5305300	So that's kind of a good percentage of the market that they're not able to touch.
5306100	5308020	It would be nice to be able to resell some of the games.
5308660	5311460	I have a lot of steam games that I got up to 90%
5311460	5314420	because of all those games I've been buying of unplayed games.
5314420	5316100	Well, it is interesting to see some of the things
5316100	5319540	that steam is doing to give more equity to those downloadable games.
5319540	5322900	And maybe steam isn't allowing you to sell those games yet,
5322900	5326500	but with, you know, the family share and some of the other things they're doing,
5326500	5328180	they're trying to sweeten the pot a little bit.
5328180	5332420	I mean, family share isn't something I can do right now with a physical game.
5333300	5336020	If I'm not sitting, you know, right near the person, you know what I mean?
5336020	5338180	Like I can family share across a great distance,
5338180	5339620	which I can't do with a physical game right now,
5339620	5342340	which is funny because that's what Xbox was going to do.
5343220	5344420	But we rejected it.
5344980	5351220	Well, you know, actually, with iOS, you have family sharing now already built in.
5353380	5355780	There's a family sharing thing for all iOS apps.
5355780	5360100	Oh, so like if I buy an app, then, you know, if my kid has an iPad, they can get it too?
5360100	5365220	You basically, you add their Apple ID into your family sharing plan.
5365220	5371540	Whatever they buy, it is attached to their Apple ID, but anybody in the family can play it.
5371540	5372180	Oh, interesting.
5372180	5375860	And parents can control whether or not their kids can actually make the purchase.
5375860	5376580	Interesting.
5376580	5379460	And so you can also hide some of your purchases from each other,
5379460	5383860	but that way family members will have the ability to make use of everything.
5383860	5385940	Well, like say, you know, mom.
5385940	5388900	So the kids don't need to see that mom and dad have been on Tinder?
5389620	5390120	Yeah.
5390120	5395240	You know, well, at any rate, you know, say this, say that you're playing, you know,
5395880	5401000	some violent game that you don't want the five-year-old to be poking at,
5401720	5404520	then you can hide that and they won't have access to it.
5404520	5407960	But I mean, but that's, it's actually been existing and working rather
5407960	5409400	smoothly now for the past few months.
5409400	5413800	Or the subscription to Playboy magazine that they might have, you know, for the articles.
5413800	5415960	Or, you know, bouncing boobs the app.
5415960	5418120	Ideally, like I would like to see Apple approve that.
5418760	5419800	I don't know.
5419800	5424920	Ideally, I would like to see once that PlayStation Now service gets more in the swing,
5424920	5430120	you know, swing of things where you have like PlayStation 4 games or something that you buy.
5430840	5432760	Like, for example, Dragon Age Inquisition,
5432760	5435880	one of the games I was thinking about purchasing digitally over the weekend.
5437720	5440600	But I kind of stopped myself a bunch of times because,
5441400	5443560	you know, I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna have to download that.
5443560	5445480	And that, you know, I want to play it now,
5445480	5449000	but then I'm not gonna be able to actually play it until, you know, tomorrow or something like that,
5449000	5450680	because it's gonna have to download overnight.
5450680	5452200	It really didn't take that long to download.
5452920	5456280	All right, let's move on though, because we're running a little long.
5456280	5457480	We still got plenty of ground to cover.
5457480	5459720	So I'm gonna go to the next story over with Dark Sakura.
5460360	5462200	Well, back to Ubisoft.
5463080	5466840	It looks like they are learning their lesson with some of this too, because for the crew,
5468120	5469960	the online racing game that's going to be coming out,
5470920	5474840	they're basically not giving reviewers any early access.
5474840	5477480	Everyone reviews it after the game is already out.
5478040	5483000	Um, the servers are going to go on at exactly the same time for everybody.
5484120	5490440	There is no embargo, but they are requesting that people put 40 to 50 hours into the game,
5490440	5493400	so they get a quote, a full experience.
5493400	5496840	And they do have a warning about early reviews to quote.
5496840	5501000	It says, while we fully anticipate that you might see some reviews immediately at launch,
5501000	5504920	largely built around the preview sessions we facilitated during the past months,
5505000	5507640	or the limited contents of the closed and open betas,
5507640	5510760	they won't be based on optimal conditions or reflect the finished game.
5512120	5516520	There is something a little concerning there about Ubisoft saying,
5517240	5519800	don't read the early reviews of the game.
5519800	5523160	They're going to be wrong because they haven't experienced it.
5523160	5526440	Where could a red flag possibly be in that line of thinking?
5526440	5528200	Except if you think about it this way,
5529640	5534680	there are features that change during beta editions and when you get the later ones.
5535320	5540520	You know, in some cases have we played, um, how many of us have been in betas?
5540520	5543560	They're like, Oh man, this beta sucks ass.
5543560	5543960	Yeah.
5543960	5547800	And then the game's been finished and come out and has been decent.
5547800	5549080	Warcraft was that for me.
5549080	5550280	I didn't like the beta at all.
5550280	5551640	Okay, but let's be fair here.
5551640	5552200	Okay.
5552200	5555160	The beta for this game, the open beta was this week.
5555160	5556680	The game comes out on Tuesday.
5556680	5559320	So how much can you really change in like two days?
5559320	5563480	I mean, I don't think that's going to be night and day different to be honest.
5564120	5568040	I think final fantasy fourteens beta only had the one zone.
5568040	5570360	And then the whole thing opened up when the launch came out.
5570360	5572840	So, I mean, I don't know if it's anything like that,
5572840	5575880	but there can be things that dramatically change.
5575880	5579720	It had other zones a bit further into it,
5580280	5583320	but no one could level up high enough to make use of the zones.
5583320	5583720	Yeah.
5583720	5587240	Cause remember I went exploring one day, high, you know,
5587240	5590520	running past all the agro stuff and found Costa del Sol.
5591160	5591880	I was like, Oh my God.
5591880	5595160	I've got the whole, everything's level 35 here.
5595160	5595800	What do I do?
5595800	5596920	You know, but I'm just saying.
5597640	5602440	And then I got, uh, uh, stabbed in the face by, uh, like the Imperial folks.
5603160	5606200	So, well, I'll be very curious to see what the reviews look like,
5606200	5610040	because I don't think, you know, reviewers are going to necessarily go negative just
5610040	5612920	because of this whole thing, but it'd be interesting to see, you know,
5612920	5616120	was the game kind of a stinker and is that why Ubisoft was holding out?
5616120	5616440	I don't know.
5616440	5619800	I missed the beta just because of all the other games I've been talking about.
5619800	5623080	I wanted to check it out, but oops, I missed the chance.
5623080	5623400	Bummer.
5623400	5626200	They won't turn that into a free demo or anything like that.
5628040	5631720	Dungeon buster and chat says, I really hope they stop calling things a beta when
5631720	5633480	it's really that close to release.
5633480	5637480	I can sort of forgive it because of the game that needs such an online stress
5637480	5641560	test, they need to give it away for free so that a lot of people will hammer the
5641560	5643480	server and they can accurately test the stress.
5643480	5645560	You know, the stress that is kind of needed.
5645560	5646840	Maybe they can call it a gamma.
5647480	5653000	Yeah, that is, that is a term we don't use enough in game is, is gamma or a zeta.
5654440	5654840	All right.
5654840	5658120	Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5658120	5661960	I believe things have slowed down dramatically, but I think there's still a
5661960	5662760	few things here and there.
5662760	5663240	Right, Loki?
5663240	5667000	Uh, they're, they did have, you know, it has slowed down dramatically as we get
5667000	5669720	into December, which is typically a very dead month.
5670280	5674120	But, uh, this week, of course, as we just mentioned, the crew is coming out on
5674120	5679400	PlayStation four, Xbox one, PC, and Xbox three 60 as well.
5679400	5684840	Also on PlayStation three, kingdom hearts, 2.5 remix limited edition be coming
5684840	5687080	out, AKA the last PlayStation three game.
5687080	5689320	A lot of people plan on buying a tradeable pin.
5691320	5694040	We, this is what we ordered it so I could put that on my lanyard.
5695080	5695880	Fair enough.
5695880	5702280	Uh, also the disc versions of Terraria on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5702280	5707400	Then on Friday, ultimate NES remix for 3DS, uh, NES remix pack for the
5707400	5711960	Nintendo Wii U and captain toad treasure tracker on the Wii U.
5711960	5712440	That's it.
5714040	5714360	All right.
5714360	5718520	Let's travel over to Japan on the 4th of December in Japan.
5718520	5720120	Call of duty, advanced warfare.
5720120	5722360	The dubbed edition comes out there.
5722360	5726680	Guilty gear XRD sign in regular and limited edition is out on PlayStation
5726680	5731160	four as is Puyo Puyo Tetris available on the PlayStation four.
5731160	5735160	I don't know how our crossover between Puyo Puyo and Tetris works, but it's
5735160	5736200	like a versus.
5736200	5737080	It looks interesting.
5737080	5737880	Yeah, it's like a versus.
5737880	5742200	One person plays Tetris while the other place Puyo Puyo, which, uh, what Dr.
5742200	5743560	Robotniks mean, mean machine.
5743560	5746360	A lot of you probably know Puyo Puyo as Kirby's avalanche.
5748200	5751480	Also available on the PlayStation four, the crew and little big planet three
5751480	5753800	getting their Japanese releases this week.
5753800	5757960	Xbox one also sees Puyo Puyo Tetris and the crew this week.
5757960	5759800	Also on December 4th.
5759800	5760040	Yes.
5760040	5764440	The Xbox one is out in Japan, uh, on the PlayStation three little big planet
5764440	5767560	three, getting its release as well as call of duty, advanced warfare, the
5767560	5772600	guilty gear game I mentioned before and common rider summon ride comes out on
5772600	5777960	the PlayStation three this common rider on the Xbox three 60 call of duty this
5777960	5783160	week in Japan on the Wii U common rider summon ride and Taiko no Tatsujin
5783160	5784600	controller pro.
5784600	5787880	I don't know if that is to support an upcoming game or if I missed a Taiko
5787880	5791480	no Tatsujin release, but this is just the controller is not the game itself.
5791480	5795560	So maybe if it's like actual Taiko size, I wonder if there is, if there
5795560	5798280	isn't something that's on the marketplace, this looks like it's in a
5798280	5801160	neat little like plastic wood looking stand.
5801160	5801960	Oh, that is nice.
5801960	5803240	This is a nice looking little thing.
5803240	5804440	So I wonder where the game is.
5805240	5809720	Maybe I missed when that was released, but I could also be something that's
5809720	5811000	like download.
5811000	5813560	Like, cause I could see that it's probably something you could download
5813560	5815480	and then the Wii U touch pad could be a drum.
5815480	5819720	Did any of the deluxe Bimani controllers come with the game?
5819720	5820220	I don't know.
5820760	5822120	Anyway, uh, let's see.
5822120	5825640	Also on the Wii U there's a lot of stuff coming up on the sixth.
5825640	5829320	A lot of it happens to be accessories though, but, uh, the big, big, big one,
5829320	5835400	of course, uh, smash brothers for Wii U gets its Japanese release on the sixth.
5836040	5839560	So a lot of people probably hearing about us eating that game up and looking
5839560	5841240	forward to playing it themselves.
5841240	5844360	So you've got to look forward to, uh, there's still more to go on the Vita
5844360	5848840	this week, Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3 comes out as well as Diablolic
5848840	5851960	Lovers Van Dead Carnival in regular and limited edition.
5851960	5854600	Cause the Vita gets way more in Japan than it does here.
5854600	5856440	Uh, the culture is very, very different.
5856440	5857720	A lot of the Japanese games.
5857720	5860120	And in fact, I was looking kind of at some of the stuff coming out next
5860120	5863000	year and there's a bunch of Atlas games I hadn't realized that were coming
5863000	5863560	up.
5863560	5869080	Uh, also of note on the 3DS, Shingeki no Kaijin, Genri Saigo no Subasa
5869080	5874120	Chain and Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3, Derby Stallion Gold.
5874520	5875960	Also on the 3DS.
5875960	5877800	Wait, what was the last one?
5877800	5878760	I just closed it.
5878760	5879480	Derby Stallion?
5879480	5881720	Oh no, listen, it's an Attack on Titan game.
5881720	5882120	Yeah.
5882120	5882760	So that's cool.
5882760	5883560	That's cool.
5883560	5884200	How about the UK?
5884920	5888840	Uh, just Call of Duty on like damn near everything.
5889480	5896440	And, um, Never Alone, uh, Kishima, um, now this is actually in, um, one of the,
5896440	5900920	uh, uh, I forgot the name of the particular Eskimo dialect.
5901560	5907080	Um, but it's, uh, Kishima Ingichuna, which is called Never Alone.
5907080	5911640	And I've actually, uh, it's on my, my wishlist on Steam actually.
5912280	5916760	Um, but it's a, uh, it looks really pretty.
5916760	5918520	So I want people to buy this game.
5918520	5919480	I want it to do well.
5919480	5921320	It's on PS4, Xbox One and PC.
5922920	5923240	All right.
5923240	5923640	That's it.
5925000	5925720	Yeah.
5925720	5926200	All right.
5926200	5927800	I said it was slow, didn't I?
5927800	5928600	I guess so.
5928600	5929320	I didn't think it was that slow.
5929320	5930040	No, I didn't.
5930040	5930920	Loki did.
5930920	5932440	Oh, all right, fine.
5932440	5932680	All right.
5932680	5934040	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
5934040	5937080	And then the classic game of the week, but first Loki.
5937080	5937400	All right.
5937400	5944360	So the human rights campaign has recognized EA for promoting LGBT quality by, um, awarding
5944360	5949800	them with a 100% score in the latest corporate equality index.
5950520	5953240	And it's, I guess the third year that they've received the perfect score.
5953240	5956040	So good job EA.
5956040	5957800	At least you can get some things, right?
5958200	5963320	Yeah, it is very interesting how the quote unquote worst company in America yet does
5963320	5965160	some things so, so, so well.
5965160	5970600	And, uh, yeah, I mean, it does seem like any pride parade I've been to, EA's had a presence
5970600	5970840	there.
5970840	5973720	It's equal opportunity forced labor.
5973720	5976360	They just, they, they just don't fuck over their employees.
5976360	5977960	Like they fuck over their consumers, I guess.
5977960	5979880	They just fuck over all of their employees equally.
5982120	5984040	That's, that's all any of us want.
5985640	5987640	We all want to be screwed equally.
5988120	5993800	Everyone needs to have equal access to mandatory overtime and spousal abuse.
5994520	5995080	I'm kidding.
5996200	5997720	Jokes, jokes, calm down.
5997720	6000200	No, at the end of the day, that is, that is a great thing.
6000200	6004360	I know EA was a sponsor of the first gamer acts and they do a lot with the community
6004360	6005000	and so forth.
6005000	6008360	And let's, let's talk about diversity and dragon age inquisition.
6008360	6011960	Cause it's pretty, it's actually still pretty sad.
6011960	6016600	Well, it's not shoved in your face either, which I think some people unfortunately who
6016600	6018520	are like, why is it matters?
6018520	6023160	All this stuff and dragon age, it's like, well, it's not exactly shoved in your face.
6023800	6028680	Like it's all just diversity of people you run into.
6029800	6031640	I still think it's absolutely hilarious.
6031640	6035080	So one of the pairings happen if you don't romance certain characters.
6035640	6036200	Yeah.
6036200	6037960	I think it's adorbs.
6037960	6038680	No spoilers.
6039320	6039640	All right.
6040120	6040760	Let's move on.
6041640	6045800	Talk about this before the classic game of the week, those smash brothers game cube
6045800	6049400	adapters, uh, did you know they're selling like crazy here?
6049400	6051480	Uh, this is, this is a mess.
6051480	6053000	I mean, they're impossible to find.
6053000	6056360	And of course everybody's jacking up the price of the Amazon resellers.
6056360	6060520	Nintendo sells something that's impossible to find with artificial shortages because
6060520	6062440	they couldn't anticipate the demand.
6062440	6064040	Do you think it's artificial?
6064040	6066040	Do you think it's artificial shortage?
6066040	6070680	Because I would almost argue that I don't think it's artificial shortage so much as
6070680	6075400	it's, you know, I think they really didn't know that this would sell so crazy.
6075400	6079000	Well, then they didn't anticipate the demand so that you would think that we'd get it
6079000	6084200	right by now, considering that, you know, they seem to miss guess that's across the
6084200	6085560	board regardless.
6085560	6090120	Now I did mention that the game is coming out in Japan and some people have resorted
6090120	6094360	to importing the Japanese controllers as kind of a workaround.
6094360	6096920	So I thought that was kind of a clever way of doing it.
6096920	6098920	So, all right.
6098920	6103240	Well, let's travel back to a classic time in video game history.
6103240	6106680	Maybe, maybe it's something that you could actually play on a GameCube.
6106680	6111000	But I actually, even though the classic game of the week only has to be 10 years old or
6111000	6114040	more, I think this one actually goes a little further back than that.
6114680	6117560	More like 20 or even 25 years old.
6117560	6121560	The classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault and
6121560	6127560	find a game that she thinks, hey, forget all that newfangled shit like your Warcraft and
6127560	6128520	your Dragon Ages.
6129640	6131080	Play this instead.
6131080	6131580	Yeah.
6132280	6137320	And I was actually, I will dedicate this one to one of my favorite video casts, Classic
6137320	6143640	Game Room, because I'm picking dude's favorite game that he uses for every, every display
6143640	6144840	and test of controller ever.
6145880	6146520	Trexton!
6147400	6148360	Anyone ever played this?
6149160	6152680	I definitely have not played this game before.
6152680	6155560	Trexton came out in Japan as Tatsujin.
6155560	6157400	It came out in 1988.
6157400	6159800	It's a vertical spoiler shoot-em-up.
6160440	6170760	And it was by Toaplan, which came out later on the Mega Drive and PC Engine in Japan.
6172440	6176120	It is set in outer space and you are a spaceship.
6176120	6178840	You get power-ups, go through different planets.
6178840	6182680	You have an eight-way joystick on the arcade version and a shot and bomb button.
6182680	6186600	You've got five levels and they're bosses, but they loop forever.
6186600	6190040	And you get, of course, more and more difficult as you go in.
6190040	6192040	And this gives us some fucking great music.
6192040	6192760	Rob, would you mind?
6193720	6194840	Yes, I will turn it up.
6201480	6207080	Anyway, it's basically you start off with a power shot as your weapon.
6207080	6209560	You get different icons.
6209560	6212360	You can get S to increase your speed.
6212360	6214120	You get Bs for your bombs.
6214760	6217320	In the Japanese one, it's Tatsujin bombs.
6217320	6219080	In the US, it's Destroyer bombs.
6220680	6230040	And then you basically start with every bomb that you use.
6230040	6233640	You get a smart bomb.
6234200	6236760	The ones that are dropped near the ship and destroy anything in range.
6236760	6242520	And then you also have other bombs that will damage items further away on the screen.
6245240	6249240	By the way, every time you start a new life, you get three bombs.
6249240	6251320	You also get Ps, which are your power-ups.
6251320	6254200	I told Dan that he had a lot of P earlier because he was playing this.
6256760	6259800	You can get other icons up to 10.
6259800	6263080	And the icons will carry over your lives.
6263080	6270760	If you die, you would actually be able to spend your icons so that you can power up again.
6271400	6274280	They put this into one of their other games called Fire Shark.
6274280	6281880	You also get one up or two up icons, which will increase the number of lives of which you get.
6281880	6284840	And these are covered by shooting certain objects.
6284840	6286680	You get different weapons.
6286680	6288520	You get the red, which is the power shot.
6288520	6292040	So you get red projectiles going forward, which is pretty balanced.
6292680	6298120	Green is the Tatujin beam, or the Truxtun beam, that's green moving lasers.
6298680	6301240	And it's the strongest weapon per projectile.
6302520	6304040	But it doesn't have much spread.
6304040	6306680	And then you have blue, which is the Thunder Laser,
6306680	6309560	which basically just has blue lightning that goes all over the screen.
6309560	6312600	Almost kind of like the lightning attack from Raiden 2.
6313480	6315080	But not quite as effective.
6315080	6316760	It doesn't like loop and latch onto them.
6317720	6324120	And of course, if you get extras of those, once you're fully powered up, you get another 5,000 points.
6325880	6328920	It's really a good game.
6328920	6332040	I mean, in easy mode, it's super easy.
6332040	6336120	But when you get into normal mode, it's actually got a decent amount of challenge to it.
6336120	6339400	Of course, it gets a lot harder in the other difficulties.
6339960	6345240	But it's one of, I would say it's up there as one of the best space shooter games.
6345800	6349640	So, again, dedicated to one of my favorite video casts.
6350360	6352760	Thank you, Classic Game Room, for sharing this one with me.
6353320	6357160	Because it was a game I did not play when it was new, but I played it as an adult.
6357160	6358040	So, thank you.
6358040	6358520	There you go.
6358520	6360920	As people should do with the Classic Game of the Week.
6360920	6362280	There it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
6362280	6365400	Truxtun, which I admit is a game I have not played myself.
6365400	6369880	But it looks like, it definitely looks like a competent shooter of that era.
6370760	6371240	Pretty much.
6371240	6371560	Alright.
6371560	6372920	1988.
6372920	6374680	Alright, 1988, yo.
6374680	6375640	Alright, there it is.
6375640	6376920	Classic Game of the Week.
6376920	6378680	We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6378680	6381160	I know we're running long so far, but we still have plenty of show.
6381160	6382760	We have rapid fire news.
6382760	6385000	The Fugal Question of the Week, of course.
6385000	6385880	Emails.
6385880	6388840	That contest from Jackbox Games we'll get to when we get back.
6389480	6390680	The FUs of the Week.
6390680	6396520	And plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6396520	6406440	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6406440	6407880	Live on this Sunday night.
6407880	6414120	November the 30th, 2014 with the 577th episode of our program.
6415640	6416680	Thanks for tuning in.
6416680	6418040	If you happen to be here live.
6418040	6421320	If you're listening on the podcast or whatever to get you through the week.
6421320	6422360	In the car.
6422360	6423240	Via Stitcher.
6423240	6424600	Via the iTunes store.
6424600	6425560	Via TuneIn.
6425560	6426680	Whatever it is you use.
6426680	6427640	Thanks for participating.
6427640	6428760	We really appreciate it.
6428760	6433480	And a big thank you to those of you that participated in our contest last week.
6434120	6435400	If you missed it.
6435400	6438600	You missed it because it was only a one week deadline to get in there.
6438600	6444840	But we asked for your best Drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.
6444840	6448120	And Drawful, of course, is one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack.
6448680	6451800	Which is available on PS3, PS4, and Xbox One.
6451800	6455880	And we all are big fans of what they are doing over at Jackbox Games.
6455880	6459880	And big thanks to them for giving us a code to give away here on the program.
6459880	6463400	And we asked you guys to submit your drawings of Orange Lounge Radio.
6463400	6466600	You only could use MS Paint in the spirit of Drawful.
6466600	6469000	And DarkSakura, I promised you guys.
6469000	6471480	She would come back from her week off and be like.
6471480	6472840	What did you guys do to the mailbox?
6472840	6474120	She filled it up with a bunch of stuff.
6474120	6475880	But I explained to her what's going on.
6475880	6477400	And she picked a winner.
6477400	6479880	And DarkSakura, would you describe what the winning
6479880	6481960	Orange Lounge Radio artwork looks like here?
6481960	6482840	It's an orange.
6483480	6484200	On a couch.
6485000	6485960	With headphones on.
6486600	6488360	Thinking about arrows and shit.
6491160	6493480	It's the poop that really won it over for me.
6493480	6495160	So poop wins, right?
6495160	6495640	Poop wins.
6495640	6496600	So congrats.
6496600	6497960	I'm four years old.
6499960	6500920	So congratulations.
6500920	6502840	It is literally a pixel shit.
6502840	6512040	A good old poop joke won it for Master of the Claw or MXC was our big winner there.
6512040	6514680	So check your email if you happen to be listening.
6514680	6517240	Master of the Claw and check that out.
6517240	6519480	And a big thank you to all you guys that participated.
6520360	6524760	We had a good time going through and looking at all your horrible, horrible drawings.
6524760	6525640	But they cracked us up.
6525640	6527000	MXC is in chat right now.
6527000	6527500	Oh, is he?
6528280	6531160	Oh, then check your email because I sent you something.
6531160	6532360	Yay, MXC.
6532360	6533160	Your shit won.
6535080	6536840	Well, enjoy a non-shitty.
6536840	6540040	I did, however, enjoy the other two quite well.
6540840	6542520	They were very well done.
6542520	6545640	But if you want to win, you have to have dicks or shit in it.
6548200	6548680	All right.
6548680	6549180	There it is.
6552200	6553480	Let's move on.
6553480	6555800	We've got some more show to get into here.
6556520	6561560	And, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6561560	6563000	But first, some rapid fire news.
6563000	6563640	Loki.
6563640	6567880	So this is probably good news for those looking to play some more Dark Souls.
6567880	6575720	Dark Souls is coming back as part of the Dark Souls, was it, the Scholar of the First Sin,
6575720	6579640	which will be coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
6581080	6583960	Now also Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
6584280	6588040	It's going to be, I guess, an expanded edition of the game.
6588040	6592360	And they're going to have some new balance tweaks, new NPCs, and a new expanded story.
6592360	6597320	Plus, well, I guess if you're on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, also enhanced visuals.
6597320	6599480	And it'll be the first time you can play it on the system.
6599480	6601800	So that's pretty cool.
6604200	6604600	Let's see.
6604600	6606200	Do they have a date for this yet?
6607880	6611800	April 7, 2015 is when it's expected to come out.
6612360	6614760	So and that's in North America, of course.
6617000	6621240	And then, of course, since we're just literally, well, we just started December
6622040	6624840	or we will be starting December and a little bit here.
6625480	6629960	Let's look at the games with gold that we have coming out as well.
6632040	6636120	So for this month of December, we've got some pretty cool stuff.
6636920	6640120	Let's see, the Raven Legacy, the Master Thief,
6640120	6645160	which is going to be from December 1st through the 15th for Xbox 360.
6645160	6653240	And then the 16th on through the end of the month, SSX, which looked pretty cool.
6653240	6655800	I like SSX, so yeah, worth checking out.
6657320	6662520	And then for Xbox One, what are we getting for Xbox One?
6663480	6667160	Worms Battlegrounds is going to be the game that you get that month.
6668600	6669480	Okay, cool.
6669480	6674600	And then, let's see, for PlayStation Network, of course, they've already kind of talked
6674600	6677160	a little bit about some of the stuff that you're getting on PlayStation 4.
6677160	6683080	They mentioned was Injustice Gods Among Us was going to be the first full PlayStation 4 title,
6683080	6687320	retail disc PlayStation 4 title is going to be on PlayStation Plus.
6687320	6689880	So that'll be coming, as well as Secret Ponchos.
6689880	6694120	And then on PlayStation 3, they're going to have Deadly Premonition,
6694120	6696920	the Director's Cut, Hitman HD Trilogy.
6697640	6702760	Also the, I guess, re-release of Hitman 2 and Hitman Contracts.
6703320	6704920	Oh, I'm sorry, that's part of the HD thing.
6704920	6706280	I thought that was coming to Vita as well.
6706280	6712760	No, for the Vita, I guess they're getting Final Horizon and a shooter called Titan Attacks.
6714280	6715480	So not bad.
6716760	6717400	All right.
6717400	6717640	Yeah.
6718200	6719640	Free stuff, sort of.
6719640	6721960	Free with an asterisk, because you're paying a monthly fee for it.
6721960	6722920	I'd be nice to check out Injustice.
6722920	6724360	It'd be nice to have another game.
6724360	6725960	Already bought Injustice on the sale.
6725960	6726920	Well, it sucks for you.
6726920	6727720	Yeah, it sucks for me.
6727720	6730280	Well, I mean, honestly, who thought that that would have been, like,
6730280	6732600	one of the first titles that they put on that service?
6732600	6732840	I mean...
6732840	6734760	I would have thought it would have been Knack, for sure.
6734760	6735480	Yeah, exactly.
6735480	6739400	I'm quite surprised that Knack isn't on there yet, because it's worth nothing at this point.
6739400	6740360	Or even Killzone.
6740360	6743240	You know, Killzone would have been, you know, interesting to see on there.
6743240	6746840	Well, perhaps one of these titles will be the next one to be given away for free,
6746840	6749880	because there's a Black Friday sale going on on PlayStation.
6749880	6752120	If you're listening live, you can probably still get it on this.
6752120	6754520	If you're listening on podcast, you're probably a bit too late.
6754520	6757560	I'm not going to read everything that's on sale, but some of the highlights.
6757560	6761960	Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls Ultimate Edition, only $20 on PlayStation 3.
6761960	6765560	$35 on PlayStation 4, which is a pretty good deal, because that game's pretty recent.
6766120	6769720	Borderlands, the pre-sequel on PS3 for $39.99.
6770600	6775000	See, Shadow of Mordor, only $30 on PS3 or PS4.
6775000	6776920	MLB 14, The Show, only $20.
6778200	6780920	And Transistor on PlayStation 4, only $8.
6780920	6783080	Although that was a PlayStation Plus title not that long ago.
6783080	6786440	I think that's the game I bought on Mac.
6786440	6787000	Oh, it is.
6787000	6787960	It was Transistor.
6787960	6789160	It's supposed to be pretty good.
6789160	6790440	I haven't played it myself.
6790440	6792200	I haven't started it, but that's the game I got.
6792200	6795640	I kept looking at Shadow of Mordor, but I just don't know if I want to play that game.
6795640	6799480	I mean, it looks good, but I just don't know.
6799480	6803160	It's one of those, like, I don't know if I really want to play this type of thing.
6803160	6805880	You know, because it's like Assassin's Creed.
6805880	6807400	They keep comparing it to Assassin's Creed.
6807400	6809000	I really don't like Assassin's Creed.
6809800	6812920	Well, we'll see which one of those titles ends up the next big sale.
6812920	6816280	And plus, if they're discounting it that much now,
6816280	6819080	you know that they're going to continue to discount that thing going forward.
6819080	6823480	So this is not going to be the first time that that's discounted that low.
6823480	6827320	Now, it should be noted that Square Enix is also doing a massive sale,
6827320	6830280	but you probably don't ever shop at their online store.
6830840	6837160	If you look at their site directly, that's store.na.square-enix.com,
6837160	6840200	or if you Google Square Enix store, you'll probably find it.
6840200	6844280	There's a lot of stuff, like 50, 60% off on their store,
6844280	6848040	and I would name them all, but we're talking like over 200 games.
6848040	6851800	But you can get things like newer titles like Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn,
6851800	6853800	I believe was $16 on PlayStation 4.
6853800	6855560	Let me tell you, that's a pretty freaking good deal.
6856360	6858280	I mean, granted, that game has a monthly fee,
6858280	6860600	but for an MMO, that's a really, really good deal.
6860600	6863080	You can also get things like Thief and Tomb Raider.
6863080	6867320	I wanted to say, I saw like Final Fantasy II on PSP was like $4.
6867960	6868440	Something like that.
6869160	6871400	They're really trying to unload some of their inventory there.
6871400	6873000	So if you are a Squeenix fan, check it out.
6873000	6876120	I just want the full four thing with the extra chapters.
6876120	6877000	That's the big thing I was looking for.
6877000	6877880	On the PSP?
6877880	6878680	No, no, no, no, no.
6878680	6880520	I want the PC iteration of that.
6880520	6884120	It's down to $6.40 from $15.99.
6884120	6885320	The PSP version though, right?
6885320	6886440	No, PC.
6886440	6886920	Oh.
6887000	6887240	Yeah.
6887240	6889720	So I'm going to be probably ordering that.
6889720	6891160	Does that have the after years in it?
6891960	6893640	It just says Final Fantasy IV.
6893640	6895240	Nah, it doesn't have the after years in it.
6895240	6896600	That's the DS version.
6896600	6899160	Yeah, the after years is the one that I want to play.
6899160	6900840	After years, they never put into 3D.
6900840	6902520	After years, it's only in the 2D.
6902520	6903640	So, yeah.
6904200	6905960	So just throwing that out there anyway.
6906840	6907640	So check that out.
6908520	6911080	Coming up this week, the Game Awards.
6911080	6913560	One of those, this moved really fast type of things.
6913560	6915720	You know, it was just last week you were talking about it was announced
6915800	6916840	and the nominees were out.
6917640	6918440	Now they're coming up.
6918440	6919480	They're on Friday.
6919480	6922360	So I heard that we're going to have one of our listeners there.
6922360	6927880	So I'm hoping to get a Man on the Street report from the Game Awards.
6927880	6931800	But in the meantime, some of the things that we have to look forward to at the Game Awards.
6932520	6936680	One is that Metal Gear Online is going to be there.
6936680	6937240	That's right.
6937800	6939320	Jeff Keeley tweeted out,
6939320	6944440	Hideo Kojima will join us at the Game Awards to world premiere Metal Gear Online.
6945000	6947480	So that's something you can look forward to at the Game Awards.
6947480	6950360	But they already had Metal Gear Online.
6950360	6952040	On the PSP, right?
6952040	6955160	No, it was part of the PS3 versions of Metal Gear Solid 3.
6955160	6955960	Oh, that's right.
6955960	6958840	It was like the other game, but they shut down the servers.
6958840	6959960	So it's not there anymore.
6960840	6961640	So I don't know.
6961640	6963240	So they're bringing the servers back?
6963240	6963640	I don't know.
6963640	6967000	Maybe it's probably a more robust experience than what they have before.
6967000	6968840	Well, we'll find out, won't we, Loki?
6969480	6970040	We'll find out.
6970040	6972040	I'd rather have another trailer for you.
6972040	6973960	No Man's Sky, to be honest, but whatever.
6974040	6979000	Well, Jeff Keeley is teasing also on Twitter because he invested a lot into this.
6979000	6985000	This Friday night, we will showcase more than a dozen world premieres at the Game Awards.
6985000	6987400	So Metal Gear Online is one of them.
6987400	6989400	What could the other 11 be?
6989400	6993560	Metal Gear Online 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
6993560	6994040	Who knows?
6994040	6995240	There could be some big stuff here.
6995240	6995640	We don't know.
6995640	6998440	I mean, some big games got revealed at the Game Awards in the past.
6999320	7004760	Skyrim was unveiled, or sorry, when it was the Spike TV Awards or whatever they were called.
7004760	7006280	But, you know, the previous iteration.
7006280	7008280	I know they're not going to do another Elder Scrolls game.
7008280	7009800	It's going to be Fallout next, but...
7009800	7011880	Well, Fallout 4 could be one of the announcements.
7012760	7013800	It seems about the time.
7013800	7021640	So, uh, Elder Scrolls Online never going to come out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
7021640	7023800	You know, it got pushed back to April.
7023800	7025480	Didn't we have a story on it a couple months ago?
7025480	7026440	I think it was pushed back.
7026440	7027000	No one cares.
7027640	7028760	That's a problem, I think.
7028760	7030680	Yeah, maybe an expansion will be out.
7030680	7031320	Who knows?
7031320	7033640	So yeah, a dozen world premieres coming for that.
7033640	7038520	And lastly, you know, if you prefer to just have your games free, then one that I've recommended
7038520	7042200	before is a game called Path of Exile, which is a bit of a Diablo clone.
7042200	7044040	It's a very Diablo-esque sort of game.
7044680	7049480	But if you haven't checked it out, Path of Exile just got a content update to 1.3.0.
7050040	7054920	It does a lot of changes with PvP, but there's also some new challenge league as well.
7054920	7057240	The Torment and the Bloodlines Challenge League.
7057800	7061480	So if you haven't checked out Path of Exile, this is something you might want to check out.
7061480	7064120	There's also an updated passive skill tree.
7064120	7068360	And if you've never seen the skill tree in Path of Exile, good lord, that thing is a mess.
7068360	7070120	I don't know what to do.
7070120	7071880	I'm so overwhelmed when I look at it.
7072520	7073240	Anyway, there it is.
7073240	7076200	Path of Exile is 1.3.0.
7076200	7078040	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for rapid fire news?
7078760	7083480	Well, there's a game that I should have mentioned in my classic game that I did not,
7083480	7086920	because I finally did the entire full playthrough of Hot to Full Boyfriend.
7087640	7091720	And I'm happy that now everybody else gets to experience the crack
7092600	7097800	and the weird feels and the what the fuckness of it.
7097800	7101720	Because it's going to be on PS4 and Vita in early 2015.
7103400	7108680	It is a game where you date pigeons, but it really goes a lot deeper than that.
7108680	7112040	It has this whole alternate world thing going on with it.
7112040	7119160	And a statement by Hatomoa, who is a manga artist who created the game,
7120120	7123240	says she was really, really happy to see it come out on PlayStation.
7123240	7125160	She never thought that it would be out.
7125160	7126360	And all you need is Dove.
7128120	7129240	So there's that one.
7130360	7138520	Also, in other news, if it ever loads, the GameCube controller for
7142120	7147400	there's going to be a Super Smash Brothers edition for the UK, but it's being delayed.
7148440	7155320	There was a report on NeoGaf that they got emails from Amazon UK and ShopTo saying that
7155320	7161080	the GameCube controller Super Smash Brothers edition is being delayed until sometime later
7161080	7161720	next week.
7161720	7163240	So sorry, folks in the UK.
7165800	7169160	They have to shift more of that inventory here our way.
7169160	7171640	Yeah, we're being greedy Americans again.
7172120	7172600	Sorry.
7172600	7173160	Not sorry.
7175400	7183080	And last but not least, there is an item being removed on December 31st, and that will be
7183720	7185880	Tetris being removed from the eShop.
7186680	7191080	So if you want it, I guess you better get it now.
7193800	7194840	Not really sure.
7194840	7197400	Nintendo hasn't said anything, but I don't know.
7197400	7199400	I kind of think I might be going to get some Tetris.
7200120	7204040	I mean, it's not like you can't play Tetris one of 50,000 other ways with all the various
7204040	7205080	Tetris games that are out there.
7205080	7207560	But the Game Boy version is really one of the greatest.
7207560	7208680	Well, I'm not sure.
7208680	7209560	This just says Tetris.
7209560	7211240	It doesn't say it's the Game Boy version.
7211240	7212360	I think it is the Game Boy version.
7212360	7212600	It is.
7212600	7213640	Okay, because my favorite.
7213640	7215640	I really do like the NES one better.
7215640	7221320	So NES one or the Tetris DS was really like one of the best ones they ever did was so
7221320	7221800	good.
7221800	7222200	Yeah.
7222200	7223640	I don't know if you ever check that version out.
7223640	7225640	The Sega Tetris arcade was pretty good.
7225640	7226040	Yeah.
7226040	7227960	Oh, the one with the gigantic joystick.
7227960	7229000	No, no, no, no.
7229000	7231320	It was just a regular arcade iteration.
7231320	7233080	Oh, I think it only came out in Japan.
7233080	7236440	I was gonna say, because didn't Atari do the Tetris game here in the arcade way back when?
7236440	7240120	There was the huge mungus controller edition.
7240120	7240520	Yeah.
7240520	7244280	But there was also just an arcade iteration that Sega put out.
7244280	7245560	So much Tetris.
7245560	7246840	Yeah, that one was really good.
7246840	7248680	It was kind of difficult, but really good.
7248680	7248920	Yeah.
7249720	7252920	All right, well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
7259640	7265160	Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.
7265160	7271080	You can find us on Facebook at facebook.com orange launch radio and google.com plus orange
7271080	7273160	lounge radios where you can find us on social media.
7273160	7277960	You take Facebook and you take Google and you slam those words together, you get foogle.
7277960	7279480	It's the foogle question of the week.
7279480	7283560	And this is in line with the story that Jamie read us earlier about the crew.
7284840	7288280	The press will be receiving advanced copies of an upcoming Ubisoft game.
7288360	7292280	While it might be easy to peg this on the recent debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity,
7292280	7296200	Ubisoft says that this is due to the necessity of needing a full experience with other players
7296200	7297000	online.
7297000	7298520	What are your thoughts on hearing this?
7298520	7302840	Do you believe more game reviews should be held back so that a game can be fully absorbed
7302840	7303640	on launch?
7303640	7307560	Do you think game companies should hold games back more often or do you use reviews to determine
7307560	7309880	if you will buy a game in its launch window?
7309880	7313640	Now we got a lot of good answers tonight and a lot of them are pretty lengthy, so I'm going
7313640	7317000	to have to be a little picky choosy tonight, so I apologize.
7317000	7320760	If you do want to see all the answers though, I encourage you to check our communities.
7320760	7324760	I'm going to start with Google Plus and Brozime who responds and says,
7324760	7329480	I personally won't buy games without a review unless I have the utmost faith the company
7329480	7331000	will deliver as promised.
7331000	7339160	With Ubi's current trend of poorly optimized or buggy releases, I know I need information
7339160	7341080	to buy anything they release.
7341080	7345880	It's also worth noting Activision and EA regularly put up servers for reviewers to play
7345880	7349160	online with other reviewers before they release games.
7349160	7351000	Why can't Ubisoft do the same?
7351640	7356440	Well, without discounting your point because I believe you raised some good ones, I do
7356440	7359160	believe Ubisoft came out and said it's not going to be enough people.
7359800	7361320	The press and all that would not be enough.
7361320	7362200	There has to be more.
7362200	7366440	It's got to be more and more and more people for the experience that they're going for.
7366440	7369400	That would be also assuming that a lot of people buy the game though.
7369400	7371000	Just saying, just saying.
7371960	7375160	Over on Facebook, let's see.
7375160	7377560	We have Fabrice A replies and says,
7377560	7381080	Holding back a game is to hide a bad game.
7381080	7389320	I read several reviews anyway unless it's a game I know is going to be a good game.
7390280	7391560	Andy R. replied and said,
7391560	7395080	As someone who reviews games as a hobby, I definitely agree that a game review should
7395080	7397240	be held until the game can be absorbed enough.
7397320	7401960	I usually review JRPGs and because I work full time outside this hobby, I don't always
7401960	7405560	feel like I have a good handle on the game in the week or the two that I have the game
7405560	7406840	before it comes out.
7406840	7410200	In those cases, I'd rather hold my review than release something that's not helpful
7410200	7411400	to anyone reading it.
7411400	7414840	That said, I do think it's in the best interest of the companies to try and allow reviewers
7414840	7417240	to get reviews out before the game comes out.
7417240	7420760	Obviously, if they can have a good game that's getting good reviews before launch, that helps
7420760	7421400	sales.
7421400	7425800	I feel that a lot of the onus should be on the reviewers to not release half-baked reviews.
7425800	7429080	Sadly though, most of the big review sites seem to care more about getting their review
7429080	7433080	out first so they can get clicks than about releasing a proper critique.
7433080	7436920	Unfortunately, in these days where online components make up large portions of games,
7436920	7441160	publishers holding review copies until launch might be the only way to get some of these
7441160	7442280	websites to behave.
7443240	7443640	Let's see.
7443640	7445240	Hits Done replies and says,
7445240	7450120	I no longer trust sites that accept terms from publishers to get review copies of games
7450120	7450920	before launch.
7451560	7456600	I will wait for word of mouth from my friends or from independent media before I drop any
7456600	7457880	cash myself.
7457880	7461960	Reviews ought to be based on the experience I would get if I bought the game, bugs and
7461960	7463800	all, so this is a good thing for me.
7465000	7466520	Lastly, Ursa Being Slurpy says,
7466520	7468520	Ubisoft is definitely up to no good.
7468520	7472840	I generally watch YouTube reviews for games I'm not sure about, but some games I'll buy
7472840	7475880	regardless of reviews just because I enjoy the story, etc.
7475880	7478600	Elder Scrolls, Witcher, Psy, Warcraft.
7478600	7480600	Remember how I said I wouldn't be to re-subbing to WoW?
7480600	7483080	Well, my orc shaman is half a level away from 100.
7483640	7484520	I feel your pain.
7484520	7485320	I feel your pain.
7485880	7486920	So there you go.
7486920	7491800	It seems like a lot of people are kind of like, here's something shady going on here,
7491800	7493560	and I do use reviews.
7493560	7496920	But, you know, we have that very strongly worded one there from Hits Done saying that
7496920	7501000	I will not trust a site that buys into the publisher's reviews.
7502200	7505480	So it does seem like more and more sites are starting to push back, though.
7505480	7509080	I mean, after the whole mess with Assassin's Creed, you know, a couple of the big ones
7509080	7514040	came out and said we will no longer adhere to embargo dates that are after the launch
7514040	7514540	of the game.
7515080	7519640	And so I guess this was Ubisoft's way of responding saying, well, then you will not get the game
7519640	7521080	until the game is released.
7521720	7525960	So it's this interesting push and dance that's going on here.
7525960	7528360	We'll see how it affects the sales of the game.
7528360	7532760	I kind of think, I don't know, the crew is coming out at kind of a bad time.
7532760	7533960	It missed Black Friday.
7533960	7537240	I mean, I realize there's still a lot of shopping needs left, but people are so consumed with
7537240	7538440	a bunch of other stuff right now.
7538520	7543720	If it comes out and it's fine, then I don't think it's going to be an issue.
7544360	7548520	If it comes out, it's all broken, then it's going to be an issue.
7548520	7552040	It's going to be a big issue with Ubisoft because that level of trust, you've already
7552040	7555320	fucked up a few games in a row that have come out.
7555320	7558600	Now, it's like we can't really trust you with this.
7558600	7563480	And we know that this is because of some sort of issues with the game.
7563480	7567000	And you kind of knew they were going to be there and you're trying to stop people from
7567000	7569720	canceling their preorders, if you know what I mean.
7569720	7574520	And I just have a feeling even though they are beta testing this stuff, I mean, they've
7574520	7581000	been tested other games before and it still was a pain in the ass to play that day one.
7581880	7585240	The crew, thankfully, I don't think is going to be as high demand to say like, you know,
7585240	7586120	Destiny or something.
7586120	7589080	So maybe it won't be so bad, but I don't know.
7590840	7591560	All right.
7591560	7592360	Well, what's that?
7594280	7596840	I read the first response I read was from Google.
7597320	7601080	I did not read all of the responses tonight because a lot of them were lengthy and were
7601080	7602040	running a little long.
7602040	7607000	So I thank everybody for replying and I encourage everybody to go read all the answers on our
7607000	7609640	Google Plus and our Facebook pages.
7609640	7614920	They're facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash or excuse me,
7614920	7618280	google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7618280	7618840	Blah, blah, blah.
7618840	7620120	I got a little tongue tied there.
7620120	7622440	So yeah, some weeks we have time to read them all.
7622440	7626280	But tonight I didn't because some of you guys got really, really, really lengthy.
7626280	7629320	So all right, let's move on.
7629320	7630760	Let's get into some more news.
7630760	7631400	Loki.
7631400	7637160	So Sony now is planning on shifting their focus towards PlayStation as regard in regards
7637160	7643880	to, you know, their income, because right now they were, I guess, kind of sharing some
7643880	7645080	of that with smartphones.
7645080	7647960	But I don't think their smartphone division is doing that great.
7647960	7652360	They're saying that right now they're expecting to lose 30 percent of the sales by next spring.
7653000	7659320	And, you know, basically, you know, the PlayStation division's been up and they're up by 25 percent,
7659320	7661720	I guess, as much as 13.6 billion dollars.
7661720	7667320	So maybe, I don't know, it makes sense.
7667320	7668840	I mean, go with what's working.
7668840	7674280	I mean, if you're going to try to do mobile and that mobile market's kind of saturated,
7674280	7680840	then maybe it's, you know, focus all your, you know, focus most of your money towards
7680840	7681800	what's working for you.
7682520	7683000	That's cool.
7683000	7686760	Maybe we'll see some better stuff out of the PlayStation side because of that now that
7686760	7688200	they're focusing more resources.
7688200	7692920	Maybe, I don't know, maybe something that has to do with Morpheus when it comes out.
7694120	7694520	I don't know.
7696600	7699640	It can't be a bad thing that they're putting more focus on PlayStation.
7699640	7702840	Don't forget, you know, what else is happening this weekend is that PlayStation experience
7702840	7703320	is happening.
7704360	7710760	So, I mean, even though this is traditionally a slower news period, I can't imagine Sony
7710760	7714920	doesn't have at least one big thing they're going to pull out of their hat at the PlayStation
7714920	7715320	experience.
7715320	7719000	You know, there's got to be something they're going to get that crowd really excited about
7719000	7721080	that, oh yeah, I got to play this.
7721080	7724680	You know, there's going to be something there that's going to have everybody really excited,
7724680	7725080	I think.
7725080	7726600	So, we'll see.
7726600	7730040	I'd be down with a better version of PlayStation All-Stars.
7731000	7733240	Oh, you think that's worth revisiting?
7733240	7733880	I think so.
7733880	7738840	I don't think, I think if they got, I mean, I think the hard part is, you know, memorable
7738840	7742280	characters because, you know, there are a lot of PlayStation franchises, but it's not
7742280	7745480	anything like the Nintendo, but I think if you get the gameplay there, then it won't
7745480	7746360	be so bad.
7746360	7748280	Hell, throw some indies on there.
7748280	7750360	You know, that would be pretty cool.
7750360	7752120	Yeah, we'll see.
7752120	7755080	Well, indies made a pretty good showing at E3, so we'll see.
7755080	7758920	I mean, maybe that's just because there wasn't a lot else to show for the rest of this year
7759960	7762680	because the titles on PlayStation have been a little light, but we'll see.
7762680	7763320	We'll see what happens.
7763320	7769960	Moving on, this would be a game I bet a lot of you would love to see at the PlayStation
7769960	7770520	Experience.
7770520	7772760	Unfortunately, I doubt it, but you never know.
7773720	7780920	Final Fantasy XV, actually, I don't know how many of the other companies Sony got to buy
7780920	7786200	into this, but considering that this demo is supposed to be, what, April next year,
7786200	7789160	it would not be far-fetched that they might have something at PlayStation Experience.
7789160	7790760	This is Final Fantasy XV.
7791640	7796760	Final Fantasy XV, more and more has been coming out on this game, which, of course, a lot
7796760	7799960	of people have been joking is the Broad Trip Final Fantasy, because that's pretty much
7799960	7800460	all we've seen.
7801160	7806760	But anyway, there is, of course, the promotion where you can get the demo if you pre-order
7806760	7811160	Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which most Final Fantasy fans will be getting anyway.
7811160	7817400	But also noting that the demo will be two hours' worth and possibly up to four if you
7817400	7819880	are one of those people that explores everything.
7819880	7823320	Like, if you're still in the Hinterlands in Dragon Age, you'll probably get four hours
7823320	7824200	out of that right there.
7824200	7827960	That's just like a Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pains right there.
7827960	7828600	Right?
7828600	7829880	Or the Ground Zero or whatever.
7830600	7835000	That's, you know, the experience that some companies charge $20 for.
7835800	7839720	It's Final Fantasy XV episode Duske.
7839720	7840840	Is that how you say that?
7840840	7841640	Duska?
7841640	7842120	Duske?
7842840	7843400	Duske?
7844040	7844440	I don't know.
7844440	7845320	How's it spelled?
7845320	7847480	D-U-S-C-A-E.
7849240	7849640	Duske.
7850360	7850840	Duske.
7850840	7851800	Episode Duske.
7853080	7855080	Type 0 launches on March 17th.
7855080	7857960	The demo will come after that, not necessarily at the same time.
7857960	7859640	I thought it was like April or something.
7859640	7864040	So not far-fetched that you might see something about this at PlayStation Experience, though.
7864040	7868680	But don't forget that this game is also going to be on Xbox One, right?
7868680	7868920	Yeah.
7868920	7870280	Final Fantasy XV is on Xbox One.
7870280	7874280	It's just not going to have the same promotion because I don't believe Type 0 is on Xbox
7874280	7874520	One.
7874520	7876040	So there you go.
7877720	7878120	All right.
7879640	7882120	Coming soon, but not soon enough.
7882120	7883800	Let's move on with some more stories.
7883800	7884760	Dark Sakura.
7884760	7888840	Well, get ready to be pissed at Verizon again.
7890840	7895880	I know that we've been touching back and forth on the whole net neutrality issues going on.
7895880	7904280	And there's been talk with the FCC over reclassifying broadband and mobile broadband to common
7904280	7907640	carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.
7907640	7914280	Well, Verizon says that if the FCC doesn't reclassify it, they won't sue.
7915000	7915240	Yeah.
7915880	7918120	Everyone who's using Verizon, listen up.
7919000	7922280	Talk to the company that you were using the service of.
7922280	7927000	Send them letters or change your service if they're going to be acting this way.
7927000	7930040	They've already sued the FCC and won once.
7931000	7934520	But if this reclassification goes through, they're not going to have any grounds to stand
7934520	7934680	on it.
7934680	7938520	They're going to try to suit to have it changed back to what it is now so that they can keep
7938520	7944040	gouging their prices and form as close to legal a monopoly with other companies that
7944040	7944440	they can.
7945240	7947560	Or more of a trust.
7947560	7949640	So keep your eyes on them.
7949640	7953720	I remember what I talked about earlier, the whole fact that we're buying all these digital
7953720	7958840	games, yet, you know, the service that's really delivering that to us is unregulated.
7958840	7960760	So we'll see.
7960760	7963960	It's I think it's still risky until we have some resolution on this.
7963960	7969400	So I think I think a big rude awakening is going to come in for some of these companies
7969400	7970440	in the next couple of years, though.
7970440	7971240	We'll see.
7971240	7971560	We'll see.
7972200	7973000	Meanwhile, lucky.
7973720	7974520	All right.
7974520	7981640	So I don't I'm pretty sure this is not legit, but there's been some videos going around
7981640	7987320	and pictures showing that an amiibo figure is being used to open the Moscow Metro gates
7988200	7990520	using the near field communication.
7990520	7997720	My guess, since the video is not playing for me, is that either somebody put the actual
7997720	8004040	NFC chip from one of those cards from the metro in the amiibo, which I've heard people
8004040	8009240	doing similar things with other types of things, you know, like they put the card in there
8009240	8010360	just look fancy.
8010360	8014360	But I don't think it's legit that, you know, an amiibo figure is actually opening those
8014360	8014680	gates.
8015560	8017160	I'll be hilarious if it was, though.
8017160	8021080	Not that I would encourage the stealing of free rides, but it'd just be really funny
8021080	8024600	if the systems were so similar, but I just can't imagine that's how it works.
8024600	8025640	Yeah, I don't think so.
8025640	8026840	I'd be very curious, though.
8026840	8031560	Like, I'm surprised nobody's hacked one of those on a PC yet, or is that just happened
8031560	8033240	and we just are not hearing about it.
8033240	8036680	That somebody's because they have to have those readers for PC, right?
8036680	8038760	So somebody's reading one of those figures on a PC.
8038760	8040520	You don't even need a PC to read those.
8040520	8041880	You can use read them with a cell phone.
8041880	8044600	My cell phone can read your field communication stuff.
8044600	8045080	That's right.
8045560	8049480	Now with the fancy-dancy 6+, I think you can do that, too, because it's how Apple Pay works,
8049480	8049720	right?
8050680	8051720	So my phone can read it.
8051720	8053320	So you can read them, but you can't.
8053320	8057080	It's hard to write to them, I think, is what the problem is.
8057080	8062280	And you also, I don't know if they have it encrypted or, you know, how exactly that works.
8062280	8067400	And I can't imagine the amount of data that's on there is very, you know, big, but it's
8067400	8068680	probably just like stats.
8068680	8069320	I don't know.
8069320	8070280	It'd be kind of weird.
8070280	8072280	I don't know what exactly they store on there.
8072280	8074520	Yeah, I'd be very curious what that looks like.
8075480	8077960	If you could get in there, you might be able to figure out what else they're going to use
8077960	8078920	it for in the future.
8078920	8084680	Although they also probably use some type of proprietary compression that, I mean, even
8084680	8088200	if you could pull the data, that doesn't mean you could decompress it.
8089240	8093000	If I were Nintendo, that's how I'd try to keep it safe is that I would have compressed
8093000	8098760	data on those things that decompresses when it comes over to the Wii U, which would be
8098760	8102920	another reason why I don't think the subway trick is really, oh, you buy this figure and
8102920	8104120	you get free subway rides.
8104120	8104840	I think you're right.
8104840	8107000	It's somebody replaced the chip or what have you.
8107000	8112680	Well, because if you imagine if they figured out how to do that, just in devil's advocate
8112680	8115080	here, imagine they figured out how the amiibos work.
8116600	8122280	Someone puts a smartphone app or whatever that, oh, look, your phone's amiibo now.
8122280	8122760	Boop.
8122760	8125880	You know, that's an amiibo and it's any amiibo that I want.
8125880	8130680	And I can store all the things or I can mod my stats or, you know, all sorts of exploits
8130680	8131400	you could do with that.
8132360	8137720	Sg100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, my girlfriend has her Boston Metro pass
8137720	8138520	as a ring.
8138520	8140760	She got it from a Kickstarter and it's pretty useful.
8141400	8144680	So yeah, some people put these chips in all sorts of things.
8145480	8147800	I wouldn't even think to put that in jewelry.
8147800	8148600	That's so crazy.
8148600	8149100	Oh my gosh.
8149880	8154040	I think they don't, they sell also now though, those like life alert bracelets, do something
8154040	8158040	like that where now instead of, you know, remember the whole life alert thing?
8158120	8163320	They actually will have a programmable thing using the Bluetooth coming from a smartphone.
8163320	8163480	Yeah.
8163480	8167080	Like some of them are like USB devices now that could have like some of your medical
8167080	8169640	records on it if need be or just all the information.
8169640	8174040	So yeah, I've actually, well, I mean, I use the same function on my iPhone, but yeah.
8174040	8174540	Yeah.
8175160	8175800	So interesting.
8176360	8176860	All right.
8177480	8184920	And Sg100Matt linking to the ring, which apparently is part of the MBTAgifts.com website.
8184920	8185800	I didn't even know that was the thing.
8185800	8187000	That's pretty cool looking.
8187000	8187500	Yeah.
8188520	8189480	The Sesame ring.
8189480	8189980	That's great.
8190920	8192520	The wearable Charlie card.
8192520	8193020	Wow.
8193720	8197720	I love how this guy in this is looking like a power ranger when he's using the, I bet
8197720	8202840	Shane would like that power ranger there and make that picture with a fist anyway.
8202840	8203080	Yeah.
8203080	8207000	And then to kind of go back on them hacking that, uh, apparently there was a guy that
8207000	8211720	actually did that with Skylanders and got seasoned assisted pretty fast.
8211720	8212600	Really?
8212600	8213100	Yeah.
8213480	8214440	Oh, come on though.
8214440	8215960	It's gotta, it'll show up somewhere else.
8215960	8220600	So the trick, and this is, this is goes for anybody that's wanting to do this out there.
8220600	8223080	You don't talk about it until you have it working.
8223080	8226680	You upload to the internet, you get your cease and desist and too bad it's on the internet.
8226680	8228040	Too bad it's already on the internet.
8228040	8228540	Right.
8229800	8233240	Get it on some video site or hosted in another country.
8233240	8233400	Yeah.
8233400	8234920	Don't talk about it until you're done.
8234920	8236120	Yeah, that's how you do it.
8236120	8239880	That's and that, that can also go for anybody that's making a fan game or anything, or,
8239880	8244440	you know, doing translations or something that, you know, one of those companies might
8244440	8249000	sue you because you're using their properties and, you know, just don't, don't say anything
8249000	8249500	until it's done.
8250600	8254840	Well, we were talking about what could possibly be revealed at the PlayStation experience.
8254840	8258680	Well, we don't know maybe something that soon, but we do know something that's supposed to
8258680	8262760	be coming at E3 next year as far as PlayStation is concerned.
8262760	8265320	It's coming from Level 5.
8265320	8268120	This is the studio that made Ni No Kuni.
8268120	8269880	They also made Yokai Watch.
8270680	8274840	And you may have heard of White Knight Chronicles, which was, I think that game was probably
8274840	8277320	a little bigger in Japan, but it was a pretty neat game.
8277320	8282280	White Knight Chronicles 1 and 2 were released here in the States, and they were almost a
8282280	8283480	little too complicated.
8283480	8285080	They had a lot of online stuff.
8285080	8289640	It felt a little bit MMO-ish, but there was a White Knight Chronicles live stream that
8289640	8294280	happened recently, and the president of Level 5, Akihiro Hino, said that they have been
8294280	8299080	working on a PlayStation 4 title, and it will be unveiled at E3.
8299080	8303640	He said he wants to create a game that exceeds the White Knight Chronicles titles developed,
8303640	8306600	and White Knight Chronicles, of course, was developed in collaboration with Sony Computer
8306600	8307560	Entertainment Japan.
8308280	8312920	If you're a PlayStation Plus member in Japan, you can get White Knight Chronicles 2 for
8312920	8313560	free, actually.
8313560	8315720	It's one of their PlayStation Plus titles right now.
8316440	8322040	There was also a White Knight Chronicles PSP prequel developed by Matrix, who made Final
8322040	8323960	Fantasy III on the Nintendo DS.
8324600	8328440	So we don't know what they're making, but this makes it sound like it could be another
8328440	8330600	epic RPG of sorts.
8330600	8332600	Hopefully the demo won't suck.
8333880	8337960	IkumaJP is in chat just going, no, nope, nope, nope.
8337960	8340520	Oh, he really wasn't a fan of that, though, if I remember right.
8340520	8343800	Yeah, but he likes Yo-kai Watch, which I want.
8344360	8344840	There you go.
8346840	8349560	All right, so we'll see what comes out of that.
8349560	8351960	IkumaJP says White Knight Chronicles not big.
8352840	8356920	Well, it wasn't really big here either, and somehow it got a sequel, so I assumed it
8356920	8357880	had to be big somewhere.
8357880	8359160	Is it big in Europe?
8359160	8362360	I don't know, it was one of the sequels that kind of surprised.
8362360	8364600	Maybe it was because Sony was invested in it, I don't know.
8364600	8368600	I just remember the sequel to White Knight Chronicles had the original in it because
8368600	8373320	you had to play the first, I mean, you could start the second game, but it was way harder
8373320	8377080	to start the second game at the base level they gave you than to level a character through
8377080	8377880	the original game.
8378600	8380200	So, interesting.
8381480	8383160	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
8383160	8385000	Every week, you guys email us.
8385000	8389480	Participate at orangelaungerated.com is the place to send those emails, and Dark Soccer
8389480	8394520	will dive into the mailbag and pull out the emails she believes are worth reading tonight.
8395400	8396280	Gross.
8396280	8396780	Ew.
8397800	8400600	All right, Dark Soccer, read some emails.
8400600	8402120	All right, words.
8402120	8404360	All right, first one is a skeezy's question.
8405240	8406520	What's up, Orange Lounge?
8406520	8407880	Sorry I haven't emailed in a while.
8407880	8409240	I've been really busy working.
8409240	8411160	Anyway, my question is pretty simple.
8411160	8414360	In Mario Party, which character do you always seem to pick and why?
8414360	8414860	Lol.
8415560	8417000	Hope you guys are doing well.
8417000	8418120	Have a happy Thanksgiving.
8418120	8419240	EA skeezy.
8419240	8421080	Um, I usually get stuck with Daisy.
8421080	8426600	Um, which I'll either use her or Waluigi, just because Waluigi is kinda lanky and weird.
8428440	8431240	Um, you guys?
8431240	8433000	Sorry, quickly, what was the question again?
8433000	8435400	Who do you get stuck using in Mario Party and why?
8436520	8439400	I always elect to use Peach because Peach is the winner.
8441160	8443640	If I can't play Peach, I stomp and throw a fit.
8443640	8445880	Like, there's no other, there's no other character that I'll play.
8445880	8447640	Do you stomp your little foot and pout?
8447640	8448140	I do.
8449000	8450280	You've played Mario Party with me.
8452280	8453160	What about you, Loki?
8453800	8456760	Um, probably just like the same characters I normally pick.
8456760	8459720	And, um, Mario Party, to be honest.
8459720	8461800	So probably, like, Yoshi.
8464360	8464860	There you go.
8466520	8467560	Next email.
8467560	8469880	Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.
8469880	8474040	I just wanted to give you guys a brief update on the situation with Galaxy as the educational
8474040	8478280	game that you guys reported on having partnered with the New York Academy of Sciences to bring
8478280	8479640	wholesome education to children.
8479640	8482360	Oh no, I can only imagine what this is gonna be.
8482920	8487720	Apparently half of the team has been let go, reducing their headcount from about 15 employees
8487720	8488520	to seven.
8488520	8493000	This includes the company's creative director who co-founded the studio along with the CEO
8493000	8496920	and was, from what my roommate tells me, the only person who was actually able to keep
8496920	8501000	the project together and keep the tyrannical CEO in check.
8501000	8505640	Now that they are gone, they're down to only one programmer and no one is there to make
8505640	8509880	sure the CEO doesn't verbally beat everyone in the company into a figurative pulp.
8509880	8513640	It seems that most of the remaining team is seeking other employment and prospects for
8513640	8518760	the game ever releasing, much less being at a high enough quality to teach children science
8518760	8519720	are bleak.
8519720	8523160	I know that most of the listeners have probably already forgotten about the company, but since
8523160	8527240	you guys initially reported on it with high hopes and I chimed in with my perspective
8527240	8530920	on the matter a few months ago, I figured I would close the loop and assure you guys
8530920	8535400	that Galaxies will undoubtedly be a miserable failure.
8535400	8537080	Yours truly is HP.
8537080	8550520	P.S. I'm a few episodes late, but here's a tribute to OLR for episode 575, Rob Jamie
8550520	8553000	Loki, the only show where every gamer has a voice.
8580680	8584520	But these guys way high up like the CEO, the creative director don't.
8584520	8584760	Yeah.
8584760	8587160	So the creative director probably knew what he was doing with the CEO.
8587160	8590840	Unfortunately, didn't last email hot mess.
8590840	8591800	Sounds like hot mess.
8591800	8592360	The game.
8592360	8594440	I have to read you the subject first.
8595160	8595480	Are you?
8596040	8596600	Wait, sorry.
8596600	8598280	Just one other quick thought on that last email.
8599160	8602520	Whoever, you know, that's involved with that whole thing should like at least write a book
8602520	8606360	or something like at least a manifesto, at least a blog post.
8606360	8606600	Yeah.
8606600	8609000	At least an angry blog post or something.
8609000	8609560	Do the thing.
8611320	8614600	Are you having issues with explosive projectile diarrhea?
8614600	8616040	Join the support group today.
8616040	8616440	Lols.
8617240	8617560	What?
8618680	8619720	That's an email we got.
8619720	8619960	Really?
8619960	8620920	That's an email.
8620920	8621480	Hi, gang.
8621480	8622040	And you read it?
8623880	8624680	Oh, there's more.
8624680	8625000	Okay.
8626040	8627000	Now I have to burp.
8627000	8627400	Thank you.
8627960	8632920	Well, at least you don't have to projectile whatever that thing is.
8632920	8633320	What?
8633320	8634680	Explosive projectile diarrhea.
8634680	8635880	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8635880	8637160	That would be a messy support group.
8637800	8638520	Hi gang.
8638520	8642840	It's that time of year again where people watch a ton of football.
8642840	8643400	Yuck.
8643400	8645240	Stuff their faces with food like no tomorrow.
8646040	8646920	Followed by shopping.
8647640	8650280	That being said, that brings up my topic for this email.
8650280	8653880	What geek-centric stuff did you three buy within the past few days,
8653880	8659080	be it gadgets, games, music, et cetera, either in a brick and mortar store or online?
8659880	8663160	Personally speaking, I did all my shopping online on Wednesday.
8663160	8668120	I had spent a personal record breaking $90 on Steam's fall sale, bought 17 items,
8668120	8672600	and spent $30 on iTunes, which went toward the Medal of Honor Frontline soundtrack,
8672600	8679320	the bulk of Sleepy Hollow season two, Crazy Chocobo from the Final Fantasy 13-2 OST,
8679320	8681960	and the Halo Suite from Halo CE OST.
8681960	8685080	This email is brought to you by Crazy Chocobo, the greatest song ever,
8685080	8686440	despite what Act Deft would say.
8687880	8689080	That's for you to start a fight.
8690440	8691000	What, Loki?
8691000	8694680	I was going to say going to projectile explosive diarrhea or whatever.
8694680	8695400	Oh my God.
8696200	8699320	That'd be a great subtitle for the sequel to Pixel Shits.
8699320	8702920	Pixel Shits 2, projectile explosive diarrhea.
8702920	8703960	Or explosive projectile diarrhea.
8703960	8705720	Let's do the 8-bit edition.
8705720	8706360	I love it.
8707880	8710360	I didn't really buy much of anything.
8710360	8712520	I did buy games for other people.
8712520	8713640	Nothing really for myself.
8713640	8719640	I bought a couple of things, but mostly I ended up finding an M-Flow album on iTunes
8719640	8721720	that I didn't own, and I bought that.
8723080	8723560	I bought the...
8724440	8728600	I pre-ordered Greg Proops' book, The Smartest Book in the World.
8729640	8730920	I didn't realize he was doing a book.
8730920	8732120	He was just here in Sacramento.
8732120	8732680	We missed him.
8733640	8737160	But he took a picture with that cat, the local celebrity cat.
8737160	8737960	Oh, really?
8737960	8738680	I forgot the name.
8738680	8739000	Norm.
8739560	8740760	Norm, the big fat cat.
8740760	8741960	It would put Sharmi to shame.
8741960	8742600	How funny.
8742600	8743480	That was a funny picture.
8743480	8744120	It was on Facebook.
8744840	8748360	Honestly, the only thing that I ended up buying was the Warlords Draenor expansion.
8748360	8749080	Isn't that enough?
8749960	8753480	Because it's being expected.
8754120	8754520	Addict.
8755160	8756920	And the Sega Humble Bundle.
8756920	8759080	I guess I did buy that in the past couple of days.
8759080	8766760	But no, when you get down to the fact that you spent probably about less than $5 on how
8766760	8767320	many games?
8768360	8770440	Yeah, that's less than lunch.
8772600	8776200	I'm still trying to pay off my credit card from all the other tech shit I've bought throughout
8776200	8776600	the year.
8777480	8778600	Now is just not a good time.
8779640	8783400	You know, so that's what I got.
8783400	8787000	I got to pay off the credit card before I can think about any other big tech geeky purchases
8787000	8789000	such as the Xbox One that I want.
8789000	8790120	And I was tempted.
8790120	8790920	I was tempted.
8790920	8792440	I'm getting my present tomorrow.
8792440	8793400	Lucky.
8793400	8799400	My extreme wonderful present that I can't really tell many people about because it might
8799400	8800120	tell people where it works.
8800120	8801640	Why would you say it now?
8801640	8803960	Just because I'm super excited about it and I wish I could.
8804600	8806520	But it's going to be so awesome.
8806520	8807560	Tease of a teaser.
8807560	8808680	All right, any other emails?
8809320	8811000	Um, no.
8811000	8814680	All right, then that means it's time to get into the FUs of the week.
8830440	8836360	If you try to just say pronounce FUs like it's just spelled, it would be FUS, which
8836360	8837320	means we have a short way.
8838280	8839080	Absolutely.
8839080	8840680	So what is your FUs of the week?
8840680	8842840	Fuck you to Mercy Medical in Daphne, Alabama.
8845240	8847800	I don't know without going too much into detail on this.
8848600	8855240	It's where my grandmom was being kept and apparently she has been very much neglected
8855240	8855480	there.
8856120	8860600	And so if I could teleport there and punch every single one of you that works there in
8860600	8862120	the face, I would do it.
8862120	8865960	But since I cannot, I'm encouraging my mother to sue the ever living shit out of me.
8866840	8867720	Just let me know.
8868600	8870120	Um, yeah.
8870120	8874680	So the state that my grandmom is in right now, I put directly blame on them.
8875240	8876280	So fuck you.
8876280	8877480	Fuck you a lot.
8877480	8883080	And, um, it's really difficult.
8883080	8884280	So I'm just going to leave it at that.
8886840	8893720	Loki, fuck you to my cat for deciding to vomit on all the things that we enjoy.
8894520	8899800	Um, I understand cats, you know, have hair balls and they spit up and stuff like that,
8899800	8903960	but she always picks like shit that's really annoying.
8903960	8911000	Like, for example, my son's remote that he chews on is in the middle of the floor and
8911000	8913960	you know, she fucking walked over to vomit on it.
8913960	8915160	And so she did that.
8915160	8919800	Or like, for example, our Christmas tree, which is in the garage in a box.
8919800	8923000	She hopped up on the box to vomit in the box.
8923560	8929080	And now today we have like an Afghan on the, um, couch, you know, that we've been using
8929080	8932200	this like, and she's been actually laying in it and she fucking threw up in that.
8932200	8934760	I'm like, what is your problem, cat?
8934760	8939560	Seriously, throw up on the floor so I can clean it up there instead of, you know, on
8939560	8940520	things that we use.
8941480	8941980	That's it.
8943080	8949080	Uh, my, a few of the week goes to a recent bout of Twitter drama that I'm seeing unfolding
8949080	8949720	tonight.
8949720	8955000	Now, look, I don't watch the walking dead, but I respect that some people out there watch
8955000	8957880	their shows and they don't want to get spoiled on their shows.
8957880	8960920	So some of y'all need to check your East coast privilege.
8960920	8963000	You need to check your East coast privilege.
8963000	8963400	That's right.
8963400	8967480	I'm looking at you, New York city and Boston OL army members.
8967480	8973400	Not that I think you ever would spoil TV shows here in the chat or whatever, but, uh, seriously,
8973400	8978040	if you're going to post spoilers on Twitter and Facebook, not cool.
8978040	8982520	And don't fucking tell your West coast friends where you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter.
8982520	8985880	No, you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter posting that stuff.
8986440	8988840	Rude, rude a tease.
8988840	8993320	There should be like a 24 hour period, at least on spoilers.
8993320	8999160	It's fine if you want to post like OMG or I can't believe it or WTF BBQ LOL.
8999160	9003480	But I'm just saying like, I could tell you what happened on the walking dead tonight.
9003480	9004920	I don't even watch the fucking show.
9004920	9007480	So some of y'all need to stop.
9007480	9008360	You're ruining it.
9009960	9010200	All right.
9010200	9010600	That's it.
9011640	9012040	Yeah.
9012040	9015240	And, uh, some people saying the walking dead Facebook page gave it away.
9015240	9016200	That was really stupid.
9016200	9018680	I hope they get raked over the coals for that one.
9018680	9019800	That was not cool.
9020680	9021080	All right.
9021080	9023080	Uh, let's move on a few more stories for you guys.
9023080	9026680	Then we'll open up the Skype line for some calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or
9026680	9031240	username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word, uh, your calls in just a minute
9031240	9032440	here after a couple more stories.
9033320	9042840	So the head of X-Box Japan, uh, Takashi Sensui has resigned and he basically will stay with
9042840	9047320	Microsoft, but he's going to be working at the US headquarters instead.
9048040	9055720	And, um, you, of course, this doesn't help the fact that the X-Box one hasn't really
9055720	9057800	been selling that well in Japan.
9057800	9059240	Not much of a surprise.
9059320	9066120	They're saying that they've only sold three or was it 38,461 units since September.
9067000	9074760	Um, and I guess the vast majority of the units were sold the first four days, but it hasn't
9074760	9076120	really picked up since then.
9077160	9081880	I've never really been doing much over there anyways, as far as like promoting.
9081880	9085480	I don't think any of the really exclusive games that they've been kind of showcasing
9085480	9086520	for it have come out yet.
9087480	9096280	Um, so I guess now they're saying that the X, the X-Box Japan, um, lead is now going
9096280	9105560	to, uh, Yoshinami, uh, Takahashi, who I guess has been there for 20 or who joined the company
9105560	9109800	in July and has been there or previously before that at 24 years at Sony.
9109800	9111000	So, hey, you know what?
9111000	9111960	He's been at Sony.
9111960	9114680	He knows how to sell consoles, you know, in that territory.
9114680	9119400	Maybe, uh, maybe it'll help, but I'm not expecting miracles.
9119400	9121480	Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room saying too bad.
9121480	9123640	He's a very, very smart man.
9123640	9129080	Um, unfortunately he could be the smartest guy in the world, but, uh, it's, uh, if the
9129080	9134840	X-Box one isn't selling, then, uh, that's going to be an issue because I doubt it's
9134840	9136680	just this one dude's fault.
9136680	9137640	No, obviously not.
9137640	9140520	No, it's not one person's fault that it's not selling.
9140520	9144200	It's, I don't think there's a lot of factors that go with to that.
9144280	9150680	And the fact that he's going to the US side of it, um, maybe can be better use elsewhere.
9150680	9151240	I don't know.
9151240	9151480	Yeah.
9152040	9157000	I mean, they released the system way late there and they didn't really have anything
9157560	9159080	Japanese exclusive out there.
9159080	9163480	They were kind of relying more on the fact that it's kind of the reverse thing for what
9163480	9164120	happens here.
9164120	9167240	Like there's a lot of games we go, Ooh, we want to import that from Japan cause that
9167240	9167960	looks awesome.
9167960	9171560	Well, there's a few things that there's, there are some Japanese gamers that want to import
9171560	9173160	stuff from here in the US.
9173160	9177320	Cause we've got, you know, things like halo and call of duty and stuff, you know, but
9177320	9182840	I don't just don't think it's a big enough crowd to, uh, carry a whole system.
9182840	9183640	That makes sense.
9183640	9184680	Yeah, it does make sense.
9184680	9184920	Yeah.
9185480	9189400	And I would bet the crowd that I just talked about with that as much smaller than the ones
9189400	9191400	here that want to import from Japan.
9192120	9198520	So anyway, um, moving on into one more story for you guys tonight, and this has a lot of
9198520	9200760	people talking on social media and so forth.
9200760	9201640	It's not spoilers though.
9201640	9202440	Don't worry.
9202440	9208280	And this has to be a Nintendo essentially commenting on an interview with GameSpot that
9208280	9213320	Toad and Toadette don't have set sexes or genders.
9215240	9216680	Just sit on that for a minute.
9216680	9221560	Toad and Toadette may not actually be gendered characters the way you think they are.
9221560	9224760	If they are mushroom people, then that would make sense, right?
9224760	9226680	Because mushrooms reproduce by spores.
9227000	9230920	Quote, this is maybe a little bit of a strange story, but we never really went out of our
9230920	9236360	way to decide on the sex of these characters, even though they have somewhat gendered appearances.
9236360	9239880	But I think what I can say is that Toadette and Toad are not siblings.
9239880	9243320	Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they are adventure pals.
9243320	9246280	And that's certainly true here in Captain Toad.
9246280	9255000	So, you know, I think, yeah, a mushroom is a plant and in a way I'm oversimplifying things,
9255000	9260440	but a mushroom is a plant and, you know, not, not everything necessarily has to, you know,
9261240	9263320	have, it's a plant.
9265560	9265960	I don't know.
9265960	9271560	I think some people think way too much about this stuff, but at the same time, I do understand
9271560	9276120	and I've known people, you know, on the internet and from the years that I've done Rocky Horror
9276120	9279720	Picture Show and some of the other conventions I've gone to in the past, I understand that
9279720	9285800	some people feel like they don't fit in on the gender spectrum on one side or the other.
9285800	9290440	So that's where you get, you know, things that they call, you know, Jamie might have
9290440	9293960	to help me out here with some of the terms because I've heard gender queer as one of
9293960	9299720	those self identifying or I've seen by gendered, agendered, agendered.
9299720	9301480	That's, that's the other one I was trying to think of.
9301480	9302760	So there's certainly those folks.
9302760	9305160	So I think it's kind of nice.
9305160	9307080	Representation is always nice.
9307080	9311480	It's always nice to know you're not alone and that goes for anybody who's in any sort
9311480	9312440	of minority, right?
9312440	9317160	And that's why there's been calls for more diversity in video games because there's so
9317160	9319000	many diverse people that enjoy video games.
9319000	9323560	So I think if you are one of these folks, it's, it's maybe nice to hear that, you know,
9324200	9327400	there's characters out there where gender is not really an issue.
9328280	9332920	I think just in this case though, I think Nintendo is kind of saying, you know, if you're
9333000	9337720	sitting there thinking about how does toad reproduce, maybe you should, maybe you really
9337720	9339320	don't need to be worrying about that right now.
9339320	9341560	This is mushrooms reproduced by spores.
9341560	9342120	That's right.
9342120	9348040	And typically when you see a mushroom cap, it's actually part of a much larger system
9348040	9349240	of a single organism.
9349240	9351800	Just saying, just saying, just saying.
9352680	9355560	So, uh, pay attention in biology.
9355560	9356120	There you go.
9357080	9366040	Uh, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, SSG100Matt in chat saying, isn't Berto
9366040	9366920	a guy?
9366920	9370920	That was a whole, that was a whole nother thing that Nintendo kind of got into and the
9370920	9374120	whole thing ended up being, wasn't it like a mistranslation or something like that?
9374120	9378520	Originally, but now I think they've kind of gone with it, but hey, uh, poison's a guy.
9379240	9379880	Yeah.
9379880	9385080	And, uh, the poison is technically not transgendered, but is transvestite.
9385640	9389960	And there's a, but there is a transgendered character for sure in the new dragon age,
9389960	9390600	uh, as well.
9390600	9392520	Cause Jennifer Hale voices him.
9392520	9395160	And it's, um, it's a pretty cool story.
9395160	9398840	If you, uh, read, uh, I mean, I know you're probably trying to avoid spoilers, but, uh,
9398840	9401400	they, they get into it a little bit and explain it a little bit.
9401400	9403800	Actually, the solace stuff has already been spoiled for me.
9403800	9408680	So I spoiled myself on the iron bull stuff just because it's too weird.
9409560	9412520	Raginator in chat says, guy, technically mushrooms aren't plants.
9412520	9413640	They're fungi.
9413640	9414680	Plants have chlorophyll.
9414680	9415640	Mushrooms don't.
9415640	9416520	You know what?
9416520	9418360	I said I was oversimplifying things.
9418360	9419480	So sit down, please.
9420200	9420840	So there you go.
9421400	9422600	Rob's a fun guy too.
9423160	9426840	Actdeft in chat saying, I think adventure pals means other stuff.
9427640	9431560	Um, you're thinking of like our toad and toadette friends with benefits.
9431560	9435080	I think you're thinking a little hard on, I think you think you're way too into this.
9435080	9435240	Yeah.
9435240	9437720	They sit in the closet or at least their spores together.
9439480	9440520	Ooh, it's shiny.
9440520	9445880	Uh, I don't care what gender or whatever toadette is.
9445880	9450360	I still think toadette is, um, not a character I enjoy seeing in Nintendo games.
9450360	9450760	Just saying.
9452520	9454840	Double dash ruined toadette forever for me.
9454840	9455240	Just saying.
9456040	9457880	All right, let's move on.
9457880	9461160	We're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9461160	9463880	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9463880	9468040	If you'd like to give us a call and be on the show, that would be awesome sauce.
9468040	9468840	We'd love to have you.
9469400	9472680	If you have more comments on anything we've talked about tonight or something, maybe we
9472680	9477720	didn't get into again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge
9477720	9478120	Radio.
9478120	9478840	All one word.
9479400	9480840	While we wait for some calls to come in.
9480840	9483000	I'm trying to find the blue shell haiku.
9483000	9487080	I'm going to check on any, uh, it was just something like, fuck you, blue shell.
9487080	9488120	I will fucking wreck you.
9488120	9488520	Fuck you.
9488520	9489320	Fuck you or something like that.
9489320	9489480	Yes.
9490440	9490680	All right.
9491400	9492280	It was totally perfect.
9493000	9494280	Any last minute stories, Logie?
9494280	9494520	Yeah.
9494520	9500920	If you're into nostalgia and you happen to also like looking at code, the complete source
9500920	9504440	code for Doom on the 3DO has been released.
9505160	9511400	And you can actually check it out now at github.com slash old dash school.
9511400	9512520	And it's spelled really weird.
9512520	9519000	So O-L-D-E dash S-K-U-U-L slash Doom 3DO.
9520360	9521800	So pretty cool.
9521800	9523480	And you can check it out.
9523480	9527960	I guess it's, you know, the C source code there.
9527960	9529880	So that is kind of rad.
9529880	9534440	I, even though I don't really understand source code, like what all goes into it, I think
9534440	9537960	sometimes that kind of stuff can be really fun to read about and try to look into.
9537960	9538520	Did you?
9538520	9538920	Yes.
9538920	9540360	A haiku about Mario Kart.
9541080	9542120	Are you kidding me?
9542120	9543560	Who the fuck threw that blue shell?
9543560	9544440	I will fuck you up.
9545400	9545880	There it is.
9547160	9547560	Perfect.
9548360	9548600	All right.
9548600	9552200	Again, it's 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9552200	9554920	I thought I saw a call come in, but I missed it while Loki was talking.
9554920	9556680	So give you another chance there.
9556680	9557240	No, that's fine.
9558760	9560200	You have a right to do your thing.
9560200	9562600	Do you have any other stories while we wait for the phone to light up again?
9562600	9566760	No, but I know that there's that Call of Duty online that's in China.
9566760	9571960	And so I'm actually going to check out, see if I can play that this weekend or next week
9571960	9572920	because it looks pretty cool.
9572920	9577800	It's basically like the modern Call of Duty stuff in the old Call of Duty Modern Warfare
9577800	9580680	maps, which is basically what I want to play.
9580920	9583400	New Call of Duty on those awesome maps.
9583400	9585400	So there you go.
9585400	9586200	I want to check that out.
9586200	9586440	All right.
9586440	9587880	Let's go to the phones because it's lighting up.
9587880	9588920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9588920	9589320	Who's this?
9590120	9590920	Pal here.
9590920	9591400	Hey, Pal.
9591400	9591880	How you doing?
9592760	9593240	Pretty good.
9593240	9594360	Packing, packing.
9594360	9595640	So, but everything okay.
9596200	9596840	What's that?
9596840	9598280	You packing.
9598280	9600920	I need, I'm moving in a month or so.
9600920	9606440	So I'm just packing and pack the video games last.
9606440	9607560	Pack the video games last.
9607560	9608920	You'll need something to entertain yourself.
9609480	9610120	Yep.
9610120	9610520	What's up?
9611240	9617480	I was going to recommend a Vita game that I bought recently.
9617480	9622840	Ah, since early in the show, we were talking about the Vita settlement and we were kind
9622840	9626600	of talking about, eh, there's not, it doesn't seem like there's a lot, a lot on the Vita
9626600	9627720	right now to make it worth it.
9627720	9630360	But you, you think there's something that is worth checking out.
9630360	9631000	Tell us about it.
9632360	9635400	I don't think it's amazing, but I'm really enjoying it.
9635400	9640040	It's called a Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1.
9640680	9642200	I'd say three times faster.
9642200	9643080	I've heard of this.
9643080	9643580	Okay.
9644840	9646440	I'm enjoying it more than I expect.
9647480	9655160	It's basically JRPG with a lot of anime looking, you know, graphics.
9655960	9659880	But I kind of really enjoying it.
9659880	9663640	It's kind of like, it's self-aware.
9663640	9665480	So I'm not too sure that some people might like it.
9665480	9671320	Some people might not, but it's basically four goddesses who represent each of the
9671320	9673800	consoles in the nineties.
9673800	9679240	So one is supposed to be PlayStation, Sega, Nintendo, and Microsoft.
9679240	9679740	Really?
9680520	9685640	And they're literally fighting a war that is called Console Wars.
9685640	9689880	And they're fighting for such a long time that they don't remember what they're fighting
9689880	9690200	for.
9690200	9698200	So it's really silly and absurd, but at the same time, the fighting system is pretty interesting.
9698840	9704440	Since in some point you can modify your own engines and even you kind of create your own
9704440	9705480	quest if you want to.
9706280	9710120	So it's extremely self-aware.
9710120	9712360	If you like anime, you might like it.
9713640	9717240	But I think it's kind of something nice to have on the go.
9717240	9720680	So it's not around 10 minutes you can finish a quest.
9720680	9722360	So it's pretty fast.
9722920	9724120	There is some text.
9724120	9726520	It takes like two minutes between quests.
9726520	9728680	So it's not that huge dialogue.
9728680	9730680	You know, I've heard of this game before.
9730680	9731800	I just didn't know a lot about it.
9731800	9736280	I knew it was a JRPG, but that sounds really funny how it's all the different games.
9736280	9740840	I'm assuming it's not so in your face, but it's very subtly these different consoles
9740840	9741800	involve the Console Wars.
9741800	9742680	That sounds kind of awesome.
9743320	9747000	Two important things regarding the game.
9747000	9753080	One is if people want to check it out, be extremely aware of the title.
9753080	9756920	Be sure you get one that says dimension Obtunia.
9756920	9759640	The one that says at the end Rebirth 1.
9760680	9765400	Because that's the remake done for the beta and it's much better than the previous version.
9766120	9768520	So be sure you don't buy the previous one by accident.
9769400	9776120	Because I even see big main websites using the wrong captures for the review.
9776120	9777320	They have the wrong pictures.
9777320	9779720	They have the wrong content.
9779720	9780840	It's pretty awkward.
9780840	9781800	Shame, shame.
9781800	9782600	They should know better.
9783320	9784760	And the second thing just to finish.
9785560	9787880	There is some dialogue.
9787880	9793080	There's some big sexualized and there's some soft erotic moments.
9793080	9800040	But if you're the kind of person that gets really turned on by that, be aware there's
9800040	9802120	some dialogue.
9803160	9809800	Even though it looks kind of magical girl type of thing, it's definitely not for kids.
9809800	9810360	I see.
9810360	9813240	You broke up a little bit there, but I think I caught mostly what you were saying.
9813240	9818440	Some of the dialogue is a little salty if you're not necessarily into that.
9818440	9820440	Looking at our chat room, some comments here.
9820440	9824120	Act F saying, I heard that Natunia is one of the games that's actually good for the
9824120	9826440	Vita, but it can be hit or miss from what I've read.
9827240	9828920	Maybe that depends on the version, Act F.
9828920	9831720	Maybe not everybody's looking at the right version.
9831720	9835400	Dark Tetsuya asking, didn't Kenji and Afune have a cameo in one of those games?
9835400	9836280	Yes, he did.
9836280	9837400	Yeah, that's cool.
9838840	9844680	I think during this week, it's on sale for 30 bucks in the store in the US and no other
9844680	9845400	regions are.
9845400	9845900	Is it?
9846520	9849960	I might have to check this out because my Vita needs a little love.
9849960	9851400	I don't even know if it's charged right now.
9852280	9853080	All right.
9853080	9854200	So that's it.
9854200	9854440	All right.
9854440	9856040	Well, thanks for the recommendation.
9856040	9859160	It's good to know a little more about that game and something that we should be checking
9859160	9859800	out on our Vitas.
9859800	9860280	Thanks, pal.
9861000	9861320	Thank you.
9861320	9862040	Have a nice night.
9862040	9862280	All right.
9862280	9862600	Take care.
9862600	9863240	Thanks for calling.
9864440	9865080	All right.
9865080	9866840	And just make sure you get the right one there.
9866840	9868520	The one that has that subtitle at the end there.
9868520	9869640	Very important.
9869640	9870280	Big difference.
9870280	9870920	Big difference.
9870920	9874360	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9874360	9876760	Hey, if you think there's a game that's not getting enough attention out there, like,
9876760	9880360	pow, just kind of say, or the people are getting it straight up wrong, go ahead and
9880360	9881960	give us a call and clear the air.
9881960	9883720	Or any of the other news items we talked about tonight.
9883720	9888280	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9888280	9892520	I am trying to bring up the Twitters real quick here because I thought I saw a few tweets
9892520	9893400	come in.
9893400	9897880	Again, we try to get to some of your questions at Twitter.com slash OLR.
9897880	9904040	Sometimes I lose things in between the other stuff that gets tweeted to us and retweeted
9904840	9905480	and so forth.
9905480	9911960	But I do see a tweet from Soutor that says, anybody at OLR into the Harvest Moon games?
9911960	9913880	I've only played the handheld ones, though.
9913880	9917480	I just ordered Harvest Moon, a new beginning for the 3DS.
9918360	9919880	In all honesty, no.
9919880	9923800	I tried playing one of them because somebody told me it was very similar to Animal Crossing.
9923800	9925240	I think it was on the GameCube.
9925240	9927000	I couldn't really get into it at all.
9927000	9927560	No.
9927560	9930520	The milking the cows, the tending to the fields.
9930520	9932920	It's like Farmville, pre-Farmville.
9932920	9933640	Yeah.
9933640	9934200	But I understand.
9934200	9936280	I don't want to make it sound, oh, and it's horrible.
9936280	9938120	No, I get why some people are into it.
9938120	9940440	But it just wasn't something that really grabbed me.
9940440	9945320	It's very impressive that it has stayed going so long as it has.
9946040	9947720	So there you go.
9948680	9951640	Flaco Jones responding to last week's Classic Game of the Week.
9951640	9952600	Dark Soccer, you weren't here.
9952600	9954680	Did you see what I picked for last week?
9954680	9956040	Uh, I did.
9956040	9956920	And then I forgot.
9956920	9961400	Well, Flaco says, Ghostbusters is one of my favorite Commodore 64 games.
9961400	9963480	Of course it's Commodore 64.
9963480	9966440	Well, to be fair, though, Ghostbusters had a port on the Sega Master System.
9967080	9969960	So one could say I was trying to pull a Jamie last week.
9969960	9973160	No, I had to show a little love to the Commodore 64.
9973160	9974600	All right, we do have another call coming in.
9974600	9975320	So let's get to it.
9975320	9976440	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9976440	9977320	Who's this?
9977320	9977960	Hey, what's up, guys?
9977960	9978680	This is Kaijuto.
9978680	9979240	Hey, Kaijuto.
9979240	9980440	What's on your mind, buddy?
9980440	9983960	And I just want to comment real quick on the story you mentioned earlier about GameStop
9983960	9986840	complaining about the digital versus the physical.
9986840	9989000	Yes, I think there's a lot of strong opinions on this.
9989000	9989500	What's up?
9990380	9994940	I don't necessarily think that there's actually a problem with the digital versus the physical.
9994940	9997100	I think people are still buying physical.
9997100	9998140	I'm one of them.
9998140	10003260	But a lot of times, people are buying off of Amazon and other places.
10003260	10006140	I don't think it necessarily has to deal with the price.
10006140	10007740	It's just the availability.
10007740	10009180	I love GameStop.
10009180	10012780	But one of the things I noticed with them, I'm a person that loves to buy my games new.
10012780	10015980	I don't subscribe to their user, you know, their used game stuff.
10016540	10018940	And they don't ever restock stuff.
10019900	10025820	They'll get not any of the big games, not like Grand Theft Auto or any of the NBA games
10025820	10026540	or anything like that.
10026540	10027580	I mean, they always restock those.
10027580	10030780	But any of the smaller games, they never restock them.
10030780	10034620	They get them that first week, sell them all out, and then they don't restock them.
10034620	10041100	Like if they really want to make sales, I think they need to look more into new games
10041100	10042220	and restock.
10042220	10044060	And maybe people wouldn't be going to Amazon.
10044060	10048220	Because half the time, the main reason I like going to Amazon is because usually they don't
10048220	10049500	have the game that I'm looking for.
10049500	10053100	So I have to go on Amazon to find that game physically and buy it.
10053100	10056780	Yeah, you know, Kaishudo, I think you just hit the nail on the head, a big part of the
10056780	10059180	reason why I personally stopped going to GameStop.
10059180	10062380	Like I haven't gone into one in a while.
10062380	10067260	And a big part of the reason is that I remember going into a GameStop, and I remember what
10067260	10068300	the game was.
10068300	10070060	But it was something that just came out on release day.
10070060	10073820	And I went to the GameStop, and I asked for the game that had just come out that day.
10073820	10075340	And they were like, well, did you pre-order it?
10075340	10076780	And I'm like, no.
10076860	10079420	And the guy kind of like shamed me a little bit.
10079420	10083660	Like, you know, like, well, you know, it's a popular game, so you should always pre-order
10083660	10086140	games, and we don't have any for people that didn't pre-order it.
10086140	10087420	And I was like, all right.
10087420	10094220	So I walked to the Target in the exact same shopping center, and they had a bountiful
10094220	10095820	amount of copies of the game.
10095820	10097420	And that's when I said, you know what?
10098140	10098780	Fuck it.
10098780	10103820	I don't need to go into a store and fucking get a lecture about not buying into this whole
10103820	10107740	pre-order bullshit that I know is just a profiteering scheme for you guys.
10107740	10113900	That was the same with a PSP, I think, where they said, you know, good.
10113900	10115180	Like, it was at the launch of the PSP.
10115180	10115900	They're all good luck.
10115900	10116700	Find it anywhere.
10116700	10117660	It's sold out everywhere.
10117660	10118380	Went to Best Buy.
10118380	10120460	They had like a whole bunch of them just sitting there.
10120460	10122940	I'm like, oh, OK, I'll just get it here.
10122940	10126140	And this is all over because I experienced the same thing.
10126780	10132140	A lot of games that I go looking for, like I remember just recently I went to get a Pokemon
10132140	10132700	Black 2.
10133660	10135340	Black 2 and White 2.
10135340	10137180	And GameStop didn't have it.
10137900	10139820	The guy told me, you know, it's a really old game.
10141100	10142860	He hasn't seen it in a while.
10142860	10145420	I went right over to Target, got both of them.
10145420	10148380	It's just like, you know, you start to do shit, man.
10148380	10149740	That's all you got to do.
10149740	10151740	What did that just instill in me for the future?
10151740	10155660	I can either go to GameStop and get a lecture, or I can go to Target and get my game and
10155660	10156780	no questions asked.
10156780	10161100	Because it's one of those cases where I actually kind of prefer that the people selling me
10161100	10163260	the game at Target aren't game enthusiasts.
10163900	10164400	Yeah.
10164940	10168140	Yeah, I got into a big debate one time about all that.
10168140	10173420	A lot of people were saying that when it comes to GameStop, that they prefer, you know,
10173420	10175900	people should know about gaming and blah, blah, blah.
10175900	10178780	I'm like, for me, all they need to know is the price.
10178780	10181980	All they need to tell me is the price and that they have it in stock.
10181980	10183900	I can do all my research online.
10183900	10186140	You know, I don't need a video game expert to work in the store.
10186140	10187900	I know people got to make money.
10187900	10190220	Not everybody has time to learn about video games.
10190220	10191580	They just got to make that quick dollar.
10191580	10193020	So that's all they need to know.
10193020	10194460	They just need to know what's in their store.
10194460	10197500	And I don't necessarily, and to make it clear, because I know we have a lot of people who
10197500	10199340	listen to the show who do work at GameStop.
10199340	10203580	And I just want to remind you guys, like my problem isn't necessarily with the frontline
10203580	10207500	workers, although there's always going to be a few bad apples in every barrel and there's
10207500	10208860	a few at every company.
10208860	10213580	But I think a lot of times that attitude that I got, because you just said you got that
10213580	10216620	same attitude, you live in a completely different part of the country than I do.
10216620	10219500	That clearly then comes from the top down.
10219500	10222780	That's an attitude that's passed on in the corporate environment.
10222780	10225580	And that's not something I necessarily fault the people on the front lines.
10225580	10230300	The reality is, though, again, that's not going to convince me to come back into the
10230300	10233980	store when I can get the game without a lecture somewhere else.
10233980	10234220	Yeah.
10234220	10237020	But to that guy's defense, like he wasn't lecturing me.
10237020	10239660	He actually sounded upset by it.
10239660	10242140	He was just saying that, you know, it's an old game, hasn't been around.
10242140	10245100	But it wasn't like, you know, see, you should have got it early.
10245100	10245900	It wasn't like that.
10245900	10247740	I never got any of that type of treatment.
10247740	10248780	But I know what you're talking about.
10248780	10249900	Wish I could say the same.
10249900	10250060	Yeah.
10250060	10250940	Still love GameStop.
10250940	10251820	Still support them.
10251820	10257660	I think that they're a major reason why games were selling like hotcakes back in the mid
10257660	10258460	2000s.
10258460	10261660	You know, so I credit them for a lot of where gaming is now.
10261660	10263660	I don't agree with that guy you're talking about.
10263660	10265420	The guy who said we're in the golden age.
10265420	10266460	We're not in the golden age.
10267420	10268380	Definitely not in the golden age.
10268380	10269820	I don't know what he's talking about.
10269820	10271260	But why not?
10271260	10272060	Quickly, why not?
10272860	10277260	Just for the simple fact, it's like, you know, we have the same games being reproduced.
10277260	10278540	Not a lot of like new games.
10278540	10279740	A lot of things are sequels.
10280540	10285900	Really what I think is the place that's experienced in the golden age is probably the indie game
10285900	10286140	scene.
10286140	10291180	Like I see the whole indie game scene the same way that I see.
10291180	10295820	Remember back in like in the mid 90s when Hollywood went indie and all those indie movies
10295820	10297900	were picking up Oscars and all that type of stuff.
10297900	10299180	We're in that type of situation.
10299180	10302860	I don't see AAA doing really well or any of that type of stuff.
10302860	10305020	I think all that stuff is going downhill.
10305020	10307020	But as far as the indie scene, yeah, we're getting a lot of stuff.
10307500	10310460	And of course that also feeds into the digital thing.
10310460	10314380	Because a lot of these indie games, they don't make CDs or anything.
10314380	10318780	So that's another reason why people may not be going into that GameStop.
10318780	10321900	Because they have to buy these games digitally online.
10321900	10323660	Because that's the only way they can get it.
10323660	10326780	That's a very interesting comparison with the film industry.
10326780	10328860	Because I know we've kind of addressed this before.
10328860	10334220	But movies had to go through similar growing pains when it became easier for anybody to
10334220	10335020	shoot their own movie.
10335020	10337740	When camcorders became more and more popular.
10337740	10342060	And that was probably about the time was the mid 90s when anybody could shoot something
10342060	10343020	on VHS.
10343020	10344380	And we got what?
10344380	10345820	The Blair Witch Project out of that.
10345820	10349500	Which, you know, whether you loved or hated that movie, it was one of the biggest independent
10349500	10350620	smashes of all time.
10350620	10355660	And that was, you know, literally people running around in the forest at night on their camcorders.
10355660	10357500	So yeah, very good point.
10357500	10358140	All right.
10358140	10359260	Take care, my friend.
10359260	10359660	All right.
10359660	10359900	All right.
10359900	10360300	Bye bye.
10360300	10361420	Bye bye.
10390300	10391020	But that's all right.
10391020	10391420	I understand.
10391420	10392700	I didn't touch it since.
10392700	10396780	No, I looked at the logs over the last few months and there's been no one on it.
10396780	10398860	So as far as I can tell.
10399820	10401900	So we'll just have to move to PlayStation 4 or something.
10401900	10403100	Anyway, we do have another call coming in.
10403100	10404060	So let's get to it.
10404060	10405020	Hi on Orange Launch Radio.
10405020	10405900	Who's this?
10405900	10406620	Hey, it's Dave.
10406620	10407340	What's going on?
10407340	10408380	Hey, what's up, Dave?
10408380	10409100	How you doing?
10409100	10409820	Not much.
10410380	10412140	Just called in to ask you guys a question.
10412140	10413900	See if anybody else felt this way.
10413900	10417020	I guess it's just more negativity from me after that last call.
10417900	10423100	But is it just me or does it feel like over the last, I don't know, like half decade or
10423100	10430140	something Black Friday sales have just gotten crappier and crappier and crappier?
10430940	10437340	Black Friday itself just seems to have transformed in the past five years.
10437340	10440220	And I think that's kind of leading into it a little bit.
10440220	10443980	Like what you're saying where like the sales are getting crappier and crappier because
10443980	10448700	I think there's more of that expectation there that, you know, you have to have these
10448700	10451420	huge doorbuster sales and so forth.
10451420	10455020	And the stores have to be open on quote unquote,
10455020	10457820	Gray Thursday, which the rest of us call Thanksgiving.
10458460	10461500	Like that wasn't a thing when I was a kid.
10461500	10464620	I don't even remember Black Friday being a big deal when I was a kid.
10464620	10468460	I remember you don't go to the mall that weekend because it's the biggest shopping
10468460	10469260	weekend of the year.
10469260	10470060	But it wasn't like...
10470060	10471580	They never really called it Black Friday.
10471580	10472300	It was just like...
10472300	10476460	It was called that by the employees because, oh my God, consumerism.
10476460	10480860	Or, you know, if you want to get technical, it's the day where the stores would finally
10480860	10483500	be in the black for the year after running in the red for the whole year.
10483500	10485340	That's really where the name comes from.
10485340	10489660	But now it's Black Friday because somebody's going to get a black eye fighting for a toaster.
10490300	10495820	I mean, you know, maybe it's just that I'm getting older and, you know, I care less about
10495820	10496060	stuff.
10496060	10497740	I just don't get excited about things.
10497740	10501820	But I remember, you know, when I was in high school and like CompUSA stores were still
10501820	10502220	around.
10502220	10504300	Oh, I wish those were still around.
10504300	10508940	But they had sales and I'd always be like, oh, there's like, you know, two or three things
10508940	10510220	that I really, really want.
10510220	10511180	That's really cool.
10511180	10517020	Now I'm old and cranky and I see sales and I go, I want just one thing.
10517020	10519900	And that I don't even see one thing like not even on Steam.
10519900	10525100	And maybe that's part of the iterativeness that the last caller was talking about.
10525100	10528940	It's just the same game with a different name on it every year.
10528940	10529420	Right.
10529420	10534940	I want, you know, I want like a Baldur's Gate again where I'm like, I pay 50 bucks and I
10534940	10537100	feel like I really got my money's worth out of this.
10538460	10544300	Well, that's a whole nother problem that really has nothing to do with Black Friday.
10544300	10546220	And that has more to do with DLC.
10546220	10547580	But that would be a whole nother episode.
10547580	10549340	You can probably see where I'm going with that.
10549340	10551260	That would be a whole nother episode of OLR.
10551260	10554780	But I think with the Black Friday stuff is concerned.
10555580	10555900	Yeah.
10555900	10558380	I mean, I had my eyes set on one thing as well.
10558620	10560140	The Warlords Draenor expansion.
10560140	10561740	I wanted to get that cheaper somewhere.
10561740	10562700	Wasn't going to happen.
10562700	10563900	Nobody put it on sale.
10563900	10565740	So yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.
10565740	10571100	But at the same time, you know, we live in a culture now where it seems like we've got
10571100	10576220	sites that really make it their business to have things on sale all year long.
10576220	10578220	And that would be like Walmart.
10578220	10581500	That would be Amazon would be an excellent example of this as well.
10581500	10584380	Like buying into the wholesale culture.
10585020	10588300	I mean, Steam kind of does this too with games in a way.
10588540	10594300	But you have to kind of ask yourself, does the quality necessarily match something that
10594300	10595260	I'm getting on sale?
10595900	10598940	An example of that would be televisions on Black Friday.
10598940	10601580	You know, I'm sure Walmart was selling some TV for what?
10601580	10605900	Like probably like a full 100 inch TV for like 30 bucks, right?
10605900	10607180	I don't know what kind of things they sell.
10607180	10608540	They sell crazy shit on Black Friday.
10608540	10614060	But the problem is the TV probably is missing something that you're probably used to seeing
10614060	10614780	on a TV.
10614780	10616460	Like it probably doesn't have component cables.
10616460	10620780	It's probably like HDMI only or some of these HD TVs.
10620780	10623820	I don't think they do this so much anymore, but a couple of years ago you could get the
10623820	10627180	cheap HD TVs, but they only did 720p.
10627180	10628140	They didn't do 1080p.
10628140	10637420	They had some like a really cheap cheapo laptops, tablets that they were selling for like sub
10637420	10637820	$100.
10639020	10645740	Oh, I walked into Best Buy and yeah, I remember seeing a tablet and the tablet was unbranded.
10646780	10649980	I didn't know that you could sell a tablet that didn't have a brand.
10649980	10652940	It just had a Microsoft logo and it was a seven inch tablet.
10655340	10660140	Yeah, I think really at the end of the day, I'm just grumpy that I'm not seeing anything
10660140	10662380	on Steam that I'm really excited to buy.
10663100	10668460	To be fair though, we all know there's going to be another sale coming at the end of the
10668460	10669100	year.
10669100	10674460	So if everybody didn't blow their load on Thanksgiving so that they could get a few
10674460	10679260	more sales before the big holiday, and then you're going to have that big after holiday
10679260	10682540	sale, I can sort of see why we're in that position.
10682540	10686060	I think Steam is uniquely positioned in a different way.
10686060	10690060	Well, if you can get Dragon Age Inquisition to go on sale for that one, then I'll be happy.
10691660	10697900	Sadly with a game like that, oh, well, since you bring that up, it's not going to go on
10697900	10700540	sale on Steam any early.
10700540	10703420	It'll be on sale on Origin before any of those other sites.
10703420	10707580	You're right, I don't think I've given Origin any money yet.
10708460	10709980	I'm really trying to hold out.
10709980	10714540	I know, but then I think an excellent example of this, Dave, would be Titanfall.
10714540	10719660	I finally bought Titanfall on the PC because it went on sale for like half as much.
10719660	10720300	Where?
10720300	10721180	On Origin.
10721180	10723740	Yeah, it's like $10 right now or something.
10723740	10724860	Now it is, yeah.
10724860	10727660	Because it's not as good of a game as they hyped it up to be, unfortunately.
10727660	10730140	My brother's upset because he paid full price for that.
10730140	10731100	I know, I know.
10731820	10732860	But that's what happens.
10732940	10735340	I'm sure Mass Effect is dirt cheap on Origin right now, too.
10735900	10739260	Which means you can go buy every single version in existence, too.
10739260	10739820	Yeah, that's right.
10739820	10742380	You can probably get the whole damn trilogy for $20, I'm sure.
10743660	10747340	Alright, well, Dave, my friend, thank you for your call, even if it was a little grumpy
10747340	10749020	cat, but you know, I understand.
10749020	10751820	Sometimes not all the news is sunshine and rainbows.
10751820	10753260	Yep, you guys have a nice night.
10753260	10754060	Alright, you too, my friend.
10754060	10754380	Take care.
10754380	10755260	Alright, bye-bye.
10755260	10756060	Bye-bye.
10756060	10759660	And here's the thing that'll inevitably happen to Dave, too, is whatever that game is that
10759660	10760700	he wants, he has his eye on.
10760700	10762380	Let's say Dragon Age Inquisition.
10762380	10763660	You know what's going to happen.
10763660	10766300	He's going to buy it, and then what's going to happen the very next day?
10766940	10768140	It'll go on sale.
10768140	10769820	So I have a last minute story, if you want.
10769820	10771500	Sure, real quick, let's do one more story here.
10771500	10772940	I am going to shut down the Skypline, though.
10772940	10775020	Thanks to those of you guys who called and got through.
10775580	10777820	To those of you that didn't get through, I'm sorry.
10777820	10778780	Thank you for trying.

10782620	10784780	You can always leave a comment on the episode, as well.
10784780	10785820	VOG Network dot com.
10785820	10788700	I know I don't always read those every- I read them.
10788780	10792060	I don't necessarily always read them on air, but I always appreciate those of you that
10792060	10793420	leave a comment on the episode.
10793420	10793920	Loki.
10794300	10800780	Valve has changed the rules for Steam gifts for trading stuff like that.
10800780	10807420	So for example, all new games purchased as a gift and placed in the purchaser's inventory
10807420	10809660	will be untradeable for 30 days.
10810860	10815580	We've made this change to make trading gifts a better experience for those receiving the
10815580	10815980	gifts.
10815980	10821020	We hope- we're hoping this lowers the number of people who trade for a game only to have
10821020	10825260	the game revoked later due to issues with purchaser's payment method.
10825260	10835260	Oh, so there's people out there that buy the game, sell the code on eBay or whatever,
10835260	10839340	put it in the other person's Steam account, and then flip the charges on the company or
10839340	10839660	so.
10839660	10841340	I see what the- I see what the exploit is.
10841900	10843420	I would have even thought of that.
10843420	10844220	That's shady.
10845100	10845900	That is very shady.
10845900	10848620	But that's also annoying though, if you're buying somebody a gift.
10848620	10849260	Yeah.
10849260	10852300	Well, no, you just don't put it in your own inventory first.
10852300	10853420	Oh, you just send it straight to them?
10853420	10855420	That's the- yeah, you can send it straight to them.
10855420	10856460	Well, okay.
10856460	10860300	Yeah, but you can buy something as a gift and drop it in your own inventory first if
10860300	10863260	you don't necessarily know who you're going to give it to, or you're going to save it
10863260	10864380	for trade fodder.
10864380	10867900	Like, you could trade a $2 game for a bunch of trading cards or something.
10867900	10869900	Like, that's the whole idea behind it.
10870620	10874060	But yeah, if I want to buy you a gift, Loki, if I want to buy you a game, like let's say
10874940	10878620	you love Civ V so much, I'm going to get you Civ Beyond Earth for Christmas.
10878620	10880060	I could just drop that right in your inventory.
10880060	10880780	I'm not going to have a problem.
10880780	10882540	I'm not going to have to sit on that for 30 days.
10882540	10888380	That would be silly of Valve to do because the whole reason they built that wishlist
10888380	10890780	thing in is so that they can tell you.
10890780	10895580	Like, if I'm looking at a certain store page, hey, Loki has this game on his wishlist.
10895580	10896860	It's on sale.
10896860	10898620	You haven't gotten him a gift yet.
10898620	10899820	Buy, buy, buy.
10899820	10901580	They want me to be able to drop that in your inventory.
10901580	10902140	That makes sense.
10902140	10903420	They just want to buy a password.
10903420	10904860	They buy it for me first.
10904860	10909180	So act deft, confirming you can still gift it, just not trade it.
10909180	10911820	They're saying that that's supposed to deter resellers.
10911820	10916220	So people that, you know, are selling games, they, they probably need to do that.
10916220	10918700	There's a lot of shady stuff that happens with the steam reselling.
10918700	10921340	So I see why they're, they probably haven't been resort to that.
10921340	10921980	It makes sense.
10921980	10922540	All right.
10922540	10924780	Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10924780	10927260	Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.
10927260	10929580	Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.
10929580	10932700	And if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or three
10932700	10933500	about the show.
10933500	10934860	Help spread the word.
10934860	10939020	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you got to give us more of those voices
10939020	10940380	so we can get the news out there.
10940380	10941340	Don't forget guys.
10941340	10946220	Next week's show, December 7th, noon is when it will actually be live.
10946220	10950780	So this is the chance for those of you guys overseas or in a different time zone to participate
10950780	10951500	with the show.
10951500	10956380	Of course, if you're, if you're the other way on the globe, like I know Akuma JP is
10956380	10958140	like, that's like 3 a.m. for me.
10958140	10959740	I'm not going to be able to, sorry, sorry.
10959740	10965340	Maybe, maybe another week we'll do, we'll do a show at 3 a.m. for those of you guys
10965340	10966380	on that side of the globe.
10967100	10969500	Maybe, well, maybe, maybe we'll see.
10969500	10969820	All right.
10969820	10971500	Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.
10971500	10973740	We'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10973740	10975100	So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.
10975100	10975900	Your final thought tonight.
10975900	10978780	So apparently there was this thing going on in Microsoft store.
10978780	10983260	If you purchase Connect Sports Rivals for the Xbox One, you can purchase another game
10983260	10983820	for free.
10984540	10988060	Oh, so for example, Connect Sports Rivals was $24.99.
10988220	10991820	And you could add Grand Theft Auto 5 for free on the Xbox One.
10992380	10994620	Uh, it wasn't supposed to work that way.
10994620	10995100	Oops.
10995100	10999100	Uh, so now that's, that's closed, but yeah.
10999100	11001980	So, um, that's silly.
11001980	11005100	But, um, yeah, so hopefully I'm working more on my game this week.
11005100	11010940	I started rewriting the engine again and, uh, hopefully this will be the last time.
11012300	11015900	And yeah, I'm going to look at maybe shutting down the Minecraft server, even though it's
11015900	11019660	only like five bucks a month, it's just, nobody's playing it.
11019660	11022380	That's just, that's five bucks a month that you're spending on a Team Fortress 2
11022380	11023340	server or something else.
11024380	11028300	It's even, I'm not playing it and I have no desire to go back and play it cause it's
11028300	11030220	just like, I don't know.
11030220	11033500	I can't dedicate a lot of time to one game.
11033500	11035820	Jamie, Jamie, do you have a suggestion for the money?
11035820	11037900	I could just give you five bucks every month.
11038940	11043340	Well, I've kept it running for like, you know, years, a couple of years, a couple of
11043340	11045420	years, and it's just not my Normandy out of it.
11045420	11047900	It's just not, I mean, I could, I'm going to back up everything.
11047900	11051500	You copy the server and then that way people can have their own local copies of it.
11051500	11053820	Maybe I can, I can download the server and stuff.
11053820	11054460	That's fine.
11055500	11058780	You know, that's what I'm, of course I'm going to do that, but like, I think it's
11058780	11063980	more advantageous to like, if we were going to do something like that, to go to a public
11063980	11066940	server or something where we could all go to the same one.
11066940	11071340	So if we're not playing, there's actual people on the server to play with instead
11071340	11073420	of just it being dead.
11073420	11073980	You know what I mean?
11073980	11075100	That, that was always the problem.
11075740	11080540	Yeah, I'd play on it, but I'd be the only one on for an hour and I may see somebody
11080540	11083740	once in a while, but it's not like it's always packed with people.
11085100	11085740	All right.
11085740	11086860	That was a long final thought.
11087580	11088140	That's all right.
11088780	11092780	My final thought for the night is I've had a really good restful period of being able
11092780	11094620	to sit on my big butt and play video games.
11094620	11098540	And I'm, I'm sad that it's coming to an end, but I am thankful that, you know, I
11098540	11101820	have a job to go to tomorrow and, and all that good stuff.
11101820	11107100	So, um, I just want to say thanks for tuning into the show on a holiday weekend
11107100	11109820	and, uh, hope your holidays went well.
11109820	11111980	And, uh, hope your winter holidays will be going well.
11111980	11115340	I know a lot of the celebrations begin for that in the coming week.
11115340	11119180	So, um, I hope whatever you're doing for the holidays is great.
11119180	11120860	And thanks you guys so much for your support of the show.
11121420	11122860	Uh, dark soccer, your final thought.
11123740	11125500	Um, don't be a dick.
11126060	11126540	That's right.
11126540	11127260	Don't be a dick.
11127900	11128140	All right.
11128140	11130380	That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
11130380	11134220	We will be back in seven days at a different time to do it all over
11134220	11136780	again and talk about whatever should come up in the news next week.
11136780	11137820	PlayStation experience.
11137820	11141500	I imagine is going to be coming up the game awards and whatever is unveiled there.
11141500	11145180	So, uh, even though it's a slow retail, well, it's a fast retail period, a slow
11145180	11148380	retail release period, uh, there's still going to be a lot of stuff coming out in
11148380	11151100	this past week, so we will see you in seven days to do it all again.
11151100	11152380	Thanks you guys so much for tuning in.
11152380	11153180	Have a wonderful week.
11153180	11153420	Bye.
