0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	27000	Tonight is a very special number for us and we'll explain why. Also, there's PlayStation updates galore for both the firmware and a popular game on the console. Did they do harm as well as good? Find out next on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	51000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 2nd of 2014, episode number 573 of our program. That is a number with some special significance, but I will get into that in just a moment.
51000	64000	First, let's go around and introduce ourselves. My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle every week with my co-host. Say hello over there. Welcome back. She was out last week, but she's back this week. DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers?
64000	66000	Moving is shit.
66000	69000	Moving is shit. But it's done.
69000	71000	I now live in Grandpa's house.
71000	76000	I wasn't going to say last week, but so yeah.
76000	79000	It's fine. I live in Grandpa's house.
79000	83000	Not the house he's living in, but the other house that he lived in.
83000	88000	Right now it's still Grandpa's house, but it will be our house.
88000	91000	Funny how all that VoG network stuff kind of comes together in the end.
91000	93000	Yeah, now it involves real estate.
93000	97000	I love how you were like, you should come over and see my place, except well you've already seen it.
97000	100000	You've already been there.
100000	106000	And I like this. I love this. You're the one that moves, yet you brought me a housewarming gift tonight.
106000	108000	And I believe the listeners should be clued in to what it is.
108000	111000	Bitch, I made that for me. I'm just sharing with you.
111000	112000	So what is this that you brought?
112000	113000	It's hooch.
113000	114000	It's a peace offering.
114000	115000	It's Jamie Hooch.
115000	118000	Okay, it's not actually hooch because I didn't, you know, make make it.
118000	124000	Not like out of juicy juice and some yeast on an air conditioner or something like my friend Roy used to do.
124000	139000	It's Blackberry Manischewitz, Coin Tro, which is a really good expensive orange liqueur, pomegranate vodka, brandy, and then this really good lime juice and sugar cane mixer.
139000	145000	Normally this stuff is like way expensive. I got a really good deal. I mean, you can drink this stuff straight. It's so good.
145000	152000	So if I sound a little out of it or disconnected tonight, now you know why. It's Jamie's fault. So there you go.
152000	158000	Grandpa came over here on Wednesday. He didn't bring me hooch. You would expect that drunkard to bring me hooch, but you brought me hooch.
158000	161000	You won't bring you hooch because he was busy drinking it.
161000	163000	That's true. That's very true.
163000	167000	Well, I had some in the car. It's gone now. We let Victoria drive.
167000	173000	So I appreciate that and happy move to you and may you get all settled in and all that.
173000	178000	Midna is ecstatic. I thought she was going to move into her litter box for a year like Shermy did.
178000	183000	Oh no. That cat's like sniff, sniff. I'm home. Let me shed on everything.
183000	184000	Nice.
184000	189000	And so she also has learned how to headbutt the cabinets in the bathroom to get them open.
189000	192000	Yeah. Our cat learned how to open doors too. That was interesting.
192000	200000	You know how like sometimes if you don't push a door all the way, it might be closed, but not be like latched.
200000	205000	So I learned that if you don't push them all the way, she'll headbutt her way in the room.
205000	209000	Mine will be shut all the way and she'll be like, boom, boom.
209000	214000	And then when the door to the bedroom is closed, you like see little black paws peeking out like, Mom.
214000	220000	All right. Well, also an owner of some cats who I'm sure has stories to contribute to this conversation.
220000	222000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
222000	226000	Thankfully only one cat, but she tried to learn how to open doorknobs.
226000	233000	She knows that the doorknob is what opens the door and she'll paw at it, but she has no way to grab the doorknob.
233000	237000	See, if we were dumb and had those, you know, doorknobs that have like the kind of handle on them.
237000	240000	Yeah, she'd be going through the house wherever she wants.
240000	244000	That's an interesting thing we all have in common. We all only have one cat.
244000	249000	But here's the thing, though, is I put a cat door in my garage and she stays out in the garage now.
249000	253000	She, because we have our old sofa out there, she just snaps on the sofa all day long.
253000	260000	Tiger call on our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
260000	264000	vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
264000	269000	And Tiger call on our chat says, maybe you can teach the cats how to use the toilets properly.
269000	270000	They just need to learn how to flush.
270000	273000	I've seen the kits. No, I'm not going to do that.
273000	279000	The first thing when we moved into this house that caught me off guard is that Sanrio started drinking from the toilet.
279000	281000	And that was nothing, that never happened in the old place.
281000	287000	But like in this place, yeah, Sanrio, I caught her one day, I was like, what are you doing? Don't do that.
287000	290000	And Alan's like, well, it's fresh water. And I'm like, ew.
290000	291000	It's not really fresh water.
291000	294000	Not really.
294000	302000	So, yeah, that was one of those quick lessons, even though two men live here, to keep the seat down at all times.
302000	307000	All right. Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
307000	313000	And I'm going to get into tonight's kickoff topic by giving you guys a little background and a reintroduction to Orange Lounge Radio.
313000	320000	As I like to do every few months, as I know, we're fortunate enough being in a podcast that has a pretty decent-sized listener base.
320000	322000	Thank you guys very much for your support.
322000	324000	We do get new listeners every now and again.
324000	326000	So just a reintroduction of our show.
326000	334000	The three of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, we all met actually at an arcade playing a little video game at the time called Dance Dance Revolution.
335000	345000	And Dance Dance Revolution, of course, was a video game that was made by Konami that was part of their Bimani series, or beat mania, if you will, or beat matching types of video games.
345000	350000	And there was a whole sorts, and I'm giving this really kind of Cliffs Notes version of it.
350000	357000	Some of you guys that have been music game enthusiasts for a long time will know that I'm cutting corners here, but bear with me for the sake of showtime.
357000	360000	There were a lot of other games involved in this too.
360000	363000	BeatMania 2DX, Guitar Freaks, which was before Guitar Hero, and so on.
363000	370000	And we used to gather at a local arcade here known as Roseville Golf Land, and we would play the game.
370000	373000	You know, coin up on the machine whose turn it's going to be, play the game.
373000	377000	Sometimes we travel to the Bay Area to meet up with friends there and play the game there.
377000	389000	And then we might, you know, when the home version started coming out, we learned how to mod our PS1s, either with a paperclip or for a little cartridge that went in the back, or the disc swap trick, or whatever it is used.
389000	395000	So we could play the import Bimani games like DDR Third Mix and have like little house parties and so forth.
395000	405000	And most importantly, after these Golf Land parties, we would play Dance Dance Revolution, we would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land.
405000	412000	And we all sit together and just, you know, get to know each other a little more through talking shit about one of our favorite pastimes, video games.
412000	420000	And so that's what OLR essentially became, is it was this big meeting at the dinner table inviting all you guys to chomp on some mozzarella sticks.
420000	422000	And now you know why we talk about food so much.
422000	433000	Right, right, exactly. To chomp on some mozzarella sticks or whatever it is that's going to make you fat and talk some smack about video games with us at the world's biggest diner table.
433000	434000	That's what OLR is.
434000	439000	Now Orange Land Radio started exclusively dedicated to the music gaming community.
439000	444000	Although a good 90% of that was Bimani in that series.
444000	450000	But certainly there's a lot of love for the Bust a Move, Bust a Groove series depending on what country you're in.
450000	455000	Parappa the Rappa, Vibribin, which we got all excited about with the re-release a couple weeks ago, right?
455000	461000	Even In the Groove in the later years of the show being a Bimani exclusive sort of thing.
462000	474000	Now when things sort of slowed down in the DDR community and the arcade scene unfortunately started to take a little bit of a tumble as Xbox Live and these sorts of things are gaining more and more precedence.
474000	482000	We had started originally a spin-off podcast dedicated to all video games at large because we kind of all sat down and realized, you know what?
482000	485000	We love video games most of all.
485000	490000	Like our love of music games is a part of that, yes, and that's something we all have in common.
490000	492000	But we all love video games.
492000	498000	Dark Sakura has a gigantic vault with all sorts of crazy ass import games.
498000	501000	It's already being rebuilt as we speak.
501000	512000	I have a deep love of PC gaming and things that date back to the Commodore 64 and Atari 2600 and some prior radio experience from college and so forth.
512000	516000	Loki likes to get in there and break shit and mod shit.
516000	520000	He likes to take the video game and make it his own.
520000	522000	And now he's programming his own game.
522000	525000	So that's kind of where we are today.
525000	531000	At some point we made our general show about video games, kind of the overarching show.
531000	534000	And that's the same show you're listening to today.
534000	539000	573 episodes later after episode number one in June of 2002.
539000	543000	So why do I give you this big ass backstory?
543000	552000	Because the number 573 holds some significance if you're a fan of these Beatmania and Bamani games.
552000	556000	Dark Sakura, would you care to elaborate with our audience a little bit?
556000	558000	What's so special about 573?
558000	563000	Well, to give you a small Japanese lesson.
563000	568000	First of all, there are two different ways of listing numbers in Japanese.
569000	577000	For standard, you know, everyday counting, you have like Hitotsu for one.
577000	585000	The word for three would be Mitsu instead of San.
585000	588000	I was like, grammar, Japanese words.
588000	590000	It's fine. I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.
590000	591000	Yeah.
591000	597000	But the rest of them are basically we have Go for five, Nana for seven.
597000	601000	And then Mi for Mitsu for three.
601000	604000	So Go, Na, Mi, Konami.
604000	605000	Yep.
605000	608000	So 573, Go, Nana, Mi.
608000	614000	And so you see that number oftentimes as little jokes in a lot of Konami games.
614000	620000	Like I remember recently I was playing on Virtual Console on Super Nintendo.
620000	623000	Or sorry, it was a Super Nintendo game originally, but I was playing it on Wii U.
623000	625000	Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
625000	628000	And you remember how Legend of the Mystical Ninja had all these little houses with minigames,
628000	630000	and one of them was the quiz show?
630000	636000	Well, it asked a question and the answers were one, two, or 573.
636000	638000	It's like that number makes no sense.
638000	643000	But now looking back, it's like, oh, that was their little in-joke for the little Konami.
643000	645000	How about something else too?
645000	650000	Did you know that Mitsubishi stands for three of those little diamond shapes?
650000	651000	Oh, I didn't know that.
651000	652000	So three diamonds.
652000	653000	Interesting.
653000	656000	Isn't Namco have a similar story behind it?
656000	657000	I wasn't sure.
657000	659000	The words.
659000	660000	I think so.
660000	662000	I think there's a similar thing going on there.
662000	663000	But anyway.
663000	667000	And some of the arcade hardware that games like DDR and so forth ran on.
667000	668000	So System 573.
668000	669000	Yeah, it was System 573.
669000	676000	So, you know, even though, you know, I don't want you guys to think we have a bias towards Konami.
677000	683000	Because in some ways, our love of those series makes us hold their feet to the flame even more.
683000	689000	Like, you know, I'm kind of sad that DDR kind of isn't what it used to be.
689000	694000	But like all things, it's, you know, kind of come and gone and had its thing.
694000	695000	But yeah, Jamie?
695000	704000	Actually, Act of Death said high scores in a lot of Konami games have 57,300 is the high score.
704000	705000	Yes, yes.
705000	706000	Very, very good point.
706000	707000	So yeah.
707000	711000	The interesting thing is 765 according to Dark Tetsuya.
711000	712000	There you go.
712000	714000	So yeah, there's, you know, a lot of those sorts of jokes and everything.
714000	721000	But, you know, we obviously, if it weren't for this series of games, this show wouldn't exist.
721000	722000	Plain and simple.
722000	725000	I mean, I don't know if I would have ever met Loki or Dark Soccer.
725000	728000	I mean, maybe, you know, nerds are kind of a small circle.
728000	729000	Maybe at a con somewhere down the line.
729000	732000	But things probably wouldn't have played out the way they did.
732000	734000	I'd be throwing stuff at you at Rocky.
734000	735000	Yeah, right?
735000	737000	You probably would have found me that way eventually.
737000	738000	I would have found you through Rocky.
738000	739000	Who knows? Who knows?
739000	741000	Like, it would just be like a totally different circle.
741000	747000	Like, so we do owe a lot to that, you know, despite the way things are 12 years later.
747000	749000	You know, we owe a lot to that.
749000	758000	So here on this episode 573, we definitely want to tip our hat and say thank you to Bomani and the people that made it possible.
758000	762000	You know, we made a lot of our friends through playing this game.
762000	764000	Some of them went to go on to work on the game.
764000	766000	You guys know Shane, one of my best friends.
766000	768000	He's on the show a lot.
768000	770000	He actually worked at Konami for a short while in some games.
770000	773000	We have a lot of friends at the show, people like Mel B and so forth.
773000	781000	What I had hoped to do tonight for episode 573 was try to get some of those people together and have a little bit of a party and reminisce a little bit.
781000	787000	Unfortunately, just everything I had going on in my personal life with my final Rocky Horror show after 16 years last week.
787000	789000	Or sorry, actually that was on Friday.
789000	799000	And BlizzCon coming up next week and Vegas a couple of weeks ago, it's just like this was the worst possible time for this number episode to have fallen for me personally.
799000	804000	So unfortunately we'll have to kind of just table some of that to a future episode.
804000	809000	Either something for like 20 November or maybe like episode 600 or something later down the line.
809000	812000	But we still want to make something like that happen in the future.
812000	815000	And I apologize, I couldn't make it happen tonight.
816000	818000	But you know, busy life.
818000	823000	And Flaco, didn't Flaco, well he was working at Konami, but I don't know if he worked on DDR.
823000	828000	Yeah, he did work at Konami for a short time. I don't remember if he was DDR or not.
828000	830000	I know the Winx was his big thing.
830000	832000	Yeah, I remember those stories.
832000	834000	But yeah, that was part of it too.
834000	841000	So anyway, Dar Tetsuya actually compiled some of this stuff together about where is Bomani now.
841000	847000	So I thought we would take a walk down memory lane and catch up with our favorite music based video games.
847000	851000	What do you guys think? Do you even know where DDR is today you guys?
851000	852000	I can't even.
852000	856000	You can't even possibly. Let's take a trip down memory lane.
861000	868000	DDR 2014 is out in Japan. It's pretty much a software update, changing the interface and adding new songs.
868000	874000	They do get events via EMUs, including things like Bomani Stadium, which had a baseball theme to it.
874000	879000	Each game in the Bomani series had its own team logo, and you could play special songs and charts.
879000	884000	But if you want to play Extra Sage, you have to use Konami's pay-to-play service, Paselli.
884000	887000	That's the norm for releases in Japan nowadays, apparently.
887000	892000	BeatMania 2DX is up to 2DX 22, or Pen Jewel.
892000	896000	It has like a light-dark theme that switches between two time periods.
896000	902000	What time of day and the date that you play factors into some of the unlocks. That's kind of interesting.
902000	909000	Some of the songs have a new difficulty chart to them called Legendaria with a little cross.
909000	916000	There's actually a Coca-Cola Cross Bomani crossover in the game, and you unlock skins with different Coca-Cola brand logos.
916000	922000	Like there was a green lane cover with a Sprite logo on it. I had no idea that was a thing.
922000	925000	Did you know that you can have Soda branded 2DX lanes now, apparently?
925000	927000	Is there a Surge branded lane?
927000	929000	Maybe. One can only hope.
929000	933000	Pop and Music, as of the 21st game, they've stopped numbering them.
933000	935000	The one that's out now is Lapistoria.
935000	940000	They've also stopped using genres for the song titles, but that's just for this new game.
940000	944000	Guitar Freaks and Drummania is up to Gita Dora Overdrive.
944000	947000	There's no longer long version songs.
947000	951000	Sorry, they were taken out at one point, and they just came back in Overdrive.
951000	954000	So, that's that.
954000	959000	Dance Evolution, which is their take on the Kinect-style game.
959000	962000	They had that game as a Kinect launch game.
962000	965000	There's an arcade version in Japan.
965000	969000	The arcade game got several song updates and some more crossovers from other Bomani games.
969000	975000	U-Beat, which a lot of people mispronounce Ju-Beat because it has a J, but the J is actually silent.
975000	976000	It's Yu-Beat.
976000	980000	U-Beat has a game called U-Beat Saucer for Film.
980000	982000	That was the last one they did there.
982000	986000	Reflect Beat is up to Reflect Beat Groovin', which is like a music game in air hockey,
986000	989000	and I believe that's out on the iPad if you want to try that out in iOS.
989000	992000	And Sound Voltex is up to Sound Voltex 2.
992000	995000	And there's a third installment that's been announced called Gravity Wars.
995000	997000	So, Bomani ain't dead.
997000	1004000	It's just a little different now than it used to be, and I kind of stopped following it as closely as I once did,
1004000	1006000	especially when they stopped releasing all the home versions.
1006000	1012000	Like, do you know how bad I want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4?
1012000	1018000	But then I realized I'm probably one of the only people that would want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4.
1020000	1023000	Well, they should do a digital version or something.
1023000	1026000	You would think, or I don't know, but then how do you get the controller?
1026000	1030000	Like, you could do it through PlayStation Now or something, but then how do you do the controller?
1030000	1035000	Remember trying to play BeatMania 5 key with a PlayStation controller? Because you could do it.
1035000	1037000	Not very well.
1037000	1043000	And there's that horrible, horrible, horrible 360 remake of popin' music called Beat and Groovy
1043000	1048000	that looked like it was literally half-finished when they released it, that you had to use the controller.
1048000	1052000	There was no popin' music controller ever released for it.
1052000	1054000	So, there it is.
1054000	1057000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, Bomani is dead, yo.
1057000	1060000	BeatMania 2DX, 24 Doritos.
1060000	1065000	Well, I mean, also Konami did a lot of downscaling, right?
1065000	1068000	They closed the office that was in the Bay Area.
1068000	1071000	I think they closed the one in Hawaii some time ago, right?
1071000	1074000	That's gone. And that's where a lot of the DDR was coming from stateside.
1074000	1078000	So, you know, and you look at Konami now, and we've even joked about this in the past,
1078000	1083000	like, what do they have going right now besides Metal Gear and, you know, soccer?
1083000	1085000	Well, P.T. came out of nowhere, to be fair.
1085000	1088000	And P.T. looks pretty fuckin' amazing, which is Silent Hill, obviously.
1088000	1090000	That looks pretty awesome.
1090000	1094000	But, you know, Konami isn't really crankin' out the games like it used to.
1094000	1096000	It's the Kojima Soccer Machine.
1096000	1099000	Yeah, it's the Kojima Soccer Company, in a way.
1099000	1101000	They should really change the name.
1101000	1105000	There you go. Do you guys have a, just before we get into some longer-form news
1105000	1107000	and Housekeeping and all that and what we've been playing,
1107000	1112000	do you guys have, like, a favorite memory looking back on the years and years of O.L.R.,
1112000	1114000	especially the music game days?
1114000	1119000	Do you have a memory of what kind of music games did for you?
1119000	1123000	I don't know. I just like coming to the parties. That was fun.
1123000	1125000	I was just here for the parties.
1125000	1130000	Lugging my StepMania computer setup, you know, that was fun.
1130000	1133000	I remember when you built a custom machine for Roseville Golf Land,
1133000	1136000	and they had it for all of, like, a week.
1136000	1139000	Yeah, then they charged me $300 in taxes for my work.
1139000	1140000	Oh, so awful. So awful.
1140000	1142000	Yeah, they suck ass.
1142000	1148000	Because it was $1,000 for that machine to buy all the hardware for it and stuff,
1148000	1151000	and they paid me for it, but then they also gave me a tax form.
1151000	1156000	So I was like, but I just purchased things. I didn't actually do any labor,
1156000	1159000	so why are you taxing me? Oh, well, we have to give this to you in no way.
1159000	1162000	What I should have done is given them a wrong Social Security number,
1162000	1165000	but I was dumb, so.
1165000	1167000	That would be wrong.
1167000	1171000	BlackDeftInChat says, Konami should do something like PT for Bimani.
1171000	1175000	They could call it BT, Bimani Teaser.
1175000	1178000	BlackWolf says, Konami is now mostly a casino company.
1178000	1180000	The gambling games is what makes them their money.
1180000	1183000	That's true. You know, when I was at the Final Fantasy Fan Fest,
1183000	1187000	I saw this giant machine there. It was like this huge rotating wheel,
1187000	1190000	you know, pretty little thing at the Rio, and it had the Konami logo there in the corner.
1190000	1193000	And we didn't sell the licensing rights in for some of that stuff,
1193000	1196000	because that would be awesome to, like, offload the licensing rights
1196000	1199000	to somebody that would actually make games for it.
1199000	1202000	It's iOS now. That's where they're making some of their money back,
1202000	1206000	is YouBeat on iOS and ReflectBeat and all that stuff, whatever.
1206000	1208000	DarkSakura, do you have a favorite memory,
1208000	1211000	kind of looking back on the years and years of music gaming?
1213000	1219000	I remember when I finally passed my first 7 in 2DX.
1219000	1222000	I think I squealed and broke people's eardrums.
1222000	1224000	I think I was there when that happened.
1224000	1226000	Wasn't it, like, WarGame or something?
1226000	1230000	It was 250 BPM. That was a lot of people's first 7.
1230000	1232000	No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't 250.
1232000	1234000	No, you did pass something else, and then, like, I want to say-
1234000	1235000	And then I did 250 BPM.
1235000	1237000	Yeah, you played that, like, as your next song, and then you passed that too,
1237000	1239000	and you're like, I am awesome!
1239000	1241000	It was something really bizarre, though.
1241000	1242000	Yeah.
1242000	1245000	And then my third one was Last Message. Remember?
1245000	1249000	Because it had that little drum bar heart that was my favorite.
1249000	1254000	And then, of course, you know, I remember passing my first 9s, my first 8s.
1254000	1260000	I remember the birthday party we had on the floor by the fourth mix machine,
1260000	1264000	where Jessica brought cake, and I had my box of candy from Japan,
1264000	1268000	and we sat on the floor and ate fucking cake with our fingers.
1268000	1270000	And, like, nobody at Golf Land seemed to care.
1270000	1272000	They're like, oh, it's them.
1272000	1273000	Oh, it's them.
1273000	1276000	And then the no shadowing party, the no shadowing thing,
1276000	1278000	so we decided to shadow everybody.
1278000	1279000	Oh.
1279000	1280000	On Para Para.
1280000	1281000	That's right.
1281000	1283000	When they tried to make that a rule that there was no shadowing allowed.
1283000	1284000	And so everyone did it.
1284000	1286000	Everybody did it in protest.
1286000	1292000	And then how it actually became my goal every trip to have somebody kicked out.
1292000	1295000	And I did. Damn those Roseville kids.
1295000	1299000	I used to have a really slow laptop that I'd have Dex Drive hooked up to
1299000	1302000	that'd make custom DDR edits.
1302000	1307000	My favorite contest that ever happened on this show was Loki's Make Edit Get Porn.
1307000	1310000	That was the thing in the early episodes of OLR.
1310000	1313000	He had a big box of porn that he gave away to some kid.
1313000	1314000	Whatever happened to that guy?
1314000	1316000	Some kid that made an edit.
1316000	1317000	His life was forever changed.
1317000	1318000	Yeah, right.
1318000	1319000	Do you remember-
1319000	1320000	He was 18.
1320000	1322000	When I say kid, I meant younger than me.
1322000	1329000	Do you remember the edit I made for Tengoku? Or .59?
1329000	1330000	Yeah. It was like-
1330000	1331000	Called Another.
1331000	1332000	Yeah.
1332000	1335000	And it was all the background offbeat stuff.
1335000	1337000	Somebody actually passed it.
1337000	1341000	I said, if anyone can pass this, I will buy you dinner.
1341000	1343000	And it was passed by-
1343000	1345000	Was it Rick?
1345000	1347000	No, no, no, no. Rick didn't pass it.
1347000	1350000	It was passed by Bran of DDR Freak.
1350000	1351000	Ah.
1351000	1352000	In Las Vegas.
1352000	1353000	Nice.
1353000	1355000	I didn't buy him dinner. He said it was okay.
1355000	1357000	But he bought it and then said I was-
1357000	1359000	He beat it and then said I was evil.
1359000	1361000	He used to love him.
1361000	1365000	I remember we went to that Konami event thing and they were talking about all the different-
1365000	1370000	It was Metal Gear Solid 3. I think they were showing off Metal Gear Online or whatever.
1370000	1373000	But I was more excited about the machine that they had there.
1373000	1374000	Yeah.
1374000	1375000	I was like, oh, I'll play that.
1375000	1378000	You were the first non-Konami person in America to play Supernova.
1378000	1380000	Yeah. And I had Naoki watching me.
1380000	1381000	Yeah.
1381000	1382000	That was really awesome.
1382000	1390000	That was definitely a moment of like, oh shit, this little show we started in the spare bedroom to extend our conversations.
1390000	1394000	This is like a thing. It was a moment.
1394000	1402000	I remember I took the trip to San Diego to play Max when it was new.
1402000	1408000	I was already in San Diego, but I made it a point I have to go to this arcade and I have to play Max.
1408000	1409000	Yeah.
1409000	1414000	And so that was- They also had a 2DX sub stream at that mall.
1414000	1416000	Oh gosh. Good times.
1416000	1422000	I would say one of my favorite memories, being a little self-referential here, but I don't care.
1422000	1429000	Probably the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio that we did, because remember I lived in that house with a friend of mine from high school.
1429000	1436000	And OLR was originally set up to have a very different tone because it was like every week was almost like a little bit of a house party,
1436000	1445000	which is why it didn't last very long that way, where we had people in the background playing 2DX and passing songs and people would be in the other room playing DDR.
1445000	1449000	And it was like, it really was every week like a celebration, especially in the early years.
1449000	1454000	And that was just a lot of fun, just getting everybody together, even though the sound quality was such shit.
1454000	1455000	I remember-
1455000	1456000	Going back and listening to it now.
1456000	1458000	I remember the amazing migraine I had.
1458000	1459000	Yeah.
1459000	1460000	Oh, that was awful.
1460000	1465000	That's all I remember about that show is the migraine and the king of iron fingering.
1465000	1472000	I remember from the very first show when you were- I actually think I have a clip of it.
1472000	1473000	Oh god, no.
1473000	1475000	I have a clip, because remember we used to do the teasers?
1475000	1477000	Yeah, but please don't play that because-
1477000	1478000	When OLR was the station?
1478000	1479000	Please, please, please, no.
1479000	1480000	Aww, why not?
1480000	1481000	Because I sounded stupid.
1481000	1483000	No, you didn't. I thought it was hilarious.
1483000	1488000	Fine. I was trying to talk about the Tetsujin, which I meant the Iron Man thing, and it was-
1488000	1493000	No, no, it wasn't that. That's not the clip. This is a different clip anyway, so don't worry about that. It's not the iron fingering.
1493000	1496000	That was a later episode, and I don't remember which one it was, but it is-
1496000	1497000	I thought it was the first one.
1497000	1499000	No, it was not the first one. The first one was this one.
1499000	1500000	Oh my god.
1500000	1501000	Okay, you ready? You ready to hear this?
1501000	1502000	No.
1502000	1507000	Wait for the sound quality here, and I'm gonna warn you guys. This is a 40-second clip. This is a commercial that used to be-
1507000	1514000	OLR was a station for a little while that had the highlight show every Sunday night. Here it is. A flashback for episode one.
1516000	1519000	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
1519000	1523000	Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.
1523000	1524000	Any arcade.
1524000	1527000	Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.
1527000	1528000	Oh yeah, baby.
1528000	1529000	And many different arcades.
1529000	1530000	She gets around.
1530000	1531000	I am such an arcade whore.
1532000	1534000	Mother, your child. Jamie will.
1534000	1538000	Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not gonna do your job, goddammit, I will.
1539000	1542000	Join us every Sunday night from seven o'clock until nine o'clock.
1542000	1545000	See? The times change, but not much else has changed.
1545000	1554000	You know, and now that I think about that, I don't want to be somebody else's child's parent, because I don't even have my own.
1554000	1556000	Why the fuck would I want somebody else's kids?
1556000	1564000	That was when we were having, I was having to go around and tell people not to change their diapers on the keyboard mania, because that's fucking disgusting.
1564000	1568000	Why would you even have to do that? I mean, seriously.
1568000	1573000	Because this is California and people are stupid and think that they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want.
1573000	1575000	That's a changing table, not a piano.
1575000	1581000	No, because this is California and people feel like they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want to and it's fucking stupid.
1582000	1586000	Alright, how about, how about one more before we get into our game movies? One more.
1586000	1587000	It better not be the fingering.
1587000	1589000	No, because you weren't here for episode two. This is episode two.
1589000	1591000	That was when I was in the gay frat house.
1591000	1593000	I have no idea.
1593000	1594000	I was at 69.
1594000	1599000	I knew, I knew what the episode one bumper was with that, but I have no idea what this one is.
1599000	1603000	So, uh, this could be anything. This might be stupid for all I know. We'll see.
1604000	1607000	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
1607000	1609000	Who was the last person to put their coin up?
1609000	1612000	I'm going after that person. The hell with the rescue.
1612000	1614000	Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.
1614000	1617000	A little, I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.
1617000	1620000	When I, I got up there and said, I'm playing.
1620000	1625000	Because this person put their token up. She starts talking about, no, he's mine, he's mine, I'm going to cut you.
1625000	1628000	I'm going to kill you in the face. I'll kill my mommy on you.
1628000	1632000	Where, where is your mother? Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you. Go away.
1632000	1636000	Mommy's on the corner. She's earning dinner money.
1636000	1639000	Oh, my. The views and opinions of Chris Conley and Julia.
1639000	1640000	She's looking for daddy.
1640000	1643000	Join us every Sunday night from 7pm.
1643000	1647000	Once again, not much has changed. Loki making inappropriate jokes.
1649000	1651000	She's on the corner making dinner money.
1653000	1655000	Good times. Good times.
1655000	1660000	That actually reminded me of when I was at, um, Country Club Lanes.
1660000	1664000	And the drunk guy tried to punch me and Dan got in a fight with him.
1664000	1666000	I don't remember that. Oh, my God.
1666000	1672000	Yeah. I boycotted, uh, Country Club Lanes and went on a big tirade about them on DDR Freak.
1672000	1673000	Oh, my gosh.
1673000	1676000	I remember going there, like, at midnight to play at three in the morning.
1677000	1682000	Because they're open 24 hours a day and play DDR Fifth Mix because they have Fifth Mix.
1682000	1687000	This is back when they still had the first one. The US first one.
1687000	1688000	Oh, yeah.
1688000	1695000	And, um, this little kid kept trying to get up on the pad while I was playing doubles, which is back in the day when I was playing doubles.
1695000	1698000	And I was like, you're going to get hurt. You're going to get hurt.
1698000	1701000	And so she runs off. Next thing I know, her daddy comes and says, what are you trying to hurt my kid?
1701000	1706000	I was like, I was trying not to, dumbass, which is pretty much what I said.
1706000	1709000	And he was drunk and he's like, well, I'm going to take a swing at you.
1709000	1714000	And he did. And I blocked him and it hurt him, not me.
1714000	1720000	And then Dan comes running in, getting all in his face, and the guy gets thrown out by off-duty cops.
1720000	1727000	I love that here we are, episode 573, and it's the exact same thing as episode one, bitching about unsupervised children.
1727000	1732000	You know what? If it wasn't such a big problem, we would have to complain about it.
1732000	1739000	Bobby's saying that we should have, uh, you know, last week on whatever, you know, for all of our, um, podcasts.
1739000	1746000	You know what we need is some sort of algorithm that it does it automatically. It may make no sense whatsoever, but it would still be funny.
1746000	1749000	It just cuts a random clip out of the show, like who knows what.
1749000	1750000	Yeah, or just sections.
1750000	1752000	Probably be me burping.
1752000	1758000	We're about to get into, um, how was your gaming week, but Alan just walked into the studio. What's going on here, Alan?
1758000	1760000	Hello, I'm home early from work.
1760000	1763000	Hi, welcome home early. What is this you're carrying in your hands?
1763000	1766000	I'm about to give you a whole bunch of candy.
1766000	1771000	Yay. Just what I need. Candy, candy. Oh my gosh.
1771000	1775000	So somebody brought all their leftover Halloween candy to work. Good times.
1775000	1776000	That's what I did.
1776000	1780000	Nice. Oh man, a Reese's peanut butter pumpkin. Those things are so good.
1780000	1785000	Trick or treat. Oh, you know who likes these? Give these to Shane. Shane loves these.
1785000	1787000	Yeah. All right.
1787000	1789000	Are those what I think they are?
1789000	1791000	Andy's mints.
1791000	1792000	I require two.
1792000	1797000	The reason why I say give them to Shane because like he's like, Oh, the Olive Garden's awesome because they give you that mint at the end.
1797000	1802000	I'm like, you know, that's just an Andy's mint, right? Anyway, tell, tell him their Olive Garden mints.
1802000	1803000	All right.
1803000	1805000	These are the best things ever.
1805000	1806000	I know, right?
1806000	1811000	I got rid of all of my candy at low cat and everybody was like, no, we don't want anymore.
1811000	1817000	Oh no, I told my, my, uh, we weren't the only ones who discovered that soul caliber could be played with a Sega Dreamcast fishing controller.
1817000	1821000	I think we actually broke one of them when the two slammed together during a heated match.
1821000	1824000	It still worked, but it doubled as baby rattle afterwards.
1824000	1827000	This is what I was doing in college rather than studying.
1827000	1834000	Now I'm going to let you in on something I was planning to create as my first Unity 2D project, the title Grammar or Death.
1834000	1838000	At the start of the game, a poor stick figure is trapped in a dungeon tied to a chair.
1838000	1845000	The player must choose grammatically correct phrases from never ending series of multiple choice questions with continuously decreasing time limit.
1845000	1850000	One wrong answer will result in a gruesome, gory death of the stick figure, complete with one of many loud screams.
1850000	1854000	Possibly con, uh, contributed to the game by one Rob Roberts.
1854000	1861000	But I've decided to scrap all of that because after listening to last week's OLR or last, last week's OLR, whatever you like to call it.
1861000	1865000	My idea, um, I now have a much better and more amusing idea.
1865000	1867000	And literally I will say it wasn't my idea.
1867000	1868000	So thank you for that.
1868000	1869000	I will say no more.
1869000	1872000	Now excuse me while I rub my hands together while gloating.
1872000	1874000	All my love, Aaron Yyr.
1874000	1875000	Uh oh.
1875000	1876000	Uh oh.
1876000	1877000	Uh oh.
1877000	1878000	Budgie Ferret grammar.
1878000	1879000	I don't, what, what did we say last week?
1879000	1882000	I said I wanted another dream game, but I don't remember what it was.
1882000	1883000	Oh no.
1883000	1884000	We weren't here last week.
1884000	1885000	This is last, last week.
1885000	1888000	Yeah, because it was the rod caliber episode, which came up a couple shows ago.
1888000	1892000	So, you know, some people catch up, they binge listen to OLR.
1892000	1894000	Like you binge watch chat rooms.
1894000	1897000	We trust your memory cause we don't remember half the shit we do.
1897000	1899000	Tell, tell me what I said.
1899000	1903000	Um, I still, I like the grammar or death idea.
1903000	1905000	I think our soccer would have been all about that.
1905000	1906000	I'm all about that.
1906000	1908000	No, too violent.
1908000	1909000	Too violent.
1909000	1910000	Well, cartoony death might be okay.
1910000	1912000	Like stick figure death is okay.
1912000	1913000	That's okay.
1913000	1915000	So this is not too realistic.
1915000	1917000	Yyr, I love you.
1917000	1921000	I want you to be my, my, uh, eternal, not soulmate.
1921000	1925000	Are we getting the steam version of, uh, Budgie Ferret tossing?
1925000	1926000	Yeah.
1926000	1929000	Maybe, uh, maybe you need to postpone work on all these other games until we get Budgie
1929000	1933000	Ferret tossing on green light and we can, uh, unethically beg for upvotes.
1933000	1935000	Greetings, OLR.
1935000	1938000	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, serious turtle.
1938000	1941000	I was wondering if any of you had tried civilization beyond earth yet.
1941000	1942000	Rob, I'm looking at you.
1942000	1943000	Yes.
1943000	1948000	At first glance at some let's play videos, it really looks like a reskinned Civ 5, but
1948000	1949000	worse.
1949000	1950000	Any thoughts?
1950000	1954000	And on the topic of Forex games, Rob, have you tried Endless Legend yet?
1954000	1959000	It is unbelievably fun, beautiful, great music, cool stories, and actually adds a lot of new
1959000	1961000	concepts to the Forex gaming front.
1961000	1963000	And the price is a nice change too.
1964000	1966000	I will look it up based on your recommendation.
1966000	1969000	Now is a really busy period, but I will, uh, especially with the price.
1969000	1970000	Rob is a busy bee.
1970000	1971000	Excuse me, the price is right.
1971000	1975000	Um, well, things are going to come, like, everything kind of built up to this weekend
1975000	1982000	and once BlizzCon is done, then my calendar clears up, so you, excuse me, hiccups.
1982000	1985000	Uh, I blame Jamie's, uh, stuff in the flask for that.
1985000	1986000	But, um.
1986000	1987000	My hooch.
1987000	1988000	Your hooch.
1988000	1991000	Um, but anyway, uh, I will check that out.
1991000	1995000	As far as Beyond Earth, yeah, I mean, it's easy to compare it to Civ 5 because they look
1995000	1997000	the same because they're on the hex grid.
1997000	2001000	But when you really get down to the nitty-gritty rules and the fact that, you know, the tech
2001000	2005000	tree isn't a tree, it's a web, that right there changes things.
2005000	2007000	And there's, you know, a bunch of other stuff that's different too.
2007000	2012000	And the whole, um, harmony versus, what is it, like superiority and purity or something
2012000	2013000	like that.
2013000	2018000	Like that throws a whole other monkey wrench into how you win the game is completely different.
2018000	2019000	Rob's got a Civ boner.
2019000	2020000	Yeah.
2020000	2023000	Um, I actually, I'm going to be honest, and I said this last week on the show, I don't
2023000	2027000	think Beyond Earth is as strong as 5, but it's not bad at all.
2027000	2031000	And I still think I'm enjoying Beyond Earth probably more than I ever enjoyed Civ 3, which
2031000	2032000	I never got into at all.
2032000	2036000	Like, that's the Civ people don't really talk about ever is Civ 3.
2036000	2037000	So.
2037000	2038000	All right.
2038000	2039000	There's more to this email.
2039000	2041000	Jamie, have a taco on Rob tonight.
2041000	2042000	No.
2042000	2043000	No.
2043000	2044000	I think I got that in one of those, like, bundles.
2044000	2045000	I don't want to eat a taco on Rob.
2045000	2047000	They had like Civ 3 for like a buck ninety-nine points.
2047000	2049000	I don't know if he's clean.
2050000	2055000	Loki, I'm pretty excited about GTA 5 for PC in January, but be honest with me.
2055000	2060000	Will the use of the N-word ruin the game for me?
2060000	2062000	I'm pretty sensitive to cursing in games.
2062000	2063000	No.
2063000	2066000	It's, it's not, it's really not that bad.
2066000	2072000	I mean, cause you're only, it's really, it's really only, uh, Franklin's friend that just
2072000	2077000	keeps, you know, you know, he just keeps using that over and over because that's the character.
2077000	2078000	I mean, and it's funny though.
2078000	2083000	Actually that, that guy that did the voice acting for that, he does, there's a car commercial,
2083000	2087000	like a, a local used car commercial that you can find him doing that for.
2087000	2088000	And it's hilarious.
2088000	2090000	He's just like, he's exactly like his character.
2090000	2094000	Um, but no, it, the language in the game is not that bad actually.
2094000	2096000	It's, it's pretty, pretty tame.
2096000	2098000	It's not, it's not like San Andreas.
2098000	2099000	Okay.
2099000	2100000	Oh, sorry.
2100000	2106000	If you can watch a movie that has course language, then course.
2106000	2107000	I like that.
2107000	2108000	Yeah, it's course.
2108000	2110000	It's like sandpaper.
2110000	2114000	Like me when I get upset, except that's not a word I would use, but I'll use words that
2114000	2115000	start with F.
2115000	2117000	I'm going to use course all the time.
2117000	2119000	It's all about Trevor anyways.
2119000	2120000	Trevor is awesome.
2120000	2121000	Seriously.
2121000	2125000	Can I finish reading this email?
2125000	2126000	Yup.
2126000	2127000	OLR as always, I love the show.
2127000	2130000	Look forward to the podcast every Monday minus the cursing.
2130000	2134000	I guess the content and opinions more than make up for it.
2134000	2136000	Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.
2136000	2138000	I'm really effing sorry about my mouth.
2138000	2140000	You know what?
2140000	2142000	Language only has power.
2142000	2145000	If you give it power, you probably like the Bobby black Wolf show.
2145000	2153000	I, you know, I don't, I, I respect that some individuals prefer not to use that language,
2153000	2155000	so that's, that's fine.
2155000	2163000	Just bear with me cause I was raised differently, so sometimes I let them fly.
2163000	2164000	Yeah.
2164000	2168000	I just remember the one day that I nearly dropped my mouth open when my mom said one
2168000	2170000	day I'd end up up shit Creek.
2170000	2177000	I was like, mom, since then has been just the one time she ever cursed in front of me
2177000	2178000	while I was a kid.
2178000	2180000	I was like, wow, mom.
2180000	2181000	Congratulations on.
2181000	2182000	Okay.
2182000	2184000	This one comes from hit Stan.
2184000	2186000	Um, congratulations on your new high score.
2186000	2187000	I have a question.
2187000	2191000	When you return to a familiar music game, what kinds of music do you play on?
2191000	2194000	Do you go back to license songs or old video game tunes?
2194000	2198000	You know, do you try to full combo and easy song or challenge the games?
2198000	2200000	Infinitely heart songs right away.
2200000	2203000	I normally look for Prague rock with fast patterns and tempo changes.
2203000	2207000	It's hard to read those note charts, but conquering that makes me, excuse me.
2207000	2210000	I have hiccups makes me feel like a boss.
2210000	2212000	I would like to not have hiccups.
2212000	2213000	Hi.
2213000	2214000	I gave them to you.
2214000	2215000	Coffee flavored hiccups.
2215000	2219000	Um, I usually just go back and do the ones that were the most fun to me, even if I get
2219000	2220000	past them.
2220000	2223000	If I'm playing a new game, like, um, an example I could give is that I actually was playing
2223000	2227000	Hatsune Miku on PS3 cause it was on sale a couple of weeks ago while I was at fan fest.
2227000	2231000	So that actually was like a new to me anyway, music game that I was playing.
2231000	2236000	And I just would listen to a little previews and usually I tend to, uh, uh, drift towards
2236000	2238000	a trancy songs in that game.
2238000	2240000	And I wish I could remember the name of that one song.
2240000	2241000	There's one song in there.
2241000	2242000	There's one song in there I really, really liked.
2242000	2243000	It's kind of trancy.
2243000	2244000	It's one of the other characters.
2244000	2250000	It's not Hatsune Miku, but I love that you can put the other characters in the video,
2250000	2251000	including the men.
2251000	2256000	So they can do all these very like, you know, uh, female oriented motions or, and he can
2256000	2257000	do vice versa.
2257000	2260000	You can have females do the guy parts and it's fun.
2260000	2262000	I think I just had something really offensive in chat.
2262000	2263000	Did you?
2263000	2266000	I want to say the song was called die, but D Y E I think it was the song I liked.
2266000	2270000	Ciel said Rob needs Jesus.
2270000	2271000	You're nasty.
2271000	2272000	You saw what I said.
2272000	2273000	Yes, I did.
2276000	2277000	I'm not repeating it on the air.
2277000	2278000	All right.
2278000	2279000	That's why I don't finish the email.
2279000	2280000	Was that, was that?
2280000	2281000	No, there's more.
2281000	2282000	Okay.
2282000	2285000	Remember even when the given choices suck, there's always another option.
2285000	2286000	Vote for Hollick.
2286000	2290000	This email is brought to you by Columbus, Ohio, home of the never ending freeway construction.
2290000	2295000	I've been listening to OLR since the to go edition in October 9th, uh, October, 2005.
2295000	2298000	And it always helps me pass the time on my commute every week.
2298000	2300000	Keep on going until you break the counter.
2300000	2302000	Oh, that was sweet.
2302000	2306000	That is, that is a long time to be listening stuff too.
2306000	2307000	Last email.
2307000	2308000	Yay.
2308000	2309000	Last email.
2309000	2310000	Hi folks.
2310000	2311000	It's the rage nator.
2311000	2315000	I thought I'd send a quick email to ask a question and to impart some info.
2315000	2321000	First things first, the info for those who are PC gamers via via steam origin, et cetera.
2321000	2324000	I found a site that aggregates news about game giveaways.
2324000	2331000	Here is the link and it's, um, actually at, uh, epic bundle.com.
2331000	2339000	Um, it's a much longer link, but I think you can get there just by going from epic bundle.com and I'm not getting struck by lightning because I'm a good Jewish girl.
2339000	2348000	Um, if you take a look at, uh, if you take a look at the page, two thirds of the way down the page, there's a yellowish newsfeed box that's regularly updated.
2348000	2350000	I suggest keeping an eye on this.
2350000	2354000	Now, considering that Halloween was two days ago, I thought I'd pose this question.
2354000	2357000	What classic games do you traditionally like to play around Halloween?
2357000	2359000	There's a Halloween feel to it.
2359000	2366000	Personally, let's play super ghouls and ghosts, Castlevania one and four, medieval nightmare creatures, frozen evil one through three and hexen.
2366000	2367000	It's actually funny.
2367000	2374000	We had, um, Dan just put on like all of the, uh, uh, Makamura music.
2374000	2383000	The Daimakaimura music, cause that's really the best, but he had like different iterations from different systems and then, uh, played some Castlevania music for all the kids come into the door.
2383000	2397000	And, but, um, honestly, uh, I like to play like really bad scary games, like the nightmare on a little street game, which is laughably stupid and the Friday the 13th game, which is also laughably stupid.
2397000	2400000	And, uh, I kind of liked Friday the 13th on NES.
2400000	2403000	Yeah, that was laughable.
2403000	2410000	Um, I don't, I mean, keep in mind, I've had a very different Halloween tradition for about the past 16 years.
2410000	2414000	So I don't really have a video game related tradition.
2414000	2418000	Um, I will be looking to start one soon, I guess. I don't know.
2418000	2420000	I sadly, I can't really answer this question.
2420000	2429000	I mean, I play scary video games whenever, well, I don't like to play them a lot because, you know, my heart can only take so much and I get scared really easily.
2429000	2430000	Have you played Among the Sleep yet?
2430000	2443000	No, but I was gifted by a kind, generous listener named ActDeft a copy of Five Nights at Freddy's saying, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, you should stream this sometime.
2443000	2447000	And I'm like, I'm, I want to say thank you for your kindness.
2447000	2449000	I'm afraid of getting that game.
2449000	2453000	I want to say thank you for your kindness and generosity and thinking of me.
2453000	2456000	But on the other hand, I want to say, fuck you.
2456000	2457000	You know what?
2457000	2458000	Sorry to the guy who doesn't like story.
2458000	2460000	You know what? I think that would make an awesome movie.
2460000	2462000	What, Five Nights at Freddy's?
2462000	2463000	Yeah.
2463000	2464000	You know the sequel's already-
2464000	2465000	Oh yeah, already greenlit.
2465000	2466000	Yep.
2466000	2468000	It didn't need a campaign to make that happen.
2468000	2472000	And I'll tell you, people are already cosplaying. It's crazy.
2472000	2476000	That's just furries looking for an excuse.
2476000	2477000	No, no, no, no. That's-
2477000	2478000	No disrespect.
2478000	2480000	That's all the Rocket Raccoon cosplay.
2480000	2483000	Or, does Groot count, maybe?
2483000	2484000	Alright.
2484000	2486000	That'd be more leafies.
2487000	2488000	Woodies.
2488000	2494000	Woodies. Yeah, that's what I'm going to call plant cosplay woodies.
2494000	2495000	So that's it.
2495000	2496000	Alright.
2496000	2497000	That's it for the mailbag.
2497000	2502000	If you want to participate in a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
2502000	2507000	This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
2516000	2526000	FU to the ongoing pain in my left ear.
2526000	2534000	It's not like a deep ear infection. I actually did go to the doctor, but it's like, when you press on one part of it, it hurts.
2534000	2543000	And it's not as bad as it was, but when I yawn or open my mouth, because it feels kind of like TMJ, except it pulls on my ear and makes my ear hurt.
2544000	2547000	So when I turn my head a certain way, it hurts.
2547000	2549000	I've been getting headaches because of it.
2549000	2559000	My doctor gave me ear drops. He said that the eardrum looks fine. I didn't have an infection, but it looks really red and horrible in there.
2559000	2561000	And I work on the photos.
2561000	2564000	Which is why many people are ever going to find out where I work.
2564000	2568000	Except for the people that I've actually told.
2568000	2572000	And no, I'm not pressing on it, but sometimes I roll over and lean on things.
2572000	2574000	It was hurting on my pillow. That's how bad it was.
2574000	2578000	FU number two to the manic panic that only took on a little bit of my hair.
2578000	2582000	That means I have to re-dye my ends, which I was going for red and purple.
2582000	2587000	And I had another FU, but fuck it.
2587000	2589000	Alright, Loki.
2589000	2596000	I guess FU two, this headache that hasn't gone away and I've been taken since and stuff for it just doesn't seem to go.
2596000	2599000	But, I'm actually going to use this for another thing.
2599000	2608000	I wanted to mention that if you are interested in Five Nights at Freddy's, that they do have it as part of the Halloween Humble Bundle.
2608000	2613000	You pay over the average, which as of right now is $5.32.
2613000	2615000	You get it.
2615000	2617000	Along with a bunch of other games.
2617000	2621000	That's good for another three days.
2621000	2629000	Alright, my FU of the week goes to I'm With You, headaches, because I had a really bad one at a really, really, really bad time.
2629000	2633000	And yeah, FU to headaches, that's for sure.
2633000	2635000	FU to panic attacks.
2635000	2637000	I'm pretty sure I had another one of those in the past week.
2637000	2638000	That's no fun.
2638000	2642000	And then FU to being thrown under the bus.
2642000	2645000	I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.
2645000	2649000	I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.
2649000	2656000	Let's move on with some more gaming news while I figure out why the oven won't stop beeping.
2656000	2664000	Because it's completely possessed by Satan.
2664000	2665000	Satan, yes.
2665000	2667000	I don't believe in Satan.
2667000	2670000	So this is kind of cool, we talked about this a little bit.
2670000	2678000	That there was this lawsuit from Manuel Noriega who was attempting to sue Activision because of his portrayal in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
2678000	2687000	You know, being portrayed as some sort of dictator and an all-around bad guy.
2687000	2690000	Kidnapped murderer, enemy of the state type thing.
2690000	2693000	Well, kind of is that.
2693000	2697000	But anyways, the lawsuit has been dismissed.
2697000	2700000	So, too bad, so sad.
2700000	2703000	You don't get any money.
2703000	2707000	But, I don't know.
2707000	2717000	It's interesting, actually it was funny because me not following politics or anything, I had no idea that the character in the game was actually a real person.
2717000	2725000	Because they make up a lot of fictional villains in these games, so it's hard to tell them apart.
2725000	2731000	It's okay, you were pretty young in the 80s and I think that guy was all, his name was all over the place, you know.
2731000	2737000	So, I forgot about that lawsuit though until you brought it back up.
2737000	2744000	Anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
2744000	2748000	And that has to do with the second chance at a game you might have missed.
2748000	2755000	Valkyria Chronicles was a Playstation 3 game, which I don't think a lot of people really checked out.
2755000	2760000	Because it didn't really come up on a lot of people's radars, but it was a pretty good tactical game.
2760000	2771000	It's getting a second chance on the PC, which is interesting seeing more and more of these companies put out titles that were once on console, like I know Square has been doing this a lot lately too, on PC.
2771000	2781000	So, Valkyria Chronicles will be coming out on PC on November 11th for $20 or 20 Euros depending on where your region is.
2782000	2791000	This is also interesting. You get, I think there was some DLC that was included as well, although that's not in this particular story I'm looking at.
2791000	2796000	I'm assuming that's, you know, everything together. You can find some deals on the internet, by the way.
2796000	2800000	Some sites are offering it for $13.86 or $14.99, so just look around.
2800000	2807000	So, there you go. That's a pretty darn good deal for a game I think a lot of folks might have missed, Valkyria Chronicles.
2807000	2815000	I only played a little bit of it. I think Alan owned the game, so I played a little bit of it, but unfortunately didn't get into it too much and I certainly didn't beat it.
2815000	2820000	It's just one of those games where probably some MMO got in the way and I never did end up beating it.
2820000	2824000	Alright, anyway, we are going to open up Skype line. It is that time. Let's take some calls.
2824000	2833000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to call and participate with our program on whatever topic you'd like to bring up.
2834000	2841000	Or maybe there's something we didn't get to tonight that you want to bring up. Perhaps a game that you've been playing that you want to review or something along those lines.
2841000	2848000	Looking quickly at our Twitter over at Twitter.com slash OLR, Dark Tetsuya tweeted us during the show here saying,
2848000	2856000	Try as I might to locate the Orange Bats DDR routine on YouTube. I'm afraid the search has ended in failure, Frowny.
2856000	2860000	Don't worry, I'm sure DarkSakura is probably rejoicing a little bit for that. Alright.
2861000	2863000	I actually have it on a desk somewhere in my house.
2863000	2868000	Do you really? You should bring that up. Anyway, we're going to go to the phones. We have a call coming in.
2868000	2870000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
2870000	2873000	Hey, how are you doing? It's me, Pau here.
2873000	2878000	Hey, Pau. Wow, I don't think you've called into the show before and we see you. How are you doing?
2878000	2886000	Pretty good. I've been just thinking about calling, not calling for almost three, four weeks, but I wasn't really sure and I decided to do it.
2886000	2888000	Where are you from, Pau?
2888000	2890000	I was born in Spain.
2890000	2893000	Oh, okay. Where do you live now? In the States? Canada?
2893000	2895000	Yeah, I'm in California now.
2895000	2897000	Oh, you're in California. What part?
2897000	2899000	Yeah, Palm Springs.
2899000	2903000	Okay, Palm Springs. Oh, that's where all the fun parties happen. Alright.
2903000	2907000	All my neighbors are like 70s, so super quiet.
2907000	2910000	There's a lot of old people in Palm Springs, quite a few.
2910000	2915000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy? You made the decision to call into the show. Glad you did. What's up?
2915000	2927000	Yeah, I was wondering with so many games coming out and with just so many releases at the same time, I was wondering for you guys so far, what was the biggest surprise of the year?
2927000	2934000	Like, which game? You were not really sure and then you realized that you just can't stop playing it.
2934000	2940000	Ooh, this is a tricky question to get put on the spot with. Alright, let's see. Do you guys have an answer for Pau's question?
2941000	2944000	And I invite the chat room to answer this too.
2944000	2946000	Sure, put it off on everyone else, Rob.
2946000	2956000	Well, no, it seems like Pau is taking a poll. I don't know if he's trying to catch up on some games that he might have missed, but what are some games this year that surprised you?
2956000	2960000	I started playing Off this year. I was surprised at how good it was.
2960000	2961000	Off?
2961000	2969000	Off. You play as the batter and you're an avatar and you have to go on this holy adventure, but you walk around with a bat.
2969000	2975000	It's a weird French game and it's got a translation out. That and I did expect to love Hataful Boyfriend as much as I do.
2975000	2979000	There you go, Hataful Boyfriend. Loki, anything you can think of?
2979000	2985000	Sadly, most of the surprises this year have been games that have been a lot more terrible than I thought they were going to be.
2985000	2996000	You know, like, I guess Watch Dogs wasn't as good as I had hoped. Elder Scrolls Online, at least based off the beta, wasn't that great?
2996000	3004000	I would say that probably in the positive, maybe, I was surprised, I haven't played it yet, but Far Cry 4 looks really good.
3004000	3008000	I wasn't expecting it at Far Cry 4 this year and, I mean, that looks pretty fantastic.
3008000	3019000	So, they'll be coming out in just a couple weeks here and, I don't know, Destiny's kind of okay, I guess.
3020000	3028000	I don't know, Sunset Overdrive, I guess, would be a good surprise. Once again, I haven't played that.
3028000	3033000	Call of Duty, I was kind of expecting to be good, so that wasn't really much of a surprise.
3033000	3038000	I don't know, maybe Bayonetta 2? I mean, I haven't played that, but it looks good.
3038000	3043000	I'm having a hard time thinking of stuff that was out this year that's not, like, obvious.
3043000	3050000	Like, I could say, oh, the Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 4, because that turned out really, really well, but I feel like that's kind of a cop-out answer.
3050000	3055000	Or I could say the Diablo 3 expansion. The Diablo 3 expansion, because it fixed all the problems of the game.
3055000	3056000	How about Shovel Knight?
3056000	3063000	I was going to say Shovel Knight! You cut me off! Damn you! He took my answer. Shovel Knight.
3063000	3069000	Shovel Knight was really fun, I played it. For me, I think it was probably Bayonetta 2.
3070000	3077000	I was cautiously optimistic, because when that game has that kind of, you know, now get cancelled and then goes back again.
3077000	3083000	I was cautiously optimistic, but I just played and I just had so much fun.
3083000	3089000	I cannot remember the last time that I played a game and I genuinely loved what I was playing.
3090000	3100000	From the first second, when she just says, well, I just need some shoes that don't have guns on them, the lines were so ridiculous, but so good.
3100000	3105000	The controls were improved, the camera was improved, so I think it just improved everything on the original.
3105000	3107000	Even the online mode worked good, I mean.
3107000	3113000	I don't know about you, but I just laugh and laugh and laugh playing that game, because it's so over-the-top.
3113000	3120000	Even from the very beginning, in the opening sequence with the New York City Christmas, it's just so over-the-top.
3120000	3126000	I can't help it. I always scream laughing at some stuff. You know what that is, when you start screaming laughing.
3126000	3136000	I think it's also just so hard and so refreshing to see a feminine character that at the same time is really feminine, but at the same time is extremely aggressive.
3136000	3150000	I think it's really challenging sometimes to write, so I thought they showed them making off to promote the game, and it was really clear that it was written with a girl developer.
3150000	3160000	I just think the mix was just really, really good. I thought the writing was just really, really funny. Even the online mode worked great.
3160000	3163000	I'm looking at our chat room to see if there's some votes in there.
3163000	3168000	Dungeon Buster says Alien Isolation is good if you're an Alien fan. I've heard that's a good, scary game, too.
3168000	3173000	A lot of folks are telling me to play that one and stream it to watch me pee my pants live.
3173000	3178000	Let's see, some folks in the chat room, a couple of people saying Wolfenstein was really fun.
3178000	3179000	Yeah, I heard that was really good.
3179000	3182000	I've heard that, too. I haven't played it myself, but I have a friend-
3182000	3188000	I feel like Downsize the Hero is really short. That's why I didn't buy it, but I do want to buy it.
3188000	3189000	That's a really good feedback.
3189000	3197000	Yeah, I sort of go, oh, it's another reimagining of this game that had its limelight back in the 90s, but apparently it is really good.
3197000	3202000	Well, you may remember, they have re-released- not re-released it, but tried reimagining it a few times now.
3202000	3205000	So, I don't know. It's not entirely new.
3205000	3211000	All right. Well, there you go, pal. There are some of our suggestions here from the chatters and us in the studio.
3211000	3217000	All right. Well, thank you for having me, and I hope that Dark Sakura gets better with her ear issues.
3218000	3222000	I have some chronic issues on my left one, so I understand her pain.
3222000	3225000	Thank you. I appreciate that. It's thankfully getting better.
3225000	3232000	Just, I thought that it was completely better today, so I went without my medication, and IKEA ruined me.
3232000	3240000	Oh, and my recommendation is if you can avoid it and don't use good headphones like this one, because I have chronic problems.
3240000	3243000	They always make it better if it's painful.
3243000	3248000	I have to use the work headphones, but other than that, I don't really use them, so yeah. But thank you.
3248000	3250000	All right. Well, thank you for having me.
3250000	3253000	Healing vibes to you both. Take care. Anytime, pal. Don't be a stranger.
3253000	3254000	Bye. Bye.
3254000	3259000	I always like hearing from new people here on Orange Laundry. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love our serial collars as well.
3259000	3261000	Is that his icon? His icon looks like him.
3261000	3264000	Yeah, I think that was a little me. Let me bring that up again here.
3264000	3265000	Oh, that's cool.
3265000	3266000	So, you can see that there.
3266000	3268000	Oh, yeah. That looks just like him. Well done.
3268000	3276000	No, I like when people do avatars with preset stuff, and they actually get it to look like them. Like, mine looks like me, I think.
3276000	3278000	Do you think my me looks like me?
3278000	3282000	Yeah. He's got your weird, you know, nose. I'm kidding.
3282000	3283000	My weird nose?
3283000	3285000	I like your weird nose. It's very Dutch.
3285000	3293000	Do you know that when, just to see, do you know that when I was born, apparently, when I, you know, came from the place that babies come from.
3293000	3295000	When you squelched forward.
3295000	3303000	The first thing my mom said was, he has the blank her maiden name. He has the blank nose.
3303000	3309000	Dan has the family nose. I think it's really a Dutch thing, you know?
3309000	3314000	Might be, might be. Let's get to some more calls. Skype's lighting up tonight, but we have time to get a few more in here.
3314000	3316000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?
3316000	3317000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
3317000	3319000	Hey, Akdeft. How you doing, buddy?
3319000	3321000	Really good, really good.
3321000	3322000	What's in your mind?
3322000	3334000	Well, since you brought Steam during most of some of the show, I also wanted to talk about something Steam did recently.
3334000	3336000	Oh, sure. What's that?
3336000	3340000	They changed the currency in Mexico to pesos.
3340000	3351000	I had seen you tweeting about this. So, since a lot of our listeners probably don't have that perspective from not living in Mexico, tell us about, like, what this change is and what it means.
3351000	3366000	Well, some background first. And I have said this before on the show, that most of the games here sold on stores and that stuff cost way more than they cost in the United States.
3366000	3367000	Right.
3367000	3373000	Basically because of conversion and import fees and taxes and all that stuff, all that good stuff.
3373000	3380000	Well, it's just like here if you want to buy a game that was released in Japan, we pay a shit ton of extra money for that.
3380000	3393000	Yeah, basically, but at least that's a real import, but like the stuff that was released in the United States or in America, basically, it costs a lot.
3393000	3402000	Only a few companies like Microsoft and sometimes Sony do match price, at least don't go a higher price.
3402000	3407000	Nintendo stuff here sells a really high price.
3407000	3412000	Yikes. So, what did Steam do to help this get better?
3412000	3428000	First, a lot of people, including me, thought that Steam was going to turn for the worse, that they were going to charge high prices or they weren't going to be at least that affordable, maybe.
3428000	3443000	But they came and it actually surprised me a lot because not a lot. Most of the games, like 99% of the games, cost way cheaper than the United States prices.
3443000	3446000	Wow, interesting.
3446000	3465000	Like, for example, Civilization Beyond Earth, it costs $50 on Steam in the United States. Here it costs 440 pesos. In the conversion, it's more or less like $40.
3465000	3472000	Well, that's not fair. I'm opening up a Mexican account and I'm going to buy all my games with pesos. It's no fair.
3473000	3486000	Everyone should do that. And it's something curious because it's not only here that happens. It's also on places like Russia and I think Brazil also have cheaper prices than the United States.
3486000	3498000	That's something that, and I didn't know this until a few months ago, that a lot of people buy from Russians or people on other places just to buy cheaper.
3498000	3509000	I have heard of this before. In fact, I think this is how friends I know got cheap copies of Mass Effect 3 was like Russian keys or something like that from doing it that way.
3509000	3518000	And then I like how I'm talking about getting cheaper games. I'm sure my friends over in the UK are like, shut up, because everything's more expensive over there.
3519000	3533000	Do you think that maybe part of Steam wanting to start accepting the pesos in the community and so forth is to try and foster more of the trading card and the marketplace?
3533000	3538000	Did that all recently open up for you guys too? Because I'm wondering if that might be a motive.
3538000	3555000	No, no, that's something we have always had. Even the market, I could sell the cards or even items from like Pink Fortress 2 and we got the amount in dollars, but now I get pesos.
3555000	3565000	But that's something that we always have done. It's not something that is region locked. Something really curious though, especially carrying to the market.
3566000	3585000	Like for example, you can now pay, not like credit, but it's something that you purchase the game on Steam, but you don't necessarily have to use a credit card or a gift card for example.
3585000	3604000	You need to go to a convenience store like 7-Eleven just to make an example. We have a convenience store called Oxo. Oxos are everywhere. You can go to every corner and you can find one.
3604000	3622000	So you can basically go there and pay your game and that's it. So yeah, it's really convenient too for people that don't have a credit card or even a PayPal account. So you can basically just go to the store and pay for your game and that's it.
3623000	3636000	Interesting. Well, thank you for giving us a little insight as to how it works in other countries because sometimes we are very blinded by what we've got here locally. It's always interesting to hear what goes on in other countries.
3636000	3642000	And having to deal with the conversions, but not anymore on Steam and now you're getting the better end of the deal.
3642000	3644000	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
3644000	3646000	Alright, enjoy it while it lasts.
3646000	3649000	Hopefully it never ends.
3649000	3652000	Alright, well take care my friend and we'll let you go to get some more calls.
3652000	3655000	Okay, looking forward to you playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
3655000	3658000	Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Alright, bye my friend.
3658000	3659000	Bye.
3659000	3667000	Alright, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Alan's the best, he just brought me pizza. He's so cool.
3667000	3670000	Alan can bring me pizza.
3670000	3671000	Alright.
3671000	3672000	Alan, pizza.
3672000	3676000	OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.
3676000	3680000	Or 1877 game OLR.
3680000	3682000	Yeah, you had a burrito.
3682000	3685000	I can tease if I want to Rob.
3685000	3687000	It's your party and you'll tease if you want to.
3687000	3689000	Uh, that sounded wrong.
3689000	3693000	Alright, well let's get to the phones. It's lighting up tonight, oh my gosh.
3693000	3695000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
3695000	3696000	It's the one and only Rama.
3696000	3699000	I see you Rama. Uh oh, what's in the glass?
3699000	3701000	Uh, it's a little bit of rum and coke.
3701000	3702000	Good times.
3702000	3704000	I was going to ask if you were drinking antifreeze.
3704000	3706000	Not as good as the hooch I had.
3706000	3710000	No, I'm drinking in honor of a good friend, so.
3710000	3712000	Alright, well I'll drink to them too.
3712000	3714000	Good, good, good.
3714000	3716000	Alright, what's on your mind my friend?
3716000	3722000	Well, first of all I want to second act deaf and yeah, you have to do a live stream of Five Nights at Freddy's.
3722000	3727000	I don't like peer pressure, but I do like this pizza.
3728000	3732000	Rob, I will watch you play, I will come over while you play Five Nights at Freddy's.
3732000	3733000	Will you hold my hand?
3733000	3734000	I will hold your hand.
3734000	3735000	Yay.
3735000	3737000	And then I will fucking laugh my ass off.
3737000	3740000	Wow, Jamie, you're a good friend.
3740000	3742000	I'm the best.
3742000	3744000	I know, right?
3745000	3747000	We'll see, after Blizzcon, after Blizzcon.
3747000	3753000	Oh, don't even get me started off at Blizzcon. I got a friend of mine, she's going nuts with her cosplay, getting it done for Blizzcon.
3753000	3755000	I'm like, that's not...
3755000	3756000	Is this our same friend?
3756000	3758000	No, different friend.
3758000	3759000	Okay.
3759000	3760000	Rob is popular, he has lots of friends.
3760000	3764000	By the way, did you see Kayla's costume?
3764000	3765000	Yes, I did.
3765000	3766000	The disciple?
3766000	3768000	That was fucking gorgeous.
3768000	3772000	Everyone needs to not give her a hard time for doing Homestuck cosplay.
3773000	3779000	We give everybody shit for every single cosplay that they do.
3779000	3782000	It's just, but I do understand where you're coming from though.
3782000	3784000	I do understand though.
3785000	3790000	Alright, so what's on your mind tonight? Is it just to peer pressure me into live streaming, or is it something else?
3790000	3795000	Well, that too, but I called in to say congratulations for hitting episode 573.
3795000	3799000	Thank you, I realize you understand what that means.
3799000	3807000	Yeah, and then when you were talking earlier about how you got into the Bimani scene, and so I started thinking about how I got into it.
3807000	3814000	And then I remember that one phone call where... Can I remember her name?
3814000	3820000	She was on the show, Jason's old lady, and I said if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have...
3820000	3824000	Well, what about you guys? You gave her shit for that, and I do remember that.
3825000	3827000	I remember that as well, yes, yes.
3828000	3836000	And I think about that, I'm like, well, to be perfectly honest, if it wasn't for my last girlfriend who I was with 10 years back,
3836000	3845000	I never would have known about all of this, because I go to the con, and I'm like, I see this dance pad sitting here, and I'm like, what the hell is this?
3845000	3852000	And I step on it, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, I walk away, and then at the time I'm flirting with her, she's like, do you play DDR?
3852000	3859000	I'm like, what's that? And she's like, well, does she describe what it is? I'm like, yes, I do play DDR!
3859000	3866000	And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, where the fuck am I going to find an arcade machine so I can play so I don't know exactly what I'm doing?
3866000	3872000	That is, that is funny. Well, you know, we always say at the end of every episode, tell a friend about the show, and it works!
3872000	3877000	We would not have Rama if somebody was not telling a friend about the show. There's a reason we do it.
3877000	3879000	Mm-hmm, got that right.
3879000	3884000	Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the congrats for episode 573, I appreciate that very much.
3884000	3893000	Hey, I'm going to put you on the spot, because we asked earlier, everybody, if you had to pick one song licensed, well, the two, one licensed, one unlicensed,
3893000	3897000	best Bamani song ever licensed and unlicensed.
3897000	3908000	Okay, I did answer that, but I had two answers, but they're both licensed titles, so can I give them?
3908000	3910000	I don't know, judges?
3910000	3912000	Sure, I'll allow it.
3912000	3924000	The first song is My Sweet Darling by Wildside, because that song was so catchy and so awesome, so I went looking to find the full version of the song.
3924000	3935000	Come to find out, it's a cover by a J-pop artist by the name of Yida Hitomi, who is one of my favorite artists, I listen to her albums on a regular basis.
3935000	3936000	Nice.
3936000	3944000	And my number two song is Tiggy Freckles, because when I first heard this song, I'm like, why does it sound familiar to me?
3944000	3958000	And I'm like, I know this song from somewhere, and then out of the blue, I just happen to be watching Kenshin, and I'm just like, this song, oh my God, it's a cover of Sobokazu by Moroni Kenshin.
3958000	3963000	I know that song as the song that makes it really easy to get max 300.
3963000	3979000	Well, then you remember how I would sing it while playing, but I only knew the Japanese lyrics, so I'd be like, I still to this day don't know the English lyrics to it, because I still run through the really high-pitched Japanese vocals in my head.
3979000	3982000	What am I gonna do when I get, something like that.
3982000	3988000	You'll find that someone has taken the English soul and just remixed it to Kenshin, I think it's pretty cool.
3988000	3989000	Oh my gosh.
3989000	3993000	Alright, well Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks as always for the call.
3993000	3994000	Hey, no problem.
3994000	3998000	Listen to Anime Jam Session, but oh, not this week, you guys are on repeat this week, right?
3998000	4006000	No, we recorded an episode at Zenkai Con, so we'll be putting that in with some extra songs, and you know, we're gonna keep it fresh for everyone.
4006000	4013000	That's it, so it's taped in advance, but still, it's live, not live from a convention.
4013000	4015000	Yes, yes, yes.
4015000	4016000	Alright, check it out.
4016000	4017000	Alright, thanks my friend, take care.
4017000	4020000	You too, and instead of staying black, stay fabulous.
4020000	4024000	I always will, and I snap, and glitter has exploded everywhere.
4024000	4025000	Pao and I need to talk.
4025000	4026000	Have a good one.
4026000	4027000	By the way.
4027000	4028000	What?
4028000	4036000	Pao and I need to talk, because once the live-action Kenshin movie, with English subtitles, I know where to find it.
4036000	4038000	You know where to find it, alright.
4038000	4044000	Anyway, we are way past time tonight, we gotta wrap up, because, you know, tonight's a school night.
4044000	4049000	So, I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through on Skype, please consider sending us an email.
4049000	4053000	Participate at OrangeLawnTradia.com, but be prepared to be put on the spot.
4053000	4062000	If you're emailing us to talk about episode 573, be prepared to answer the question about your favorite licensed and non-licensed, and you can only pick one.
4062000	4064000	We are not waiving it for anybody else.
4064000	4069000	Dark Sakura was being very kind and generous to Rama.
4069000	4070000	Anyhow.
4071000	4079000	Just keep, I am stacking up lots of favors that I'm going to redeem in the form of a ticket to New York, and a place to crash.
4079000	4082000	Maybe you can cash that one in for, like, an authentic taco from New York City.
4082000	4084000	Oh, I'm already doing big, big favors.
4084000	4086000	That thing I told you I'm working on?
4086000	4087000	Oh yeah, right, right, right.
4087000	4088000	Oh yeah.
4088000	4089000	There you go.
4089000	4090000	Cash those checks, girl.
4090000	4091000	Cash those checks.
4091000	4093000	I save them up.
4093000	4098000	Let me just quickly check in with Loki for any quick last minute headlines here, before we sign out.
4098000	4103000	Last minute headline, I'm on level 1,964 clicker heroes.
4103000	4106000	Oh god, I forgot to try that game, that's probably a good thing.
4106000	4107000	Don't try it.
4107000	4108000	I won't.
4108000	4109000	It's pointless.
4109000	4111000	I don't know why I'm still playing this, just for no reason.
4111000	4113000	Because you have problems.
4113000	4114000	I do have problems.
4114000	4116000	Because I also don't have to look at the screen to play it.
4116000	4118000	It plays itself.
4118000	4119000	It plays itself.
4119000	4120000	Just like cookie clickers.
4120000	4125000	Alright, well then that being said, we are going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
4125000	4129000	Hey, thank you guys for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4129000	4131000	It was a very diverse episode tonight.
4131000	4142000	We had some good old fashioned debate and we had some good old fashioned memories looking back on some of the great foundations of where our show came from.
4142000	4145000	So thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.
4145000	4147000	What's that?
4147000	4151000	I was reminding you that we have a special cookie tonight.
4151000	4153000	I still have to bring it up.
4153000	4154000	But that's just for the live listeners.
4154000	4156000	The podcasters sadly don't get that part.
4156000	4160000	Because that's where we play things that don't necessarily belong to us.
4160000	4167000	So anyway, thank you guys very much for listening to the show and supporting independent podcasting.
4167000	4170000	Remember, if you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, then support another show.
4170000	4176000	But if you did like Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five or fifty about the program.
4176000	4177000	Who knows?
4177000	4180000	You might know the next Rama.
4180000	4182000	Just like somebody referred Rama to this show.
4182000	4183000	You might know them.
4183000	4186000	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and keep this the place where every gamer has a voice.
4186000	4190000	And where we can engage in a lively debate respectfully.
4190000	4195000	I think that's one thing I really like about what we've been able to do here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4195000	4198000	That's my thought.
4198000	4201000	So let me go around and get everybody's final thought.
4201000	4206000	I'll start with my actual final thought, which would be this pizza is delicious.
4206000	4208000	Nom nom nom.
4208000	4210000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
4210000	4212000	Reject false icons.
4212000	4214000	Oh, look at you going for a classic there.
4214000	4217000	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.
4217000	4222000	My final thought is I am done playing cookie cooker today.
4222000	4224000	Sure, you say that now.
4224000	4229000	Well, I'm level two thousand one, so I should be good enough.
4229000	4231000	How many of the achievements have we gotten?
4231000	4232000	Eighty four percent.
4232000	4234000	It's not a hundred percent.
4234000	4235000	All right.
4235000	4238000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4238000	4240000	We will be back next week.
4240000	4242000	Podcasters, you don't have to do anything different.
4242000	4245000	The show will show up on the feed just like you're used to.
4245000	4248000	Live listeners, keep in mind, we may be a little bit delayed.
4248000	4251000	Stay tuned to our Twitter for updates.
4251000	4254000	And Bobby Black Wolf will also provide updates live at VOG.
4254000	4257000	But I will be literally walking in the door.
4257000	4261000	This also means that next week's episode will be produced by Loki.
4261000	4263000	This will be interesting.
4263000	4266000	It won't be. It'll be just like it normally is.
4266000	4270000	He pretty much gives me three quarters of the stories that go on the show anyway.
4270000	4273000	So it'll be just like any other week at OLR.
4273000	4274000	So we will see you next week.
4274000	4276000	I'll be back to talk BlizzCon.
4276000	4278000	Those of you that will be in Anaheim on Thursday,
4278000	4279000	I hope to see you at World of Podcasts.
4279000	4281000	Have a good night everybody. See you next week.
4281000	4284000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4284000	4288000	Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
