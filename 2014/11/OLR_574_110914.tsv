7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	Tonight, November 9th, 2014, we're fresh back from BlizzCon and ready to talk about their first big new IP in over a decade. Also, games start to disappear, including one EA MOBA and Ubisoft games from Steam. We didn't disappear, and we'll talk about all this next on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November 9th, 2014, with the 574th episode of our program.
45000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts, and yep, I made it back. We're good to go. If you've been following the show recently, I literally just got off a plane an hour and a half ago, and here we are doing the show with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
59000	64000	We drifted a few times and took some curves, and I had to cut off some guy.
65000	77000	Jamie actually gave me a ride from the airport. Thank you so much. Deeply appreciated. But as the kickoff song tonight for OLR, I played an old Bamani favorite that seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway.
82000	92000	If any of you have ever played Initial D or anything like that, it's all Eurobeat music, so it seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway, except her music in the car is Let's Have a Kiki.
92000	101000	Actually, right when you got in the car, it was an Apollo Throwdown, and then it was Let's Have a Kiki, and eventually ended into a remix of Calista.
101000	107000	It was a very Jamie ride, Mass Effect remixes and so forth. And then it ended.
107000	110000	Although that version was from a racing game. It was from Midnight Club, I think.
110000	112000	And then it ended with a burrito.
112000	116000	With a burrito. Tacos for you, tacos. Rolled tacos.
116000	118000	Tacitos, a little snack told me over till the real dinner.
118000	120000	Rob put something long and cylindrical in his mouth.
121000	122000	Hey, hey. Watch it.
122000	125000	Alright, also joining us in the studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
125000	126000	Hello.
126000	127000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
127000	128000	Doing okay.
128000	130000	So I heard your PlayStation 4 is already back.
130000	132000	Yes. That was surprisingly fast.
132000	133000	But it's not your PlayStation 4.
133000	137000	No, it's just a reverb, but whatever. It's mine now.
137000	141000	You see this? It's mine now. So they sent you a better one, basically.
141000	142000	Yeah, it was less scratched.
142000	143000	Nice.
143000	145000	And didn't have a weird smell to it.
145000	148000	Well, I know we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that in a little bit.
148000	153000	But let me ask, just overall, how has your experience been now that you're playing PlayStation 4 games?
153000	160000	Good. I wish they had some better control over when you're downloading stuff.
160000	165000	Because I was downloading my digital version of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
165000	170000	And I wanted to download other things first.
170000	174000	And I paused stuff. And then even when it said it was done downloading, it went into the game.
174000	176000	I'm like, cool. I'm going to play some of the campaign.
176000	179000	Because I told it to download the single player first.
179000	182000	Even though I played the campaign like six times now.
182000	185000	So I played the campaign and got through the first level.
185000	189000	And it's like, please wait for the rest of the content to download.
189000	193000	I'm like, what? It's got like seven minutes left. What the hell?
193000	195000	So I thought this was done already.
195000	197000	That was like Destiny, playing that for the first time.
197000	199000	Because you put the disc in and it spins up and a little bar fills up.
199000	200000	You're like, all right, it's installing.
200000	201000	All right, we're good to go.
201000	204000	And you go into the game and it's like, downloading game updates.
204000	205000	Download, download, download.
205000	207000	I haven't even touched Destiny yet.
207000	210000	Just warning you, you're going to have a similar experience.
210000	211000	So be ready.
211000	219000	But we did play more of, or I should say Josh was very excited to be able to play more Ninja Bots again.
219000	221000	Oh good. Something for everybody in the household.
221000	227000	All right, well joining us in studio tonight, we have a very extra special guest here for Orange Lawns Radio.
227000	231000	Those of you who have been listening to the show for a long time will recognize this voice.
231000	235000	Somebody who is only able to grace us with her presence once in a blue moon.
235000	237000	But we're so happy she's here tonight in studio.
237000	240000	Say hello everybody to Marissa.
240000	241000	Hello.
241000	242000	Hi, welcome back.
242000	243000	Hi, it's great to be back.
243000	248000	And Marissa, if you have not been following the saga of Marissa.
248000	250000	How many parts is there?
250000	252000	I think there's 27.
252000	254000	It's a sonnet in 27 movements.
255000	259000	No, but you say you're not a gamer, but you totally are.
259000	263000	Like, you know more about the Thief franchise than anyone I know.
263000	265000	We're not going to talk about the new one.
265000	268000	Marissa's very irritated.
268000	270000	What went wrong? What went wrong with New Thief?
270000	271000	Everything.
274000	275000	How about one example?
275000	282000	They really wanted to, they tried to cater to too many people at once instead of taking advantage of what made it lovable in the first place.
282000	288000	So it created a really scattered vision and they got rid of the lead voice actor, who is a motherfucking genius.
289000	291000	Well, let's talk about voice acting for a little bit.
291000	298000	Because I know that in the earlier days of OLR, because the show's been around a while, so people's lives have changed over the past 12 years.
298000	302000	For a while you were really into folk music, and you still are.
302000	304000	I mean, I know that's not something you've really abandoned.
304000	309000	But somewhere along the way you got the itch to get into voice acting, right?
309000	314000	It's actually what I had wanted to do ever since I was about eight or nine.
314000	315000	Really?
315000	320000	I had even studied it. I studied acting intently and I was an actor for many years.
320000	324000	And this is actually, back in my day, this is when it wasn't cool.
324000	327000	When all my theater friends would tease me, that's not real acting.
327000	329000	Now they're like, can you help me get an agent?
330000	341000	And I had done all these other things, honestly, because it takes a lot of courage, as anybody knows, when they are the sole proprietor or an independent contractor, to represent yourself.
341000	344000	It's a lot easier to hustle for other things.
344000	350000	And a lot of my friends came together and they gave me, I guess, a talent intervention or something.
350000	354000	They're like, we can't have you crying anymore because you're coming home working at a law office.
354000	357000	We think you're good at this thing and you should do it.
357000	363000	Which also meant a lot to me because I know if I went to them and I was like, I would like to be a ballerina, they'd be like, really?
363000	367000	No. That's how I knew they weren't BSing me.
367000	371000	I love that. A talent intervention. That's amazing.
371000	374000	So you are doing voice acting now.
374000	381000	Sadly, I can't say, oh, Marissa's been in this game you've all played, but it'll be a road to get there at some point, right?
381000	382000	Right.
382000	388000	Well, I don't know how time, because I know that the show's starting right now, but we can talk about how people start that later.
388000	390000	Because it's a little bit lengthy to talk about that process.
390000	392000	We'll get into that part B, I guess, a little bit.
392000	393000	Okay.
393000	394000	Just remind me.
394000	398000	My mind's going 100 miles an hour right now since I literally was in Anaheim earlier today and now I'm here.
398000	401000	It's also one of those jobs where you're like, hey, what do you do?
401000	404000	I go, oh, I do this and they go, oh, how can I get into it?
404000	407000	You know what? A lot of people want to know that.
407000	410000	But a lot of people want to hear video game talk, too, so we'll get to that a little later in the show.
410000	412000	We'll ask all about how you got into that.
412000	421000	Now, usually I would say let's talk about people, because you know a lot of voice actor people, but I want to keep it really positive.
421000	422000	I want to talk bad about anybody.
422000	424000	So who are some awesome voice actors?
424000	427000	If we aren't following their stuff, we really should be.
427000	430000	Who is doing the video games that are just awesome people?
430000	438000	I don't have anyone that I've ever even heard anything negatively about, because everyone I've ever met has honestly been wonderful.
439000	445000	I know that people are people and we don't necessarily get along, but it's a community where it's very small.
450000	456000	You think about video games and who is voicing stuff. It's like Jennifer Hale is in every game and Troy Baker is in every game.
456000	459000	This weekend was the Troy Baker game weekend.
459000	463000	That's not a bad thing. They are both gods.
463000	465000	It makes the game that much better.
465000	466000	Yeah, exactly.
467000	470000	You hear that Jennifer Hale is going to be in a game and it's like, yes please.
470000	477000	There are so many facets to that too, because they know that they are amazingly talented, but they are going to show up and they are good to work with.
477000	487000	Although, now that we've gotten to the age where we are digitally scanning actors, a lot of the characters in the games I'm playing are starting to look like Troy Baker.
490000	493000	You must have been playing Infamous this week, I believe.
493000	495000	We'll get to that in a little bit though.
495000	503000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the voice of Geeks Network.
503000	506000	Vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
506000	509000	I'm going to do my best voices tonight with Marissa President.
509000	513000	I'm in the presence of voice acting soon to be royalty. I need to do my best.
513000	518000	Alan Alchemy is asking a question saying, Marissa, have you worked on anything with Chris Hardwick?
518000	522000	I know that voice acting work is rarely done in a group studio setting anymore.
522000	525000	No, I haven't. Although, yes, that's true.
525000	531000	Specifically with American animation, that's when it's done in a room.
531000	536000	Actually, it is amazing. You have to give serious credit to people who do video games and anime.
536000	542000	They give them the least amount of anything and as little as possible, they just go, make your magic, do something.
542000	549000	Taliesin Jaffe, I'm pronouncing his name wrong because I put the emphasis on the wrong syllable.
550000	558000	He's an amazing actor who came into our class and talked about one time they just threw this thing at him at the last second.
558000	562000	It turned out in the game that he was kind of playing this butch woman.
562000	565000	They didn't tell him that at the time, but they just threw this at him.
565000	568000	It ended up being hilarious and funny, but they gave him so little to go on.
568000	572000	To start to transition into what I'm going to talk about next,
572000	578000	there was a voice acting stage at BlizzCon where all weekend they had voice acting talent up there on the stage.
578000	581000	I was joking with you before the show, I thought of you and I really did.
581000	584000	Just seeing some of that talent on display, there were some panels,
584000	587000	and I'll admit I didn't stay to watch anything start to finish,
587000	591000	but there were some demos that were near there so I kind of absorbed what was going on.
591000	596000	I heard some Q&A, but I also heard one panel, talking about a little bit to go on,
596000	600000	where they were doing monster voices as requested by the audience.
600000	603000	It was like design a monster voice over panel or something like that.
603000	608000	Some guy got up there and was like, zombie, turkey, thanksgiving, rat.
608000	610000	I don't know what the heck it was, but it was crazy.
610000	613000	This man made the most hideous noise I've ever heard in my life,
613000	617000	but he pulled it out of thin air, like I imagine you have to do sometimes.
617000	620000	You had to be able to do that at the last second.
620000	624000	Video games are one of the most grueling things you can do to your voice because of those efforts.
624000	629000	Getting stabbed lightly, deeply, getting stabbed and the knife pulling downwards to the side.
629000	634000	And also, if you have something like this, you have to be able to have range within that.
634000	641000	If you audition and you get the job like that, you can't move within an emotional range within there.
641000	644000	You're screwed and you're actually going to be sounding like that at the end of the day.
644000	647000	Yeah, wow, wow. Oh my gosh, wow.
647000	652000	Any other games you've been dabbling in lately, Marissa?
652000	656000	I don't know if your voice acting lends any time to games.
656000	659000	I've actually really just been studying what other actors have been doing more.
659000	662000	That's really been a lot of my time.
662000	668000	I just completed a move and then all my grief over the thief game.
668000	670000	Fair enough, fair enough. I like that.
670000	675000	You might be looking for influence in some of the art that's out there with voice acting.
675000	676000	That's really cool.
676000	677000	Absolutely.
677000	680000	Well, we'll talk to Marissa more throughout the show and please feel free to chime in at any point.
680000	683000	If you guys have questions for her in chat, we can do that as well.
683000	686000	But let's move on to our kickoff topic tonight, BlizzCon.
686000	692000	I'm back from BlizzCon and I literally just walked off the plane about 90 minutes ago and here we are at OLR.
692000	694000	I spent...
694000	697000	Rob, that's figuratively just walked off the plane.
697000	698000	Whatever.
698000	701000	If you literally did it, we would be filming a recording of the airport.
701000	705000	Really? Because that would be kind of fun, I think, if we could all get past security.
705000	708000	I'd like to point out that my positive spin on your coming out from Anaheim,
708000	711000	yeah, he's like, Anaheim sucks, doesn't it?
711000	713000	I was really positive about that.
713000	718000	Not the city block I was on because I was within one mile of Disneyland at all times.
718000	720000	That is awesome, yes.
720000	722000	So you did the BlizzCon?
722000	725000	No, I didn't go to Disney this time. There was no time.
725000	730000	I arrived on Thursday and the first thing I went to was this event called World of Podcasts.
730000	735000	It was a kick-started event for the community and this was their second year that they'd done the event.
735000	740000	It was a lot of World of Warcraft podcasters and fan communities that came together to do this.
740000	743000	It was a really awesome event, I've got to say.
743000	745000	They did a fantastic job.
745000	747000	They really outperformed last year.
747000	751000	And not to knock last year, but everything starts somewhere and then gets better, right?
751000	754000	So, I mean, it was like five times the size of what they had last year.
754000	759000	They had a room dedicated to panels and I was fortunate enough to be on a panel where I was talking about podcasting,
759000	761000	which, you know, I can talk a lot about, right?
761000	765000	They had a room where you could take your pictures in front of a green screen.
765000	772000	So, myself and Dr. Ken from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and our friend Talrix all got a photo with Sylvanas,
772000	774000	thanks to the green screen magic, so that was fun.
774000	780000	And there was an art gallery in one of the rooms and this fan website, AskMrRobot,
780000	784000	those of you that listen to Hoard House probably remember when we had V on the show from AskMrRobot.
784000	792000	But AskMrRobot is a site that really aims to make players better through data that is submitted to them from logs
792000	796000	and through analysis and lots of big complicated math basically.
796000	802000	But AskMrRobot actually sponsored this art gallery where they had a bunch of photos from the fan community.
802000	806000	They were up on the walls and everywhere and I got to tell you this.
806000	812000	At the con, I got a tweet from V and she said, hey, come find me, I'm over by the Illidan statue.
812000	814000	So, I went over, she said, I got something for you.
814000	820000	So, I went over to the statue and she gave a gift on behalf of AskMrRobot to Hoard House
820000	827000	and believe it or not, what she gave us, one of the prints that was on the wall on display at World of Podcasts.
827000	831000	And each print was specifically picked to match the podcast.
831000	838000	So, we got a picture of an orc baby with a handwritten card from V that said,
838000	842000	so you can hang it in your studio and have a picture of grandpa.
845000	848000	It is fantastic and I'll give you more information.
848000	849000	There's not enough vodka.
849000	852000	I'll give you more information about that on the next episode of Hoard House.
852000	855000	But if you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.
855000	857000	Is it supposed to look like a troll doll?
857000	860000	It's supposed to have a distinct look to it.
860000	862000	I mean, it does look like an orc as a baby.
862000	867000	And my favorite is that he has that confunk coming off of him with all those little flies there.
867000	868000	Oh, that's what that is.
868000	869000	Yeah.
869000	870000	I love his hair.
870000	874000	If you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.
875000	878000	I know we talk about ethics and game journalism and all this stuff.
878000	881000	And I'm really not supposed to let bribes win me over.
881000	883000	But that one kind of won.
883000	885000	I'm just full disclosure.
885000	887000	Like, you give me something like that and yeah.
887000	889000	I'm like, okay, I'm going to say AskMrRobot.
889000	891000	But you're not selling the product.
891000	892000	Yeah, that's right. Exactly.
892000	895000	And we are commentators here at Orange Lounge Radio.
895000	896000	There's a big difference.
896000	898000	All right. Anyway.
898000	901000	We aren't above selling out here at Orange Lounge Radio.
902000	904000	It's the highest bidder. We're not going to lie about it either.
904000	905000	I just sold out for a painting.
905000	907000	We don't have any ethics, so we can't sell them.
909000	910000	Now hold on. We have some ethics.
910000	911000	I can't.
911000	912000	We have some ethics. All right.
912000	915000	Anyway, so that was awesome.
915000	917000	And let's see.
917000	921000	So the con itself, I'm sure a lot of you guys have been following the news.
921000	924000	They didn't say a lot about World of Warcraft because their big expansion is coming out.
924000	929000	They announced Starcraft 2, Legacy of the Void, which we all knew that was coming.
929000	930000	So it wasn't really a big surprise.
930000	932000	Got to play that a little bit on the show floor.
932000	937000	I'm not very good at Starcraft, but lots of intricate cutscenes and things you'd expect was pretty cool.
937000	941000	Diablo 3, my favorite Blizz title right now, sadly.
941000	944000	All they could really talk about was the next mini patch.
944000	946000	But we did get to play that on the show floor.
946000	949000	They're going to have one new map that has these really cool spike traps on it.
949000	956000	And they're going to have different types of treasure gnomes, like treasure gnomes that drop only gems, drop only blood shards, and things like that.
956000	959000	So just a little bit to get into there with Diablo.
959000	962000	And then some bigger news with Hearthstone.
962000	971000	They announced the Goblin vs Gnomes expansion, where the cards have a lot to do with the mechanical things that these two races make.
971000	973000	A lot of unpredictability with that.
973000	977000	And I got to play a match against Dr. Ken, and I made the biggest stupid noob mistake I could.
977000	979000	Because I haven't played Hearthstone in like a year, okay?
979000	983000	So I'm playing this, and Ken gets up from his computer and he's like, you win.
983000	985000	And I'm like, what do you mean I win? I haven't killed you yet.
985000	990000	And he's like, you have all these monsters out, you can attack me for two damage and I'm dead.
990000	996000	And I was like, oh, I thought I had to clear all your minions first, like in Magic the Gathering, before I could attack you.
996000	997000	And he's like, no.
997000	1000000	And I was like, I ended my turn on accident.
1000000	1002000	And so we went back to playing, and he beat me.
1002000	1006000	I made the biggest dumb noob mistake.
1006000	1008000	But the expansion was a lot of fun.
1008000	1010000	It motivated me to give Hearthstone another look.
1010000	1012000	I haven't played it in far too long.
1012000	1015000	Got to play Heroes of the Storm, which they're bringing some new heroes to.
1015000	1019000	Jaina, Thrall, you know, some of those people you know from World of Warcraft.
1019000	1023000	I think Tyrael was new, I can't remember if he was already in the game or not, I apologize.
1023000	1026000	Sometimes with the hero rotation, I forget who is and isn't there.
1026000	1028000	So they announced some new heroes, which was cool.
1028000	1031000	Sylvanas was one that they announced for Heroes of the Storm, that was awesome.
1031000	1033000	She looks like a lot of fun.
1033000	1038000	And got to play that, and again, had a lot of fun playing that, so I need to give that another look.
1038000	1041000	And then, of course, the big one that everybody's talking about.
1041000	1045000	Blizzard announced a new IP franchise.
1045000	1047000	I mean, they say it's their first in 17 years.
1047000	1052000	You have Heroes of the Storm, though, in Hearthstone, so it's not really their first new thing.
1052000	1055000	But heroes based off existing characters.
1055000	1058000	Hearthstone based off existing lore and characters.
1058000	1061000	So this is their first, like, from scratch thing.
1061000	1066000	And as that trailer is playing, which I'm sure you've all seen by now,
1066000	1069000	if you haven't, check it out on YouTube, Overwatch trailer, BlizzCon.
1069000	1073000	It looks like Pixar did it, like it was a really good trailer.
1073000	1075000	Did any of you, the rest of you, see the Overwatch trailer by chance?
1075000	1077000	You really should check it out when you get a chance.
1077000	1078000	I didn't.
1078000	1081000	It was really cool. It looks like a Pixar movie, like you're watching The Incredibles or something.
1081000	1089000	And my jaw hit the floor as I was watching this because I realized this was Project Titan we were looking at.
1089000	1094000	Because there was no way, no way that this was pulled out of somebody's butt in a year.
1094000	1099000	Now, maybe Titan had started as one thing and became this other thing that's now Overwatch.
1099000	1101000	I don't know. We'll never know.
1101000	1105000	Blizzard will probably never peel back the onion on that so we can really see what's in the middle there.
1105000	1112000	But whatever this was was the product of many, many years worth of work, clearly.
1112000	1117000	And Overwatch, which is a lot of people are comparing to Team Fortress 2.
1117000	1121000	I played it twice. I'm comparing it to Team Fortress 2.
1121000	1128000	It is a lot like Team Fortress 2. At least the component we played was very similar to a match in Team Fortress 2 where you control one checkpoint.
1128000	1131000	And then once you take over that checkpoint, you move to the next one and the next one.
1131000	1133000	So it was very much like that.
1133000	1137000	But the characters in Overwatch, very, very good.
1137000	1146000	I mean, just to, you know, Blizzard took some heat last year because there wasn't enough women in World of Warcraft and a lot of strong female characters.
1146000	1153000	Which, you know, you look at Overwatch and they've got men, women, robots, big, small.
1153000	1157000	I mean, just a great diverse roster there in Overwatch.
1157000	1160000	But it's not just the diversity. It's not just that.
1160000	1164000	But it's the fact that all of these characters were so strong and so fleshed out.
1164000	1169000	It wasn't like a reskin of another character. I mean, this was really a new cast of characters.
1169000	1175000	Sometimes I feel with a female thing, though, that strong female character just means not being a prostitute being murdered in a bikini.
1175000	1178000	Anything above that is nice to know.
1178000	1185000	Well, and you know, there was one character I played named Symmetra that definitely had that side cut dress that was a little bit revealing.
1185000	1187000	And she had kind of an Egyptian look to her.
1187000	1189000	And she was kind of, you know, like sexy.
1189000	1196000	But then there was another one, Tracer, that looked like she was like a throwback to one of those Amelia Earhart aviators.
1196000	1198000	What they would look like in the next century.
1198000	1200000	The orange goggles and things like that.
1201000	1206000	And she was really cool and she is the lead mascot for the game. At least that's the sense I get.
1206000	1208000	So, you know, it's around the board.
1208000	1210000	There's going to be a little bit of sexy there.
1210000	1212000	But there were some sexy men, too.
1212000	1214000	You know, a little bit of everything.
1214000	1217000	But the characterization at the end of the day was really, really strong.
1217000	1222000	And yeah, man, there's a lot to devour there.
1222000	1228000	The first time I played it, I wasn't really feeling it because I played Symmetra and I didn't get her at all.
1228000	1233000	And I guess her thing is you want to set up as many turrets as you possibly can, fast, figure out where people...
1233000	1237000	And I didn't get that. I thought, oh, I can only have one turret up at a time.
1237000	1239000	Here I am with the lowest score.
1239000	1243000	So, I don't know, it wasn't a lot of fun when you feel like you don't know what the hell you're doing.
1243000	1245000	But I went back, I said, you know what, I'm going to try it again.
1245000	1247000	So I went back through the second day and I tried it again.
1247000	1253000	I played a character named Mercy, which is almost exactly like the medic in Team Fortress 2, like with the heal ray.
1253000	1255000	But you can heal or you can buff.
1255000	1257000	It's left click, heal, right click, buff.
1257000	1262000	So you have something to do when somebody's health is full, besides the invulnerability thing that Team Fortress has.
1262000	1268000	But the other cool thing is that when you hit the shift button, medic will fly to whatever person you have targeted.
1268000	1271000	Because she's like an angel type character, so she flies right to somebody.
1271000	1273000	So that was really fun to like zip around.
1273000	1278000	And so once I played her, I was like, all right, that was a lot of fun, even though we lost.
1278000	1279000	That was really cool.
1279000	1281000	So Overwatch won me over by the second day.
1281000	1285000	They haven't said if it's free to play or if it's going to be a $60 game, we don't know.
1285000	1292000	I would think because Team Fortress 2 is free and that's going to be the big comparison, I would think Overwatch will be as well.
1292000	1294000	But I don't know, they could also get away with it for $60.
1294000	1298000	I would not be surprised at all if Overwatch makes it to consoles, but they didn't announce that.
1298000	1301000	PC is really the only thing we have.
1301000	1308000	One other thing I wanted to say, I got to say kudos to Blizzard by the way they started their opening ceremony.
1308000	1312000	And not to get into that whole controversy thing again, but the bottom line is,
1312000	1315000	and this is what Mike Morhaime said at the beginning.
1315000	1321000	Like, you know what, there's been a lot of harassment and bullying in the past couple months.
1321000	1326000	And I think it's important for all of us to take a stand against harassment and bullying.
1326000	1330000	And he didn't call anyone out specifically or whatever.
1330000	1337000	But you have to remember, harassment and bullying unfortunately in gaming go way back.
1337000	1339000	They go back years and years.
1339000	1348000	And unfortunately, games like WoW, games like Heroes, people get trolled and yelled at and nerd raged at all the time.
1348000	1354000	So despite all the other drama and hysteria going on in gaming community right now,
1354000	1362000	I thought it was just really cool for the president of a company who sometimes is associated with games that lend themselves to cyberbullying and so forth,
1362000	1366000	to come out and say, hey remember, there's somebody else on the other side of the monitor.
1366000	1370000	And we here at BlizzCon want to kind of start today with creating that environment.
1370000	1374000	Like, I was one over. I was clapping at that point. I was clapping. Marissa?
1374000	1375000	No, I'm doing my church wave.
1375000	1379000	Oh, you're doing your church wave. Yes! Yes, mama, yes!
1379000	1383000	So, anyway, I just thought that was like a super classy thing to do.
1383000	1386000	So, anyway, there you go.
1386000	1389000	So I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1389000	1395000	ActDeaf reminding me that the medic does have a similar metagun called the Kritzkrieg, which buffs the player you're healing.
1395000	1400000	Oh, interesting. I wonder if it's like an all-in-one thing, though. I haven't played enough Team Fortress 2. Sorry about that.
1400000	1408000	Kaijuta says, as far as Hearthstone, me and a few people spammed Blizzard about putting Hearthstone on the Android and they closed the thread.
1408000	1412000	Well, they did announce Android tablets are getting it in December, so you won't have to wait too long.
1412000	1418000	But no phones yet. It's not on iOS phones. It's not on Android phones, as far as I know.
1418000	1421000	So, yeah, that was BlizzCon.
1421000	1427000	And, you know, now that I've attended both BlizzCon and FanFest, Final Fantasy FanFest, you know, the two big MMOs.
1427000	1433000	I mean, obviously WoW is behemoth, but Final Fantasy is kind of like up and coming with a very different kind of cultural background, right?
1433000	1436000	Being Japanese-based as opposed to American-based.
1436000	1440000	It was really kind of cool to see how similar the events really were.
1440000	1443000	I mean, BlizzCon was really well organized.
1443000	1448000	A lot of the line issues that I bitched about with Final Fantasy weren't really present at BlizzCon.
1448000	1450000	Like, the lines moved really briskly.
1450000	1455000	Remember when I had that seeding issue at Final Fantasy I bitched about here on the air?
1455000	1461000	Well, Warcraft had very clearly marked, this section between this time and this time is for VIPs only.
1461000	1465000	You will be asked to look. It was very clearly marked and I thought, okay, that's fair.
1465000	1467000	You know, they have it very marked and that's what they do.
1467000	1470000	And they were just very efficient at getting people to do all the things they wanted to do.
1470000	1480000	But, in Final Fantasy's corner, I kind of thought, like, I didn't need to play WoW at BlizzCon because the expansion is coming out in a week.
1480000	1481000	I don't need to just play.
1481000	1486000	So, why not, you know, what Final Fantasy did is, oh, here's a new boss you can play.
1486000	1493000	Or, here's a special event we made just for the fan fest, like a roulette mode where you have to do a boss with these certain restrictions, you know.
1493000	1497000	It's kind of like putting little spins on the game that make it more interesting.
1497000	1501000	And I think BlizzCon could have had a little more of that for the games that weren't really popular.
1501000	1504000	Like, people weren't really lined up to play Diablo 3 because it was just a mini patch.
1504000	1513000	But, what if they had had, like, a greater rifts contest where if you could get to, like, level 15 on a rift at the show, you'd get a special little pin or something that you could use to train on the board.
1513000	1517000	I think that is something maybe they could have gotten from the fan fest side of things.
1517000	1523000	But, at the end of the day, both cons were good and the reason why, one word, community.
1523000	1533000	The communities for both games, excellent. And, just, I met so many great people at both BlizzCon this past weekend and at fan fest a few weeks ago.
1533000	1537000	The communities for the games are really spectacular and you all behaved yourselves.
1537000	1544000	And, I did not smell butt the entire weekend. Like, everybody was well bathed and using cologne.
1544000	1548000	That or the ventilation in the Anaheim Convention Center is primo.
1548000	1552000	Very well done. So, I did not smell butt the entire time I was there.
1552000	1555000	So, Marissa, why are you giggling?
1555000	1559000	Just laughing at the low bar we have.
1559000	1564000	Alright. One other thing I'll quickly talk about because a lot of people talk about this out of BlizzCon.
1564000	1569000	On the third floor, they showed footage from the Warcraft movie.
1569000	1573000	You're not going to see it on the internet because it was very much under lock and key.
1573000	1579000	They were demonstrating a new Dolby surround type system where the speakers are actually on tracks.
1579000	1583000	And, I'm sorry, I forgot the name of this. Maybe somebody in the chat remembers this.
1583000	1590000	The speakers actually move on the tracks so that if you hear something move, the speaker might actually move the sound from left to right.
1590000	1592000	They're on a 360 rail. It was kind of a trip.
1592000	1596000	But, they played the teaser and some of the Blizzard trailers on this sound system.
1596000	1599000	And, it was a teaser, essentially, for the Warcraft movie.
1599000	1604000	They said it was extended BlizzCon footage, excuse me, extended Comic Con footage.
1604000	1609000	But, I'm sorry. They had the Dead Can Dance music in the background, which I instantly recognized.
1609000	1614000	I'm like, that's host of Seraphim. I love this song. Perfect movie trailer song, right? Especially for somebody at Warcraft.
1614000	1617000	And, then they had all these shots.
1617000	1621000	And, I'm sorry guys. I can't remember every little detail about the trailer because there was a lot of rapid cuts.
1621000	1623000	Rapid, rapid, rapid, rapid.
1623000	1629000	But, there was definitely an orc baby coming in that movie because there was a very pregnant orc out to give birth.
1629000	1632000	And, my jaw hit the floor when I saw the night elves. Not going to lie.
1632000	1636000	When I saw the night elves, I was like, oh my. Like, I gay gassed. I did.
1636000	1640000	That's all you can do. Like, the visual effects in that movie look stunning.
1640000	1646000	And, I think that's going to really capture a lot of people that maybe aren't even Warcraft fans are just going to check it out for the visuals.
1646000	1650000	After they showed the teaser, they said, by the way, the visual effects in that aren't complete.
1650000	1653000	And, I was like, what? I'm like, that looked great.
1653000	1656000	And, then they showed us a completed visual effects.
1656000	1661000	Literally, just 15 seconds of an orc up close showing emotion.
1661000	1665000	And, it looked to be Durotan during the birth of Thrall.
1665000	1668000	That's what we speculated that scene was that we were seeing.
1668000	1670000	So, you could see, like, the emotion in his face.
1670000	1674000	And, I was just like, it definitely has human elements.
1674000	1677000	But, it didn't look stupid like Shrek would be.
1677000	1679000	Like, Shrek's supposed to be stupid. I'm not knocking Shrek. It's a kids movie.
1679000	1683000	But, it looked like the box art of where it looked like.
1683000	1686000	It's a kids movie with half the dialogue written for the grown-ups.
1686000	1687000	But, yeah.
1687000	1690000	But, you get what I mean, right? Like, it just, wow.
1690000	1692000	It looked like the Warcraft art in motion.
1692000	1695000	And, I was like, this is a really good sign.
1695000	1697000	I really hope the story doesn't screw this up.
1697000	1701000	But, I think they're doing the smart thing by not jumping right into the MMO.
1701000	1704000	They're going to do the backstory.
1704000	1706000	Original OG Warcraft.
1706000	1708000	And, I think that's the smart way to do it.
1708000	1712000	Because, most people playing WoW forgot the story of the original Warcraft.
1712000	1713000	Which is a great way to retell it.
1713000	1715000	See, I love the original Warcraft story.
1715000	1717000	I hated playing the games.
1717000	1719000	So, this is actually going to be good for me.
1719000	1722000	Even though I still want Sylvanas fuck shit up the movie.
1722000	1723000	That would be great.
1723000	1724000	And, thank you chatters.
1724000	1726000	Tigerclaw says, Dolby Atmos was the name of it.
1726000	1728000	That was the system that we saw there.
1728000	1730000	And, Alan Android in chat says,
1730000	1732000	Do the night elves look like Avatar people?
1732000	1734000	Um, no.
1734000	1735000	Here's the thing though.
1735000	1738000	I gasped because I thought they were blood elves at first.
1738000	1740000	I was like, blood elves are in the movie?
1740000	1742000	They're very similar in look.
1742000	1744000	And, then I realized, oh wait, no.
1744000	1746000	That's the night elf city that they're in.
1746000	1748000	That's the night elves I just saw.
1748000	1750000	But, they looked really good.
1750000	1751000	Like, the glowing eyes and everything.
1751000	1754000	Yeah, but also keep in mind that the blood elves before they were blood elves.
1754000	1756000	That's true. So, maybe I did see that.
1756000	1758000	I don't know.
1758000	1759000	Who knows?
1759000	1761000	Because, they went to...
1761000	1763000	Yeah, you're right.
1763000	1764000	More? No, I'm kidding.
1764000	1765000	Well, you know me.
1765000	1767000	When I play World of Warcraft, I'm like, click, click, click, click, click.
1767000	1769000	Give me loot. Click, click, click.
1769000	1771000	I don't read.
1771000	1776000	I actually have to agree with your experience you're talking about with Blitzcon.
1776000	1778000	Because, you know, it's convention central down there.
1778000	1780000	Everyone I know looks forward to Blitzcon.
1780000	1781000	Everyone has a great time.
1781000	1783000	And, I hear the least amount of complaints about it too.
1783000	1786000	Which is, you know, everybody and all has a good time with that one.
1786000	1789000	And, there's, you know, so many conventions going on down there all the time.
1789000	1790000	It was a huge party.
1790000	1792000	I mean, every night something was going on at the Hilton.
1792000	1794000	Just in the lobby.
1794000	1796000	Just people drinking and being merry.
1796000	1800000	They had a big street party Friday night for Warcraft's 10th anniversary.
1800000	1802000	Or, sorry, World of Warcraft's 10th anniversary.
1802000	1804000	Warcraft's 20th anniversary.
1804000	1806000	They had food trucks out there the whole time.
1806000	1808000	Gourmet trucks out there.
1808000	1810000	It was just well done.
1810000	1812000	Very well organized con.
1812000	1814000	Loved it.
1814000	1816000	Let's see. Tigerclaw says,
1816000	1820000	Skye, even though it takes place before WoW, don't be surprised if they planted Easter eggs throughout the film.
1820000	1823000	I mean, you could just have a scene of the characters going into a cantina.
1823000	1825000	And, there you'll see all the races.
1826000	1829000	You never know what's going to be after the credits, right?
1829000	1831000	Unless it's a Christopher Nolan movie.
1831000	1834000	You never know what's going to be after those of you that were paying attention to the news this week.
1834000	1836000	Alright.
1836000	1838000	Let's see. What else is said here?
1838000	1839000	Act F says,
1839000	1845000	Hey, what if after the Warcraft movie we get an Overwatch movie or maybe a TV cartoon series?
1845000	1849000	I think they've said, I want to say they said in some media panel,
1849000	1853000	they are open to that type of expansion of the Overwatch universe.
1853000	1855000	I mean, this is Blizzard.
1855000	1857000	There is everything for World of Warcraft.
1857000	1860000	Toys, comics, movies, you name it.
1860000	1863000	And now, you know, the big, big movie.
1863000	1865000	Diablo comics and all this.
1865000	1867000	Starcraft, I mean, is huge.
1867000	1871000	Overwatch, Blizzard completely plans to be next in line.
1871000	1876000	And that's the thing that they can't really do with Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone as much.
1876000	1881000	As much as those games are good, they're borrowing on things that already have been existing and selling in these other franchises.
1881000	1886000	So, Overwatch is their chance to, you know, monetize all the things over again.
1886000	1889000	And I think they will. I think they will.
1889000	1891000	The characters were very, very strong.
1891000	1893000	That's something that Blizzard does very, very well.
1893000	1896000	Anyway, I've rambled on enough about BlizzCon, but if you want to know something else, just ask.
1896000	1898000	I'll get to it at some point in the show.
1898000	1903000	But before we get to the news, let's catch up with all of our hosts in how was your gaming week?
1903000	1905000	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1906000	1908000	I played Final Fantasy XIV.
1908000	1912000	And, uh, some Final Fantasy XIV.
1912000	1916000	And, um, I played with Kat.
1917000	1919000	Yeah, that's about it.
1919000	1921000	I played with Kat.
1921000	1922000	Okay.
1922000	1924000	She was pretty fun.
1924000	1926000	Sounds good. Well, lots of MMOs.
1926000	1930000	Oh, wait, wait, wait. I did play Mass Effect 3 for N7 Day.
1930000	1932000	And ordered my new hoodie.
1932000	1934000	Did they do anything special online for N7 Day?
1934000	1937000	Yes. 25% off hoodies, actually, through...
1937000	1939000	What's today's date?
1940000	1942000	Um, the 9th.
1942000	1944000	I think it's through the 11th that they're doing it, so...
1944000	1946000	Nice. Maybe I'll check that out. I saw the faux leather jacket.
1946000	1948000	It looked really hot. I wanted that.
1948000	1954000	But, um, they also did the pre-order for the Italian Garris statues.
1954000	1956000	And I want the Garris one, but I don't have the money for it, so...
1956000	1961000	I will say, I was at, uh, I was at BlizzCon, obviously, on N7 Day.
1961000	1965000	And I was wearing my Final Fantasy XIV shirt just to see if anybody would get the joke.
1965000	1969000	And, spoiler, nobody said anything. Or if they did, it was behind my back.
1969000	1975000	But I did notice that there were at least three people that were wearing N7 gear to BlizzCon on N7 Day.
1975000	1977000	And I felt really stupid.
1977000	1981000	I felt really stupid not having worn my hat to the con that day.
1981000	1983000	Geez, Rob.
1983000	1985000	Even after I went to all the effort to say, you can keep it.
1985000	1987000	I wore it the next day. Leave me alone.
1988000	1990000	And I wore it to World of Podcasts the night before.
1990000	1992000	So I just forgot that it was the 7th of November.
1992000	1994000	I'm allowed to give you a hard time.
1994000	1995000	Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
1995000	1997000	Alright, uh, Loki. How was your gaming week?
1997000	2002000	Um, I actually played a few things. I played more Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare, did some multiplayer.
2002000	2009000	Um, had a little trouble getting the game, um, to preload on, uh, PlayStation 3.
2009000	2016000	Because, um, because I had originally preordered it on PlayStation 4 and it was cross-buy.
2016000	2024000	So, um, they didn't tell you that you had to, I guess, what was it, you had to download the pl-
2024000	2031000	Even though I already had, like, it on one system, I had to rebuy it again on the Sony, uh, network.
2031000	2035000	And then, because it said free, so I had to rebuy it and then it would unlock everything.
2035000	2038000	But it was just a pain in the ass trying to get it to unlock.
2038000	2043000	Even, because it's a Day Zero edition, it should be unlocked on Monday.
2043000	2045000	But it was being stupid, so.
2045000	2048000	You were a very angry Twitter user that day, I noticed.
2048000	2051000	You were, you were, uh, definitely letting your feelings be known.
2051000	2057000	So, um, so I finally got it to work and I played some multiplayer and that was fun.
2057000	2061000	Really, really fast, um, so I enjoyed that a bit.
2061000	2063000	I got up to level 18, I think.
2063000	2072000	And then, um, you know, I had sent off my, um, my PlayStation 4, actually, I think it was on that Monday.
2072000	2076000	And I got it back on Saturday, um, all fixed.
2076000	2082000	So I got to, uh, actually play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, which is, it's okay.
2082000	2085000	I don't know, I wasn't a huge fan of, like, Infamous.
2085000	2089000	I, I got it free when they did the whole PlayStation Network outage thing.
2089000	2093000	Um, it just looked like a kind of a fun game based off of the trailers I saw.
2093000	2096000	And, it's okay. I don't know, like, it's open world.
2096000	2101000	It's very similar to me, like, like a Crackdown type of game, although Crackdown's a lot more fun.
2101000	2109000	Um, maybe even a little bit like, um, you know, was it Saints Row IV, I guess, where you have, like, the superpowers and stuff.
2109000	2115000	And you kind of do different things to collect power-ups to level your character and thing.
2115000	2118000	I don't know, it's okay. The storyline so far is not really hooking me.
2118000	2123000	It's just kind of bland, but I'll play it a little bit more and see, I guess.
2123000	2125000	Uh, but Call of Duty is pretty awesome.
2125000	2132000	I've already played through the first half of the campaign about four or five times, because I did it on about three different systems now.
2132000	2134000	And, uh, yeah.
2134000	2136000	Can you, can you explain to me a meme I've been seeing on the internet?
2136000	2140000	And, um, uh, granted, this is because I've been kind of out of it.
2140000	2142000	I was busy with BlizzCon and stuff before that.
2142000	2145000	What is the push F to pay respects thing? Can you explain that for me?
2145000	2154000	Okay, so there's a, I guess, an interactive cutscene or part of the game where you're, it's spoiled already.
2154000	2159000	And, uh, you know, the, the E3 footage I think they had where it showed the dude.
2159000	2167000	Basically your partner in crime in the, um, the Marines happens to be the son of the guy that runs Atlas or Kevin Spacey.
2167000	2176000	And so in the very first mission of the game, he gets his arm stuck in this, uh, mobile, like, um, anti-aircraft, uh, launcher thing.
2176000	2180000	And, you know, with a bomb on it. And so it explodes and he dies.
2180000	2190000	And so your pain or your respects to him at funeral in the very beginning, that's when, uh, the Kevin Spacey's character invites you to Atlas and gives you the prosthetic arm because your arm gets chopped off in the first level.
2190000	2191000	Um,
2191000	2193000	Oh yeah, that was in the E3 thing. I remember that.
2193000	2195000	Yeah, that's the E3 thing.
2195000	2196000	That's not really a spoiler.
2196000	2200000	So that's not really a spoiler. So yeah, anybody, anybody who cares has already played through that part of the game.
2200000	2213000	Yeah, it's really what it is, is it's just, it's an interactive cut scene and you don't really have to push a, I mean, you shouldn't really have to push a button, but I think they do it on purpose so that, because when your pain or respects, it also shows that, look, your arm is amputated.
2213000	2222000	You know, like in case you didn't catch that by dragging it away and your arm's staying there, you know, it's not super stretchy arm now, it's your arm is gone. So, um,
2222000	2223000	Go, go gadget arm.
2223000	2236000	Yeah. So they give you a prosthetic one later on, but, uh, it's just kind of doing that. It, they have a lot of weird, like, you know, cut scene things that are in the game where they have you interact with it that really aren't necessary, but they have them there.
2236000	2248000	So I guess they thought, Oh, it's jumping the shark and whatever. It's just like, you know, I didn't really need to have a cut scene where I'm taking off the straps that are holding me into my harness or something in the drop ship and stuff.
2248000	2253000	It wasn't really necessary. That could have been done just as a cut scene, but they had you interact with it.
2253000	2263000	All right. I get it now. I just, I've seen all these like pictures on Twitter, like somebody photoshopped the scene from final fantasy seven where cloud is holding Aerith after Sephiroth did the thing.
2263000	2264000	And I'm cheering in the background.
2264000	2270000	And it says, push F to pay respects. And I was like, okay, there's a joke here about the new call of duty somewhere.
2271000	2277000	And then I also played a ninja bots, which is the AR it's a DLC for play room that they had.
2277000	2282000	And it's kind of like a, like a runner type game. And it's a great kids game.
2282000	2288000	My son loves playing. He can actually play it by himself without me needing to help him and stuff.
2288000	2295000	The only thing is it's only one level and they programmed it so terribly that like once you're finished with level and it's kind of cool as you earn coins throughout the thing.
2295000	2299000	And when you're done, all the coins pop out and they're in your room and you can kind of interact with that stuff.
2299000	2305000	But there's no way to play the game again without backing out and then going back into it. And it's only one level.
2305000	2310000	And that's like, you know what? I'd fucking buy more levels for this shit if you would just put them out.
2310000	2316000	I mean, it can't be that difficult or, and even just program it so that I can go back into it when I'm done playing.
2316000	2323000	Like, Hey, would you like to play again instead of having to go out to the main menu and go back into ninja bots again and fucking have them do that shit again.
2323000	2328000	Um, but it's fun. He likes it. So, um, I just wish more DLC. I would totally buy it.
2328000	2335000	All right. More DLC. Do it. Um, Marissa, I know you said you haven't had a whole lot of time to game, but I'm going to check in with you anyway.
2335000	2339000	My gaming week has consisted of playing Waze driving up to Sacramento.
2339000	2345000	Hey, you know what? Geolocation games. Waze is kind of the game.
2345000	2346000	Warning, police ahead.
2346000	2349000	Yeah, but you run over candy and you get points.
2349000	2350000	That is true actually.
2351000	2357000	I've also been playing don't break your phone and I've been playing, uh, studio one and pro tools.
2357000	2360000	Fantastic. That's all right.
2360000	2365000	Although, although you know what the call of duty game, the most disappointing part is that you don't get to play as Kevin Spacey.
2365000	2367000	I would like to play Kevin Spacey the game.
2367000	2372000	Maybe that's an Easter egg at the end. Maybe like something you get in the end. You know what? DLC.
2372000	2373000	Kevin Spacey the game.
2373000	2377000	It's Kevin Spacey DLC. That's what they do now. That's the thing you really want is DLC.
2377000	2379000	No, what you're going to want is probably new.
2379000	2381000	Push F to spend $9.99.
2381000	2385000	New player skins for multiplayer. That's probably the only way to build.
2385000	2389000	Boy. Oh boy. All right. I talked a lot already, so I'm not going to ramble on my gaming week.
2389000	2392000	I already talked about everything I checked out at Blizzcon.
2392000	2399000	Uh, before that more Diablo three, more Final Fantasy 14, um, was playing Binding of Isaac a little bit this week on PlayStation four.
2399000	2404000	Um, but I also, I pushed A and B on the plane ride home today.
2404000	2408000	I pushed A and B to pay respects to Metroid, which I had on my 3DS.
2408000	2410000	I was like, what do I want to play on my 3DS?
2410000	2416000	Cause Theatrhythm doesn't really work well on an airplane because you know, you're just hearing the rrrrrrgh of the engine or whatever.
2416000	2418000	So you can't really like hear Theatrhythm.
2418000	2422000	But I played Metroid. I was like, what the heck? Let's, let's play an old 8-bit game.
2422000	2428000	So I played some Metroid and I was having fun and I was like, I need to do more like classic game live streaming.
2428000	2432000	Invite friends over and, and just have fun with these classic games and, and see how much I can remember.
2432000	2440000	Because like my, my Metroid muscle memory will take me like, okay, I remember to go get the, the thing that lets you morph into the ball.
2440000	2444000	Uh, I remember you go get the missile after that and then you go get the bomb and then you go get the ice.
2444000	2447000	And then I was like, wait, what's after the ice?
2447000	2452000	I'm like, is this where I go and get the jump boots or, shit, I don't remember.
2452000	2454000	Do I go with the Varia suit now? Damn it.
2454000	2458000	And I kind of hit like a wall, like a mental wall. I was like, I don't remember where I go at this point.
2458000	2462000	So it's like your muscle memory only takes you so far and it's kind of sad.
2462000	2470000	And then I, I realized after I shut it down, that's the part where you backtrack all the way to the beginning, freeze the bird and get the extra energy tank.
2470000	2474000	Or do you need the, you know, you need the high shot, the long shotgun for that, huh?
2474000	2477000	Dang it. Damn this memory loss.
2479000	2481000	Oh well, that's why there's game facts, right?
2481000	2487000	All right. So that was my gaming week, getting irritated at how much I'm forgetting in my advanced stage.
2487000	2490000	So let's, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.
2490000	2493000	Hey, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2493000	2497000	We are also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2497000	2503000	And as far as I know, no shows off in the near future, maybe December 7th.
2503000	2508000	I'll pencil that in for right now, but I'll find out about that for sure in the coming, coming weeks.
2508000	2515000	But, uh, at least for the next few weeks, we will be here and, uh, we hope you, if you're available Sunday night, you'll come check us out live sometime.
2515000	2519000	Uh, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vog network.com.
2519000	2526000	Let's get into some gaming news, producer Loki tonight of tonight's episode since I was in the air.
2526000	2528000	Let's get to it. Start us off.
2528000	2534000	So Ubisoft, um, I guess briefly, cause, uh, Bobby had said that these have come back now silently,
2534000	2539000	but they had, uh, pulled off their upcoming PC titles from steam.
2539000	2546000	And that includes, you know, far cry for, um, assassin's creed unity and the crew have been, uh, they disappeared off steam.
2546000	2555000	And, you know, I guess the statement that, um, they gave was we've been in discussions about valve, about assassin's creed unity,
2555000	2561000	but for the time being, the game is not widely available and, uh, via steam in the UK.
2561000	2566000	In the meantime, UK customers wishing to purchase a digital copy of the game can do so by visiting the Uplay store.
2566000	2574000	I don't think anyone wants to visit the Uplay store to be honest, or our retail partners or other digital distributors.
2574000	2578000	Um, and they were also saying that was, it was also gone from the store in North America.
2578000	2581000	And I haven't gotten checked to check and see if it's back yet.
2581000	2588000	And also, um, you know, still on other sites other than steam, like green man gaming and that kind of stuff.
2589000	2591000	No, I, I heard they came back today.
2591000	2593000	I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
2593000	2602000	So whatever, whatever disagreement or whatever, whatever, uh, issue, I guess quickly got resolved fairly quickly, I guess.
2602000	2605000	Yeah. I was going to say, um, yeah, it's, it's back on the store.
2605000	2610000	It looks like I see assassin's creed unity right here, uh, for sale,
2610000	2614000	but they never really got into like the real reason why they disappeared.
2614000	2617000	Just who knows? Interesting.
2617000	2623000	I hope this doesn't go down a road. Like, um, uh, we, we worry about with Netflix.
2623000	2627000	And I actually was thinking of this today because I saw a commercial on the,
2627000	2637000	the inflight TV for Disney anywhere or something is what it's called where Disney is basically taking all their movies and doing their own type of Netflix type service.
2637000	2640000	And we all know there's HBO go yet. Everybody's doing their own type of service.
2640000	2647000	And we're all kind of sitting here going, uh, this is like, there needs to be one hub with multiple things.
2647000	2651000	That's the thing is that unfortunately everybody was like wishing, geez, I wish I could get everything out of cart.
2651000	2659000	You know, I wish I could have all my, you know, I don't want to watch, you know, Fox or this, I want, you know, I only want to watch Disney.
2659000	2662000	Well, here you go. Here's our Disney stuff. But yeah, at the same time though,
2662000	2667000	stuff like Netflix is going to get gutted with all these shows being taken off there.
2667000	2673000	Although they kind of cycle stuff through like they have the old 19 was it 1990s Ninja turtle movie there now.
2673000	2681000	Yeah. It seems like Netflix is at least thinking ahead a little bit and they're trying to get their own series and they've done, you know, obviously like I'm a huge fan of orange is the new black.
2681000	2684000	And you know, I know they have a lot of other, uh, critical shows on there. People really dig.
2684000	2691000	So at least they at least kind of seem to be preparing for this possible future where maybe Netflix has to have its own shows worth subscribing for.
2691000	2697000	Um, but, uh, yeah, I just, I don't want to see things get fragmented like that and just, you know, again, I'm making stuff up.
2697000	2705000	I don't know why Ubisoft really ended up doing the game pull. Um, but I just hope it isn't something like probably a whole lot of stuff.
2705000	2710000	We just don't see like, you know, the inside stuff. Maybe, maybe it's something that you play.
2710000	2717000	Maybe it's just something that they want to implement that valves not okay with, or I don't know. Who knows?
2717000	2723000	Um, ACT F says, I want to say they removed them and added them again because of region pricing and locks.
2723000	2730000	That's a thing there. Uh, ACT F says it seems like new games added to steam can be cross region gift locked. Interesting.
2730000	2737000	A power in our chat says everyone wants a piece of the pie, but they don't realize the dividing the market is the worst thing they can do.
2737000	2742000	And dungeon buster says capitalism running wild and Y Y R says unlimited Disney movies.
2742000	2748000	Sounds great for kids and their parents. Yeah. I mean, I, I was looking at, I think they were given away wreck it Ralph for free.
2748000	2754000	And I was kind of looking at it. They go, well, maybe I should, maybe we should get that. I like record Ralph. So there you go.
2754000	2762000	All right. Well, uh, moving on to another story. Uh, this is, you know, what's funny is that this link to the story actually like wasn't working before the show.
2762000	2766000	Oh, now it's working. There it is. I thought it was like, because the website went down.
2766000	2776000	Well, I thought maybe the website went down during the week. Uh, but, uh, well, what happened is that the game went down and, uh, I thought maybe they were cleaning, cleaning house.
2776000	2782000	I've never heard of this game. I had heard of it, but it was in a very diluted market. And the game we're talking about is Dawn gate.
2782000	2793000	It was electronic arts or EA's answer to the MOBA genre. You know, where league of legend, Dota 2, smite, heroes of the storm, all of these games already exist.
2793000	2798000	So unfortunately it's a, it's a pretty fragmented market and Dawn gate tried to get into that market.
2798000	2809000	And unfortunately in a letter written at, uh, Don gate.com from group general manager, Matt Bromberg, he said, today I have the unenviable task of announcing that we've decided to stop development of Dawn gate.
2809000	2816000	Um, so, uh, you know, they basically talked about, you know, we were trying to do this and it's all, he said, we knew going in, it was extremely competitive.
2817000	2827000	But as being a EA, just because we stopped development doesn't mean we're not going to release it. We're going to put it out there. But, uh, we've just stopped development. If anything's buggy, we're just going to leave it in.
2827000	2839000	You gotta want, you know, they could, they could repurpose it a little bit and just like put it out. There's like a $20 game where you could just go, you know, all the characters there and you can just go ahead, head of your friends or something like they could do that.
2839000	2847000	I don't know if they will. I mean, they've got origin set up as the storefront. Why not make a little money off of everything you invested, but, uh, we'll see.
2847000	2852000	But they are saying as part of the process of closing down, gone, Dawn gate will continue to operate the game for the next 90 days.
2852000	2858000	All players will be entitled to a full refund of any money spent during the beta. Uh, so there you go.
2858000	2864000	If you did spend money on Dawn gate and you were a big Dawn gate fan, at least you're getting the money back, even though this news probably sucks for you.
2864000	2874000	Why are they charging people during a beta? To be fair, Blizzard does this too. It's to quote unquote test the store. Oh yeah. Test the store.
2874000	2881000	It's working. We're making money. To be fair, whatever you buy in the beta, you will have when the game goes live.
2881000	2890000	And these are free to play games where the transactions are based off of these characters or these mounts or these skins or the, I mean, that is what all of these mobas do.
2890000	2898000	Oh, they have an in-game store at, uh, for EverQuest online or not EverQuest. Uh, I'm sorry. The, uh, elder scrolls online for the elder scrolls online.
2898000	2904000	I don't think they do, but, uh, final fantasy 14 rolled one out just a couple of weeks ago, the two, four patch mounts and minions.
2904000	2917000	They were very clear at fan fest to say, and he even said in English, you know, they don't, they all speak Japanese and not a lot of English, but he said in English, no pay to win.
2917000	2924000	So he wanted to make that very clear, uh, but, uh, just like mounts and minions and things like that only, but that's still pissed off some of the fan base.
2924000	2933000	And I get it. I don't, I don't, I never bought that crap and wow. The only time I did it was when it was a charity minion and, uh, you know, props to Blizzard.
2933000	2939000	One thing they did announce a BlizzCon, they'll be doing another charity minion for American Red Cross Ebola relief.
2939000	2943000	They're going to do a 100% charity minion there. So.
2943000	2945000	Which all of five people have.
2945000	2951000	Well, but to be fair, I believe the American Red Cross is also helping the people in Africa. So, you know.
2951000	2952000	Well, that's better.
2952000	2954000	Yeah, that's better. So.
2954000	2958000	Hey, do you want to hear a joke about Ebola? You probably won't get it.
2958000	2962000	Yeah, it was going around Facebook. It's the pun dog.
2962000	2964000	Wow.
2964000	2967000	All right. Pun dog. Why don't you give us the next story?
2967000	2971000	Did you just call me a bitch?
2971000	2977000	It, you make it sound like it'd be the first time I've ever said that, but to be fair, you've called me a bitch more than I've called you a bitch.
2977000	2980000	Because I usually know better than to do that.
2980000	2982000	Hey.
2982000	2984000	You know what? That's okay.
2984000	2989000	Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the art of shade.
2989000	2998000	You better watch out because I just watched a Real Housewives of Atlanta marathon on the right home.
2998000	3004000	Why do I come here anymore? I could have just made you walk.
3004000	3008000	Probably be lifting up that pant leg.
3008000	3014000	I just get on, I just get on Lyft and then I'd write a nasty tweet about you. I'm just kidding.
3014000	3017000	I'm just kidding. If you couldn't, you couldn't.
3017000	3018000	Bitch, please.
3018000	3021000	Ah, see? See? Who called who that word?
3021000	3024000	At least I didn't call you late for dinner.
3024000	3029000	So anyway, does anyone remember Direct to Drive?
3029000	3033000	Was that the one that GameStop bought?
3033000	3037000	It was the one that IGN bought.
3037000	3039000	Oh, okay. I knew somebody bought them.
3039000	3043000	Well, basically, yeah, they were bought by IGN.
3043000	3044000	Point for Loki.
3045000	3055000	It was basically the AtGames Digital Media said that it got the GameFly digital distribution platform,
3055000	3059000	which had been bought by IGN before and called Direct to Drive.
3059000	3063000	So now Direct to Drive is going back to what it used to be.
3063000	3070000	AtGames is going to be relaunching it under the original name and not GameFly anything.
3070000	3079000	So basically, it's going to give people a way to buy and play and rent, I believe, games.
3079000	3082000	Pretty cool, though, that it's coming back. I mean, I guess that they're like,
3082000	3084000	we miss it. We're going to bring it back.
3084000	3092000	So a quote on here says that the vision for new Direct to Drive is to create the best destination
3092000	3097000	both for gamers to find their favorite titles and for publishers to showcase their lineups.
3097000	3101000	We will bring a retail quality experience to the digital world with the best incentives
3101000	3105000	and events that gamers both expect and deserve.
3105000	3107000	So it's a steam competitor, essentially.
3107000	3113000	Yeah. But anyway, they're offering gamers a chance to win 12 legendary gems of The Chosen One
3113000	3116000	or a flashback console, whichever one they want.
3116000	3117000	Nice.
3117000	3124000	I guess the 12 legendary gems are basically 10 randomly drawn people
3124000	3130000	will get one game every month for the 2015 calendar year.
3130000	3131000	Nice.
3131000	3135000	And the flashback consoles available are the Atari Flashback 5, Sega Genesis,
3135000	3138000	Sega Genesis Portable, ColecoVision, or Intellivision.
3138000	3140000	My Intellivision flashback should be getting here this week, by the way.
3140000	3143000	If you remember the show a couple of weeks ago, I went on Groupon and bought that boy.
3143000	3144000	But anyway.
3144000	3146000	You know what? I have an Intellivision.
3146000	3148000	I know, but I don't.
3148000	3149000	You gonna buy mine?
3149000	3152000	No, because I just got a flashback console.
3152000	3156000	But anyway, what I wanted to say is that even though I just talked about,
3156000	3159000	I don't want to see the marketplace diluted, I'm okay with this.
3159000	3161000	Steam needs some competition.
3161000	3164000	And they do have, you know, there's Desura, there's Humble Store.
3164000	3166000	There are still other competitors out there.
3166000	3170000	But the difference here and why I say this is okay is because a company like this
3170000	3173000	relies on distribution agreements.
3173000	3179000	It's not publisher-owned, so it's not going to be just one silo of games.
3179000	3181000	I mean, it is competing on the same level.
3181000	3185000	Although, well, okay, to be fair, Steam is publisher-owned.
3185000	3194000	But I suppose, you know, because Steam also has a lot more than just Valve stuff,
3194000	3196000	we let it slip by a little bit.
3196000	3198000	So, anyway.
3198000	3199000	Let's move on.
3199000	3200000	Loki.
3200000	3202000	All right.
3202000	3203000	So, let's see.
3203000	3207000	Let's talk a little bit about other companies like Activision,
3207000	3211000	which they're not really my friends right now,
3211000	3215000	despite the fact that I'm playing a ton of Call of Duty.
3215000	3220000	They've raked in, apparently, for a quarter of three, $753 million.
3220000	3223000	Of course, a lot of that is Destiny.
3223000	3230000	And, of course, they also, I guess, released Diablo III, the Ultimate Evil Edition,
3230000	3231000	back in August.
3231000	3232000	So, a lot of it's that stuff.
3232000	3237000	And, of course, you know, the Blizzard side of things.
3237000	3242000	Of course, that brings now their revenue for 2014.
3242000	3247000	They're expecting to earn $4.325 billion in that revenue.
3247000	3254000	And I guess another $1.492 billion, which is expected, I guess, this next quarter.
3254000	3256000	Probably, hey, that's probably Call of Duty.
3256000	3260000	So, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're going to probably rake in a ton of money from that
3260000	3263000	and, hell, even the World of Warcraft expansion.
3263000	3265000	The thing that I'm a little peeved about, though,
3265000	3268000	is you may remember we talked a little bit about SharePlay,
3268000	3272000	which was part of the brand-new PlayStation 4 2.0 patch,
3272000	3276000	that it's that wonderful feature that you can take a game that you own
3276000	3277000	and share it with your friends.
3277000	3281000	In other words, like, say, Rob wants to play some Call of Duty.
3281000	3283000	I could say, hey, you know what, I'm going to SharePlay that
3283000	3287000	so we can either play, you know, split-screen deathmatch or something like that
3287000	3289000	or he can play the single-player version.
3289000	3293000	Oh, wait, no, he can't because Activision decided to be unique about it and say,
3293000	3299000	hey, we're going to disable SharePlay functionality on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
3299000	3300000	That's right.
3300000	3302000	Is this something where maybe they're only going to do it for a little while?
3302000	3305000	Like, maybe like 30 days you can't do it or something?
3305000	3308000	They didn't say. Their excuse, though, according to it right now is...
3308000	3309000	Well, I can't wait to hear this.
3309000	3312000	Yes, and this is totally not PR speak.
3312000	3316000	This is, I'm sure, a completely honest reason why it would work.
3316000	3317000	From the heart.
3317000	3322000	Delivering a great gaming experience for our fans is our top priority.
3322000	3326000	We're focused on launching Advanced Warfare and ensuring that people
3326000	3329000	have a great time playing it, which our fans seem to be.
3329000	3334000	SharePlay is a new feature that was introduced as part of the recent PS4 firmware 2.0 update.
3334000	3337000	Our engineers didn't have access to it before it launched,
3337000	3343000	so we haven't had a chance to evaluate and see how it will impact the experience across all modes of play.
3343000	3347000	Of course, we wouldn't include a feature in our game without having the chance to test it.
3347000	3352000	Once we fully analyze its performance, we'll determine how to support it going forward.
3352000	3353000	It's too new.
3353000	3361000	Really, that's kind of strange because all the other games out there that were before Advanced Warfare
3361000	3366000	that definitely didn't know about it seem to be working just fine, so...
3366000	3370000	Okay, I'm going to humor this train of thought for a minute
3370000	3377000	because I believe an argument could be made that SharePlay will help people demo games.
3377000	3380000	I mean, you're going to be able to play your friend's game and get an impression of,
3380000	3383000	do I like this game? Do I want to buy this game?
3383000	3389000	And if the streaming technology lags or has too much frame skip
3389000	3393000	or too much artifacting or something like that, you might decide as you're testing this game,
3393000	3396000	ah, this is kind of crappy, I don't really want to buy this, this doesn't look very good,
3396000	3400000	and it doesn't respond very well, it doesn't play, it's not fun.
3400000	3404000	I could see, you know, I'm trying to give Activision the bit of the doubt,
3404000	3412000	I could see an argument made there where they don't want people's impression of the game to only be through SharePlay.
3412000	3414000	Okay, then put out a demo.
3415000	3421000	And I think that's a fair exchange, then put out the demo you want people to see, right?
3421000	3425000	Because, you know, put out the first level or something like that, or put out whatever.
3425000	3429000	I mean, put out something then if that's what your excuse is going to be.
3429000	3434000	But, I don't know, I just, all these other games that are out there now,
3434000	3437000	I don't see them using this as an excuse.
3437000	3441000	I could see Activision as, we want to sell more copies of this game,
3441000	3445000	and god damn it, you're not going to share your copy, you're going to buy a new copy.
3445000	3449000	If you really want to play Call of Duty, you're going to buy another copy.
3449000	3452000	I would actually totally understand if companies wanted to,
3452000	3455000	as much as I think SharePlay is really great and everything,
3455000	3460000	I understand if companies want to be like, you know what, for 30 days we're going to lock it out.
3460000	3462000	Like, I would kind of get that.
3462000	3465000	Okay, well then that's fine, but be honest about it.
3465000	3469000	I mean, I don't know, it's just, we haven't had a chance to test it out yet.
3469000	3474000	I mean, come on, I don't think they're leaving developers in the dark about this stuff.
3474000	3479000	And let's be honest here, SharePlay, this is a feature that they were talking about
3479000	3482000	when they first talked about the PlayStation 4.
3482000	3488000	We've known about SharePlay that it was coming since E3, if not E3 of last year.
3488000	3494000	I kind of have a hard time believing Activision didn't have some access to a preview 2.0 PlayStation build.
3494000	3499000	You know, I mean, you have to suspend a little disbelief to believe that, I think.
3499000	3504000	Well then I guess you better not put any of those Call of Duty games on PlayStation Now
3504000	3507000	because they're just not going to play as well over the internet, right?
3507000	3510000	You know, streaming, it's just not going to work.
3510000	3515000	YYR in chat says, but who hasn't played Call of Duty, which actually I haven't.
3515000	3516000	Hand raised.
3516000	3519000	We all know how it works, but I've watched other people play it, I will say that.
3519000	3521000	I actually haven't even watched other people play it.
3521000	3524000	To be honest though, the new game is a little bit different.
3524000	3531000	I mean, the Exosuit stuff makes the game a lot faster than the standard Call of Duty game.
3531000	3533000	There's a lot more verticality to it.
3533000	3535000	It does feel different.
3535000	3540000	It is, I would think, worthy of a demo or some sort of way to get people to check it out
3540000	3548000	because I think it's going to be one of those games that it actually may appeal to people that didn't like Call of Duty in the past.
3548000	3552000	Fifth Dream in chat says, to tell the truth, I can't see how share play benefits the game makers.
3552000	3555000	To which YYR responds, Fifth Dream, quote, hey, this is pretty cool.
3555000	3557000	Maybe I'll buy it to play with my other friends.
3557000	3562000	Yeah, to be fair, I just told you I've never really played Call of Duty, but if Loki could share play it with me,
3562000	3564000	I would try giving it a go.
3564000	3566000	What do I have to lose? Time.
3570000	3572000	I'd say time you can't get back.
3572000	3573000	That's true.
3573000	3579000	My understanding of this game is that it's the one where my boyfriend gets called crude expletives by 8-year-olds.
3579000	3581000	I'm sorry, that's Xbox Live.
3581000	3583000	That's a lot of video games, actually, Marissa.
3583000	3586000	Yeah, it's not so bad on the PlayStation.
3586000	3591000	Which is why I talked about earlier, it's a good thing that the CEO of one of the biggest companies came out and said,
3591000	3593000	you know, there are people at the other side of the monitor, stop it.
3593000	3598000	I'll just be at the kitchen making dinner and I hear all sorts of the crudest of expletives from young children.
3598000	3600000	I'm like, oh, Call of Duty today, huh?
3600000	3606000	You'd be surprised that actually on all the games that I've played on Advanced Warfare, I haven't really heard any of that.
3606000	3610000	And even like Modern Warfare 2, I haven't really heard a lot.
3610000	3615000	I mean, there's a few times you run into a hacker, but that's Modern Warfare 2. It's a fucking old ass game.
3615000	3616000	Halo is always the worst for me.
3616000	3619000	Do you think that's more associated with Xbox? People always insist on that.
3619000	3622000	That there's like people, like more college kids or something.
3622000	3624000	I think maybe the 360.
3624000	3626000	Maybe because it was the PlayStation 4 version I'm playing,
3626000	3630000	maybe a lot of little kids don't have PlayStation 4s that they're playing Call of Duty on right now.
3630000	3631000	I don't know.
3631000	3636000	Marissa, I think the thing you were saying, I think that was a little more unique to 360 versus PlayStation 3.
3636000	3639000	Maybe so much as the one versus PlayStation 4.
3639000	3643000	And I would say it was because the 360 came out sooner and it was more affordable.
3643000	3646000	And at that time, you know, PlayStation 3 took a long time to catch up.
3646000	3650000	Like it didn't really make headway in that console race until a few years into it.
3650000	3653000	So I think the Xbox One really was kind of like that predominant system.
3653000	3658000	But now I don't necessarily know that the stereotype belongs to Microsoft in that regard.
3658000	3662000	And then also on top of it is now they've added a lot of things since the 360 came out.
3662000	3666000	And even on PlayStation's side I think where you can rate people.
3666000	3671000	So if you run across a really annoying little prick that, you know, is just shouting expletives.
3671000	3674000	First you can mute him and second you can rate him down.
3674000	3679000	And I think, I don't know, I haven't played a lot on 360 recently.
3679000	3682000	But I know there's definitely people out there like that.
3682000	3684000	And unfortunately it's little kids.
3684000	3687000	Because little kids that think they can get away with all sorts of shit because they're anonymous.
3687000	3689000	And singing. What's with the singing?
3690000	3694000	Some people just love to sing. I mean, I don't know.
3695000	3700000	I have heard some of the worst things. Like kids yelling at parents.
3700000	3704000	Like, oh my god, if I were there I would be spanking you right now.
3704000	3707000	Like for real. Like you little brat.
3707000	3709000	And props to Sony, I was almost going to buy a new headset.
3709000	3713000	But then I read up on the patch, or whatever, 1.6 for the PlayStation 4.
3713000	3717000	It now supports my old headset I have for the PS3, the Sony stereo one.
3717000	3720000	I'm like, oh yes, surround sound wireless. Woo!
3721000	3724000	Alright, well let's move on to talking about some classics here for a minute.
3724000	3727000	No, not the classic game of the week yet. We'll get there in a little bit.
3727000	3731000	But let's talk about what the EFF, or Electronic Frontier Foundation, did.
3731000	3736000	They actually filed a petition with the Library of Congress and the United States Copyright Office this past week.
3736000	3744000	Over modifying abandoned games, especially those that you need an online connection to prevent piracy.
3744000	3747000	You know how this was a trend we started to see in games.
3747000	3750000	Probably about 10 years ago it started to pop up here and there in some games.
3750000	3755000	So what the EFF wants is they want the laws to be modified.
3755000	3760000	So mods that strip out these authentication checks will be fair.
3760000	3766000	Because if the developers take the servers offline and are done, then people still want to play these games.
3766000	3770000	So people should be able to mod them to take this out, and that should be legal.
3770000	3774000	Civilization V and Mario Kart Wii cited as examples in the petition.
3774000	3776000	Though there's many, many, many games.
3776000	3779000	I know Mario Kart Wii, but I thought Civ V you could still play online.
3779000	3782000	But maybe that'll be something down the road.
3782000	3784000	Why would Mario Kart Wii need online to play?
3784000	3788000	You'd, well you'd, but, I guess that's true, huh?
3788000	3790000	That doesn't make any sense.
3790000	3795000	Maybe in that case it was a modification to be able to play online on a private server?
3795000	3799000	I'm thinking that's what, when I read it I thought that's what it was.
3799000	3804000	That you'd be able to basically run your own servers, I guess.
3804000	3807000	To play those Nintendo Network stuff.
3807000	3810000	I could see maybe also, maybe it's both.
3810000	3813000	That it's multiplayer servers and it's authentication servers.
3814000	3821000	I wish more developers would realize that there are people there that still really want to play classic games and do this themselves.
3821000	3825000	Like if they're going to turn off these servers, allow people to do custom servers themselves.
3825000	3827000	We've seen some games do this.
3827000	3830000	Like I remember when Phantasy Star Online was sunsetted on PC.
3830000	3835000	They were really good about being able to export your data to set up custom servers and so forth.
3835000	3839000	Like they kind of embraced that, and I always thought that should have been like a model for others.
3839000	3842000	But speaking of MMOs, like Phantasy Star.
3842000	3848000	The petition did note that MMOs and persistent world games would be exempt from the change.
3848000	3854000	Since the audio visual content is primarily stored on the developer server and not in the client.
3854000	3861000	Speaking of old games and the ever controversial quote unquote abandonware.
3861000	3863000	This link circulating Facebook.
3863000	3867000	I thought we might have mentioned this last week, but last week was a week ago.
3867000	3872000	So forgive me if I'm mentioning this again, but with good reason because this is really cool.
3872000	3875000	The Internet Archive has put out the Internet Arcade.
3875000	3879000	Over 900 classic arcade games you can play for free inside your browser.
3879000	3883000	It's basically MAME that's endorsed by the Internet Archive.
3883000	3884000	That's essentially what it is.
3884000	3886000	Yeah, but who's the Internet Archive?
3886000	3891000	It's a company in San Francisco, I believe, whose sole mission is to archive everything that's on the Internet.
3891000	3892000	The Wayback Machine.
3892000	3893000	It's archive.org.
3893000	3895000	It's where you find your old GeoCities page.
3895000	3897000	Yes, and I have.
3897000	3901000	Hey, I still haven't seen my old AOL Ranma page.
3901000	3904000	I should go check and see if my GeoCities page is there.
3904000	3905000	I know, right?
3905000	3909000	You might be able to go see the old Orange Launch Radio website, the old site we had for that.
3909000	3910000	But here's my thing.
3910000	3918000	It's like, yeah, I understand it's MAME and stuff and these are ROMs, but is this legal?
3918000	3922000	I mean, because if it is legal that I can just play these for free.
3922000	3924000	Then what's to stop me from like...
3924000	3930000	Doesn't copyright expire on hardware after 25 years?
3930000	3933000	Hence why we have systems like the Retron 5?
3933000	3937000	I don't know what the thing is, but this isn't hardware, though.
3937000	3938000	This is software.
3938000	3940000	There are arcade machines.
3940000	3943000	There are arcade machines, but it's emulating the arcade machine.
3943000	3945000	It's data stored on chips.
3945000	3946000	It's emulating the hardware.
3946000	3950000	This is the legal gray area that we live in.
3950000	3954000	This would be the same argument they'd be making in court.
3954000	3959000	I'm just surprised that, especially with Bionic Commando being in there,
3959000	3963000	I'm surprised Capcom hasn't said, ah, we're going to sue you.
3963000	3968000	I am kind of surprised they're able to do this, especially because it really wasn't that long ago
3968000	3973000	where on Nintendo Wii, Virtual Console had arcade games in it.
3973000	3978000	I want to say that Mappy and some of the Namco classics were a part of that.
3978000	3979000	Don't you remember that?
3979000	3980000	Yeah, I remember that.
3980000	3983000	And every now and then we get those retro arcade collections,
3983000	3987000	like the infamous OLR Cameo in the Namco collection.
3987000	3988000	Yeah, Namco, yeah.
3988000	3990000	Well, Dig Dug.
3992000	3995000	It seems like there's all sorts of cools and ghosts.
3995000	3998000	There's another Capcom game there.
3998000	4000000	Frogger from Atari.
4000000	4002000	They put Nintendo games in there.
4002000	4003000	Is Donkey Kong in there?
4003000	4004000	I was just looking for that.
4004000	4007000	I don't believe Donkey Kong is in there.
4007000	4010000	Maybe that would be the one where I'd be like, you know,
4010000	4016000	if they put a Nintendo game in there, they're the ones that really go after their old IP.
4016000	4021000	Mario Brothers original would be another one to look at?
4021000	4023000	No Mario Brothers.
4023000	4025000	Marvel Madness though is in there.
4025000	4026000	Interesting.
4026000	4028000	But see, that's what I'm kind of wondering.
4028000	4031000	It's like, okay, so if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?
4031000	4033000	Like Street Fighter II?
4033000	4036000	I mean, that's pretty well known.
4036000	4039000	So if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?
4039000	4041000	Like say, you know, if I had an...
4041000	4044000	Granted, I'm going to put whatever the fuck I want on my own MAME machine,
4044000	4047000	but like let's say, you know, I put these 900 ROMs on there,
4047000	4050000	so that's completely legit, right?
4050000	4052000	It says it's on here for free.
4052000	4055000	I'm assuming that that's free for me to use as well on my machine.
4055000	4057000	That's a good question.
4057000	4060000	And let's, you know, take it a step further.
4060000	4063000	You know, people, when they make MAME machines and stuff like that,
4063000	4066000	when you sell them on eBay, you're not allowed to sell ROMs with them
4066000	4068000	because they're copyrighted.
4068000	4071000	But if these are all free of copyright,
4071000	4074000	because now that they're available on the internet for free...
4074000	4076000	Oh, and Tron's on there, by the way.
4076000	4078000	Fifth Dream Notes in our chat room.
4078000	4080000	They have Pac-Man Plus, but no other Pac-Mans,
4080000	4083000	so there must be some rhyme and reason to it.
4083000	4084000	So...
4084000	4085000	Namco.
4085000	4086000	Yeah.
4086000	4090000	So I'm wondering, like, you know, if that would be legit or something.
4090000	4091000	I don't know.
4091000	4094000	There's a lot of Konami games on there because the first game I played,
4094000	4096000	because, you know, it's an alphabetical list, and I was like,
4096000	4098000	Amidar, I like that game. That's a Konami game.
4098000	4099000	Space Harrier.
4099000	4101000	Ooh, there you go.
4101000	4104000	All right, well, anyway, I'm sure many of you have already checked that out,
4104000	4106000	but just in case you haven't, check that out.
4106000	4108000	Archive.org, I believe.
4108000	4110000	The full link was...
4110000	4113000	Archive.org slash details slash internet arcade.
4113000	4115000	Perfect. Thank you.
4115000	4117000	One more story before release date.
4117000	4118000	Dark Sakura.
4118000	4119000	Mass Effect.
4119000	4120000	What? You have my attention.
4120000	4122000	Mass Effect All the Things.
4122000	4123000	Yes.
4123000	4124000	All the Things.
4124000	4125000	Yes.
4125000	4128000	Well, there is a sort of poll out there.
4128000	4129000	Kind of a poll.
4129000	4132000	Do you like Mass Effect? Yes or sure.
4132000	4135000	Yes or no.
4135000	4138000	The fuck you mean do I like Mass Effect?
4138000	4143000	Basically, the current Bioware boss, Aaron Flynn,
4143000	4148000	was on a post on NeoGaf, basically,
4148000	4156000	listing what the most requested features you'd ever heard for a Mass Effect trilogy re-release.
4156000	4162000	And the ideas were basically 1080p, 60 frames per second support,
4162000	4166000	high-res textures, especially for Mass Effect 1, and seamless DLC.
4166000	4171000	And basically, that's one thing that he said that would definitely be included if it were done,
4171000	4175000	where the DLC would be as if it were already parts of the game.
4175000	4177000	At places in the game, it would make sense.
4184000	4186000	Maybe some new multiplayer maps just for fun.
4186000	4188000	Just as the icing on the cake.
4188000	4190000	A little more multiplayer.
4190000	4191000	Well, here's a quote too.
4191000	4195000	ME3 combat mechanics in ME1 comes up relatively often,
4195000	4198000	but it's not on my radar against speaking personally.
4198000	4200000	First, it would be a hell of a lot of work.
4200000	4205000	Secondly, I hate the idea of us being accused of retconning ME1.
4205000	4214000	Basically, the big thing is that there really are addresses that people have asked for.
4214000	4217000	He said, there's no plans right now, but the quote says,
4217000	4219000	when we do, we'll share ASAP.
4221000	4224000	Well, soon needs to happen sooner.
4224000	4226000	Soon needs to be like now.
4226000	4227000	Right.
4227000	4229000	How soon is now, to quote.
4230000	4232000	BioWare, you shut your mouth.
4232000	4236000	How can you say, we're going about things the wrong way?
4236000	4239000	I am human, and I need Garrus' love.
4239000	4241000	I need to love Garrus.
4241000	4243000	Just like anybody else does.
4244000	4246000	Marisa just gave a toast.
4246000	4247000	Alright.
4247000	4249000	Do you know Garrus?
4249000	4252000	Of Garrus, Marisa, have you seen the character?
4252000	4253000	I know, yes.
4253000	4254000	I'm sure Jamie's told you a lot.
4254000	4255000	Absolutely.
4257000	4258000	That voice.
4258000	4260000	Guy's goofy looking, by the way.
4260000	4263000	Utterly goofy looking, and he's got the hottest voice.
4263000	4266000	This tells you a lot about the people in real life.
4267000	4269000	And he was in a really bad episode of Buffy.
4269000	4271000	He does say a radio phrase for nothing.
4272000	4274000	Now, Marisa, you're a very lovely lady.
4274000	4275000	Thank you.
4275000	4279000	But he was also in a really bad episode of Buffy, which I don't hold against him.
4279000	4280000	Alright.
4280000	4284000	Well, let's talk about some things coming out a whole lot sooner than a Mass Effect remake.
4284000	4286000	Loki, release dates.
4286000	4288000	This week we have lots of stuff coming out.
4288000	4292000	Starting off with Pro Evolution Soccer 2015.
4292000	4297000	PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.
4297000	4301000	The Halo, the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One this week.
4301000	4306000	Minecraft, the PlayStation Vita edition on, obviously, the Vita.
4306000	4310000	Assassin's Creed Unity on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4310000	4315000	Assassin's Creed Rogue on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4315000	4318000	Hello Kitty Racing on 3DS.
4319000	4321000	Yay! Except that series actually isn't that good.
4321000	4323000	You're the guy who has Kitty the Cool.
4326000	4328000	I don't think I bought that for myself.
4328000	4330000	You bought that when I got Vibribin.
4330000	4331000	Oh, that's right.
4331000	4338000	Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
4339000	4344000	The Wii U, the 3DS, and I believe the Vita as well.
4344000	4347000	Oh, and probably PC to go along with that.
4348000	4353000	Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric on the Wii U, as well as Sonic Boom Shattered Crystal.
4353000	4358000	That's the new Sonic game that he has longer legs.
4359000	4362000	Tropico 5 on Xbox 360.
4363000	4368000	Digimon All-Stars Rumble on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4369000	4374000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze on 3DS.
4374000	4377000	As opposed to the Secret of the Ooze, now it's the Danger of the Ooze.
4377000	4379000	It's the Danger of the Ooze.
4379000	4382000	Will Vanilla Ice be there to tell us, go Ninja, go Ninja, go?
4382000	4384000	No, but he'll be there to build him a house.
4386000	4387000	Let's see what you did there.
4388000	4393000	Let's see, Payday 2, the Safe Cracker edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4393000	4396000	Shape Up on Xbox One.
4397000	4402000	World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor on PC.
4405000	4408000	What else? Am I missing something?
4409000	4416000	If you really want to shop at GameStop, Tales of Heart R is an exclusive for the Vita at GameStop.
4418000	4422000	For the record, by the way, in my defense about goofy looking guys, I did marry Dan.
4423000	4424000	Well, he's the goofiest of them all.
4424000	4425000	I mean that with love.
4426000	4427000	He is kind of goofy looking.
4428000	4432000	But that Tales of Heart R is not on the online store.
4433000	4434000	I don't know.
4434000	4436000	Interesting. I would be surprised if it was.
4436000	4440000	Lisa, it may be online, but they may have the physical version exclusive to GameStop.
4441000	4443000	Interesting. Let's look at Japan.
4443000	4446000	Last week was a slow week in Japan and this week makes up for it.
4446000	4447000	There's a lot more coming out in Japan this week.
4447000	4450000	On the PlayStation 4, Battlefield 4 Premium Edition.
4450000	4453000	Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, their edition that's subtitled is out this week.
4453000	4458000	There is a new camouflage DualShock 4, I believe, to match that.
4459000	4461000	And World Soccer winning 11 2015.
4461000	4463000	That's Konami's big soccer series.
4463000	4464000	It's huge.
4464000	4466000	That is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
4466000	4472000	Xbox One also gets the Call of Duty release and winning soccer, or sorry, excuse me, World Soccer winning 11 2015.
4473000	4479000	There's also some new Xbox console collector sets for Xbox One out there in Japan this week to try and motivate some sales, I suppose.
4480000	4482000	PlayStation 3 gets Call of Duty.
4483000	4487000	World Soccer winning 11 and Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.
4487000	4492000	I do not believe this is the popular dice game that my mom used to play.
4493000	4495000	It just happens to have Bunko in the title.
4495000	4497000	This is actually, looks like it's based off like an anime.
4497000	4500000	There's a lot of anime characters fighting each other.
4500000	4510000	There's a girl on a motorbike and people with swords and epic anime cutscenes and all the things you expect in an anime fighting game.
4510000	4512000	That is on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4512000	4518000	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, yes, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.
4519000	4523000	On the Wii U this week, there is a new Wii U Mario Kart 8 set.
4523000	4526000	32 gig black and white additions coming out.
4526000	4533000	There's also a game called Susume Kinopio Taiko comes out this week, which is, oh, it's Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.
4534000	4535000	I did not realize that.
4535000	4536000	That's out in Japan this week.
4537000	4538000	Wow, they get that way earlier than we do.
4538000	4540000	We have to wait until December for that.
4541000	4543000	So that is out in Japan this week.
4543000	4551000	And on the Vita, that Dengeki Bunko fighting game is out there as well, including Marginal No. 4, Idol of Supernova is out.
4551000	4557000	And there is a new PlayStation Vita Mercury Duo, light pink white version that's out this week.
4557000	4566000	And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Disc Wars Avengers Ultimate Heroes, One Piece Super Grand Battle X,
4566000	4572000	and Osawari Tante Ozawa Rina Nameko Rime comes out this week in Japan.
4573000	4574000	There's your Japanese release date.
4574000	4575000	So there's actually quite a bit this week.
4575000	4576000	Busy week in Japan.
4576000	4577000	Dark Sakura.
4577000	4579000	You're still getting better every week, Rob.
4579000	4580000	Thank you. I'm trying.
4580000	4581000	All right.
4581000	4587000	Well, in UK releases on the 12th, we have Retro City Rampage DX.
4587000	4591000	And I'm waiting for it to reload once again because, yuck.
4592000	4594000	I don't know why it does this.
4594000	4597000	I'll have it loaded and it'll be like, no, we're going to reload.
4598000	4601000	Okay, so as I was saying, Retro City Rampage DX.
4601000	4607000	And we have Toy Box Turbos for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
4607000	4612000	On the 13th, we have Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed Unity.
4612000	4623000	There's also PES 2015, World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor, also known as Warlords of Draeno.
4624000	4625000	Warlords of Draeno.
4625000	4626000	As I heard said.
4626000	4629000	We'll unclog that lack of content from the past year.
4630000	4636000	And then on the 14th, we have Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on Fuck Near Everything.
4637000	4638000	And that's it.
4638000	4642000	Some folks in chat letting us know that that is Toad's name in Japan.
4642000	4643000	I didn't pick up on that.
4643000	4644000	I actually didn't know that.
4644000	4647000	Like, I've probably heard that before, but, you know, I don't play a lot of Japanese Nintendo games.
4648000	4650000	So, Kino Game Guru, specifically in chat.
4650000	4653000	Kino Pio is what Toad is called in Japan.
4653000	4655000	I never realized that.
4655000	4656000	So, there you go.
4657000	4658000	Alright.
4658000	4662000	Just a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.
4662000	4663000	But first.
4664000	4665000	Alright.
4665000	4670000	So, apparently, the first DLC for Mario Kart is right around the corner.
4670000	4672000	Did not even realize it was that close.
4672000	4673000	Probably because I don't have Mario Kart 8.
4673000	4677000	But, Mario Kart 8, the first piece of DLC will come out.
4678000	4688000	And, including with that, I guess they've confirmed that when you use your amiibo in Mario Kart 8, you get a character-themed costume for your in-game Mii character.
4688000	4692000	And, also, they're gonna have new characters and new courses.
4693000	4698000	I believe, if I remember correctly, the first piece of DLC is the Hyrule Cup.
4699000	4700000	Or, Triforce Cup, I'm sorry.
4700000	4701000	The Triforce Cup.
4701000	4706000	And they've already kind of gone over, I guess, according to the Nintendo Minute video.
4707000	4708000	Which courses are going to be in there.
4708000	4713000	So, including with that, Wario's Gold Mine from Mario Kart Wii.
4713000	4716000	Rainbow Road from the original Mario Kart.
4717000	4720000	Ice Ice Outpost, which is a brand new track.
4720000	4724000	And, Hyrule Castle, which I guess has rupees instead of coins.
4725000	4730000	And, there's even shortcuts that trigger the secret fountain chime from The Legend of Zelda.
4731000	4732000	So, that's pretty cool.
4733000	4736000	That Excitebike track looks really cool, I gotta say.
4736000	4738000	But, that F-Zero track really pisses me off.
4739000	4742000	And, then, the Yoshi Cup, which I believe is also part of that.
4743000	4745000	Yoshi Circuit from Mario Kart Double Dash.
4746000	4749000	The Excitebike Arena, which is a brand new track.
4750000	4752000	Dragon Driftway, which is also new.
4752000	4760000	And, Mute City, which apparently they said there's no coins on the course except when you drive over the recharge strips.
4760000	4762000	And, the entire track is racing her mode.
4763000	4764000	Interesting.
4764000	4766000	I don't know how I feel.
4767000	4770000	On one hand, it makes me really sad because this means we're never gonna get an F-Zero game again.
4771000	4774000	Like, can't Nintendo just announce one for 2016 or something?
4774000	4776000	Like, get me a little bit excited, please?
4777000	4778000	I love F-Zero.
4778000	4780000	We'll get more details about new games that they're working on.
4781000	4783000	And, I'm sure you'll be excited.
4784000	4785000	We'll see. We'll see. Alright.
4786000	4791000	Well, one of those games that we got some details on is the fact that they're remaking Majora's Mask.
4791000	4796000	It was announced that the Majora's Mask remake is going to be coming out for the 3DS in Spring of 2015.
4797000	4798000	You know what? There's a lot of fans that really wanted this.
4799000	4803000	I wasn't huge on Majora's Mask, but there are some people that this is their favorite Zelda in the whole series.
4804000	4806000	So, you know what? I'm glad they're getting this remake.
4807000	4816000	Because the remake of Ocarina of Time, again, I hold the unpopular opinion that the Nintendo 64 Zeldas really never match the Super Nintendo Zelda for me.
4817000	4818000	But, that's my opinion.
4819000	4820000	I share that with you.
4820000	4821000	I know. But, other people think we're totally wrong.
4822000	4823000	And, you're entitled to be wrong.
4824000	4825000	That's right. So, some people love this Majora's Mask.
4826000	4828000	And, they do look really good in 3D. At least the Ocarina of Time did.
4829000	4831000	So, the fact that Majora's Mask is getting that same treatment is pretty cool.
4832000	4834000	So, you'll be able to experience that in Spring of 2015.
4835000	4838000	And, they did a whole little announcement trailer during their Nintendo Direct.
4839000	4843000	Now, speaking of Zelda games, Amiibo figures will work with Hyrule Warriors.
4844000	4847000	So, if you do happen to get an Amiibo character, you can use that on Hyrule Warriors.
4847000	4851000	If you use the Link Amiibo, for example, you'll get the Spinner.
4852000	4854000	This is a weapon that was originally in Zelda Twilight Princess.
4855000	4858000	Other figures are just going to give you random weapons, materials, or rupees.
4859000	4863000	So, it's basically, hey, if you spent money on this stuff in real life, we'll give you something in the game.
4864000	4868000	So, I mean, it's not like you're going to be playing as Princess Peach in Hyrule Warriors.
4869000	4870000	And, if you thought that was ever going to be the case, you were...
4871000	4874000	Can we get Mushroom Kingdom Warriors? Because that would be pretty sweet.
4875000	4876000	Actually, that would be fucking rad.
4877000	4880000	I'd like to see something like that, Dynasty Warriors cross Mario. That would be amazing.
4881000	4883000	But, sadly, probably not going to happen.
4884000	4886000	Alright, DarkStalker, you have another story for us.
4887000	4889000	I do, and it's also about Amiibos.
4890000	4894000	Although, I really feel like extending the Mii because it's two eyes.
4895000	4896000	Amiibo!
4897000	4904000	But, apparently, there is going to be some talk, because third parties have shown interest in using the Amiibo technology.
4904000	4909000	And, they might be allowed to use them, to have them of their own.
4910000	4913000	Or, to be able to use them in their own franchises.
4914000	4919000	What third party game? Sorry, somebody had to say it. Somebody had to say it.
4920000	4923000	No, Sega would be the likely candidate, right?
4924000	4926000	Probably Sega. Maybe some Capcom?
4926000	4936000	I mean, I know that this doesn't mean that the third parties get to make Amiibos, but I could totally see where Nintendo would produce a Sonic Amiibo for Sega.
4937000	4939000	I mean, it's still a hugely popular character. Just none of his friends.
4940000	4947000	If Mario was able to go into, say, Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric, or something like that, would he have extra long legs, too?
4948000	4950000	Would they give him all lanky legs?
4951000	4954000	Except, I guess, Waluigi would be perfectly fine there.
4954000	4966000	Well, the quote from Damon Baker, who is the Nintendo of America licensing manager, says that they've been getting some creative ideas coming from third parties, and they're working on opportunities for next year.
4967000	4970000	Sorry, I can't hear you over my machine printing all that money.
4970000	4986000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when, you know, gaming was a little bit simple. You didn't need all this other stuff to attach to your game to get stuff.
4987000	4993000	You just put in the game, insert cartridge, and play game. Hurray. It's the classic game of the week.
4994000	4998000	And, again, I find myself without the music, so I suddenly have made this the new song.
4998000	5006000	It's for the classic game of the week. Oops. Hey, I got off a plane three hours ago. Give me a break.
5007000	5008000	But not literally.
5009000	5014000	Figuratively got off a plane three hours ago. Although, that wasn't a lot. Yes.
5015000	5020000	Uh, I left the- I got you around 4-4. It's not quite 7-40 yet.
5021000	5025000	I literally am sick of this conversation. Alright. The classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.
5025000	5033000	Misuse of literally makes me figuratively insane. How about- I'm gonna come over there and bop you with this mic, and it'll hurt.
5034000	5035000	I'll throw up on you.
5037000	5041000	These things are foam coated, it might not. What's the classic game of the week?
5042000	5043000	Star Wars trilogy arcade.
5044000	5048000	Cause I'm still going with the Sega model 3 theme.
5048000	5054000	You would pick a game that has the, uh, you know, March of Darth Vader in it, or what do they call it? The Death March?
5055000	5060000	We just have to start with the very beginning, and then we can skip forward a little bit. But the 26 minute mark?
5061000	5063000	So yeah, you would pick this.
5070000	5073000	I remember this in the arcades when we were playing DDR.
5074000	5075000	Oh yeah, this game was awesome.
5075000	5079000	I wonder if James Earl Jones ever messes with people on the phone that call him.
5080000	5081000	I would.
5084000	5088000	I don't know, I'm just now imagining him saying, hello, this is Mufasa.
5090000	5091000	Tell us about the game!
5092000	5094000	Fuck! Star Wars, shit!
5094000	5100000	Um, okay. It came out in 1998. It's a 3D rail shooter that was based off of Star Wars.
5101000	5109000	And it had, uh, also, uh, it actually came out at the same time that these special editions did.
5110000	5117000	Um, it also came out with the Star Wars trilogy pinball game, so it was sort of like this big batch of Star Wars all at the same time.
5117000	5123000	And it was the second in Sega's Star Wars arcade series preceded by Star Wars arcade.
5124000	5129000	And, uh, followed by Star Wars Racer arcade that came out in 2000.
5130000	5140000	So it basically has two, uh, big themes which are reenactments from the first, uh, three star, from the actual three Star Wars movies instead of the shit ones that didn't exist at the time.
5141000	5147000	Um, they have two missions each and a bonus battle, uh, against either Darth Vader or Boba Fett.
5148000	5151000	Um, the normal gameplay has you moving across here around and shooting shit.
5152000	5159000	And you have a special event button at certain points that will, uh, highlight and trigger different events on screen.
5160000	5168000	Uh, your first, uh, basically your, uh, first mission is, uh, the battle that you have in the X-Wing, uh, against the TIE Fighters.
5168000	5175000	And then, um, the second part is, uh, flying around the Death Star shooting, you know, Darth Vader's TIE Fighter.
5176000	5178000	And the third part is basically the trench run.
5179000	5182000	So the Empire Strikes Back has the Hoth battle.
5183000	5190000	Um, the second part has, uh, the escape from Hoth and, uh, you know, shooting, you know, going around in the Millennium Falcon.
5191000	5196000	And the third part is in the hangar shooting, uh, snowtroopers and a wampa.
5197000	5199000	Poor wampas. They never asked for that.
5200000	5203000	And Return of the Jedi has you doing the speeder bike reenactment.
5204000	5212000	Then you, uh, move toward the base on Endor and the last one you have to, uh, basically just shoot down a walker.
5213000	5217000	The game's very final mission has you as an X-Wing pilot to destroy the second Death Star.
5218000	5225000	It also has the bonus stages, like I said. One of them you use a lightsaber to def, uh, deflect Boba Fett's blaster shots.
5226000	5229000	And then the last one is versus Darth Vader on the second Death Star.
5230000	5233000	Really freaking good game, um, especially for its time.
5234000	5244000	It was really, I'd say, it threw back to having the old original Star Wars arcade, but it was just really fun.
5245000	5249000	And I still think that, you know, graphically and playwise it still holds up today.
5250000	5251000	So, that's the classic game.
5252000	5254000	Let's hear it for the Sega Model 3.
5254000	5257000	It was also specifically on the Step 2.1 hardware.
5258000	5261000	Give us some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5262000	5267000	Dungeon Buster says, you could kill the wampas on Hoth, but you had the button mash like crazy, which with the joystick could look a little embarrassing.
5268000	5269000	A friend of mine was really good at the game.
5270000	5274000	YYR says, I have to say, Star Wars trilogy arcade bordered on really unfun when the difficulty was set to maximum.
5275000	5278000	The game basically bends you over and takes your wallet. Other than that, awesome.
5279000	5281000	Well, yeah, if you have it on normal difficulty, though, it was super fun.
5281000	5285000	And yes, there was a lot of money spent on this machine by me.
5286000	5287000	You don't say.
5288000	5291000	Like, I'm tired of playing DDR. I'm gonna go shoot some TIE Fighters.
5292000	5296000	Fair enough, fair enough. It was a fun game. It was really cool for the time, too.
5297000	5305000	It just reminded me of something. Remember how we've been trying to get people to, you know, submit us, you know, stuff in the mailbag or, you know, the participate email?
5306000	5307000	Sure.
5308000	5311000	And how we were punishing them with music from the, uh, what was it?
5312000	5313000	Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
5314000	5315000	I think...
5316000	5318000	Paris' eyes just lit up like, please don't.
5319000	5320000	Oh my god.
5321000	5327000	I think that instead we should be punishing them with music from the Star Wars dance section of the game.
5328000	5329000	Oh, the Kinect Star Wars.
5330000	5331000	The Kinect Star Wars music?
5331000	5339000	I don't remember the popular music, but we changed them to have Star Wars lyrics. Would be quite appropriate, I think, for punishments.
5340000	5345000	Uh, let's consider that maybe for a future week. I think that will be, we'll put that challenge out, uh, soon.
5346000	5347000	I'll be absent that day.
5348000	5349000	Alright.
5350000	5352000	These aren't the droids you're looking for. Oh my god.
5354000	5360000	Alright, um, we're gonna take a break. Actually, remember the chatroom didn't really, like, hate the Kim Kardashian music.
5361000	5364000	We were playing it on air, and we were like, it's actually not that bad.
5365000	5370000	Like, the Kim Kardashian game music is, it's kinda like, you know, it loops an awful lot, but it's not awful.
5371000	5372000	Masochist level low.
5374000	5378000	Alright, uh, we're gonna take a break, guys. When we come back, there's plenty more of Orange Dance Radio.
5379000	5383000	Rapid Fire News, the Fugu question of the week, which sadly was only the Facebook question of the week this week, that was my bad.
5384000	5388000	I'll explain why when we come back. Uh, and your emails that you may or may not have sent, and plenty more.
5388000	5393000	We're gonna talk to Marissa about voice acting as well, let her expand a little bit on, so you want to be a voice actor.
5394000	5399000	Uh, so we'll talk a little bit about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5406000	5414000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 9th of 2014, with episode number 574 of our program.
5415000	5432000	If you're just joining us here live at the Voice of the Geese Network at voggetnetwork.com, I am just back from BlizzCon, and I had the hilariously timed, uh, vacation where I was going to BlizzCon and going to be in LA, the same time that our dear friend of the show, Marissa, would be up here in Sacramento.
5433000	5437000	But we're fortunate that it didn't totally crisscross, so she's able to join us here tonight. So, hello again, Marissa.
5438000	5439000	Hello.
5439000	5451000	Now, earlier in the show we were talking about, um, that you, you were gonna tell a longer story, but I wanted to get right into the game news for some of our, you know, podcast people that, you know, I want my, I want my commentary, I want my Loki rant as soon as possible tonight, let's get to it.
5452000	5459000	But now that we're a little deeper into the show, I thought, you know, I think there are a lot of people that might be curious, like, what do you go through to become a voice actor? How did you get down this path?
5460000	5463000	So, Marissa, how do I become a voice actor?
5464000	5468000	As I said earlier, now we're gonna transition the show just completely off topic into Rob Marissa's giggle time.
5469000	5472000	That's A-OK. I think some of our listeners would be A-OK with that.
5473000	5480000	Well, it's just one of those things that you can't even just talk about yourself, you know, like, hey, I do this because everybody has to know, you know, how do I do it?
5481000	5489000	And then it also explains, you know, what I've been doing, but, um, excuse me, that's a great moment to voice over right now.
5490000	5495000	That's all right. I always tell people hiccups are like the internet radio guy's, like, biggest enemy, so, you know, it happens.
5496000	5497000	Oh, yes, my allergies came up here.
5497000	5499000	Oh, yes. Welcome to Sacramento.
5500000	5502000	I was like, I don't have these down south. I got them up here, though.
5503000	5505000	That's okay. You're breathing in cancer living down there, so.
5506000	5509000	That's true. Watch out for those sentient yellow clouds that follow you around.
5510000	5515000	Hey, I don't live in, um, that foggy place that we go up to on the five. That's different.
5516000	5517000	Anyway, anyway.
5517000	5522000	Um, uh, it's just something that I always want to do, and I was inspired.
5523000	5531000	I was actually studying to be an animator as a child, and then I watched behind the scenes, and they were showing the voice acting, and I've always been in love with the human voice.
5532000	5538000	It's just, it's such a versatile instrument, and, you know, animation combined with that, and then, you know, games.
5540000	5546000	I'm going to have to send you the bit from Mass Effect 3 where Trainer talks about wanting to lick Edie's voice.
5548000	5550000	You ever had somebody tell you, I want to lick your voice.
5551000	5552000	I wish it was voice.
5553000	5555000	If your voice had a body, I would lick it from head to toe.
5556000	5557000	Anyway, stop interrupting her. Stop interrupting her.
5558000	5559000	Sorry, sorry.
5560000	5569000	Uh, I guess, though, um, uh, it's interesting, like, thinking about it, because I know there are people most, every time, again, when you say this is what you're doing, people ask what to do to get ready to get into it.
5570000	5575000	It's funny, because the industry has changed so much with the internet, as so many industries have.
5575000	5580000	But the one thing that stays consistent is that you still have to be the best.
5581000	5586000	I came back from a major convention that I was blessed to attend, and I'm lucky to live in a major hub.
5587000	5590000	But there's just so many opportunities, it's really easy to get caught up.
5591000	5596000	Not a lot of people know that the first, you know, the thing that most people make the bulk of their income on is commercial.
5597000	5602000	Because there's going to be, you know, thousands of commercials per one video game, per, you know, one piece of animation.
5602000	5609000	And there's a website, actually, called voicebank.net, and you can look up all of your favorite actors, their demos will be posted there.
5610000	5612000	Huh. David Hayters is pretty fun.
5613000	5620000	And if you want to talk about talent, I mean, it's always amazing to listen to, you know, all the different, like, you know, those types of leaps and bounds.
5621000	5627000	But when you listen to somebody within a constrained space, you know, like when they have to do, like, you know, Rob Paulson, he's your friendly Honda dealer.
5627000	5640000	You know, in addition to, you know, Pinky, when you listen to someone's commercial demo, and then you start to recognize them, it's fascinating to realize how much versatility they can demonstrate in a constrained space of, you know, being a regular guy.
5641000	5648000	Wait, so me being a regular guy, could I just upload what I think are good Rob Roberts voices to this voicebank.net, or?
5649000	5654000	Believe it or not though, what you said though, as being a regular guy, that is the style of advertising that you hear right now.
5654000	5660000	Well, we talk about this right now. Like, when we talk about the class, like, people don't want to hear that anymore. Our generation is too simple.
5661000	5664000	You know what happened to the wacky morning DJs? They all got replaced.
5665000	5667000	Yeah, no more morning zoo. You want some free t-shirt.
5668000	5678000	So, yeah, though, they are obsessive about that when you, you know, take classes, listen to what you like to hear on television and radio.
5679000	5689000	Like, as a good friend of mine says, you know, find styles that you like, because it starts with emulating for a lot of people, but you have to learn to go out of that, because you listen to all your favorite, when you're talking about games and animation.
5689000	5702000	When you listen to your favorite people, they will constantly tell you it is not about the voice, which confuses people, because these people, you know, like, Greg Berger and Rob Paulson and Tress McMeel, like, they can do such beautiful, beautiful and wildly, you know, versatile voices.
5703000	5711000	It's because if you can't act, it doesn't matter. You know, you still have to be underneath all of that. You have to be able to act first.
5711000	5721000	I remember seeing this guy come to our group. He had this beautiful, you know, like, Don LaFontaine type voice, but he didn't know how to connect with what he was reading, and that's what you have to learn to do.
5722000	5736000	But now, thanks to the internet, I mean, you can, you know, with a microphone at home, you can, you're capable of pursuing a career at home. They make that sound way, you know, much easier than it actually is.
5736000	5743000	It's not like that is, hey, kids, just get a computer and plug in and you could be a voiceover star. No, but it's given a lot more opportunities.
5744000	5753000	And you just, you know, like in any entertainment field, you have to be careful and focused because at the end of the day, the most competitive thing you have is to be the best.
5754000	5762000	It's interesting because there's a lot of parallels there to podcasting and some things that are like completely opposite because, you know, any idiot with a microphone can podcast. Hey, how you doing?
5763000	5765000	Many of them shouldn't.
5766000	5767000	Well, no, you know.
5768000	5773000	Okay, okay. There are people who should, I think, think their ideas through a little more.
5774000	5775000	Yes, yes, that's exactly it.
5776000	5791000	But a lot of this stuff about driven and really like striving to be the best and I think just kind of having that drive is so crucial because if you, like, if we didn't sound like we wanted to be here at Orange Lawn Radio, would we have people listening to us?
5792000	5794000	Well, that's why it's called acting.
5797000	5806000	Well, not that I'm going to play any of this garbage coming out this week, but we have these fucking games coming out and this whole industry is a joke.
5807000	5808000	Which is true.
5809000	5825000	On the other hand, though, it's really easy to replace, though, drive for the drive to be the best, you know, because, you know, you can go to all of the podcast conventions and you can obsess about your Facebook page, but, you know, you could completely lose track of being good at your podcasting.
5825000	5831000	You know, that's what you have at the end of the day and, of course, the first step to that is, you know, honing your talent.
5832000	5840000	You can do that privately and here's the thing I always tell people, too, is that, you know, record at home and you can do that and it's pretty easy, you know, to do it nowadays or even on your phone.
5841000	5846000	And then, like, you know, continue to practice, but like a month later or two, you know, listen back on what you did.
5847000	5849000	And if you think you were fantastic, you're a bad actor.
5852000	5854000	You're right. We are our own worst critics.
5855000	5859000	I always listen to O.L.R. and it's not that, like, I like the sound, I like to hear my own voice.
5860000	5862000	In fact, that's actually, I'm not like, who is that nasally gay guy on that show?
5863000	5866000	But, like, you know, it's a, I am my own worst critic, you know, and I will fix the problems.
5867000	5869000	Of course, but, you know, we're artists. We're all broken on the inside.
5870000	5876000	But the thing being, though, if you're like, oh, I can do this crazy, I'm so great because I can do these voices.
5877000	5880000	Like, if you, if you listen to that a month later and you think that you're great, then you haven't grown.
5880000	5886000	Because right now I'm up here and I have a friend of mine who's a recording engineer and Lord knows that there's plenty of those in L.A.
5887000	5890000	But he's a good friend of mine and I love working with him and I'm working on another demo.
5891000	5895000	And it'd be really easy to go, you know that thing I did? Shit, I'm good.
5896000	5899000	But if you look back and you think that, it means you haven't grown.
5900000	5904000	Like, my friends go, aren't you beating yourself? I go, no, I know what to do now. I can do it better.
5904000	5910000	Act F in our chat room says, actually, it's about acting in games journalism. Anyway.
5911000	5914000	Slow clap for you, Act F. Slow clap for you. All right, look.
5915000	5921000	So when you say practice, what does that mean? Should I, should I invent a character? Should I try to emulate something I've already seen?
5922000	5926000	Like, can I practice doing my Grover? Near, far, near, far.
5927000	5930000	Should I practice my own Grover for a while or should I come up with my own thing?
5930000	5939000	Well, you, like, if you were to just specifically do that, you would take your, like, a lot of funny and good character voices and characters have come from a bad impression of somebody else.
5940000	5947000	But it's true, though, like, not that that was bad. But no, like, some, like, they weren't able to do it correctly and it turned into another character.
5948000	5954000	But if you, let's just say you don't have an acting background, like, you would write down a little sheet and, you know, like, you know, it's like a, you would write it down like, like you would a gaming character, though.
5954000	5959000	Like, if you're doing RPG, you would write down your character and that's the way you remember it, too, because it's not a voice.
5960000	5967000	Everything that you love and the people that, that do what you love, it's, it's because they're all indistinct characters, not just funny voices, you know.
5968000	5979000	Although, I do have a funny story about Jim Cummings and I told this to him and it's so cute because I did a show with one of his, one of his kids and this girl kept saying, oh, you know, she was so sweet.
5979000	5986000	I just got a kick out of her, but she's like, my dad keeps embarrassing me. And I go, why? And she goes, he does voices.
5987000	5997000	And I was a 12-year-old, 14-year-old, like, voiceover geek and I don't know why this didn't occur to me, but all of a sudden her dad comes to pick her up at the cast party and it's Jim Cummings.
5998000	6007000	I'm like, oh, yeah. Like, her last name, I just, you know, and I told him the story and he laughed because it's true, he's talking about how, you know, your kids, you know, you're never cool to your kids.
6007000	6009000	L.A. can be hilarious like that though.
6010000	6017000	But their friends are like, come on, please do it. She's like, dad, don't, please. So he's delightful and wonderful as well.
6018000	6021000	So I know that voice is a great documentary. It's on Netflix right now.
6022000	6023000	Yes.
6024000	6025000	Yeah.
6026000	6027000	Jeff just talked about.
6028000	6035000	It's also on, oh, the premiere that was so much fun. You're on the people that you love in the bathroom. And June Ferre, she's like this big and amazing.
6035000	6040000	Amazing, flawless goddess of the universe. I, oh my God, June Ferre.
6041000	6042000	I also recommend, of course.
6043000	6046000	Magic of the Spell, right? You've all played the DuckTales game, Magic of the Spell, June Ferre.
6047000	6048000	That's true.
6049000	6053000	No, no, don't even, you have to go further than that. Rocket Jay Squirrel.
6054000	6055000	Fair enough.
6055000	6063000	Yeah, Natasha. Also, you know, Rob Paulson's podcast is amazing talking tunes and on Netflix.
6064000	6066000	It is still weird hearing him as Donatello, just saying.
6067000	6074000	And on Netflix, it's funny because for me and a lot of people get a kick out of seeing it, you know, in a fictional like narrative form in a world.
6075000	6077000	And I still need, I still want to watch that.
6078000	6079000	The trailer for that was.
6080000	6081000	Yeah.
6081000	6086000	Yeah, that's the movie where the idea is that people are volleying to be the next Don LaFontaine.
6087000	6090000	Let me ask you before we get back into gaming news, because I do have to get back to that channel.
6091000	6093000	Let me ask you one more question here, and that would be specifically about, you know, practicing.
6094000	6097000	And here's one common practice. You know that Twitch TV is a thing, right?
6098000	6100000	You know Twitch TV and the people who are playing the video games on it.
6101000	6102000	This is something I see on Twitch TV all the time.
6103000	6108000	And that is people are playing role playing games and they decide they're going to act out the dialogue text that's on the screen.
6108000	6114000	And they like to read it, you know, you spoonie bard. And they just, they do all these like weird voices that don't even sound.
6115000	6120000	Would you encourage that sort of behavior or like, stop, stop, enough, enough.
6121000	6123000	Depends on whether you're in public or not.
6124000	6125000	Well, Twitch, Twitch is pretty public.
6128000	6135000	It just, you know what, you can be as silly as you want, as long as it's not, as long as you believe what they're saying, you know.
6135000	6144000	And that's a lot of people's method of practice. Of course, you still have to be able to, again, deal with the natural voices.
6145000	6147000	You know, like the commercials. I can't stand it right now, especially as a woman.
6148000	6153000	You'll turn on the TV and it's like, hey, come on down to Guitar Center, like you can or you won't, like whatever.
6154000	6159000	Like, advertising is fantasy. Like, you'd think you'd want to hear beautiful voices.
6160000	6164000	But, you know what, I was wondering too, I was like, why did they use this voice so often?
6165000	6166000	Because I've gotten into the world too, but I'm like...
6167000	6169000	Hey, you know, sometimes you get that not so fresh feeling.
6170000	6171000	Yeah.
6172000	6174000	So, that's why there's like, you know, Kotex.
6175000	6176000	Get some fucking Tampax.
6177000	6178000	Just like, find it at the grocery store, okay?
6179000	6184000	You know what though, maybe the reason they use that ad is because like, especially that Guitar Center ad is like, she doesn't sound like she knows anything about guitar.
6185000	6188000	She doesn't sound enthusiastic about the store, but she kind of sounds like...
6189000	6190000	She's the bored girlfriend.
6191000	6193000	No, the groupie that, you know, you might want to get with.
6193000	6195000	And she kind of sounds like that bass player.
6196000	6197000	The vocal fry.
6198000	6200000	YYR says, shit, I need to go to Guitar Center right now.
6201000	6205000	She sounds like the one character on Saturday Night Live that kept one-upping everybody.
6206000	6209000	Oh, the Kristen Wiig character. You know that one, the one that would always, she'd one-up everybody with their story.
6210000	6213000	Like, you know, yeah, what Alan perked up, what is it? You know this.
6214000	6215000	You know that character though.
6216000	6217000	It's like, I gave birth to five baby cows.
6218000	6219000	Yeah, you know, I did that one thing.
6219000	6220000	Baby arm thing.
6221000	6223000	Like, you know, I'm Prince of Tom Cruise, we're really close, yeah.
6224000	6229000	Yeah, just be as silly as you want, as long as though you do have to make sure that you are acting and in the moment.
6230000	6231000	And there's lots of different theories about that.
6232000	6234000	Like, a lot of people don't have any acting background, but they understand music.
6235000	6240000	But either way, you have to, you know, understand a character, understand how having to get in a character and things like that.
6241000	6247000	I think if Rob and Marissa ever do a Giggle show, I think we should consider doing a Twitch stream where we act out role-playing games.
6247000	6253000	Completely inappropriate voices, I think would be, you know, yeah, you spoonie bard.
6254000	6259000	Just play games with dialogue in them, but turn the voice volume down and just make up the voices for them.
6260000	6262000	Some people though, like, they've got publicity for themselves.
6263000	6268000	I mean, a lot of people that, and through successful YouTube videos, but I mean, you know the same thing.
6269000	6270000	They'll be like, all you need is a microphone.
6271000	6272000	All you need is a camera, get yourself on YouTube and you'll be famous.
6273000	6274000	No, but you know, you know what I mean.
6275000	6276000	Like, Melger Solid 5.
6277000	6281000	Well, I just can't wait for the show because now I'm imagining we might be playing Mass Effect and it's like, you know,
6282000	6285000	Hey you guys, my name's Garrus and I got to go do some calibrations.
6286000	6287000	Oh my, who wants a free bubble sticker?
6288000	6289000	All right.
6290000	6291000	I'd watch that.
6292000	6296000	All right. Marissa, it's always so lovely to talk to you and I wish you lived up here.
6297000	6301000	I do, but I understand you get it. You got to be where your industry is and best of luck with all that.
6301000	6309000	And I hope that next time we have you back on the show, you, you are having this huge list of games and anime to promote.
6310000	6311000	Cause I know you, I know you could do it.
6312000	6314000	You can go to my site, listen to my demo. You can feel the embarrassment.
6315000	6317000	You know, we do, we, believe it or not, we have industry people listen to this show.
6318000	6320000	So you never know where, where's your demo, where people can hear it.
6321000	6323000	Marissa Meisel.com. It's M E I Z E L.
6324000	6325000	Okay.
6326000	6327000	I'll answer to Meisel, but this smells like crack.
6328000	6330000	Oh yeah. We have pumpkin pie. Uh, we're distracted now.
6331000	6332000	Thank you so much.
6333000	6336000	I'll let you ladies get to your pie and we'll get to rapid fire news. Loki.
6337000	6339000	All right. I'll just talk about pie.
6340000	6345000	Sorry. SSG 100 Matt in chat says, Oh, it's Wolfman Jack. And this is my favorite spot on the Citadel.
6347000	6348000	All right. Anyway.
6350000	6355000	To register participation for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com use the passphrase crowd.
6356000	6363000	Loki. Uh, all right. Uh, well, they talked a little bit about, um, the instant game collection for PlayStation network.
6364000	6365000	Um, these are going to be the brand new games.
6366000	6377000	You're going to be able to check out, um, if you're a member of PlayStation plus and because, because, uh, drive club PlayStation plus edition has been kind of delayed for a while now.
6377000	6389000	Our first retail game coming to the, um, instant game collection for PlayStation forest in justice, gods among us, the ultimate edition, which is cool because I've not played that game.
6390000	6396000	Yeah. I already own it cause I bought it in a mega sale, but I cool that we're taking this step. I can't really be that mad.
6397000	6402000	Um, they're also going to have, I guess the standalone infamous, uh, second son expansion, infamous first light.
6402000	6411000	Um, so if that's free, that'd be pretty cool because yeah, that's, that'll be interesting. Yeah. And I'm also a secret ponchos and the swapper.
6412000	6416000	I'm sorry. First light and the swapper are going to be for January. Whereas the other two work for December.
6417000	6426000	I forgot that they put in both months there. Um, see, I didn't see what they had on. Oh, that's only PlayStation four.
6426000	6434000	So I don't know what they're going to have for PlayStation three yet, but, um, maybe injustice for PlayStation three.
6435000	6444000	It makes sense. So that'd be kind of cool. Um, all right. And then, uh, see here, this is kind of cool.
6445000	6452000	Grand theft auto five and you know, they are going to be having the HD remake coming out here in just over a week.
6452000	6460000	Not that you're counting down or anything. I don't do the counting down the, my, uh, pre-order does the counting down for me.
6461000	6473000	Uh, anyways, so they're going to be having that come out and, um, to go along with that, they're actually going to be putting out the, um, soundtrack for the game on vinyl as well as the CD.
6473000	6480000	Um, that's pretty amazing. That's going to be on vinyl now only listen to vinyl and hipsters were a part of the game.
6481000	6492000	So, um, it, I guess it's going to include 59 tracks from the game. Um, it's too bad though that they're not actually going to be having, uh, the full soundtrack, which they're going to be including.
6492000	6500000	Cause they're adding like 150 some songs, I think into, um, the HD five version of the game.
6501000	6512000	So I don't know. I'm very interested to play that. Can't wait. Um, but yeah, three CD soundtrack or six, six record vinyl, uh, collection they're going to have there.
6513000	6519000	Wow. And uh, how much is that going to cost me? No idea. Probably not going to buy the vinyl cause I obviously don't have any record.
6519000	6526000	Wait, I do still have a record player. Yeah. You know what, if hipsters really wanted to do it right, they'd bring back the eight track.
6527000	6543000	I mean like a million eight tracks. So just to, you know, true, true. Um, and then last but not least, um, you know, this must be exciting news if you're a fan of Pikmin, but guess what?
6544000	6556000	You know, instead of working on say something like, I don't know, a new F zero game, they're going to take, you know, Pikmin three, which was kind of okay, but they're going to make a Pikmin four.
6556000	6566000	Um, you know, they're working on games. This is continually launching campaigns after release of software will lay the groundwork for the next iteration of Pikmin in the future.
6566000	6578000	And needless to say, uh, we want it to be one of those motivations for potential consumers to purchase a Wii U. We are making a very, or making very, a variety of different efforts.
6579000	6590000	I don't think the Wii U, I don't think Pikmin's ever going to be a reason why people purchase the Wii U. I mean, it's, I mean, I think it's, it's more one of those things where it's like it helps bolster it up.
6590000	6606000	It's a nice, it's a nice thing to have in the pocket. There are definitely a lot of Pikmin fans out there. Maybe we don't have any hardcore Pikmin people, but I know people that really enjoy the series and so forth, but it doesn't seem like the type of like system seller that Mario or Zelda or even Bayonetta is, you know?
6606000	6615000	Um, and to go along with that, Pikmin 3 is also getting a demo, which I'm surprised they didn't have a demo for that yet, but now that's a great idea. Gonna put one out.
6615000	6626000	Um, but seriously though, focusing on Pikmin 4 and you haven't even brought F-Zero out yet. I mean, I would think F-Zero would be more of a system seller than say Pikmin.
6627000	6635000	Depending on what the whole like, you know, how many resources they're having to pour into it, what they're having to pull from other projects, like it's kind of like one of those, you know, I realize there's enough Pikmin fans out there.
6635000	6649000	I'm cool if they want to go down that road and explore Pikmin 4 as long as like it's not coming at the cost of, you know, my dream F-Zero game or hell Animal Crossing Wii U, which I think we all anticipate will be the next big thing they announce at E3 or, you know, whatever.
6649000	6669000	So, well, they haven't really announced anything beyond, I mean, they've announced a few things for like 2015, but maybe that could be something that takes place in the second quarter because they haven't really said, you know, I know they have for the first part of the year they've got, what was it, um, Splatoon, but, and I assume Zelda's fourth quarter, so beyond that.
6672000	6676000	I know what you're saying, but I keep hearing Splatoon and thinking of my old uncle Roy.
6677000	6679000	Very different, very different.
6679000	6680000	I know.
6680000	6698000	Alright, I got a few stories for you guys. First off, Duke Nukem 3D, the Megaton edition, it is coming to the Vita and the PlayStation 3. I actually didn't know that this was being planned, but if you somehow still haven't experienced Duke Nukem 3D, you know, the good one, then come and get some on the Vita and the PlayStation 3.
6698000	6711000	Devolver Digital did announce that on Twitter, January 13th, 2015, and in Europe the next day. I guess this was announced way back in August of 2013, I just somehow forgot, because, you know, I've been happy with my Steam version.
6711000	6712000	So, uh...
6712000	6715000	You know, I still haven't played the Steam version even though I bought it. What's...
6715000	6719000	Shocking that I bought something on Steam that I have not played.
6719000	6724000	I think you should make a note. I think we should, I think we should battle each other this week and stream it or something. That would be fun.
6724000	6726000	Come on, Loki, an old school battle.
6726000	6727000	I wouldn't be willing to do that.
6727000	6737000	Well, God, it's been so long. I used to play the exclusively just keyboard, so I would use like the arrow keys or whatever it was to look around. I would never use the mouse.
6737000	6747000	Well, if you are interested in buying somebody's garbage, you can do so. The ET game cartridges that were in the New Mexico desert are now available on eBay.
6747000	6755000	And I think, I remember we talked about this, like they were going to be going to eBay or something. We just brought this up like the last week, so that's why we're putting this in rapid fire news tonight.
6755000	6761000	But they are out there on eBay, and if you want to know how much these are getting, there's one up on eBay for $500.
6761000	6764000	I could just take a crap on one of mine and put it on eBay.
6764000	6768000	These cartridges are not guaranteed to work, just so you know.
6768000	6770000	Oh, well, then it sounds like a DT.
6770000	6778000	They have been in a dump for 25 years or so, so yeah. There are other games available, by the way.
6778000	6783000	When I see a game like Sword Quest is available, I'm kind of like, well, that's kind of cool.
6783000	6790000	I don't know, there's a part of me that's like, oh god, the big video game fan that I am should own a piece of gaming history like that.
6790000	6795000	But then I'm like, that is fucking garbage. What would I do with a piece of garbage? Can you even hang it on the wall?
6795000	6798000	Like, look at this garbage I have up on the wall.
6798000	6799000	Shadow boxes.
6799000	6807000	You could have the arcade, you could have the Atari shit pile shadow box.
6807000	6812000	You could just buy a copy of ET, hit it with a hammer, and put it in a shadow box. It would be just the same.
6813000	6820000	I don't know, so, you know what, there's people that are into this and collecting this, and don't let our little cynicism get you down.
6820000	6823000	If this is a piece of gaming history you want to own, then more power to you.
6823000	6825000	Where's my HD remake?
6825000	6826000	Of ET?
6826000	6827000	Yeah.
6828000	6832000	Maybe when they release ET2, Electric Boogaloo.
6832000	6838000	Anyhow, Luigi's Mansion. Remember that series? Luigi's Mansion is going to be getting an arcade game.
6838000	6841000	Here's the funny thing, it's made by Capcom, developed by Capcom.
6841000	6847000	The arcade version was being actually tested about a week ago, October 30th to November 3rd.
6847000	6850000	But now the arcade game will be coming out.
6850000	6854000	The arcade game is based on Luigi's Mansion 2 that was on the Nintendo 3DS.
6854000	6860000	It's only playable in a first person perspective, but Luigi does appear in cut scenes, so it's not like you're never going to get to see him.
6860000	6862000	So, that's pretty cool.
6862000	6865000	Summer 2015 is when the game is set to be released in Japan.
6865000	6868000	Is it like a shooter? Is it like an on-rails shooter or something like that?
6868000	6869000	No, it's Luigi's Mansion.
6869000	6873000	Sounds like it's along the lines of the, maybe like the gun survivor games.
6873000	6875000	You think?
6875000	6877000	Perhaps. I'm trying to see if it says anything here.
6877000	6880000	Gloomy Mansion is a stage that's in the game.
6880000	6885000	You get an in-game tutorial from Elvin Gadd.
6885000	6890000	And there's a Poltergust shaped controller which sucks in ghosts if you shake it.
6890000	6892000	And then there's a start button and a bomb button.
6892000	6894000	It sounds very similar to how the game on 3DS controls.
6894000	6898000	Well, I know something better than that.
6898000	6906000	There's going to be the Golden Age of Arcade Gaming on the Nintendo 3DS by Sega.
6906000	6913000	Basically we're getting a new batch of Sega 3D classics that are going to be the best of them.
6913000	6921000	There will be the 3D Fantasy Zone 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.
6922000	6928000	Oh, and also After Burner 2 is going to be in early 2015.
6928000	6931000	But I don't care about any of the rest of them because Fantasy Zone.
6931000	6934000	And I'm sure Dan's going to be happy about having Outrun.
6934000	6938000	But Fantasy Zone is really the best Sega game in the universe.
6938000	6940000	And that and Space Harrier.
6940000	6946000	When I read that earlier this week, I was like, oh, Jamie is going to have some heavy breathing on OLR this week.
6946000	6948000	I'm screaming internally.
6948000	6951000	You know that cat picture with heavy breathing?
6951000	6953000	I know. I might need new pants.
6953000	6956000	YYR in chat says, OMG, really? Is this happening?
6956000	6959000	This is happening. This shit's going down.
6959000	6962000	Jamie's going to be a happy, happy bunny.
6962000	6966000	Also, we can finally kill our Sims in the pool.
6966000	6968000	Yay, Sims 4 has pools.
6968000	6973000	You can drown your Sims, which is the best thing ever.
6974000	6978000	I want to make the best ghost house ever once I get Sims 4.
6978000	6980000	There need to be more mods for it.
6980000	6983000	Can I make a family and call them the sorrows so I can drown my sorrows?
6983000	6987000	I'm going to just have two characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and they're going to be dead.
6987000	6989000	Like the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
6989000	6991000	You all got problems.
6991000	6993000	You know what? I only have one problem. It's named Rob.
6993000	6995000	It's a problem.
6995000	6998000	You had 99 problems, but a Rob ate one.
6998000	7000000	No, Rob's actually included in problem.
7000000	7003000	You can't have a problem without Rob.
7003000	7009000	I would love to see a psychological study on your mental health compared to what you do to your Sims.
7013000	7021000	You know, when you start writing that paper, I will give you something to write about.
7022000	7027000	I was always disappointed in the Sims that you couldn't put a diving board on the second floor of a house
7027000	7029000	so they would be able to dive into the pool that way.
7029000	7034000	You can, but it has to have the pool as an interactive thing.
7034000	7040000	But you can actually, there's a code to make items clip and put them anywhere.
7040000	7044000	So you can put a diving board on the second story and have someone jump off of it.
7044000	7050000	ActDeft is referencing a years old meme in our chatroom by putting in all caps, pools opened.
7051000	7056000	I'm having flashbacks to those theme park games and doing sadistic things in those games.
7056000	7058000	Like half finished roller coasters.
7058000	7060000	You mean the hell coaster?
7060000	7062000	Like Final Destination 3 reenactments.
7062000	7067000	What was that one ride? Was it like there was the one that was really long? Mr. Bones something?
7067000	7069000	It's been so long since those games.
7069000	7071000	I think it was Mr. Bones Wild Riders.
7071000	7074000	I just remember the one where then you could ride the ride yourself.
7074000	7076000	In like the first, remember when like virtual reality.
7076000	7077000	Oh yeah.
7077000	7080000	They had this roller coaster. They had like a one where you could build the roller coaster and ride it.
7080000	7082000	That was the Disney one because I remember getting that one.
7082000	7088000	Because I always, you know, they wanted me to use the chain drive to go up and I was just like,
7088000	7093000	I'm just going to have it go in a corkscrew and I'm just going to have accelerators the entire way up.
7093000	7095000	And kill people with G-forces that way.
7096000	7101000	SSJ 100 Matt says, have a family called the Gatsby's and have the game end without them all dead in the pool.
7102000	7104000	Alright. Anything else Star Saga?
7104000	7106000	Spoilers for an old book.
7106000	7112000	Look, Nintendo has confirmed that Splatoon will have a single player mode.
7112000	7114000	They have a trailer out for it now.
7114000	7116000	But yeah, you can be single player.
7116000	7120000	So if you only like playing with yourself, you can play with yourself all night.
7120000	7122000	I love playing with myself.
7122000	7124000	I don't have any friends.
7124000	7126000	Single player mode is going to be great for me.
7126000	7129000	At least it's single player and not single handed.
7129000	7134000	People are not always available to play Splatoon at my beck and call.
7134000	7137000	Marissa, do you plan on playing Splatoon by yourself?
7138000	7140000	What did you ask me about?
7140000	7142000	The Splatoon was the end result.
7142000	7145000	I'm asking you about your love.
7145000	7148000	You're not supposed to have an interest in these activities. I'm a female.
7148000	7150000	Am I what by myself?
7150000	7152000	Even females can love the Wii U.
7152000	7154000	Everyone eventually goes Splatoon.
7154000	7156000	What about you? What's the name of the game?
7156000	7158000	Myself.
7160000	7162000	I've had too much soda. I'm sorry.
7162000	7166000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
7166000	7168000	Where we ask our listeners...
7168000	7170000	Well then what are we going to do?
7170000	7172000	Giggle time!
7174000	7176000	No, we're definitely doing the foogle question of the week.
7183000	7185000	So here's the thing.
7185000	7187000	I might have screwed up.
7187000	7190000	So you all know Loki produced tonight's show.
7190000	7193000	Which, by the way, Loki has done a fine job with tonight's show.
7193000	7195000	Yeah, it was very last minute.
7195000	7197000	Well that's okay. All the shows usually are.
7197000	7199000	Wink.
7199000	7201000	But here's the thing.
7201000	7207000	So Loki did tonight's show, but Loki actually didn't have admin access on the Google Plus community.
7207000	7211000	Because I had no idea that Loki was actually on Google Plus.
7211000	7213000	So I never gave it to him.
7213000	7216000	So he did have admin access to the Facebook community.
7216000	7218000	So I apologize to our Google Plus people.
7218000	7220000	The foogle question only went to Facebook.
7220000	7227000	But usually the foogle question of the week is where our Facebook and Google Plus communities come together to answer a question that we ask of our listeners.
7227000	7229000	And asking this week...
7229000	7237000	With so many releases coming out this holiday season, what is a game you think people might overlook and really should be playing?
7237000	7239000	This is a good question. Good job, Loki.
7239000	7241000	What are people going to forget about?
7241000	7243000	There's a lot of things you can forget about.
7243000	7247000	There's like 50,000 games coming out over the next month or so.
7247000	7250000	What's the one that's going to get swept away that people need to not forget about?
7250000	7251000	I think that's a great question.
7251000	7253000	So Alan starts us off. Alan Alchemy is saying,
7253000	7261000	I keep hearing about this little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition that might be a sleeper hit if enough people gave it word of mouth.
7261000	7266000	In all seriousness, I keep hearing about fantasy life on Tumblr from everywhere.
7266000	7268000	It's like a cross of Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, I guess.
7268000	7271000	And a ton of people don't really know about it.
7271000	7275000	I've heard of this from some of my fellow podcasters that are really into the Nintendo games.
7275000	7277000	But I haven't checked this out myself.
7277000	7280000	But that's a great example of one that might be getting lost right now.
7280000	7283000	A little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition.
7283000	7285000	I doubt anybody's going to be playing that.
7285000	7288000	Oh, shut up. Everyone's going to be playing it and shipping everybody with everybody.
7288000	7290000	Because that's what we do in BioWare games.
7290000	7291000	We ship.
7291000	7293000	HypnoToad replies and says,
7293000	7298000	Final Fantasy VI. Play it. Live it. Love it. So says HypnoToad.
7299000	7303000	See, here's the thing though. Its release is coming out this holiday season.
7303000	7306000	Not holiday season 20 years ago.
7306000	7311000	It could be the mobile release because that just came out not that long ago.
7311000	7313000	It could be that.
7313000	7315000	But it is a classic. Why not?
7315000	7318000	Didn't they just put, was VI one of the ones they added on Steam?
7318000	7320000	Not on Steam yet.
7320000	7322000	But I don't see why it wouldn't happen.
7322000	7324000	But V has to happen first.
7324000	7325000	So we'll see.
7325000	7328000	Oh, I guess it doesn't have to. They can do whatever the hell they want, really.
7328000	7331000	I would say HypnoToad's answer really amounts to,
7331000	7333000	Screw the new stuff. Go play a classic.
7333000	7335000	I think that's kind of what I'm hearing in that answer.
7335000	7337000	ActDeaf replied and said,
7337000	7339000	Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.
7339000	7343000	The levels on Super Mario 3D World are really fun and get really challenging towards the end.
7343000	7347000	Though I expect many to just dismiss this title because it's more of the same in the price.
7347000	7350000	But I'm looking forward to it and playing it this holiday season.
7351000	7355000	You know, I gotta say that Nintendo Direct thing that they showed for Captain Toad's Treasure Tractor.
7355000	7357000	Say it four times fast.
7357000	7359000	Treasure Tractor.
7359000	7361000	That would be awesome.
7361000	7365000	It's just a Mario version of, like, Farming Simulator.
7365000	7366000	Yeah, exactly.
7366000	7369000	God, you know what? I would totally play that if it was Farming Simulator.
7369000	7372000	Right? Mario Goes Farming? That'd be great. Yeehaw.
7372000	7378000	Anyway, seeing the Nintendo Direct and seeing really how varied a lot of it looks,
7378000	7383000	I was like, alright, maybe I'm one of those people that's writing this game off and not really giving it a fair shot.
7383000	7385000	So, good example.
7385000	7393000	Of course, if you're a Wii U owner only, you know, that's one of the three games you have to buy this holiday.
7393000	7399000	Serpingslurpy says, I don't have enough time to play the games I already have, let alone those that are coming out.
7399000	7403000	But one game that hasn't been receiving a lot of attention is The Forest.
7403000	7406000	Think survival horror meets Minecraft.
7406000	7409000	I think I've heard of that once, but I haven't seen much on it.
7409000	7413000	I came super close to buying it, but then I was like, no.
7413000	7421000	AZHP says, with the PlayStation TV out, it's a great time to play games you might have missed with a low investment PSTV at $99.
7421000	7428000	It's $100 less than Evita, and you can play great games like Persona 4 Golden and Super Danganronpa 1 and 2.
7428000	7433000	PS, shoutouts to Jonas for taking second place at the US Pump Festival yesterday.
7433000	7435000	Freestyle is dead, long live Freestyle.
7435000	7439000	I heard actually that Jonas, I don't mind you derailing that, because thank you for the reminder.
7439000	7443000	I had read a tweet from Jonas that he did very well in that Pump It Up competition.
7443000	7445000	He won second place. National.
7445000	7447000	It's amazing.
7447000	7450000	So, where's my video? Pics or it didn't happen.
7450000	7453000	I want one of whatever Alan made.
7453000	7456000	Yeah, they're cooling right now. He made some cookies is what he made.
7456000	7458000	They're chocolate peppermint cookies.
7458000	7462000	So anyway, less cookies, more video games.
7462000	7466000	Crylo responded and said, I agree with Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.
7466000	7469000	Super excited and it looks like so much fun.
7469000	7474000	How about here in studio? I'll just open Mike, whoever wants to answer.
7474000	7477000	Any games coming out this holiday that you're afraid people might miss?
7477000	7479000	No.
7482000	7483000	That's tough, because...
7483000	7485000	Go outside and play.
7486000	7488000	Um...
7488000	7491000	Gosh, I don't know. I mean, there's...
7491000	7495000	It would probably have to be an indie title, because I'm kind of familiar with a lot of the stuff.
7495000	7498000	Yeah, that's where I'm kind of like, I'm like, I feel like there's that indie title I haven't played yet.
7498000	7500000	You know, ironically, I think The Crew.
7500000	7503000	I think a lot of people aren't going to be really paying attention to that, because...
7503000	7505000	But it looks like an interesting driving game.
7505000	7507000	Um...
7507000	7511000	Gosh, I don't know. Dragon Age Inquisition, I keep forgetting, is coming out.
7511000	7513000	Um, so I may look at that.
7513000	7515000	Maybe there was some truth to Alan's answer there.
7515000	7517000	Seriously, I mean, I keep forgetting that that game is coming out.
7517000	7520000	If you're on Tumblr, you will never be allowed to forget.
7520000	7524000	Um, I've never played Dragon Age, although I have...
7524000	7527000	What is it? Origins, I think, on...
7527000	7529000	Origin, so...
7529000	7532000	To be fair, Jamie, if you're on Tumblr, there are a lot of things you're not allowed to forget.
7532000	7534000	Oh, I'm not on Tumblr, so...
7534000	7536000	So I guess that's...
7536000	7537000	Probably all the better for you.
7537000	7538000	It's a scary place.
7538000	7541000	I don't know. Straight white men are not allowed on Tumblr.
7542000	7545000	Is that, like, is that one of the questions that you have to answer when you sign up for Tumblr?
7545000	7547000	Are you straight white male?
7547000	7549000	Are you, like, are you...
7549000	7551000	It's all checker privilege. Sorry, nope.
7551000	7555000	Are you a straight white cis male? Do you need a bodyguard?
7555000	7557000	Check here for privilege. No, alright.
7557000	7559000	Ah, we kid, we kid, we kid. Alright.
7559000	7561000	Uh, let's...
7561000	7564000	Let's get to some more stories. Loki.
7564000	7566000	Alright.
7566000	7568000	Um, let's see.
7568000	7571000	Let's talk a little bit about Tony Hawk.
7571000	7573000	Yes, Tony Hawk. Who's that guy? I mean...
7573000	7574000	You mean he's relevant?
7574000	7576000	He is, nowadays, I guess.
7576000	7578000	Or he's coming back.
7578000	7580000	You know, because he did do a mobile game.
7580000	7583000	You may remember. I was kind of disappointed that it wasn't a console game.
7583000	7587000	But, apparently Activision is getting desperate for a Tony Hawk game.
7587000	7589000	Because they haven't had one for several years now.
7589000	7592000	So Tony Hawk will be making a comeback.
7592000	7595000	Or at least they're going to have another game come out in 2015.
7595000	7598000	Please, please Activision.
7598000	7604000	No games that require some sort of weird looking, you know, snowboard-like controller.
7604000	7607000	Because that was stupid. Please don't do that.
7607000	7610000	Just make a Tony Hawk game.
7610000	7612000	And I totally played a new Tony Hawk game.
7612000	7614000	I'm sorry, cookies.
7614000	7616000	I like the pro skater games.
7616000	7619000	And Skate 3, though, I do want to try Skate 3 even though that is not a Tony Hawk game.
7619000	7621000	Because the glitches look so awesome.
7621000	7623000	You know, it's been on a break for a little bit.
7623000	7624000	So, why not?
7624000	7627000	Like, I even think it's time to try another Guitar Hero.
7627000	7628000	Why not?
7628000	7629000	I want a new DJ Hero.
7629000	7630000	I want a new DJ Hero.
7630000	7631000	Me too.
7631000	7632000	So, I want a new DJ Hero.
7632000	7633000	I need to play DJ Hero.
7633000	7634000	I've got the controller.
7634000	7636000	I was even looking at it the other day.
7636000	7638000	I'm like, ooh, I still have DJ Hero.
7638000	7640000	Yeah.
7640000	7644000	Anyhow, unfortunately you can't play DJ Hero on your PlayStation 4.
7644000	7646000	Which is why we need a new DJ Hero.
7646000	7650000	But PlayStation 4, as you know, there was some dramas with the firmware that came out.
7650000	7652000	Meaning you couldn't put your PlayStation in rest mode.
7652000	7657000	Well, here is patch 2.01 to save the day.
7657000	7663000	2.01 addresses issues some users have encountered when powering on the system from rest mode.
7663000	7666000	Now, I didn't hear if this actually released or not.
7666000	7668000	But I thought I'm hearing it did in Europe.
7668000	7669000	It has.
7669000	7670000	It has here.
7670000	7672000	Because I updated when I got my system back.
7672000	7674000	And it does work.
7674000	7675000	Yay.
7675000	7676000	Because I liked rest mode.
7676000	7678000	Because that's how you charge your controller when you're not playing.
7678000	7679000	Yep.
7679000	7680000	So, alright.
7680000	7681000	Good to know that's back.
7681000	7684000	And using the charge controller and using it to download Call of Duty.
7684000	7686000	Because it was like 40-some gigs.
7686000	7690000	Speaking of updates, Xbox One is getting their last update of the year.
7690000	7692000	And it just started rolling out.
7692000	7696000	And this is where you can now customize the background image for each account's dashboard on the console.
7696000	7700000	I guess similar-esque to PlayStation 4 themes.
7700000	7707000	You can also have locations and bios and six game clips or achievements that you would like to share on your profile.
7707000	7709000	These are the six most meaningful.
7709000	7713000	This is the teabagging moment that really meant a lot to me.
7713000	7715000	So, you can do that on.
7715000	7718000	I called some guy an asshole online and didn't get banned.
7718000	7724000	So, also there's some marketplace tweaks to help make it, you know, more navigatable.
7724000	7731000	Also, there's a trending tab in one guide that shows the 20 shows that are most popular with the general Xbox audience.
7731000	7734000	Probably Walking Dead, Walking Dead, and Walking Dead.
7734000	7735000	Within reason.
7736000	7740000	I get a feeling Downton Abbey probably won't be making the list.
7740000	7742000	Just call it a hunch.
7742000	7743000	Call it a hunch.
7743000	7745000	Barefoot Contessa on the Food Network.
7745000	7747000	Don't think she's gonna be in the top 20.
7747000	7750000	All my children? Probably not.
7750000	7752000	Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?
7752000	7753000	What?
7753000	7755000	Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?
7755000	7756000	Because it's walking-
7756000	7758000	She makes delicious food!
7758000	7760000	How can you hate delicious food?
7760000	7761000	You can't hate delicious food.
7761000	7762000	You can't eat the delicious food.
7762000	7763000	I guess that's where the anger could come from.
7763000	7764000	How dare I? How dare I?
7764000	7767000	Is that Rob you were saying something? Because there's cookies.
7768000	7770000	I'm in a cookie coma over here.
7770000	7772000	You know what? Barefoot Alan Alchemy just made you all cookies.
7772000	7773000	Yeah.
7773000	7774000	So enjoy it.
7774000	7775000	Bye, Alan!
7775000	7776000	Alright.
7776000	7782000	Anyhow, if you want to see more, Major Nelson did a little tour that you can look up on YouTube and get everything detailed.
7782000	7787000	But honestly, if you're an Xbox One owner, you probably already grabbed it, and I don't blame you.
7788000	7796000	Hey, Dark Sakura is going to take a break from cookie eating and dive into the mailbag and find some emails that our listeners have sent us this week.
7796000	7797000	These are not treated like this.
7800000	7801000	Or she'll make Marissa read them in a silly voice.
7801000	7802000	Oh, I know, man.
7802000	7803000	I'm going to put her on the spot.
7803000	7804000	I read them in a silly voice.
7804000	7805000	Alright.
7805000	7806000	It is the mailbag.
7806000	7810000	Participate at orangelawnsready.com if you would like to participate with a future mailbag segment.
7810000	7812000	I'm going to try to be the guitar center lady.
7812000	7813000	Alright.
7813000	7823000	It's probably been, probably a week late to ask, but I was wondering, are there any horror games that would have made good haunted house slash maze attractions?
7823000	7824000	No, I'm going to do one in one place.
7824000	7825000	You became a Gen-Xer.
7825000	7826000	Huh?
7826000	7829000	You became a Gen-Xer.
7829000	7838000	They do usually prefer to keep the lines moving, so I doubt one could watch monitors in a room for ten minutes or find picture fragments in a seemingly endless maze of hallways.
7838000	7839000	This one's from Robert M.
7839000	7840000	Wait.
7840000	7846000	I'm actually going to be, um, I'm not too big on many of the haunted house ones myself.
7846000	7849000	I'm going to be playing Five Nights at Freddy's soon.
7849000	7853000	Wait, so we're talking about what game should become a haunted house?
7853000	7855000	Like the Silent Hill thing?
7855000	7856000	Like the Silent Hill thing?
7856000	7857000	Okay, okay.
7857000	7858000	I just want to make sure I understood the question.
7858000	7861000	Well, they did one just recently, I think this year, for The Evil Within.
7861000	7862000	So they did one for that.
7862000	7864000	It's like a promo thing.
7864000	7865000	Makes sense.
7865000	7869000	Um, they may have done one in the past for Resident Evil, I guess.
7869000	7870000	I can see that.
7870000	7873000	That would make a really good one.
7873000	7875000	Thief, Deadly Shadows, The Cradle.
7875000	7876000	That's my vote.
7876000	7882000	No, seriously though, if you haven't played anything in the game, that's one of the scariest levels I've ever played in the game, ever.
7882000	7883000	The Cradle.
7883000	7886000	And then one day I played it, and no one was at home.
7886000	7888000	The dark was raining.
7888000	7890000	And my friend came home and was like, are you okay?
7890000	7891000	Yes.
7891000	7892000	I was playing The Cradle of the Dark.
7892000	7894000	I was like, I told you not to do that.
7894000	7897000	You know what would be cool though, is if they took the PT.
7898000	7904000	And then did that sort of like, a whole house like that and have monitors on the various levels.
7904000	7906000	You have to track the ghost.
7906000	7915000	Or they just do the Silent Hills trailer and just recreate that like, fuck, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
7915000	7918000	I'm gonna go with what was already said, Five Nights at Freddy's.
7918000	7919000	Come on.
7919000	7921000	That is, somebody's got a nightmare.
7921000	7924000	That is a movie franchise waiting to happen.
7924000	7926000	That's all of my childhood nightmares.
7926000	7927000	That guy's gonna make some bank.
7927000	7928000	That guy's gonna make bank.
7928000	7933000	It's not gonna be like Minecraft Bank, but it's gonna be like the next big anything.
7933000	7934000	Let me put it this way.
7934000	7938000	There's so many cult horror movies out there nowadays, somebody's gonna license it.
7938000	7940000	They've run out of ideas.
7940000	7942000	They made a goddamn Ouija movie.
7942000	7945000	Yeah, they did one of those before it was called The Exorcist.
7945000	7947000	They did one before that, it was called Witch Board.
7947000	7948000	They're attorneys writing up the agreement.
7948000	7950000	Actually, The Exorcist came out before Witch Board.
7950000	7951000	This is a great case, by the way.
7951000	7954000	Actually, you have a Ouija board case for, what is that?
7954000	7955000	My Ouija wallet.
7955000	7957000	Oh, your Ouija wallet?
7957000	7964000	So she can be thrifty and contact the dead.
7964000	7966000	Should I buy that bag?
7966000	7973000	Y-E-S-S-A-L-E question mark.
7973000	7978000	Maybe I can find a spirit with better credit than me.
7978000	7980000	Are you Steve Jobs?
7980000	7983000	N-O-J-K.
7983000	7985000	How about Yaris?
7985000	7986000	Mommy needs an ointment.
7986000	7989000	Yaris, only the remake would be scary.
7989000	7991000	I'm just kidding.
7991000	7993000	Alright, we've thrown ideas out there.
7993000	7994000	Next email.
7994000	7995000	Hello, LR.
7995000	7996000	Oh, oh, sorry.
7996000	7997000	Chat, chatter.
7997000	7998000	What?
7998000	7999000	Alan alchemy.
7999000	8000000	Amnesia.
8000000	8001000	Nope.
8001000	8002000	Nope.
8002000	8003000	Nope.
8003000	8006000	My favorite let's play of that game is where the guy starts the game and in 15 seconds,
8006000	8010000	something starts coming down the hall and he goes, nope, nope, and he turns it off.
8010000	8011000	What was that?
8011000	8015000	That's the other one that they have, the other survival game that's on PlayStation 4
8015000	8016000	or whatever.
8016000	8020000	Oh, with the old penis that's in it.
8020000	8022000	Yes, old penis.
8022000	8023000	Outlast?
8023000	8024000	Outlast, yeah.
8024000	8027000	I like being on the outside of this conversation.
8027000	8029000	Where Rob's just jerking off some air.
8029000	8032000	Marissa, that old penis, you know what I'm talking about?
8032000	8034000	Hello, LR.
8034000	8035000	Oh, hi.
8035000	8038000	I just wanted to say thank you for the really nice retrospective.
8038000	8040000	And reminisce, that was episode 573.
8040000	8043000	Do you ever still go to that parking lot diner?
8043000	8044000	No.
8044000	8045000	Not that one.
8045000	8046000	Not that one.
8046000	8047000	Not that one.
8047000	8048000	But other ones in the franchise.
8048000	8049000	Yes.
8049000	8051000	There's more often the one in Rancho.
8051000	8052000	Yeah.
8052000	8053000	In the Cho.
8053000	8054000	Me too.
8054000	8055000	In the Cho.
8055000	8056000	That's what Dan calls it.
8056000	8061000	I'm not even from here and I know that you all call it Rancho Cambodia.
8061000	8063000	Margaret Rancho Cordova.
8063000	8069000	No, from the days of working at the Funko Lantern GameStop turned Radio Shack, they
8069000	8070000	called it the Cho.
8070000	8071000	Got it.
8071000	8076000	Anyway, it reminded me of many a day spent waiting in coin lines to play DDR Max 2 and
8076000	8077000	then Extreme.
8077000	8081000	All of us slowly working our way through DDR's content while actually forming meaningful
8081000	8083000	relationships and groups.
8083000	8089000	I would have to say that my favorite old school DDR license was so deep from DDR Max.
8089000	8090000	So deep.
8090000	8094000	With my runner up being every other license from DDR Max.
8094000	8097000	Well, my favorite non-license was definitely Insertion from Fifth Mix.
8099000	8100000	You also said insertion.
8100000	8101000	Insertion.
8101000	8103000	I'm just saying, if we're going for every possible euphemism.
8103000	8107000	There was a song in DDR called Insertion and it even had this, if you listen very carefully,
8107000	8109000	there's a point where it goes, ah.
8109000	8111000	Like, it's part of the song.
8111000	8112000	Herders.
8112000	8114000	And I go, was that the insertion?
8114000	8115000	I don't know.
8115000	8116000	Anyway.
8116000	8119000	I personally still play In the Groove 2 at least one to two times a week as my only exercise
8119000	8124000	and folks in the community are still creating new charts all over the difficulty scale.
8124000	8126000	Times definitely have changed, even on weekends.
8126000	8130000	I generally don't have to wait in line and I'm usually the only person on the machine
8130000	8133000	at the overpriced, under-populated local stomping ground.
8133000	8135000	But hey, at least I still have one.
8136000	8142000	Strangely enough, in a, I'm going to mispronounce this, Nanuet, New York, close to the semi-famous
8142000	8147000	and fairly enormous Palisades Center Mall, a New Yorkade is opening on Saturday, November
8147000	8152000	15th, called Nanuet Arcade, which will feature stepping games, among other things.
8152000	8153000	Will it have Spider Stomp?
8153000	8155000	It's not complete without Spider Stomp.
8155000	8159000	I hope the owner has gobs of money and isn't afraid to lose them, but I digress.
8159000	8161000	I did want to remind folks of something.
8161000	8165000	For many of us lucky enough to be located in several pockets around the US, Bimani is
8165000	8167000	still very much alive and well.
8167000	8171000	Thanks to both the ingenuity of the community and Konami's indifference, it is possible
8171000	8177000	to play current or recent versions of Bimani titles, such as DDR 2014, 2DX22 Pendual,
8177000	8183000	Pop Up Music's Sunny Park, and more, plus to utilize the network features of the games
8183000	8188000	using actual Konami EMU cards, which I have one, purchasable either online or at the same
8188000	8190000	arcades that have the games.
8190000	8193000	I got mine at Classic Gaming Expo a couple weeks ago.
8193000	8194000	I mean, years ago.
8194000	8196000	I want to say weeks.
8196000	8199000	Some locations include Game Underground in the Boston area, a new Chinatown fair in New
8199000	8205000	York City, 8 on the Break in, I'm going to mispronounce this too, Dunellen, New Jersey,
8205000	8209000	Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas, Press Start in Las Vegas in Super Arcade, as well as several
8209000	8211000	Goughland locations in California.
8211000	8216000	The new Nanowet Arcade I mentioned earlier will also be joining this list when it opens.
8216000	8220000	Further, a few of these locations still host yearly tournaments, such as Champions of the
8220000	8226000	Coast at 8 on the Break, and Best of the West at Sunnyvale Goughland, both of which feature
8227000	8231000	simultaneous competitions on almost every music game they have, and there are many.
8231000	8237000	I just wanted to throw out there that I believe it would be truly awesome for OLR to record
8237000	8241000	a segment at Best of the West next year, which will likely be in August 2015.
8241000	8246000	So yes, in closing, I just wanted to say that not all of us are done with music gaming.
8246000	8250000	I would go so far as to say I still spend about as much time playing music games as
8250000	8252000	I do everything else, and that's unlikely to change.
8252000	8253000	We drink Ritalin.
8253000	8254000	Aaron, why YR?
8283000	8285000	But I am still a huge fan of music games.
8285000	8290000	I mean, maybe I don't obsess about Bomani so much, but any time Konami releases a game
8290000	8295000	on iOS, I check it out, even though I know I'm gonna be like, hmm, whatever.
8295000	8298000	But I love music games still.
8298000	8302000	All they have to do is release anything as an actual retail release, and I'd buy it.
8302000	8308000	I just bought Hatsune Miku not that long ago on PlayStation 3 because it was on sale, and
8308000	8309000	I really wanted to check it out.
8309000	8312000	It's a great Dreamcast game for my PS3.
8313000	8316000	There's still lots of music games today I really do enjoy, so I just want to make sure
8316000	8318000	that's a genre I'm always gonna love.
8318000	8321000	And I wish they would make a new rock band, dammit!
8322000	8324000	Even Marisa's nodding her head over there.
8324000	8329000	I have all my instruments in my garage.
8329000	8332000	I'm for that too, and I liked the latest Rocksmith.
8332000	8335000	I mean, that's with an instrument, but I love Oasis.
8335000	8338000	My friends are teasing me like, you know how to play the songs for real?
8338000	8339000	I'm like, yeah!
8339000	8342000	Maybe I should go to Guitar Center and pick up a guitar.
8342000	8343000	Guitar, yeah.
8344000	8346000	I was like, but I can play it in a game!
8346000	8349000	This next email I sort of thought about whether or not to read it.
8349000	8351000	Rob, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
8351000	8353000	No, because I thought those were the only two emails we had.
8353000	8355000	Oh, that's right. We had two more.
8355000	8357000	One of them is, I will go ahead and just put this out.
8357000	8358000	Sure.
8358000	8363000	We have a listener who, just to rephrase this,
8363000	8368000	has a Wii U that is having trouble reading disc and he created a GoFundMe.
8368000	8370000	And asks the community for assistance.
8374000	8381000	Yeah, I'm of two minds about it because there are some of us who are,
8381000	8385000	you know, we go out and buy our own things when they're broken.
8385000	8386000	Right.
8386000	8387000	But some people may not be able to afford it.
8387000	8388000	Yeah.
8388000	8389000	I don't know if you're in that situation.
8389000	8390000	Buy a replacement disc drive.
8391000	8396000	You know what, I'm going to say, because we haven't had this situation before,
8396000	8400000	I'm going to read this one, but let's not open the floodgates to more of these.
8400000	8401000	Absolutely not.
8401000	8403000	But since this guy thought of it first, go ahead and read it
8403000	8405000	and I'll let everybody make their own decision,
8405000	8407000	because he'll have the pitch on the GoFundMe page.
8407000	8408000	Okay.
8408000	8409000	Go ahead.
8409000	8411000	Basically saying, over the next few months,
8411000	8414000	my Wii U has occasionally had trouble reading discs.
8414000	8415000	Now I won't read them at all.
8415000	8418000	I tried Nintendo's lens cleaning kit as well as several home remedies,
8418000	8419000	but nothing worked.
8419000	8422000	When I called customer service, they told me the disc drive would have to be replaced,
8422000	8426000	which would cost about $150 including shipping, which I can't afford.
8426000	8431000	So with several other upcoming non-gaming expenses,
8431000	8434000	I thought I would have a go without a Wii U for the foreseeable future,
8434000	8436000	but a friend suggested I try crowdfunding.
8436000	8439000	What better place to start, I thought, than the OLR community.
8439000	8443000	So I will go ahead and give you a plug on this one.
8443000	8445000	You will probably be the one and only that we do this for.
8445000	8446000	Mm-hmm.
8446000	8453000	But it's GoFundMe.com slash H1065K.
8453000	8457000	And then ended saying, thank you in advance for your time and kindness,
8457000	8460000	and thanks especially to you, Dark Soccer Sky and Loki,
8460000	8464000	for informing and entertaining me for most of the past decade.
8464000	8466000	Sincerely, Justin Masterclaw.
8466000	8470000	P.S. If my goal is met within the week, I might be able to give back to the community somehow.
8470000	8473000	At least I've heard this name before, so it's somebody that, you know,
8473000	8475000	I know has posted on Facebook a lot and so forth.
8475000	8478000	And I just want to say, I don't want, like, I don't want this guy to think,
8478000	8481000	like, God, what jerks they're being, like, I'm trying to do, like, a thing.
8481000	8484000	You know, it's just like, unfortunately, we've been around a very long time,
8484000	8489000	and we've seen a lot of, like, dark things, so we have to question everything.
8489000	8492000	That's just part of, sadly, what we have to do.
8492000	8496000	Like, I'm going to tell you guys, I don't want to get into all the details yet,
8496000	8499000	because I don't, I haven't been able to put it all together,
8499000	8503000	but something happened with Hoard House this week that we didn't really talk about on air,
8503000	8505000	and I'm not going to get into it so much,
8505000	8508000	but, like, it really was something where I was, like,
8508000	8511000	I kind of got an email that was a little bit of a mindfuck in a way,
8511000	8513000	and I'm worried it might have been a catfish thing,
8513000	8517000	and I feel really bad, like, going to that negative place,
8517000	8521000	but something didn't connect in my head, and so I had to do a little research,
8521000	8524000	and there was some things that didn't line up.
8524000	8525000	Yeah.
8525000	8529000	But it was a very, like, serious kind of email, and I was just like, yeah.
8529000	8533000	Yeah, so anyway, I just want to say, like, unfortunately, yes,
8533000	8536000	even little old podcasts that very few people listen to like us,
8536000	8541000	sometimes, you know, we've had some not-so-great things happen,
8541000	8542000	so anyway, sorry, I don't want to-
8542000	8544000	It's a universal rainbow of trolling, huh?
8544000	8546000	Yeah, well, yeah, but again, I don't want to make this guy,
8546000	8549000	like, I'm sure this guy is well-intentioned, I hate to-
8549000	8550000	Oh, yeah, I didn't mean that about him.
8550000	8553000	See, I'm more inclined, since I remember the name,
8553000	8558000	and he's been around since 2004, listening to us blab about shit all week.
8558000	8559000	Right.
8559000	8560000	I was inclined to give him benefit of a doubt.
8560000	8561000	That's fair, that's fair.
8561000	8564000	And, you know, it's up to our listeners whether or not they want to be kind.
8564000	8567000	Just keep in mind, and that's always going to be a thing when it comes to money,
8567000	8571000	and we here at OLR, we haven't asked for your money, like, besides charity things,
8571000	8574000	you know, we might have said donate to the MS Foundation or, you know,
8574000	8576000	things that we've done charity drives for in the past,
8576000	8579000	but, you know, we don't usually ask for money, so we,
8579000	8582000	when other people ask for money, we have to really question that.
8582000	8586000	And if we support a charity, we are going to research the fuck out of them.
8586000	8587000	Yeah.
8587000	8589000	Because we're not going to have, like, a Komen walk.
8589000	8590000	Because fuck them.
8590000	8593000	We did just have guests, we had, like, three weeks' worth of guests
8593000	8594000	that were talking about Kickstarters.
8594000	8595000	Yeah.
8595000	8596000	So, it's fair.
8596000	8597000	Fair is fair.
8597000	8598000	This is last email.
8598000	8602000	Hi, OLR, and the ever-lovely Marissa.
8602000	8603000	You got a fan.
8603000	8604000	Aww.
8604000	8605000	Watch this.
8605000	8607000	They're all going to be like, this is the best person ever,
8607000	8609000	the next line, something critical.
8609000	8610000	Shit.
8610000	8612000	That'd be a great way to open, you know, a good...
8612000	8614000	It's your friendly neighborhood rage-nator.
8614000	8615000	Aww.
8615000	8618000	I just thought I'd throw out a random topic to discuss tonight.
8618000	8619000	Arcades.
8619000	8620000	That's random.
8620000	8623000	At one point or another, you have professed your love of arcades
8623000	8628000	and how playing music game at the arcades has led to the creation of OLR.
8628000	8630000	That being said, I'd like to pose these questions.
8630000	8632000	Do you remember your first visit to an arcade?
8632000	8633000	What did you play?
8633000	8634000	Please elaborate.
8634000	8636000	I can tell you.
8636000	8640000	I mean, I've been in arcades since I was probably an infant.
8640000	8641000	Yeah.
8641000	8644000	I remember our Aladdin's castle.
8644000	8647000	And this one had been there since, like, the 70s.
8647000	8651000	It was the same one I went to when my brother Matthew was six
8651000	8652000	and got hit by a car.
8652000	8653000	Oh, my gosh.
8653000	8655000	And nearly died.
8655000	8656000	They had carpet on the walls.
8656000	8658000	That's how old it was.
8658000	8660000	It was like going to the freaking roller rink.
8660000	8662000	It had carpet on the walls.
8662000	8666000	And I remember going there and beating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade
8666000	8668000	at that arcade.
8668000	8672000	That was when they shut off the power right when we had beaten the game.
8672000	8675000	You know, I remember going to play pinball when I was a kid.
8675000	8679000	I remember having to stand on a crate to play kangaroo.
8679000	8681000	So I remember Pong.
8681000	8686000	I remember the sit-down Pong tables because you did have that weird burnout in them, remember?
8686000	8695000	And I remember, you know, even sometimes going to the bar with relatives
8695000	8701000	and sitting down at the table to play Pac-Man, you know, is craziness.
8701000	8704000	But, yeah, I've got very strong memories.
8704000	8707000	Okay, the first movie my mom ever took me to was Star Wars.
8707000	8711000	My dad took her to see Exorcist 3 as a romantic date.
8711000	8718000	So, yeah, I've been in arcades and fun places since I was very young.
8718000	8721000	My first arcade memory that I can remember.
8721000	8723000	I mean, I'm sure I was taken to an arcade before that,
8723000	8727000	but my first memory that I vividly remember was I was probably about four or five years old.
8727000	8729000	I think I was about five years old.
8729000	8731000	And it was something to do with my sister's wedding.
8731000	8737000	It wasn't the reception, obviously, but I think it was like the rehearsal celebration post-dinner or something.
8737000	8739000	It was at Chuck E. Cheese.
8739000	8745000	And I remember that I had to stand on a box because that's what they used to have for kids.
8745000	8749000	They'd have like a big wooden box that you'd stand on so you could reach the controls and see the screen.
8749000	8753000	And I was playing Crystal Castles with the trackball.
8753000	8758000	Remember the little dude that goes around and gets all the gems and, you know, when you get hit by something?
8758000	8760000	Oh, no, Di.
8760000	8765000	That was my earliest arcade memory was Crystal Castles.
8765000	8768000	It was a little bear.
8768000	8770000	I did that for Classic Game.
8770000	8771000	Bentley Bear.
8771000	8772000	I did that for Classic Game.
8772000	8773000	You have done that for Classic Game.
8773000	8776000	And the 2600 version, I remember playing that a couple years later going,
8776000	8780000	It doesn't look a damn thing like the arcade version.
8780000	8783000	Anyway, Loki, do you have an earliest arcade memory?
8783000	8785000	God, I don't remember.
8785000	8789000	I know I played Chuck E. Cheese a bunch of times, but I don't remember the first arcade I went to.
8789000	8791000	Because this was back in the 80s.
8791000	8792000	There was arcades everywhere.
8792000	8796000	So, probably at Chuck E. Cheese, but I don't remember.
8796000	8800000	It could have been at Golf Land because I did live in San Jose down there.
8800000	8805000	So, I went to Milpenas Golf Land before they had all the cool stuff.
8805000	8806000	That was the DDR capital.
8806000	8807000	Yeah, before all that.
8807000	8812000	And I had Sundayville Golf Land too a bunch of times because it was right near my grandparents house.
8812000	8815000	But it is one of those.
8815000	8817000	I don't remember, which was the very first.
8817000	8819000	But I played a lot back then.
8819000	8822000	This is also in Alabama for me.
8822000	8826000	So, that we had arcades actually was pretty cool.
8826000	8828000	Other than going to Godfathers or Showbiz.
8828000	8830000	I'm sad that there's not arcades in malls anymore.
8830000	8832000	Tilt. Remember Tilt?
8832000	8834000	Tilt was purchased by Namco.
8834000	8835000	Tilt.
8835000	8838000	They have an arcade at the Roseville Galleria.
8838000	8841000	But it is seriously nothing but ticket redemption machines.
8841000	8846000	And I think they have that one Konami shooter game that every frickin' place has.
8846000	8849000	They do have Derby Owners Club, don't they still?
8849000	8850000	Do you think Dave & Busters?
8850000	8852000	That was it. Dave & Busters had Derby.
8852000	8855000	I think this place is called Fun Factory or something like that.
8855000	8857000	Yeah, it's right there by the carousel.
8857000	8858000	Yeah, exactly.
8858000	8862000	What was the other one that I was trying to think of?
8862000	8867000	Oh, Dan, when he was out on his route to Adventures at Work, sent me a picture of a cyber station.
8867000	8868000	Nice.
8868000	8869000	There was still one open.
8869000	8871000	Marissa, do you have an early arcade memory that you remember?
8871000	8873000	Definitely Chuck E. Cheese.
8873000	8876000	I can't remember the game in particular.
8876000	8886000	At a young age, with the exception of going to Chuck E. Cheese, they were always really cheap with the coins.
8886000	8890000	But I remember spending many of my teenage years playing Crazy Taxi in the mall.
8890000	8895000	And we had a Marvel vs. Capcom game at the college that's still there, actually.
8895000	8898000	Wow. Crazy Taxi was so much fun, though.
8898000	8901000	It wasn't. Everybody knocks it. That shit is fun.
8901000	8904000	We love Crazy Taxi when we go all out.
8904000	8906000	We want to make some crazy money.
8906000	8909000	That's a fun game. That's one of the most fun driving games to this day.
8909000	8911000	And everyone says that's what happens.
8911000	8912000	We used to go to...
8912000	8913000	Take me to the Pizza Hut.
8914000	8919000	When I was in elementary school, or even junior high and stuff, we used to go to...
8919000	8924000	They usually have an arcade game in a random restaurant.
8924000	8928000	We used to go to Rico's Pizza, and they used to have a bunch of arcade games there.
8928000	8930000	Rico still has a decent supply of arcade games.
8930000	8934000	And Rico's with the big party pizza. It's like 30-inch-long slices.
8934000	8936000	They still make that.
8936000	8940000	I haven't been there in years. They used to have them all over, and now there's one.
8941000	8944000	And it's the same... I think it was the original one, still. The one on North Gate.
8944000	8945000	Is that where it is? North Gate.
8945000	8946000	Yeah.
8946000	8950000	The one that was in Antioch.
8950000	8957000	We used to go to a diner-type place, and they had Captain Commando.
8957000	8963000	We'd go play that, or go down to 7-Eleven, and they'd have one arcade machine that they'd change out.
8963000	8965000	Usually it was Street Fighter.
8965000	8968000	Lots of fun stuff.
8968000	8971000	It'd be fun just to go to different convenience stores and be like,
8971000	8974000	Oh, they have an arcade game here! What's that?
8974000	8978000	Oh, it's Street Fighter. Or whatever other games they have.
8978000	8986000	Hey, adult men over 18, for an interesting gaming experience, go to your local Chuck E. Cheese. By yourself.
8986000	8988000	I don't think they let people in.
8988000	8990000	No, they don't.
8990000	8992000	You're creepy. Get out of here.
8992000	8995000	At my local one, me and Chris could go and play Skee-Ball.
8995000	9000000	Except when I lived in Chico. Chico is a big college town, and college rules that town, right?
9000000	9004000	We used to go to Chuck E. Cheese as a group of college kids, but I think that's different. They expect that.
9004000	9006000	I had my graduation party at Chuck E. Cheese.
9006000	9007000	Did you really?
9007000	9009000	Yeah, one of my graduation parties.
9009000	9014000	The only plus about Chuck E. Cheese nowadays? Everything's one token. Every single game is one token. That's awesome.
9014000	9020000	Now one other arcade memory I just want to throw out there is playing, I think it was Star Wars Arcade at Shakey's Pizza.
9020000	9021000	Oh.
9022000	9026000	Remember Shakey's Pizza? I think they still have a Shakey's Pizza in Oroville or some shit.
9026000	9030000	Why on earth would I go up there, but there's a Shakey's Pizza.
9030000	9035000	We still have some down south, and they're still with the old colored glass, you know, ye olde pizza parlor stuff.
9035000	9042000	When Dan and I were newly together, we used to go to Crestview Lanes, which makes me sad every time I drive by it,
9042000	9047000	because it's been closed and now all the homeless people live in there, which I'm glad they have a roof over their heads.
9047000	9055000	But that was like where we would go play Air Guys on arcade and Blazing Star and just some of the coolest games that we didn't see anywhere else.
9055000	9059000	Some of our chatters joining in answering this question over at live.vognetwork.com.
9059000	9064000	SSU100Matt says, Sport Time USA was probably the first stand-alone arcade I went to.
9064000	9069000	It's actually featured in the Anamanaguchi Meow music video. That's fun.
9069000	9070000	Was that it for emails or one more?
9070000	9071000	No, there's more to this one.
9071000	9072000	Wow, okay.
9072000	9077000	As for me, my first arcade visit was to Showbiz Pizza Place in Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo,
9077000	9083000	in the fall of 1983 as a reward for doing well as I did my elementary school fundraiser.
9083000	9085000	Side note, I came in second place at the school.
9085000	9090000	When I first stepped inside and looked around, my jaw hit the floor and I thought I had died and gone to gamer heaven.
9090000	9099000	Aside from eating pizza and watching the animatronic band, I ended up playing stuff like Skee-Ball, Popeye, Gauntlet, Mario Brothers, and a whole host of other games.
9099000	9102000	It's because of that place that I love pizza, gaming, and associate with each other.
9102000	9107000	Oh my god, Popeye. I played the shit out of that on Commodore 64. It was so good.
9107000	9111000	You know what actually I always will associate forever with Chuck E. Cheese's?
9111000	9113000	Pole position. Sit-down pole position.
9113000	9115000	Yes.
9115000	9117000	Always a sit-down pole position.
9117000	9120000	Like early voice acting in video games.
9120000	9123000	Get ready for Link in the Road.
9124000	9131000	And the first showbiz that I ever went to was, it was in Mobile, like the whole shopping center since gone since then.
9131000	9136000	But they had this room that you'd walk into on the way to the bathroom that had light-up walls, and it was like the seizure room.
9136000	9138000	And it was right by the speaker.
9138000	9141000	Yes, they had like an amazing stroby seizure room.
9141000	9145000	And it was on the way to the bathroom so you could not, and they had the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.
9145000	9151000	We could do this topic all fucking night because like I could talk about at Roller King out in Roseville when they had a Spy Hunter machine,
9151000	9155000	and I used to play that with skates on, and that's probably why that pedal broke after six months.
9155000	9157000	But my god, we'll be here all night.
9157000	9159000	I could only play frog-grown roller skates.
9159000	9162000	We could do a whole podcast about retro arcade memories, but anyway.
9162000	9164000	Thank you, Raginator.
9164000	9165000	Alright, was that it?
9165000	9166000	Yeah.
9166000	9168000	Alright, you too can email us.
9168000	9171000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.
9171000	9174000	And Dark Soccer will consider reading them next week.
9174000	9180000	But I'm just going to say, if we go another week and don't get a single email, we will play music from Star Wars Connect.
9180000	9186000	So I want one damn email this week. One damn email or you get Star Wars Connect music during the break next week, I'm just saying.
9186000	9190000	And it's not just any Star Wars Connect music. It's the dance mode Star Wars Connect.
9190000	9194000	I will play I Am Han Solo or whatever that song is. It's so awful.
9194000	9195000	Alright.
9195000	9199000	We should do the Kim Kardashian game music with her speaking over it.
9199000	9205000	I think I'd rather have you as Kim Kardashian speaking over it.
9205000	9211000	This is what you get, you guys. And you don't love me enough. Is that I'm just going to play this music for you.
9211000	9217000	Anyway, let's get back into some news. We're going to open up the phone lines here in a little bit.
9217000	9222000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTrader. But a few more stories for you first.
9222000	9227000	Yes. This is exciting. And I actually didn't see this right away when it came out.
9227000	9229000	They had a brand new trailer, of course.
9229000	9234000	We knew that they were teasing a first person mode for Grand Theft Auto 5, which is, you know,
9234000	9238000	Grand Theft Auto's been traditionally third person action game.
9238000	9248000	But now they have a brand new first person mode that's completely customizable that will be in the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game.
9248000	9254000	And what's kind of cool about it is, you know, literally everything has been tweaked for first person.
9254000	9260000	So it plays, you know, like a Call of Duty or something like that. You can limit it to, you know, I only want first person in driving.
9260000	9265000	And you can do that. Or I only want first person in, you know, the non-driving stuff.
9265000	9271000	I want it, you know, in third person in driving. Or I want to tweak whatever, depth of field, whatever you want to do.
9271000	9280000	It's completely customizable. And they're even going to have, I believe, for Grand Theft Auto Online, modes where it's only players that are playing in first person.
9280000	9292000	And I believe, if I remember correctly, it's toggleable, like, while you're playing the game. I think it's just tapping the L stick or something like that to go between the modes.
9292000	9300000	So that's pretty cool because actually first person, for me, usually would be beneficial, especially when you're chasing people down in cars.
9300000	9307000	It's kind of hard sometimes to shoot people out of the front of the car, you know, in third person.
9307000	9313000	But I think first person, you'd be a little bit more accurate, get headshots and stuff like that, you know, in the car.
9313000	9319000	I can't wait for the first person shooter footage to be splashed all over CNN the next time there's a violent act that's blamed on video games.
9319000	9322000	Because you know what's going to happen.
9322000	9327000	The first person, you know, stripper mode or strip club, you know, all that fun stuff.
9327000	9335000	But yeah, it looks pretty cool. So that'll be on the 18th. Not too far away.
9335000	9337000	How ready are you for this, Loki?
9337000	9342000	I am extremely ready. I wish I could take time off, but unfortunately starting a new job can't do that.
9342000	9346000	But I will have the game preloaded and I'll be playing it that night.
9346000	9349000	That, you know, probably on the-
9349000	9351000	You're training for a few weeks, right?
9351000	9354000	You have a red bull. You can get a red bull to keep you awake for a little bit. I'm just kidding.
9354000	9356000	Oh, I can stay up just fine. Yeah.
9356000	9362000	I know a lot of you are looking forward to the Oculus Rift.
9362000	9365000	If you haven't tried this, you know, we've talked about the Oculus on the show before.
9365000	9368000	It's one of those things where like when you hear about it, you're like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9368000	9371000	But then when you actually try it, you're like, okay, I'm a believer.
9371000	9376000	Like, you know, virtual reality has come a long way from the days of the virtual boy
9376000	9380000	and hard driving in the speaking of old arcade games.
9380000	9383000	Virtual reality has come a long way. The Oculus is pretty awesome.
9383000	9386000	Try it at a convention near you sometime.
9386000	9390000	Or, soon, the first consumer Oculus headset.
9390000	9392000	They are saying this is months away.
9392000	9402000	This was a comment that Oculus VR CEO Brendan Eribe said at a web summit in Dublin 2014.
9402000	9405000	We're all hungry for it to happen. We're getting very close.
9405000	9408000	It's months, not years away, but many months.
9408000	9413000	So, like, probably- I would say that makes me think summer, fall next year.
9413000	9414000	That was my thought.
9414000	9420000	They're saying that the biggest issue right now is that an input system, a proper input system is tough.
9420000	9423000	Standard keyboards, mice, and game pads really aren't working.
9423000	9426000	Gesture control is still a little bit primitive.
9426000	9429000	I don't know. I've played games under all those things and it's worked fine.
9429000	9432000	But I see why they need to establish their standard or whatever.
9432000	9434000	So, there you go.
9434000	9438000	Oculus Rift coming sooner rather than later.
9438000	9443000	And I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will be picking one up if nothing else.
9443000	9445000	And hopefully bringing his to the next DragonCon.
9445000	9450000	Honestly, now that I have a PlayStation 4, I'm pretty excited about when Project Morpheus comes out.
9450000	9458000	Because for the Oculus Rift right now, I'm not positive that my laptop would be able to run it well.
9458000	9463000	Whereas Project Morpheus, you know, that's its own box.
9463000	9468000	I really think- I don't necessarily think we'll get a full game announcement for Morpheus.
9468000	9472000	But I really think with this PlayStation event really coming out of nowhere that they're doing in December in Vegas,
9472000	9475000	I really think they're going to let more people experience Morpheus.
9475000	9479000	And I think that's going to cut- you know, because nobody's really talked about it since E3.
9479000	9484000	But I think it's going to kind of be back on everybody's- on the tip of everybody's tongue come this December event.
9484000	9488000	And I don't know if they'll announce- maybe they will announce a game. Who knows?
9488000	9491000	I think it's too soon maybe to announce when it's coming out.
9491000	9493000	But that maybe is the next E3.
9493000	9497000	But it'll be interesting to see how Morpheus has kind of evolved in the past six months.
9497000	9498000	Definitely.
9498000	9500000	We haven't really seen it since E3.
9500000	9505000	So. But again, I was fortunate enough and very lucky to get to try it at E3.
9505000	9509000	And I was really impressed. Really impressed.
9509000	9511000	And yeah. So.
9511000	9513000	DarkSakura.
9513000	9516000	It'd be nice if it loaded.
9516000	9521000	Okay. So there is a new trademark in Japan and Europe by Square Enix.
9521000	9524000	Called Brave Exvius.
9524000	9526000	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
9526000	9531000	The application was submitted on November 7th and on September 26th in Japan.
9531000	9534000	There is not a lot of information about it.
9534000	9543000	It just says- just the information that came from Kabushiki Kaisha Square Enix.
9543000	9546000	So that's about it.
9546000	9555000	However, there is- it may possibly be related to Mavius Final Fantasy trademark that was filed last month.
9555000	9557000	So. Could be.
9557000	9561000	I wonder if it isn't some iOS game, though.
9561000	9564000	Because they have a few of those free-to-play games.
9564000	9567000	Square Enix has a whole little branch of the company that's kind of doing that stuff.
9567000	9572000	And a lot- some of them are kind of rooted in Final Fantasy-esque sort of universes.
9572000	9575000	So. Be curious.
9575000	9578000	It'd be cool if it was a new Brave Fencer Musashi.
9578000	9581000	That might be a stretch. But we'll see. We'll see.
9581000	9584000	Alright, well, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.
9584000	9588000	Because here at Orange Launch Radio, sometimes, you know, believe it or not, we get upset.
9588000	9590000	Like, we get really upset.
9590000	9596000	And so we vent to you, the listener, as we have every week since the very beginning in a segment we call
9596000	9598000	The Caffeine of the Week.
9598000	9614000	F you to having a sore throat off and on.
9614000	9620000	Given that I work a ten hour shift at Locat.
9620000	9622000	You know.
9622000	9625000	I come home unable to talk.
9626000	9629000	And I mean, I love what I do. I love where I work.
9629000	9631000	I love everything about my job.
9631000	9633000	Except the sore throat.
9633000	9636000	And it's just- it feels like a-
9636000	9641000	Okay, this is really gross. It just feels like a constant pile of mucus in the back of my neck.
9641000	9644000	But my ear's feeling better. So that's good.
9644000	9646000	I think it's just something you'll get conditioned to after time.
9646000	9650000	Well, I've been there almost a year. I would hope I'd have been conditioned now, except that-
9650000	9651000	Yeah?
9651000	9653000	Wow, time flies.
9653000	9655000	Let's see, Loki, you have an F you of the week?
9655000	9663000	Yes, F you to the local teriyaki joint that's opposite of the devil named Nippon Teriyaki Bowl.
9663000	9664000	I love that place!
9664000	9665000	I do too!
9665000	9670000	What I don't love is their non-posted hours and their fucking odd-ass open times.
9670000	9677000	Because they used to be open from sometime in the morning that I wasn't there to 8 PM during the week.
9677000	9682000	And, you know, open to 3 on Saturday and closed Sunday, which I'm still mad that they're closed Sunday, but whatever.
9682000	9686000	Now, so I'm like, okay, well I don't know what their fucking hours are.
9686000	9688000	I looked it up on the internet, it says 5.30 is when they close it.
9688000	9690000	My sweet, cool, I'm gonna go pick up dinner.
9690000	9691000	They're fucking closed.
9691000	9694000	So, I don't know when the fuck they're open anymore.
9694000	9696000	And I look on the door, there's no fucking hours.
9696000	9699000	So it's like whenever the hell they feel like being open is when they're open.
9699000	9703000	And so, it kinda pisses me off because they're so good.
9703000	9705000	And I want it not just for lunch.
9705000	9708000	I want to go there for lunch and maybe dinner too.
9709000	9713000	Bring some of that home. But I can't because you're fucking closed.
9713000	9719000	You would think I'd give an F.U. that's related to the trip I just took, but everything really went rather well.
9719000	9721000	I can't really complain about a whole lot.
9721000	9723000	Like, I'm really trying to think of something to complain about.
9723000	9726000	I would say F.U. to P.F. Chang's, because it made me a little bit sick.
9726000	9728000	Like, what was I thinking eating there?
9728000	9730000	What was I thinking?
9730000	9732000	I want Chinese food that doesn't taste like Chinese food.
9732000	9735000	I want really whitewashed Chinese food.
9735000	9737000	Like, I want, like, what if...
9737000	9739000	They do have decent dim sum.
9739000	9745000	No, here's the thing. I was going out and meeting Dr. Ken from Starboard Power Coupling and his friend.
9745000	9747000	Their guildies all decided to go there.
9747000	9750000	Because, you know, there's only so many eating places in that safe spot.
9750000	9752000	It's all chains over there, yeah.
9752000	9756000	But I will say this. To P.F. Chang's credit, great drinks.
9756000	9758000	I had a great drink there.
9758000	9761000	By the way, I do have to clarify for the chat room.
9761000	9765000	This has only been happening within the last three weeks, the issue with my throat.
9765000	9767000	Oh, so it's not something, okay.
9767000	9770000	No, no, no. Keep in mind, I worked on the phones for seven years before that.
9770000	9773000	So, I'm conditioned. Trust me.
9773000	9776000	And if you want to give some You're Not A Doctor advice to DarkSakura,
9776000	9780000	live.vognetwork.com is where you can join our live chat.
9780000	9782000	Marissa, do you have an F.U.?
9782000	9786000	F.U. to my lack of prosperity.
9787000	9793000	To my inability to, I cannot eat as many cookies as I want and stay svelte.
9793000	9795000	These are delicious.
9795000	9800000	And F.U. to everything between L.A. and Sacramento.
9800000	9802000	The exception of the coast.
9802000	9804000	F.U. to the smell of cow poop.
9804000	9806000	It just really, really ruins that drive.
9806000	9809000	Yeah, that was a hoot.
9809000	9811000	That's why I'm glad I flew this time.
9811000	9813000	I don't get to fly to L.A. very often, but this time I got to fly.
9813000	9816000	It's an interesting flight, too, because you never reach altitude.
9816000	9820000	It's like you are now free to get back in your seat.
9820000	9822000	It really is.
9822000	9824000	We're now beginning our descent into Sacramento.
9824000	9826000	It's like 25 minutes away.
9826000	9828000	Yeah.
9828000	9829000	Anyhow.
9829000	9831000	All right. Let's get back in. Just a couple more stories.
9831000	9833000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
9833000	9835000	1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype.
9835000	9838000	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to participate with tonight's show.
9838000	9839000	Loki.
9839000	9841000	All right. So this is kind of cool.
9841000	9845000	It's a brand new game that's on Steam and Greenlight.
9845000	9847000	I guess they're trying to get approval right now.
9847000	9849000	It's called Scrap Mechanic.
9849000	9854000	And you build machines out of all sorts of parts and stuff.
9854000	9858000	I guess it's sort of like that Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.
9858000	9860000	But it's its own thing.
9860000	9865000	And so they've got some footage right now on Steam and Greenlight.
9865000	9867000	So go check that out.
9868000	9872000	There's another one I saw too that someone was working on Unity actually.
9872000	9874000	That was kind of like that.
9874000	9879000	But it was a racing game where you had a certain amount of time to build your machine.
9879000	9881000	Like 30 seconds or something like that.
9881000	9883000	And then you had to race it with whatever parts you had.
9883000	9885000	And it was really silly.
9885000	9887000	So I'd be curious to check that out too.
9887000	9889000	But Scrap Mechanic.
9889000	9890000	Sounds like your kind of game.
9890000	9893000	Yeah. It's supposed to come out sometime in 2015 it says.
9893000	9894000	All righty.
9894000	9895000	One more story for you guys.
9895000	9898000	And it's about a classic franchise called Bomberman.
9898000	9900000	Do you guys know Bomberman?
9900000	9903000	That's a fun series except that Xbox 360.
9903000	9905000	Bomberman Zero.
9905000	9907000	Oh my god. Oh my god.
9907000	9908000	So bad.
9908000	9911000	But they did a download digital title later on.
9911000	9913000	It was like Bomberman Returns or something like that.
9913000	9914000	It was cute.
9914000	9915000	It was good.
9915000	9916000	It was fun.
9916000	9919000	Well anyway, Bomberman 3DS was supposed to be a thing.
9919000	9921000	But it got cancelled.
9921000	9925000	There really hasn't been a proper Bomberman game in our lives for quite some time.
9925000	9929000	However, Bomberman is coming to smartphones.
9929000	9931000	There's not going to be a story mode in the smartphone game.
9931000	9936000	But it will be going back to the classics with competitive versus modes.
9936000	9938000	You can go against the CPU.
9938000	9941000	Or you can go into a competitive multiplayer mode.
9941000	9944000	Up to four players via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
9944000	9946000	Well that might be kind of fun.
9946000	9948000	I guess Bomberman was pretty simple controls.
9948000	9950000	So maybe it won't be so terrible on a smartphone.
9950000	9954000	But again, there's no tangible buttons on a smartphone.
9954000	9955000	Anyway.
9955000	9957000	Bomberman Colosseum will be another mode in this.
9957000	9958000	It's like a time attack mode.
9958000	9960000	You take on various CPUs.
9960000	9964000	And you can unlock boss characters by defeating them in the Bomberman Colosseum.
9964000	9967000	It is in Japan right now for Android and iOS.
9967000	9968000	And I would imagine it's a matter of time.
9968000	9969000	It's not out already.
9969000	9972000	I didn't have time to check before tonight's show.
9972000	9974000	But it's probably imminent in the US.
9974000	9976000	Unless they're doing a lot of translation.
9976000	9977000	I don't know.
9977000	9979000	Because the screenshots are very, very Japanese.
9979000	9982000	Anyhow, that does it for our news tonight.
9982000	9983000	But what do you guys think?
9983000	9985000	Do you have an opinion on tonight's news?
9985000	9986000	Or something we haven't yet discussed?
9986000	9988000	Or you just want to say hi to Marissa.
9988000	9989000	Give us a call.
9989000	9990000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9990000	9991000	Or our username on Skype.
9991000	9993000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9993000	9995000	If you'd like to give us a call.
9995000	9997000	And while we wait for some calls to come in.
9997000	10002000	Do we have any last minute stories from Loki?
10002000	10004000	There was one thing I saw.
10004000	10006000	And of course I closed the damn page.
10006000	10007000	Oh there we go.
10008000	10011000	I guess another one of these games that's out there
10011000	10018000	that's trying to hide negative reviews through DMCA takedowns.
10018000	10022000	And of course it being on Steam was at the slaughtering grounds.
10022000	10024000	So kind of look out for that.
10024000	10028000	Because it looks like a really terribly put together game.
10028000	10035000	And they're putting DMCA takedowns for any negative reviews that they have.
10035000	10036000	I heard about that.
10036000	10037000	That is so sketchy.
10037000	10038000	Like seriously.
10038000	10040000	You think the internet's not going to figure that out?
10040000	10041000	Have they not learned?
10041000	10042000	Are they brand new to the internet?
10042000	10046000	Because it hasn't worked for everybody else that's tried that.
10046000	10047000	So I don't know.
10047000	10048000	The internet.
10048000	10049000	On Wednesdays we wear pink.
10049000	10050000	Hey!
10050000	10051000	We got a phone call coming in.
10051000	10052000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10052000	10053000	Who's this?
10053000	10054000	Hey this is Akdeft.
10054000	10055000	Hey Akdeft.
10055000	10056000	How you doing?
10056000	10060000	So when are we starting our Overwatch clan or guild?
10060000	10061000	Right now.
10061000	10063000	Right now?
10063000	10065000	Well when the game comes out I suppose.
10065000	10067000	We have to wait for the game to come out.
10067000	10068000	Yeah.
10068000	10076000	I was trying pretty much all evening trying to retrieve my password from battle.net because
10076000	10078000	I didn't remember it.
10078000	10081000	And yeah I got locked out even.
10081000	10083000	I eventually got it so yeah.
10083000	10085000	Are you trying to sign up for the beta?
10085000	10086000	Yeah.
10086000	10087000	I wouldn't blame you at all.
10087000	10089000	Yeah I'm pretty excited about the game.
10090000	10097000	Even though the comparison to TF2, Team Fortress 2, is pretty much uncanny.
10097000	10098000	Uncanny.
10098000	10099000	Sorry.
10099000	10104000	But still it looks like a fun game to play.
10104000	10107000	Tell us, because you are such a fan of Team Fortress 2.
10107000	10111000	You probably play it more than any other listener that I'm super familiar with that calls in
10111000	10112000	to OLR.
10112000	10117000	What was your reaction to hearing that Blizzard's going to kind of take on this genre?
10117000	10123000	Were you like, oh god how dare they touch such a franchise that really Valve has kind
10123000	10124000	of owned.
10124000	10126000	Or were you kind of like, wow this looks like awesome.
10126000	10131000	At first I was reading about it and people were talking, oh it's a TF2.
10131000	10134000	It's TF2 with mobile elements and that.
10134000	10141000	And I was a little confused about it because I hadn't watched the video until later that
10141000	10142000	day.
10142000	10148000	And I had only watched the cinematic trailer and that looked pretty awesome.
10148000	10151000	I got pretty interested because of that.
10151000	10159000	Until that day later, or even I think the day after, I watched the gameplay trailer.
10159000	10164000	I pretty much thought it's pretty much the same as Team Fortress 2.
10164000	10171000	It's even the same modes, it has the same character types and all that.
10171000	10180000	But I don't know, even though the gameplay looks similar, the components and everything
10180000	10186000	in the game looks different from TF2.
10186000	10193000	Something to add to your question is that a lot of people I know that I started playing
10193000	10196000	TF2 with are not playing TF2.
10196000	10204000	So I was saying to you on Twitter that if Overwatch is free to play, I know a lot of
10204000	10212000	people that may get interested in it because a lot of people, like I said, I know they
10212000	10219000	left TF2 because they thought the game got stale or the game didn't evolve that much
10219000	10221000	from what it was.
10221000	10223000	So it got boring.
10223000	10225000	So possibly Overwatch will fix that.
10225000	10229000	I'm very curious to see if Valve might have a response to this because it's interesting
10229000	10233000	how Valve and Blizzard are becoming more and more competitors.
10233000	10237000	The Battle.net launcher could very well become a storefront.
10237000	10238000	It is in many ways.
10238000	10244000	It only sells Blizzard stuff, but in some ways it is a storefront.
10244000	10247000	It kind of goes on that whole fragmented thing I talked about earlier.
10247000	10251000	So I kind of have to say, look at them for that.
10251000	10255000	It's interesting how they are competing with Valve, not just necessarily in that space,
10255000	10260000	but the fact that they also did a MOBA where Valve had Dota 2.
10260000	10264000	We remember there was even that lawsuit where they were going to call the game Blizzard
10264000	10268000	Dota, is what Blizzard was going to call their game, but they got into a little tiff with
10268000	10270000	Valve and ended up settling.
10270000	10272000	But it is kind of interesting.
10272000	10274000	Now they've got a game that's very similar to Team Fortress 2.
10274000	10279000	I wonder if Valve might be pressured to announce some sort of Team Fortress 3.
10279000	10283000	Although, I don't know, Valve kind of does what Valve wants to do.
10283000	10288000	Valve has had many competitors against Team Fortress 2.
10288000	10289000	True, true.
10289000	10292000	Like Monday Night Combat and some other games.
10292000	10293000	Bethesda had one.
10293000	10300000	The only one that comes to mind is that one because that one at least got some, I don't know,
10300000	10303000	War of Mouth out, but it didn't grow that big.
10303000	10306000	But there are other games like Team Fortress 2.
10306000	10309000	There's another game free-to-play on Steam that's called Road Out.
10309000	10314000	They're really similar too, but not that popular as Team Fortress 2.
10314000	10320000	Even though those games are free-to-play, Team Fortress 2 is still the game to play if you want to play
10320000	10322000	team first-person shooters.
10322000	10327000	Bethesda had one that they showed at E3 because I remember that was the only other thing they were
10327000	10330000	showing besides the Evil Within.
10330000	10331000	And so that's one.
10331000	10334000	I remember playing that and going, oh, this is Team Fortress.
10334000	10336000	So they've got one in development too.
10336000	10343000	But it's kind of like when MOBAs all came out fast and furious, and I guess they still are.
10343000	10348000	I hope we don't have stories like the EA game that closed this week happening too frequently in the
10348000	10349000	Team Fortress 2 universe.
10349000	10352000	But one way or another, Blizzard will end up fine.
10352000	10354000	But before I let you go, I want to ask you about Overwatch.
10354000	10356000	What did you think of the characters?
10356000	10359000	Because I felt that was the strongest point of the whole thing was that, wow, these characters are
10359000	10361000	super interesting.
10361000	10367000	Yeah, that's something that Blizzard I think knows how to do really well, that it's characterization.
10367000	10370000	And the characters look like real characters.
10370000	10380000	Even though Team Fortress has some characterization, it doesn't look as in-depth like in Overwatch,
10380000	10387000	at least from what we see in the trailer and the cinematic and the gameplay trailer.
10387000	10389000	So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
10389000	10396000	And even, like I said in chat earlier, that Overwatch could very well be a series or a movie even.
10396000	10400000	SSG100Matt has a theory in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
10400000	10405000	He says, Gabe probably sat back in his deluxe leather chair watching the trailer saying,
10405000	10409000	oh, that's cute, while watching the Valve staff make Half-Life 3.
10409000	10410000	Yeah.
10410000	10411000	All right.
10411000	10413000	Well, active, and we'll let you go to see if we can get some more calls.
10413000	10415000	But thank you for your thoughts on Overwatch.
10415000	10417000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10417000	10418000	Anytime.
10418000	10419000	Take care, buddy.
10419000	10422000	I feel like you need to have a spinoff gaming law podcast.
10422000	10423000	Oh.
10423000	10426000	Well, God, somebody's suing someone every week in this damn industry.
10426000	10427000	It's crazy.
10427000	10431000	I feel like every week, this is like the first week in a month we haven't had some type of lawsuit story.
10431000	10436000	Speaking of last minute stories, speaking of Blizzard, you know, and Marisa, you can back up this statement,
10436000	10440000	you can't have a good character without a good voice actor.
10440000	10441000	That's right.
10441000	10442000	That's right.
10442000	10443000	Voice.
10443000	10444000	Exactly.
10444000	10447000	So, you know, and Blizzard knows how to find great voices.
10447000	10453000	And this just goes to show the Voice Arts Award, as announced by Voice Over Times,
10453000	10461000	the winner of the Outstanding Video Game Character Voice Arts Award went to Michael Gao for Diablo 3.
10461000	10466000	And if you don't know who he is, he voiced Deckard Cain in that game.
10466000	10475000	Oh, Deckard Cain, who was younger in Diablo 2, but in Diablo 3, he's really old.
10476000	10478000	And that's from the Voice Over Convention.
10478000	10482000	That's going on tonight and for the next few days in New York.
10482000	10485000	Nice. Well, congrats to him. Congrats to Blizzard.
10485000	10490000	I guess he probably wasn't at BlizzCon if that was the case, but there you go.
10490000	10494000	That's interesting, though, because Diablo 3 has been out a while.
10494000	10499000	It's a relatively new organization that got together to give these awards.
10499000	10503000	I was going to say, there was an expansion, although I don't remember how much Deckard Cain was in the expansion.
10503000	10506000	I don't think he was really in it, but I don't know. Anyway.
10506000	10512000	Okay. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10512000	10515000	The phones are still open. I'll leave it open for a few more minutes to see if anyone else gets in,
10515000	10519000	even though we are well after 9 o'clock here on the West Coast and we usually like to calm things down.
10519000	10522000	But I'll try to fit in one more call. Jamie's tired. She's yawning.
10522000	10524000	She might need another cookie to perk her up. All right.
10524000	10526000	I have to go to bed eventually.
10526000	10528000	All right. Loki, anything else for the last minute stuff?
10528000	10534000	Thanks to hacking, there is a guide now how to play GameCube games on your Wii U.
10534000	10536000	Oh, wow.
10536000	10540000	Because of the GameCube controller support that they're going to be having.
10540000	10541000	Uh-huh.
10541000	10544000	They're saying, hey, it's a good time to play GameCube games.
10544000	10548000	Of course, it's up through the homebrew channel, and I'm pretty sure you have to rip ISOs in order to do it,
10548000	10551000	but it can be done on a Wii U.
10551000	10553000	Wow.
10553000	10555000	We should just add support for GameCube games.
10555000	10558000	Hack, hack, hack your Wii, hack it for Wii U.
10558000	10562000	So we know that's kind of irritating, so it's like we know it can do it,
10562000	10567000	but Nintendo won't unlock it because you know they're going to start selling them as virtual console.
10567000	10571000	It can do it. They're putting out GameCube controllers.
10571000	10575000	But fuck you, we're not going to connect those dots.
10575000	10577000	I want my F0GX.
10577000	10581000	We're going to put an F0 track in Mario Kart 8.
10581000	10584000	We're going to put an F0 level in fucking Nintendo Land,
10584000	10586000	but fuck you, you don't get an F0 game.
10586000	10588000	I want to play Eternal Darkness again.
10590000	10594000	Alright, I want to see some cool DLC characters for Smash Bros.
10594000	10597000	Maybe instead of FU of the Week, next time we should just have Wine of the Week.
10597000	10598000	Like the Wine of the Week.
10598000	10602000	And Excitebot, or, you know, Geno.
10602000	10605000	Alright, well, sadly the phones are not lighting up.
10605000	10608000	I'm going to go ahead and close it so we can wrap up, because we are well after 9 o'clock,
10608000	10612000	and I've had a pretty long day today, I'm ready to call it.
10612000	10617000	We weren't even supposed to be here today, to quote a popular movie.
10617000	10622000	Alright, anyhow, so we are here at the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
10622000	10625000	and, you know, before we wrap up shop here, I just want to say Marissa,
10625000	10628000	it is so lovely to have you here in studio.
10628000	10630000	Just your presence is always fun to have.
10630000	10633000	I know you don't play as many games as the rest of us, but you know what?
10633000	10637000	At least you still have a respect and an adoration for it,
10637000	10639000	especially with the whole voice acting connections,
10639000	10643000	and I think it's always interesting to hear your perspective of the industry side of things.
10643000	10645000	I love it. I actually do play a little more than I care to admit,
10645000	10648000	but I don't want to be held to being incorrect when I speak up.
10648000	10651000	If they come for you, I will fight them.
10651000	10653000	If they come for you, I will fight them.
10653000	10654000	I love being here. It's such a pleasure.
10654000	10657000	Alright, you're welcome any time that you can get yourself up here.
10657000	10661000	Alright, or, one of these days, we're going to come invade LA. I'm just saying.
10661000	10662000	Oh, you guys so should.
10662000	10666000	I know, I know. It would be my dream to do a live from E3 show,
10666000	10670000	but we have to let Loki's wife leave for a couple days to do that.
10670000	10674000	Alright, but Marissa, thank you again so much for being here.
10674000	10680000	Best of luck to you in your journey as you continue to find more and more voice acting engagements and so forth.
10680000	10682000	Please, please plug it one more time.
10682000	10686000	Seriously, guys, if you need a voice actress, Marissa.
10686000	10688000	You get to hear me doing some really silly stuff.
10688000	10693000	It's MarissaMizell.com and that's my official website and then you can link to there.
10693000	10697000	Or it's Marissa Mizell at SoundCloud and I have some silly stuff there too as well.
10697000	10700000	It's just good fun and I appreciate any listens and feedback anyway.
10700000	10702000	It doesn't matter who you are. It's always interesting.
10702000	10703000	Yeah, that's great.
10703000	10704000	Thank you.
10704000	10706000	Thank you. Alright, let's...
10706000	10711000	I listened to that Marissa girl. She sounds like a good young lady.
10711000	10713000	That's right. She's nice.
10713000	10715000	Alright, she's so wholesome.
10719000	10721000	Next on the Disney Channel.
10721000	10723000	That means she's such a good actress.
10723000	10725000	That's when you know you've really got them fooled.
10725000	10729000	Oh, she sounds like a good Christian girl. Alright.
10729000	10731000	Shalom.
10731000	10734000	Alright. Anyhow, as I say at the end of every show.
10734000	10737000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.
10737000	10741000	If you like what you heard here at the show, we've said this for the past 574 weeks.
10741000	10744000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
10744000	10749000	Help spread the word because Orange Launch Radio is the place where every gamer has a voice.
10749000	10753000	And we want to have your friends at the table as long as they promise to behave.
10753000	10757000	No whipping it out and putting it on the table. That's disrespectful.
10757000	10762000	Unless you're Nintendo or something. Then you get to do that.
10762000	10765000	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.
10765000	10767000	I'll start with my official final thought.
10767000	10770000	My final thought is I want to give a big congratulations.
10770000	10776000	Speaking of 500 weeks, I want to give a big congratulations to Critical Myth.
10776000	10781000	Who is having episode 500 of their show air on the network Monday.
10781000	10785000	Now to be fair, that's not 500 weeks because they do three shows a week.
10785000	10792000	But still, how many shows get to 500 one-hour episodes?
10792000	10796000	Not a lot. Not a lot. A fantastic accomplishment.
10796000	10801000	And if you like television, who doesn't like TV? There's got to be some nerdy show.
10801000	10807000	Even you will watch Doctor Who or there's some shows you watch once in a while.
10807000	10811000	And chances are if it's a nerdy show, Critical Myth is talking about it.
10811000	10812000	So check out their reviews.
10812000	10817000	TV.vognetwork.com and you can actually participate and write your own reviews.
10817000	10820000	And check out their shows Monday, Wednesday, Friday at VOG Network.
10820000	10823000	A big congrats to Critical Myth and the whole crew over there.
10823000	10828000	All those guys that met for the first time at this year's Dragon Con for 500 episodes.
10828000	10829000	Woo!
10829000	10831000	Okay. Loki, your final thought.
10831000	10837000	My final thought is I'll create an auto in a week.
10837000	10843000	I guess I'll work on my game during this time so that I have some productivity.
10843000	10846000	It's going to have to write itself once that game comes out.
10846000	10848000	Well, I'll get bored of it eventually.
10848000	10851000	But it'll be fun to go back in there and play it again.
10851000	10854000	Alright. And last but not least, StarkSoccer, your final thought tonight.
10854000	10859000	If someone knows of an HTML5 GUI editor, because I'm looking for some...
10859000	10860000	No, seriously.
10860000	10867000	I'm looking for something that I can do to do dating sim-esque dialogue for an idea I have.
10867000	10873000	If anyone knows of a good one that will run in HTML5, please let me know.
10873000	10874000	Thank you.
10874000	10876000	Well, you know Unity exports HTML5.
10876000	10878000	I know and I don't know if...
10878000	10883000	There is a content thing on the Asset Store for dating sim dialogue.
10883000	10886000	I don't think it's free.
10886000	10888000	I wanted to do my webcomic in that format.
10888000	10890000	Okay. Alright.
10890000	10894000	Well, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10894000	10901000	Have a great week everybody and we will see you in seven days with episode 575 of our show
10901000	10906000	and everything that might break in gaming over the next week that we have to fix here live on air.
10906000	10908000	Thanks again for tuning in and supporting the show guys.
10908000	10909000	We'll see you next week. Bye.
10936000	10938000	They were all still true.
10940000	10942000	See you next week.
10966000	10968000	Thanks for watching.
