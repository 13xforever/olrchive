0	17520	A new AAA release, a new series of issues, Assassin's Creed Unity release and gamers
17520	20960	are both amused and annoyed at player trapping bugs, multiplayer issues, and an array of
20960	21960	visual glitches.
21960	25020	We'll have much more as well as your comments and calls, so keep your face on and stay tuned
25020	27900	for the show where every gamer has a voice.
27900	31740	Orange Lounge Radio
31740	34660	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34660	42140	where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 575 for this
42140	45700	November the 16th of 2014.
45700	49460	Joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the
49460	53100	gamer lifestyle with me, my name's Rob Robertson.
53100	58460	Joining me as always are my co-hosts, say hello over there to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58460	59460	Nom nom.
59460	60460	How are you doing?
60460	61460	I'm satisfied.
61460	66340	Yes, we went on a lunch date earlier.
66340	67340	With the lady Victoria.
67340	72460	Yes, for those of you that know Horde House, there's one of my co-hosts over there, we
72460	76380	call him Grandpa because he's been playing, or was playing Warcraft since Vanilla, a very
76380	78060	long time, so we call him Grandpa.
78060	86820	So his quote unquote wife, which, he's actually a gay man, so it's, you know, his fruit fly,
86820	91700	flame dame, I don't know, what are the terms, I know a lot of women that hang out with gay
91700	96780	men do not like the blank hag, they don't like that one anymore, so whatever that is,
96780	99900	that's what she is to Grandpa, so we call her Grandma.
99900	103460	Although that's not really, I mean, I don't know, I feel like in that situation she's
103460	108420	more like, when Anna Nicole Smith married the rich tycoon guy, she's more like that,
108420	109420	so I think that's what it is.
109420	110420	So she's Anna.
110420	111420	Yes, she's Anna.
111420	114820	So we went to, we went to,
114820	115820	Genghis Kitchen.
115820	118500	Yes, Mongolian barbecue with Anna Banana.
118500	119500	Yeah.
119500	120500	So.
120500	121780	It was yummy.
121780	122780	Good times.
122780	125340	And then you brought leftovers to make my whole house smell like Mongolian.
125340	132140	I have, I have a lot of leftovers, and I've actually, I must say, I've finally given up
132140	139180	on the whatever low carb crap thing I was doing before, and I've just said, fuck it.
139180	141940	And I'm eating whatever I want to.
141940	144620	And I dropped three pounds.
144620	145620	You're on the fuck it diet.
145620	146620	I'm on the fuck it.
146620	147620	I'm on the fuck it.
147620	148620	I'm gonna eat it.
148620	150540	I'm just, I don't care anymore.
150540	152340	It's a happy way of living.
152340	154740	I have a lot less stress.
154740	159660	And apparently I'm happy with everything else going on, so fuck it, I'm gonna play DDR.
159660	160660	Awesome.
160660	161660	All right.
161660	164540	Nothing wrong with incorporating a little exercise into the fuck it diet.
164540	167980	Clearly over on the fuck it diet, chomping down on his McDonald's fries over there.
167980	169700	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
169700	172860	It was just, they're the only people that could give me food.
172860	177580	I was late today because I had to put away laundry because the stupid dryer took too
177580	178580	long.
178580	180700	Are you saying that laundry is more important than OLR?
180700	184540	No, I don't, I don't agree that it is, but you know.
184540	185900	The wife might feel differently.
185900	190420	She might disagree that, you know, her clothes are wrinkled and stuff, so I had to hang everything
190420	195780	up and then I was like, crap, you know, I'm not that hungry, so I'll just go to McDonald's.
195780	198220	And thankfully they're busy, so that means that the fries are pretty good.
198220	199620	So that was good.
199620	204540	And then, um, yeah, I'm kind of on the fuck it diet too because, uh, with the cafes at
204540	210700	work now, it's like, yeah, I'll bring in stuff, but I'm like, no, they make such delicious
210700	211700	food.
211700	212700	What, you make your own Barbies?
212700	214380	Oh my God, it's so good.
214380	218500	So you, you started the new job now, so you don't, you don't work in gaming distribution
218500	219500	anymore, unfortunately.
219580	222700	That doesn't mean you don't have friends, you know, can hook you up.
222700	223700	Yeah.
223700	226060	It's, uh, so I'm glad to see you got settled pretty quick.
226060	227060	All things considered.
227060	228060	Yeah.
228060	229060	Good for you.
229060	231740	Um, you were mentioning before the show to me that, uh, you've been playing a lot of
231740	234940	games this week and we'll get into the details and we get into how was your gaming week,
234940	240220	but, uh, you found that now that your PlayStation four is back and working, you catching up
240220	241220	on everything or what happened?
241220	243940	Yeah, I'm sort of, I mean, I, I've been playing lots of stuff.
243940	248020	I even went through and just kind of checking out some of the, um, PlayStation plus games
248020	249020	and that kind of thing.
249540	251780	And as I was mentioning too, though, I've been noticing that I've been buying a lot
251780	253820	more things digitally, which is kind of weird.
253820	258700	I never thought they would be doing that, but like, it's, it's just, for me, it seems
258700	263460	to be pretty like by the time I go and take something back, like say if I'm going to,
263460	267060	I'm not going to really sell it on eBay anymore because it's kind of absolutely easy.
267060	271100	You want to have like a mailroom at work and I could just, you know, put it together and
271100	274620	just give it to the mail person and, you know, send it off, you know, whereas now I would
274620	278740	have to go to the post office or I'd have to go drop it off in a UPS box or something
278740	279740	like that.
279740	280740	It's a pain in the ass.
280740	287060	So I just, I'm not really selling stuff on eBay and, you know, to take something back
287060	291660	to like GameStop or something like that, it's not, you don't really get a ton of money.
291660	294580	So I've been doing a lot of, no, I don't know.
294580	295580	Not a lot.
295580	299980	I bought like call of duty and grand theft auto digitally, mainly those two will call
299980	300980	of duty.
300980	303460	I want it digitally because I wanted the PlayStation three version as well.
303460	306840	So I can play with my friends that don't have a PlayStation four yet.
306840	310400	And then grand theft auto, uh, just because it didn't really matter, wasn't going to sell
310400	312520	that game back anyways.
312520	316200	And it was, you know, I got a little bit more stuff with it.
316200	320440	Plus since I spent over a hundred dollars on PlayStation network, they kicked me back
320440	321840	$15.
321840	324360	You know, that was a thing that they had during the month of October.
324360	325360	Yeah.
325360	326360	Yeah.
326360	329460	I, I, I'm not still super into the buying things digitally.
329460	333980	You know, I like to have the physical copy of things because I can sell it back and it
333980	335760	does have that value.
335760	339720	But I do find that I, I will, it's not to say, Oh, I never buy games digitally.
339720	345340	No, I found that I will get sucked into it usually when there's like a really good deal
345340	349960	or something, which of course, steam sales or, you know, any digital distribution channel
349960	354240	really sales and they've been doing be very, even like, yeah, the games of gold stuff.
354240	357580	They are not games of gold, but like, um, the PlayStation network stuff where they'll
357580	358580	have stuff on sale.
358580	359580	Yeah.
359580	360580	Sometimes that's actually really good.
360580	361580	Like I bought Hatsune Miku that way.
361580	362580	Yeah.
362580	365360	I was going to buy a wool Lego Marvel superheroes.
365360	369360	I had saw that I was like, eh, I don't really play like Lego games, but maybe that's something
369360	370360	my son would like.
370360	372520	And I kind of hesitated and I didn't buy it.
372520	373520	It was like $20.
373520	374520	I hate to say it.
374520	375520	Sorry.
375520	376520	Lego fans was probably for the best.
376520	377520	You didn't.
377520	378520	I didn't really care for it.
378520	379520	I did buy it.
379520	380520	I really care for it.
380520	381520	Julian is addicted to those Lego games.
381520	382520	I played way more injustice.
382520	383520	Uh, I did buy it though.
383520	384520	I did.
384520	385520	I did end up picking it up.
385520	391720	I bought it digitally because, um, I looked at with the $15 I had on there, um, which
391720	393520	expires in December.
393520	398080	Um, honestly it would have been cheaper than buying it used.
398080	402480	So I just went ahead and picked up digitally, uh, running the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
402480	406600	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network of vognetwork.com
406600	410720	at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show.
410720	414360	And if you do happen to be participating with our show live, you can comment and we read
414360	418080	them and read some of our favorite comments here on air to start a discussion in the room
418080	419080	sometimes.
419080	424200	Uh, and just dungeon buster says, speaking of digital inquisition was a decent 24 gig
424200	430000	download was a nice rest respite from the 47 gigabyte monster that unity is.
430000	437000	Uh, so yeah, a lot of people getting ready for dragon age with the digital, uh, Alan,
437000	438400	my partner, Alan did that.
438400	444040	Uh, he's already got his deluxe, whatever through origin, ready to go.
444040	445040	I'm thinking about it.
445040	446040	I was looking at today.
446040	447040	The problem.
447040	448040	Yeah.
448080	452000	I haven't played any of the dragon age games, but I mean, um, like they've been getting
452000	453480	really good reviews for it.
453480	457440	So I was like, maybe I tried really hard to get into the other games.
457440	460880	They just didn't click for me, but I'm going to give it another go with something.
460880	464800	That's been my question is like, is this game going to be something where if I haven't played
464800	467960	origins or two that I'm going to be kind of like, who are these people?
467960	472880	I'm being told no, it's, it's basically you get new batches of characters for each game,
472880	475000	but they do have characters that continue.
475000	479920	Like Zevram in the first one showed up into for a little bit and I think he's got appearance
479920	484200	in three, but I'm being told that like, yes, there is fan service for fans of the first
484200	487960	two games, but you're not going to be like lost as hell if you didn't buy them.
487960	490840	And they have that standalone catch up thing.
490840	493600	I forget somebody in chat might have to help me or if Shane was in the room, he'd yell
493600	494600	it out.
494600	497040	But there's that, uh, that dragon age keep, is that what it was called?
497040	502160	The keep something where you can actually play through the first two, uh, like stories.
502160	504360	It's kind of like the Mass Effect comics, I guess you played through the stories, make
504360	510320	the key decisions and then your, your save goes to origin, which what, wherever you get
510320	512320	dragon age will pull from origin.
512320	513320	I have origin.
513320	514320	Yeah.
514320	518000	Cause I have origins on origin because of, you know, they were given out free, but I
518000	519000	don't know.
519000	523360	And then, and then far cry four cause far cry four looks amazing too.
523360	528160	And as like all these games, it's so, I know I was just, I was just talking about it with
528160	533960	Bobby on his show, uh, before we were on arrows, like I, I'm dropping $200 on games next week.
533960	539080	Like it's just, it's disgusting, but it's, I mean this next week is the biggest week
539080	541240	because we're on the heels of black Friday.
541240	546280	I ordered my game, uh, right when I got hired at low cat officially.
546280	547800	So I'm glad I paid for it.
547800	548800	All right.
548800	550800	It's one of those times I was glad that I ordered it already.
550800	554460	Um, but there actually is another thing that popped up that's probably going to be getting
554460	559600	me to spend some money and that's that, uh, this, uh, origin has out the Sims four create
559600	561400	a SIM for free.
561400	565200	So I was going to play with that cause now you can drown your Sims on dungeon buster,
565200	569080	by the way, is confirming that it is the keep and you can check that out at dragon age.
569080	570080	Keep.com.
570080	575980	Uh, is that I am going to probably wait on, I do want far cry four and maybe dragon ages
575980	580120	because you know, everybody's going to be playing it and stuff, but I'm, I don't know.
580120	583720	I, I'm going to wait just to see if there's some black Friday sales.
583720	584720	Here's my problem.
584720	587380	I have dragon age inquisition, which even though I didn't even really super play the
587380	588380	first one.
588380	592860	My, my roommate and my partner are super into dragon age and they're both, you know, especially
592860	593860	shame.
593860	594860	How many players can do co-op?
594860	595860	Huh?
595860	596860	How many players can do co-op?
596860	598220	I don't know, but it's not cross platform.
598220	599860	So think carefully about which platform you're gonna buy it on.
599860	601540	I'm getting them PlayStation four if I get it.
601540	602540	Yeah, I probably will too.
602540	603980	And that's where Shane has it too.
603980	607020	But then Alan and Jamie are going to be on PC.
607020	611840	So it's going to depend on, yeah, well, but I figure Alan and I can always switch.
611840	614540	I can always play on his account if I really want to play with PC people.
614540	618340	He can play on my PS four if there's somebody who wants to play with there.
618340	621780	So anyway, uh, where was I not just trying to, okay, so next week we also have little
621780	624420	big planet three, which I don't want to get lost in the shuffle.
624420	629340	I realized that may not be getting the fanfare of the other little, honestly, I'm going
629340	633660	to hold off on that one just because I dug it at E3 and I love those games.
633660	638180	I've been playing that stupid iPhone runner of all things, the little big planet one.
638180	641420	I've been playing that a lot more than I would care to admit actually.
641420	644480	So I'm actually really excited about little big planet three, which I realized is kind
644480	648940	of, it's, it's strangely enough, somehow not really the triple a title next week.
648940	652420	I mean, I realize it is Sony's big, big title, but it is getting, you know, a lot of the
652420	657340	attention is focused on dragon age and super smash brothers, will you, which is that other
657340	658340	game I have to pick up.
658340	663460	And of course I can't pick that up and not get at least one or two or three of those
663460	664460	amiibos.
664460	665460	So which ones are you getting?
665460	672740	I decided to get Samus because Samus and I decided to get peach because peach and, uh,
672740	675020	for the third one, I did something that you might not expect.
675020	678940	I got Mario, which I know it seems like, well, that's kind of vanilla, but that was actually
678940	681420	the reason why I picked it up is because I said, you know what?
681420	684660	Like a lot of games are going to support Mario going forward.
684660	685820	Like that's the one you're going to want to have.
685820	689740	Like I realized, you know, they're talking about only the link one works and, but we'll
689740	693700	see how I like the three that I get and if I want to get more, I'll get more.
693700	696940	It doesn't seem like they're hard to get right now.
696940	702660	I don't think those first few are going to be very hard to get because it's cool.
702660	708660	They're fun to collect and stuff, but right now it's, it's not like it's integral to playing
708660	710900	a certain game like smash brothers or something.
710900	712740	You don't need them to play the game.
712740	718260	It's not like, you know, say Skylanders or Disney infinity or something like that where
718260	721260	you actually play as those characters in the game.
721260	725340	Um, so I think that they're just not going to, I don't think they're going to fly off
725340	726340	shells.
726340	727860	I mean people pick them up for sure.
727860	728860	Yeah.
728860	732000	But, um, Kai's, you don't, our chat says only new game that's doing it for me this month
732000	733000	is Pokemon.
733000	734000	That's about it.
734000	735000	Yeah.
735000	736500	That's a, I kind of had to bump that.
736500	737820	Like I'm, I'm out of money now.
737820	739500	I can't, I can't get Pokemon right now.
739500	741220	I'll wait and see how it's being received.
741220	742580	I'm sure I'll hear all about it from Shane.
742580	743580	Yeah.
743580	744580	Shane will pick it up.
744580	745580	Of course.
745580	746580	Uh, let's see what else is there?
746580	749740	Um, there's grand theft auto five, which you were telling me I have to get, but then you're
749740	751820	like, Oh, we could share play it.
751820	753360	So I'll probably do that.
753360	754860	So Oh my gosh.
754860	755860	Oh yeah.
755860	756860	I can't wait.
756860	759540	I'm going to totally stream that game once I get it, get a chance to play it.
759540	760540	So it'll be fun.
760540	761540	Uh, yeah.
761540	764260	Lots and lots of stuff to look forward to next week.
764260	766620	Let's um, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic though.
766620	772140	I want to talk about this week and there's a story from this week that literally everyone
772140	773140	is talking about.
773140	776820	So let's throw our hat under the ring and let's see what you guys in chat think about
776820	777820	this.
777820	779660	Um, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on?
779660	780660	Okay.
780660	785580	So Ubisoft released a game, um, the latest game in their assassin's creed franchise.
785580	790060	And of course this time they released a little, you know, two games, they had one on PlayStation
790060	795420	three and Xbox three 60 and then one on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.
795420	798700	That one being assassin's creed unity has some problems.
798700	801060	Uh, there was all sorts of glitches.
801060	807620	There were seriously some, I don't know, texture draw issues where it would not really draw
807620	808620	the face of people.
808620	812820	It would just kind of have the mouth and eyes and kind of make them look like, was it, um,
812820	819140	is that from like, um, the body snatchers or some of those characters look like super
819140	824420	meat boy rendered in 3d honestly, it was, it was, it was all messed up.
824420	827900	And of course now that joke is ever, I'm sure you've heard this joke 500 times.
827900	828900	So here's 501.
828900	834300	Well, it looks like Ubisoft really couldn't render women, poor men.
834980	840300	Um, apparently even having issues, um, I remember reading issues with it running on high end
840300	845300	PCs, even if it was AMD chips or something, ATI, um, cards and stuff, it just wouldn't
845300	846300	be able to run very well.
846300	848620	Um, I guess it's not ATI anymore.
848620	853300	It's AMD, but, um, yeah, uh, pretty bad.
853300	858700	And they've released, I think already a couple, um, a couple updates, but still hasn't fixed
858700	860700	everything.
860700	865860	This is really tricky because you know, uh, some of the things I'm hearing from the, and
865860	869580	just disclosure, I haven't played the game and I don't think my co-hosts have either.
869580	874580	So, you know, yes, we're talking at our butt a little bit on something that everybody online
874580	880780	is talking about, but it's, it's a very interesting lesson in a way of maybe you should watch
880780	883660	what you're spending your money on before you actually spend the money.
883660	887900	Cause there's even, even some fans of Assassin's Creed that I know on Facebook are like, this
887900	888900	game's a mess.
888900	894180	This game is an absolute mess, but I'm also hearing that like this, it's sorry.
894180	898940	I'm also hearing that it kind of sucks when you're a fan of the series because deep down
898940	901620	in there somewhere, there's a good story.
901620	904460	Like the backbone and the skeleton of the Assassin's Creed.
904460	906880	There's a good Assassin's Creed game in here.
906880	909180	Someone took it out of the oven before it was done.
909180	911260	Sounds like it was, it was just badly managed badly badly.
911260	912260	I liked how it was.
912260	916460	They said, uh, was it, they had art, um, you know, falling to the ground, crashing when
916460	920700	you're enjoying a co-op session, getting stuck in hay carts, that's kind of funny.
920700	926700	Um, frame rate issues, graphical inclusion issues, matchmaking co-op issues, um, helix
926700	929460	credit issues, which I don't know the fuck that is.
929460	932540	I hope that's not like in app purchases or some shit like that.
932540	937460	Um, cause I thought I heard that this game had that or it was one of these games that
937460	940860	just came out where they can, you can speed up progression by buying stuff.
940860	946340	I don't know if that's the helix credits or what that is, but it was in the whole
946340	949700	thing where like there's chests in the game that you can't open unless you have the smart
949700	950700	phone app.
950700	951700	Like, Oh yes, yes.
951700	952700	I did see that.
952700	959340	How can you possibly justify that to, that's a good thing for gamers cause you know, there's
959340	963300	going to be that fricking press release that comes out like, well, this is what gamers
963300	971180	want based on their website or something like that or the open, like some other chest and
971180	975940	it's, it's, this is really getting to the point where it's, it's really ridiculous.
975940	981740	Um, and you know, again, I know there's fans of Assassin's Creed out there, uh, somewhere
981740	987020	that are probably pissed that this is happening to their franchise, but this is, I mean, this
987020	995100	is kind of a tough lesson learned in regards to, uh, management and where the people up
995100	999620	here are getting involved with a game that maybe they have no business getting involved
999620	1001860	with sadly.
1001860	1007620	And they're just, it's, they're going, they're out of EA kind of, and just really, and remember
1007620	1013220	that we had problems even with, um, the last, you know, Ubisoft game that was a big release.
1013220	1016900	Um, watch songs had issues on PC.
1016900	1021700	There's a whole controversy about, Oh, Hey, there, you know, is being shown and you know,
1021700	1025580	better fidelity for the E3 demos and this wasn't the case and now all that stuff was
1025580	1028660	hidden in there or disabled or something like that.
1028660	1033020	And just a whole bunch of, um, you know, seeing them as glitchy and stuff and they,
1033020	1034780	this isn't the first game they have coming out this month.
1034780	1039580	I mean, they've got the crew next week as well, so that's an online focus game.
1039580	1041340	So hopefully that doesn't get all fucked up.
1041340	1044300	Um, cause you know, in chat says, I don't think we should blame people for buying it
1044300	1045300	day one.
1045300	1047860	You buying, you should expect it to work.
1047860	1049620	Um, well, I, I agree.
1049620	1054620	Let's talk about this part a little bit because you know, um, Twitter this week for the first
1054620	1059340	time in several months, uh, we are, we are actually having a chat about ethics and game
1059340	1065060	journalism all over this week because of the infamous embargo that was on this game and
1065060	1069580	the fact that, uh, many sites were embargoed on their reviews of Assassin's Creed unity
1069580	1075780	until noon the day the game was out and Ubisoft's perspective was, well, we need to make sure
1075780	1080060	people actually are exposed to the online component because online is such an important
1080060	1081420	part of the game.
1081420	1086540	But in reality with as glitchy as, as some of the stuff was showing to be, a lot of people
1086540	1088760	kind of already had their reviews done.
1088760	1093060	And I know a lot of outlets out there now kind of do like they kind of do living breathing
1093060	1097700	reviews where, you know, if they can't review the online component right away, they'll amend
1097700	1101820	or an issue, an addendum to their review later on or whatever to, to incorporate that in.
1101820	1106020	But the bottom line is once all these issues kind of came to light, this started to feel
1106020	1112020	like maybe this is a really shady way for Ubisoft to not get the word out there for
1112020	1114820	the day one buyers that the game might be broken.
1114820	1117460	Yeah, I think so.
1117460	1121760	And there's been some outlets that have straight out come out and said, never again, like,
1121760	1126140	you know, and I know we've razzed this site in the past sometimes, but Kotaku, I have
1126140	1129340	to applaud them this week because they came out and they put their foot down and they
1129340	1133260	said, we will no longer agree to post release embargoes.
1133260	1135860	And I, I have to applaud that.
1136420	1137500	It's their right to do that.
1137500	1142500	And I think it's going to take a lot of these big websites coming out and pushing back against
1142500	1144020	the publishers.
1144020	1148300	If only all of these big websites had a way to communicate with each other behind the
1148300	1151300	scenes, like a mailing list or something anyway.
1151300	1155540	So all these big websites are going to have to start pushing back and basically saying,
1155540	1159540	we're not going to play by these rules because these rules are anti-consumer and that's what's
1159540	1161300	going to have to happen for things to change.
1161300	1164780	See then what's going to happen is if they do play by their rules or whatever, then they
1164780	1169060	get the exclusive preview or whatever they can do that drives in more traffic to their
1169060	1170060	website.
1170060	1171060	Which is also bull.
1171060	1177940	And that's where we as the users have to stop buying into that shit where, you know, ethics.
1177940	1179020	Yeah, exactly.
1179020	1182900	If you want to, you know, and to go back to the big question about ethics and game journalism
1182900	1184560	that has to come on both sides.
1184560	1190660	You have to support ethical websites as well as the websites have to, you know, do things
1190660	1191660	ethically anyway.
1191660	1192660	Let's see.
1192660	1196180	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1196180	1199540	Pow in chat says, same with Sonic.
1199540	1201740	Journalists didn't get review copies because Sega didn't want that.
1201740	1202740	Yeah, let's not neglect that.
1202740	1203740	They know this stuff.
1203740	1208580	It's not like they don't know the state their game is going out in.
1208580	1209980	They play test this shit.
1209980	1214700	They know there's no way that, oh, we never had any of these glitches when we're testing
1214700	1215700	it.
1215700	1216700	That's a bunch of shit.
1216700	1222300	Here's where the Wii U kind of bubbling under the other, the PS4 and the Xbox one.
1222300	1226900	Here's where the Wii U being in that position kind of did a favor this week because not
1226900	1229580	as many people talking about Sonic, although it is to be fit.
1229580	1232660	Sonic Boom is in a very similar situation where a lot of people that have been playing
1232660	1237620	it are saying it's, it's grant granted that Sonic Boom, the bar wasn't exactly as high
1237620	1238620	as a century.
1238620	1239620	Exactly.
1239620	1240620	It's quite low.
1240620	1241620	That's true.
1241620	1242620	That's true.
1242620	1244820	A lot of people kind of go into Sonic games these days with tempered expectations.
1244820	1249620	But still, the last Assassin's Creed was so good, people pre-ordered this new one on
1249620	1251820	the back, on the heels of the last Assassin's Creed.
1251820	1256500	But still though, Sonic Boom still managed a limbo underneath that bar of quality that
1256500	1257500	they have there.
1257500	1260900	I don't know, it, poor Sonic.
1260900	1265300	Tiger Claw on chat says, I think the only risk is the sites getting blacklisted, but
1265300	1267900	I read Ubisoft is changing their policies behind it.
1267900	1269580	Well, Ubisoft's under a lot of pressure right now.
1269580	1271060	Ubisoft had to come out.
1271060	1274780	Didn't they start like a blog about here is how we're fixing the game, basically?
1274780	1277100	Like, they're wearing a lot of egg right now.
1277100	1280620	They're really having to kind of make amends to their fan base.
1280620	1283540	They let a lot of the Assassin's Creed fans down.
1283540	1286260	And you know, maybe there's some Assassin's Creed fans out there who feel differently
1286260	1290100	that might email us and say, Rob, the game's not as bad as Twitter's making it out to be.
1290100	1293260	And if you do feel that way, please, I want to hear from you guys.
1293260	1297660	But right now, everything I'm hearing is it's a technical glitchy nightmare.
1297660	1303020	And Ubisoft does have to respond to how they've let people down who trusted them with money,
1303020	1304020	with a pre-order.
1304540	1305540	See, that's the only thing.
1305540	1310900	It's like, that's where I would say, that's hard to say because, you know, digital pre-orders
1310900	1312700	you can't cancel.
1312700	1313700	Once you pre-order digitally.
1313700	1314700	Yes, you can.
1314700	1315700	Well, it's not easy to cancel.
1315700	1316700	Let's put it that way.
1316700	1317700	Yes, it was.
1317700	1318700	Well, how'd you do it?
1318700	1320860	Did you have to call Sony and do that whole thing or whoever it is?
1320860	1321860	Origin made it really easy.
1321860	1322860	Oh, yeah.
1322860	1330500	Because I ordered my Dragon Age and messed up on it because I used the wrong card.
1330500	1333700	It took me maybe three minutes to cancel the order.
1334220	1336620	Get my refund and then order it the proper way.
1336620	1341060	Origin even has the money back thing, though, with, you know, even if you did download it,
1341060	1345220	let's say this game was an EA game and came out and it was all fucked up.
1345220	1346460	Why did they have to do that?
1346460	1347460	Because of SimCity.
1347460	1348500	Because of SimCity.
1348500	1352800	So now it's going to be interesting to see how is Ubisoft going to make it right for
1352800	1353800	some of their games.
1353800	1354800	Oh, I don't know.
1354800	1362260	Let's put more Uplay features in there because, um, are there really any Uplay features that
1362260	1367220	I mean, I've I haven't played enough, I guess, Ubisoft games, but I haven't noticed any sort
1367220	1372740	of reason the need you play Dungeon Buster in chat says I've always accepted that some
1372740	1375980	minor glitches and patches were needed because of my PC history.
1375980	1379540	But the whole day one patching thing feels as if it's conditioning people to accept that
1379540	1382700	the product they're getting will already be broken in some way.
1382700	1383700	No, no.
1383700	1384700	Hold on.
1384700	1385700	I got to stop.
1385700	1386700	Stop the day one patch thing.
1386700	1389540	Day one patching is good because, you know, day one patching means day one patching means
1389540	1394280	that after the game has been pressed and is gold, that they're actually still bug fixing
1394280	1395740	after the fact.
1395740	1400740	And that's what that is, is that there is a time between when the game is gold and is
1400740	1403580	being pressed to when it comes out a few weeks.
1403580	1405700	So day one patches, I have no problem.
1405700	1407780	OK, but devil's advocate, I have to ask this.
1407780	1410300	Then why is the game going gold when it still has bugs in it?
1410300	1411700	Why is that acceptable?
1411700	1415420	Well, it's usually beyond Wednesday.
1415420	1418420	Assassin's Creed exactly is a good example of that.
1418420	1422260	I'm talking about like additional bugs that maybe are not so overt.
1422260	1425700	OK, maybe Dragon Age Inquisition might be an example, because Dragon Age did get bumped
1425700	1428220	back a month for mysterious reasons.
1428220	1432300	And now the game is out, the embargo is already up for it.
1432300	1435140	Nine point five, a 10 out of 10.
1435140	1436140	Yes, exactly.
1436140	1440800	And this is what needs to happen is, you know, delaying games so that EA kind of figured
1440800	1445420	it out with, well, they stumbled through it a few times, but they figured it out with
1445420	1446420	Battlefield 4.
1446420	1451900	We can't let something like that happen again, hopefully, as you know, giving them benefit
1451900	1452900	of that right now.
1452900	1457780	And so, you know, that's why they delayed Battlefield, you know, Hardline and they delayed
1457780	1460220	Dragon Age Inquisition.
1460220	1463460	I think NBA Live was OK this year.
1463460	1464460	I don't know.
1464460	1467940	I don't play basketball games, so but I haven't heard any super, you know, tons of complaints
1467940	1468940	about it.
1468940	1470860	EA's been having a pretty good year, all things considered.
1470860	1475340	So I mean, I think hopefully they've learned their lesson in judging by the reviews of
1475340	1477500	Dragon Age Inquisition.
1477500	1478500	It sounds like it.
1478500	1480500	Hardline hopefully will get good reviews.
1480500	1483060	Well, BioWare does a lot of quality stuff.
1483060	1484060	Yes, yes.
1484060	1487300	I might be a little biased, but BioWare does a lot of quality stuff, so of course it was
1487300	1488300	gonna...
1488300	1489860	Let's wait until Battlefield Hardline comes out.
1489860	1494260	Hopefully that'll be better than, you know, Battlefield 4 was.
1494260	1498580	Let's see, going to chat, Warrior Bob says, I don't mind day one patches if they're genuinely
1498580	1503020	finding or fixing new issues, but I have to admit, I really like not having to worry about
1503020	1508620	that, which is why I buy like 90% of my games from GOG, good old games, or flea markets.
1508620	1512100	And YYR is saying, you know, the reason why this stuff happens, because it has to come
1512100	1513700	out next week.
1513700	1519060	Dude, management and some of the ways these games have become so bloated in the way that
1519060	1522460	they're developed, it's really starting to wreck things, and I think unfortunately what
1522460	1527420	you're seeing here with Assassin's Creed and Sonic Boom and Battlefield and, you know,
1527420	1532980	this is starting to come to a climax here, where things in the gaming industry have already
1533140	1539100	been a little volatile for other shenanigans for the past couple months, and now this happens
1539100	1543500	and it's just like, oh my god, this has to fucking change.
1543500	1549860	So, joining us here in studio tonight, he's been in and out over the past few months,
1549860	1553020	we always appreciate him stopping by and saying hello.
1553020	1557420	From the big anime game room, say hello to Jonas.
1557420	1558420	Hello guys.
1558420	1559420	Hey, how you doing?
1559420	1560420	I'm doing fine.
1560860	1564780	So you've been listening to us debate a little bit about the Assassin's Creed Unity fiasco,
1564780	1568420	surely you've been following what's going on, what do you think about the whole mess?
1568420	1574980	So far, right now it's really a tough situation on YouTube, so I can't really answer the questions,
1574980	1579020	since I have actually worked in the game industry before, and actually work at a company like
1579020	1583220	Intel, that does like all this validation stuff.
1583220	1589660	So from, this is just from a general point of perspective, sometimes marketing, again,
1589660	1595220	back to marketing, has to push the game out at a specific time based on investments.
1595220	1597420	Because at the end of the day, it's about making the investors happy.
1597420	1598420	Correct.
1598420	1600180	Well, Ubisoft investors are not happy right now.
1600180	1603220	So yeah, that's one thing.
1603220	1609980	So this is why, day one patches, it's totally acceptable because they're trying to fix something
1609980	1613340	that might be considered critical before the consumer sees it.
1613340	1619500	Let's say I play something that has a critical bug, that for some reason didn't get catched,
1619500	1624340	or for some reason passed validation during development.
1624340	1628180	Like if I play and I see a huge glitch, and they say they're fixing it, okay, I'm gonna
1628180	1633220	be happy as a customer that day one actually happened with the fix.
1633220	1637300	Maybe like version 1.1, version 1.2, who knows?
1637300	1643260	But yeah, Ubisoft, the situation with Ubisoft is a really gray line situation, which I need
1643260	1647180	to know more details of what goes behind the scenes.
1647180	1650740	Well, we're gonna feel the effects of this week over the next few years.
1650740	1656660	I mean, it's not just Assassin's Creed, it's Sonic, it's also World of Warcraft.
1656660	1659500	You know, we're gonna get into that a little later in the show, but World of Warcraft launched
1659500	1665340	an expansion, and they had a lot of technical glitches that harken back to when the original
1665340	1666340	game came out.
1666340	1671860	And not even that, Halo the Master Chief collection, multiplayer server issues.
1671860	1676540	So I think there's a lot of gamers out there that are just fucking fed up with a lot of
1676540	1678540	this.
1678540	1688780	In addition to Assassin's Creed, this is probably one of Ubisoft's biggest challenges
1688780	1693020	to pretty much make amends for the customers and their fanbase.
1693020	1696540	For Sonic Boom, this isn't the first time this has happened.
1696540	1700660	I think everyone remembers what happened with Sonic 06.
1700660	1703380	Yeah, let's not talk about Sonic 06.
1703380	1707660	But it's just an example, like, if it happens once, okay, maybe the people may forgive.
1707660	1712980	But if it happens, like, constantly, then okay, then that's where the customers...
1712980	1718180	You're right, because what's happened with Assassin's Creed, and you can argue, I mean,
1718180	1721420	there might be an Assassin's Creed fan out there listening that's like, Rob, you're wrong,
1721420	1725300	it's not that bad, the internet's blowing it up, but this is gonna be a hard point to
1725300	1726300	dispute.
1726300	1727300	What is that?
1727300	1728940	Perception is everything out there right now, right?
1728940	1733620	And so the headlines, I mean, the BBC ran a story about the bugs in Assassin's Creed.
1733620	1738740	So at the end of the day, the perception out there is, Assassin's Creed is a buggy game.
1738740	1741460	So what is the ultimate impact of this gonna be?
1741460	1747500	If there's an Assassin's Creed 2015, the pre-orders are gonna be impacted next year, because people
1747500	1752300	are gonna stop and go, maybe I wanna wait for the reviews before I pre-order the game
1752300	1753300	this time.
1753300	1754300	After what happened.
1754300	1756380	And I wouldn't even say it's as far as that goes.
1756380	1760420	I mean, look at the kind of stuff that Ubisoft is pushing as quality products.
1760420	1765100	I mean, Watch Dogs had issues, and that was a big tentpole title for them.
1765100	1767940	You know, Assassin's Creed's having issues now.
1767940	1771620	The crew's gonna be coming out very shortly, so let's see if that has issues, and then
1771620	1776180	there's the Division that's supposed to be coming out, I think next year at some point.
1776180	1780820	If all of these, especially these online focus games that are gonna have server issues, like
1780820	1783380	the crew, I'm worried about that.
1783380	1787220	I mean, the servers are all fucked up and you can't play the game.
1787220	1790300	Assassin's Creed, I don't know if it's such a big deal.
1790300	1793940	Another interesting perspective here, Alan Alchemy in chat says, Bioware pushing Dragon
1793940	1798020	Age Inquisition by five weeks in July probably wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for
1798020	1802780	the Mass Effect 3 mess, and them knowing that far ahead that they'd need more time.
1802780	1806880	If it was August, September, Activision probably wouldn't let them bump it.
1806880	1811380	Bioware has a lot of social capital to spend regarding, do you want another Mass Effect
1811380	1812580	3 on your hands?
1812580	1819060	Now Ubisoft gets to say, do you want another Unity on your hands going forward?
1819060	1824880	Interesting that that's what it takes, but again, I really feel like what's happened
1824880	1830340	this week, this month essentially, with not just one game, but the one game that's become
1830340	1835100	a symbol for several games, this impact's gonna be felt a year from now.
1835100	1840180	We're gonna be, like next E3, we will see things because of what happened this week.
1840380	1845420	I had a question though, because I'm not playing Assassin's Creed, so I don't really know,
1845420	1850460	and I was also looking up something else here real quick, but were these issues mainly on
1850460	1852900	PC or was this on console?
1852900	1853900	All of them.
1853900	1854900	Okay.
1854900	1857300	And speaking of, I was kind of curious, I'm like, well Assassin's Creed Unity didn't do
1857300	1859180	that great, I wonder what Rogue-
1859180	1861740	Well, and interesting you bring that up, because I want to make sure that did get brought up
1861740	1865940	at some point, is because a lot of people don't even know, there was a second Assassin's
1865940	1870840	Creed game that came out last week, and one reason people don't know that is because they
1870840	1873560	didn't give the early copies to anybody.
1873560	1877860	It was not, there wasn't an embargo or anything, they just flat out didn't send it out until
1877860	1882500	the day it came out, because Rogue is the quote unquote last gen release, it's the Xbox
1882500	1887220	360 and Playstation 3 release, but what I'm hearing, again, haven't played it, I can only
1887220	1891100	go off of everything that I try to absorb during the week, just like many of you, I'm
1891100	1895620	hearing it's not a bad game at all.
1895620	1898500	That's the experience people expected, you know what I mean?
1898500	1899500	Reviews aren't that great.
1899500	1900500	Oh really?
1900500	1901500	Yeah.
1901500	1905460	Well, keep in mind, I don't, I'm going off of gamers on Twitter, but generally it's better
1905460	1907820	than Unity right now, that's for sure.
1907820	1912300	It's probably not as buggy, because it's running in the same engine as the game last year,
1912300	1917020	but I'm going to say, I don't know, I'm trying to see real quick, let's see what-
1917020	1921820	Dungeon Buster in chat says, Rogue is really fun if you loved Black Flag.
1921820	1925340	Cow in chat says, I love Assassin's Creed, that's why I'm frustrated.
1925340	1931340	Yeah, it looks like they're getting about, you know, along the average, about the same
1931340	1933020	sort of reviews.
1933020	1936900	Black Wolf is talking about the crew, saying, one thing I noticed in the crew beta is that
1936900	1940300	the single player was still playable if you couldn't connect fully to their servers.
1940300	1944700	Oh good, see, because I was worried that that was more of an MMO type thing, where you know,
1944700	1945700	you have to play that.
1945700	1950780	I'm cool with it, hey, as long as they have single player not hindered by the fact that
1950780	1953820	you can't connect to the server, fine by me.
1953820	1957940	It's an inconvenience, yes, but it's not like, I'm not going to be as mad as like, say if
1957940	1961680	it was Destiny or something, where they're going to be, you know, like, for example,
1961680	1965860	they're going to be shutting down the servers, I think, for a few hours, and you know, you
1965860	1968400	can't play it during that time, it's fucking useless.
1968400	1974180	So I'm glad that it's not impacted totally by server outage problems.
1974180	1978620	Alright, well, again, I think we'll be talking about the events this week for a long time,
1978620	1983060	and we welcome your feedback, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or many of you have
1983060	1984060	been participating in chat.
1984060	1987000	We do have a lot of other news to get to in our gaming weeks, so I do want to move on
1987000	1990300	with the show, but before we get into our gaming weeks, since Jonas is here, let me
1990300	1991900	catch up with you a little bit.
1991900	1992900	How was Reno?
1992900	1996340	You did your teabagger, you took your show on the road to Reno, right, and you did a
1996340	1997340	convention up there, how'd that go?
1997340	1998340	That actually turned out pretty well.
1998340	1999340	Yeah.
1999340	2006340	Surprisingly, this is actually unusual, there was actually, I think it was Mario Kart and
2006340	2010420	Smash Brothers had the same amount of people and participants, it was like, wait, Mario
2010420	2012740	Kart 8 is really starting to get popular.
2012740	2013740	Yeah.
2013740	2017180	Well, the new Smash Brothers also isn't out yet, but, you know, I'm sure that'll level
2017180	2021140	set some things when that comes out, but, well, now you have the Mario Kart DLC, and
2021140	2025780	that's gonna, you know, that's gonna make Mario Kart kind of last even longer.
2025780	2029620	I think a lot of people turned on Mario Kart 8 this week who hadn't touched it in a couple
2029620	2031140	months, I'm one of them.
2031140	2033740	I hadn't played in a couple months, but I was like, oh, I gotta check out those new
2033740	2034740	tracks.
2034740	2035740	Oh, wait for the game of the year edition.
2035740	2036740	Oh, Anna Wii U.
2036740	2040380	The inevitable game of the year edition next year that has it all bundled together.
2040380	2044500	I'm sure that'll be a thing, we laugh, but it will.
2044500	2045900	So everything went well for you guys in Reno?
2045900	2050300	Yeah, SnafuCon was actually pretty fun, it's a 24-7 game room and stuff, so it was like,
2050300	2051300	ooh.
2051300	2052300	Is that hard to do 24 hours?
2052300	2055300	I think his mic's off, I might check that.
2055300	2056300	Oh, oops.
2056300	2057300	Oh, no.
2057300	2058300	Oops.
2058300	2064660	Anyways, SnafuCon's 24-7 gaming, it's actually not bad because, yeah, I think it's like 1,000
2064660	2069820	plus people, but not as much as big as FanimeCon or those other cons.
2069820	2075820	But nevertheless, the community was really nice and it was manageable, meeting up with
2075820	2080860	Greenlight Gaming and other communities like the Reno Smash community and stuff.
2080860	2081860	Gotcha.
2081860	2084940	Let's see, what else do I want to ask you about?
2084940	2087820	Recently, this has nothing to do with the anime game room, but it's something I want
2087820	2093220	to ask you about, there was a large Pump It Up competition that you participated in, and
2093220	2095800	my understanding is you did pretty fucking awesome.
2095800	2096800	What happened?
2096800	2098960	I got second place of the US Championships.
2098960	2100640	So where were the US Championships at?
2100640	2102100	It was in Los Angeles.
2102100	2104900	So you went all the way to Los Angeles to participate in Pump It Up Freestyle?
2104900	2105900	Yep.
2105900	2106900	And you got second place?
2106900	2107900	Yep.
2107900	2108900	Get the fuck out, that's amazing.
2108900	2109900	Good job!
2109900	2110900	I'm surprised myself, I'm like, holy shit.
2110900	2112620	Can we see the video online somewhere?
2112620	2118320	I'm uploading the videos online, again, everybody, I know it's gonna take a while to upload it
2118320	2122800	on YouTube at 60 frames a second at 1080p, because YouTube actually allows you to do
2122800	2124900	60 frames a second videos now.
2124900	2125900	Like the super high-def stuff?
2125900	2126900	Mm-hmm.
2126900	2127900	Well, congrats to you.
2127900	2128900	What song did you do?
2128900	2133040	Actually, I'll just stay tuned for YouTube to find out.
2133040	2134040	Oh, you.
2134040	2135040	Oh, you.
2135040	2136040	All right.
2136040	2137040	Sorry.
2137040	2138040	So what did you get?
2138040	2140880	Did you win something for second place, or was it like a winner-takes-all sort of thing?
2140880	2145400	I got some prizes supported by Andamir, like shirts and all that other stuff.
2145400	2151440	But if it was a World Pump Festival, on the other hand, if the World Pump Festival occurred,
2151440	2154560	this last specific year, I would have been guaranteed a world championship offer.
2154560	2158800	Yeah, I was gonna say, do you get to, because you're at least like top three, do you get
2158800	2162680	to go to what, Korea or something and participate in the world there?
2162680	2165760	There has not been an announcement of a World Pump Festival championships yet.
2165760	2166760	Oh, okay.
2166760	2172680	But if it's announced, top two of any division, whether it's Women's Speed, Men's Speed, or
2172680	2177040	Freestyle, are eligible to go to wherever the country that they hold the World Pump
2177040	2184120	Festival for free, which includes like paid flights, paid food, paid hotels and stuff.
2184120	2185120	Well, look at you.
2185120	2187160	We're in the presence of pump royalty right now.
2187160	2188160	That's amazing.
2188160	2189960	And good on the CM Punk thing.
2189960	2191680	Oh, thank you.
2191680	2192680	The pose.
2192680	2193680	Yeah.
2193680	2194680	Oh, yeah.
2194680	2195680	Stay tuned for the videos.
2195680	2196680	All right.
2196680	2198400	I'm sorry we're not getting the videos up on time, but.
2198400	2199400	All right.
2199400	2202160	Well, you can't come here on this program and not have something to promote.
2202160	2205680	So now you've got to get it up because the podcasters are going to go looking for it,
2205680	2206680	wanting to see it.
2206680	2207680	So.
2207680	2208680	All right.
2208680	2209680	Again, I'll post it up soon.
2209680	2210680	All right.
2210680	2211680	Sounds good.
2211680	2212680	Sounds good.
2212680	2213680	I hope you do get to participate in a world finals.
2213680	2214680	That's crazy.
2214680	2215680	Good.
2215680	2217640	How much prep did it take you to do something like that?
2217640	2219680	This one took me a while because I'll be honest.
2219680	2226400	Last year I actually competed really tired and sleepy and stuff and unprepared.
2226400	2229320	This time I actually came in more prepared and with more sleep.
2229320	2230320	Good.
2230320	2231320	Sleep is important.
2232040	2233040	And with new ideas.
2233040	2234040	Yes.
2234040	2236760	New freestyle ideas I don't think I've ever seen before.
2236760	2238760	Oh, well, look at you.
2238760	2241680	Chatters want to know where's your YouTube channel so we can find the thing when it's
2241680	2242680	posted.
2242680	2249120	You can go if you go to YouTube, just research on TBAGR space gaming or TBAGR space media
2249120	2251240	because it's the same name, which is.
2251240	2253920	You mean an underscore?
2253920	2255920	You can go YouTube just type in teabagger.
2255920	2260440	Hopefully they've all liked the teabagger page on Facebook by now and they will be able
2260480	2261680	to see it on there.
2261680	2264000	So that's the best way to do it right with 404 likes.
2264000	2267200	So hopefully that's good.
2267200	2268200	Sounds good.
2268200	2269360	Well, congrats.
2269360	2274440	That's so awesome that you have second place in the United States for Pump It Up.
2274440	2275440	That's amazing.
2275440	2276440	Thank you.
2276440	2277440	Congrats.
2277440	2278440	How much?
2278440	2279440	How much do you still play?
2279440	2280440	Do you play that game like every week?
2280440	2285080	And surprisingly, I came back at like last year's because I'll try one more time since
2285080	2290040	before I get too old for competitions to actually compete in the finals for you as
2290040	2291040	a lifetime.
2291040	2294120	Do they have an H cap or is it just like, there's no H cap.
2294120	2295120	Okay.
2295120	2296120	So I could compete if I wanted to.
2296120	2297120	Yes.
2297120	2298120	Fuck yeah.
2298120	2304520	I mean, like for example, this one Mexican male speeder who was actually 35 and got second
2304520	2305520	place last year.
2305520	2306520	Oh nice.
2306520	2307520	Yeah.
2307520	2308520	35 years old.
2308520	2309520	Way to wrap the 30 somethings.
2309520	2310520	Awesome.
2310520	2312560	I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be the first 40 year old to win a freestyle
2312560	2313560	competition.
2313560	2314560	Awesome.
2315040	2316040	Live on stage.
2316040	2317040	Watch.
2317040	2318040	All right.
2318040	2319040	That's awesome.
2319040	2320040	Actually that doesn't remind me.
2320040	2324680	Wasn't there like a DDR routine way back in the day where some dude was on crutches and
2324680	2327440	got up on the DDR machine on crutches and he like threw him to the side.
2327440	2329040	Like he wasn't really injured the whole time.
2329040	2330400	I swear to God that was the thing.
2330400	2336480	I saw a video a long time ago of someone doing pero with crutches, but they didn't throw
2336480	2337480	them away.
2337480	2339480	They actually, Oh, maybe that might be confusing.
2339480	2340480	That might be the one.
2340480	2341480	It's been a long time.
2341480	2343460	Y'all been a long time.
2343460	2345500	Everybody in chat will know what I'm talking about.
2345500	2346500	All right.
2346500	2347500	Well, congrats.
2347500	2351140	Uh, of course Jonas will be just staying with us throughout the show to comment on the news
2351140	2355940	as we get to things, but let's talk about our gaming weeks and what types of video games
2355940	2357580	you have been playing this week.
2357580	2358580	Dark Sakura.
2358580	2363960	Uh, I've been playing Hatoful Boyfriend because I'm still live streaming it, which, uh, after
2363960	2366180	the week of Thanksgiving, my schedule will change.
2366180	2371740	So my streaming day will change, but for right now I'm still streaming on Tuesdays roughly
2371740	2377180	between four 30 and six, you know, is when I'll start and then it's about an hour.
2377180	2382620	Uh, I have three endings left to do of the regular game and then I have the hurtful boyfriend
2382620	2383620	path.
2383620	2391660	Um, uh, other than that, I'm also playing final fantasy 14 and uh, I don't know, thinking
2391660	2395660	about going to play some other stuff, I just haven't decided, but I've got dragon age on
2395660	2396660	Mondays.
2396660	2398260	You'll never hear from me again.
2398260	2399260	Yay.
2399260	2407260	Dragon age and lots of, uh, bust a move cause there's a new version on iOS.
2407260	2408260	Okay.
2408260	2410260	All right.
2410260	2412860	Um, let's see.
2412860	2414220	This week actually played some stuff.
2414220	2421020	I played more Call of Duty and um, I think I'm up to level 19 now on multiplayer.
2421020	2428460	And then I played, what else, um, a little bit more, uh, infamous second son.
2428460	2429980	It's still kind of okay with it.
2429980	2430980	I don't know.
2430980	2434940	I'm starting to like it a little bit more, um, as playing through the game.
2434940	2439460	Um, some of the mini game or like not mini games with little missions and they're kind
2439460	2440460	of dumb.
2440460	2445700	Um, I don't like how you can kind of do collateral damage to pedestrians and it counts against
2445700	2446700	you.
2446700	2451060	Cause I'm not, it's like, listen, you had me do that move and it's supposed to destroy
2451060	2452060	all this stuff.
2452060	2454260	I can't help it if I kill a few innocent people along the way.
2454260	2458380	It's not like I'm trying to do that, but uh, I don't know.
2458380	2459380	It's pretty fun.
2459380	2465420	And then, uh, I played a little bit of, um, Lego Marvel superheroes, play the demo kiosks
2465420	2468060	for the Xbox one that had that on there.
2468060	2472260	And so I played that with my son a little bit and he's kind of interested in it.
2472260	2473780	Um, it's pretty cool looking.
2473780	2479920	Uh, the, the song that they have though, they have a song that's on, I'm assuming it's both
2479920	2484540	the digital version and um, the disc version when you pop in the game.
2484540	2489060	You know how like if you're navigating through stuff on PlayStation, um, little cross media
2489060	2492360	bar thing that it'll play kind of music sometimes.
2492360	2493860	It's got like some, I don't even know what it is.
2493860	2498940	It sounds like an old song about like Marvel, but it's just like so weird.
2498940	2502500	It like, it fits, but it's just kind of silly.
2502500	2507460	I didn't even know what it was, but um, so that's kind of cool.
2507460	2508460	And um, what else they play?
2508460	2513060	I played a binding of Isaac rebirth a little bit, so I'm didn't make it very far.
2513060	2518860	I only played it for like maybe like 20 minutes, but I got down to the second basement and
2518860	2520300	um, kind of played through that.
2520300	2521300	It was kind of fun.
2521300	2522980	Uh, it's kind of a silly game.
2522980	2527620	And then I tried a little bit of picks the cat and didn't really get into that too much.
2527620	2528620	Boogs.
2528620	2529620	That game is awesome.
2529620	2532460	Yeah, but I couldn't really get into binding of Isaac rebirth.
2532460	2536620	I don't, I played it a little bit on PC when it was first out and I tried to play it again
2536620	2538100	on PS4 and I'm not, I'm not feeling it.
2538100	2539100	I'm sorry to say.
2539100	2540100	Yeah, it's okay.
2540100	2541100	I don't know.
2541100	2543940	I don't like indie titles like that, but I just, you know, some people like extroverts
2543940	2544940	obsessed with it.
2544940	2545940	So, you know, that's cool.
2545940	2546940	Yeah.
2546940	2547940	Um, and then what else?
2547940	2550700	Oh, I'm more ninja bots and we've got two controllers now.
2550700	2555660	So we've been, I was playing a little bit of that, uh, with Josh and so that's pretty
2555660	2556660	cool.
2556660	2559100	And then what else did they do?
2559100	2561220	Um, I think that's it.
2561220	2562860	I think that's all I've played.
2562860	2566140	Uh, but grand theft auto next week.
2566140	2567140	That's right.
2567140	2568140	It's already downloaded and ready.
2568140	2569140	Get ready.
2569140	2570140	Can't wait.
2570180	2571180	Next week.
2571180	2574740	Uh, I played more Final Fantasy 14, of course, because you know, MMOs, um, I've been really
2574740	2579020	tempted to go back to wow, but so far I've resisted and that's because people are seeming
2579020	2582860	to really love this new expansion when they can get into the game, which you know, a lot
2582860	2586220	of that settled down over the weekend, but they're seeming to really love the expansion.
2586220	2587220	So I don't know.
2587220	2590020	I'm teetering on the fence, but right now I'm like, all right, look, I got like three
2590020	2592220	console games to buy next week.
2592220	2593660	One MMO is more than enough right now.
2593660	2597140	If I try to get into a second MMO, none of these console games are gonna get played and
2597140	2598140	I can't have that.
2598140	2599140	So, uh, we'll see.
2599140	2602020	But anyway, I am still continuing on with Final Fantasy 14.
2602020	2603940	There are other online games I'm continuing to play.
2603940	2605820	I still am playing Diablo three.
2605820	2608020	Uh, I was playing my seasonal hardcore character.
2608020	2611060	I'm up to about Paragon 20 now on that character.
2611060	2615480	And then I was also playing my regular character, my non hardcore, non seasonal character, just
2615480	2619300	because I was like, I need to do some greater rifts because I hadn't really done a lot of
2619300	2620300	that since it came out.
2620300	2621980	So I wanted to try that feature a little more.
2621980	2625860	So I was playing that Diablo three also been playing heroes of the storm.
2625860	2629100	You might remember last week when I came back from Blizzcon, I was like, you know, I wasn't
2629140	2632980	really feeling super energized on wow coming out of Blizzcon, but I'm like, I've been missing
2632980	2633980	out on heroes of the storm.
2633980	2635140	I got to play more of this.
2635140	2637980	So sure enough, I've been, I've been playing quite a bit more heroes of the storm.
2637980	2641580	I really enjoy playing Lele, uh, Valla, the demon hunter.
2641580	2645020	I even found that I really liked playing Mirrodin, which I didn't think I would enjoy, but I
2645020	2646020	do.
2646020	2649580	Uh, so yeah, I'm, I'm shocked at some of the characters I'm finding.
2649580	2655440	I really enjoy playing in this game and, uh, just that I am having fun with this MOBA game.
2655440	2658780	When if you go back a year on the show and I talked about, I really tried to get into
2658820	2659820	Dota to you guys.
2659820	2663020	I really tried to get into League of Legends, you guys, but I'm really, I'm just so bad
2663020	2664020	at the game.
2664020	2666140	I don't know what I'm doing, but I feel like heroes.
2666140	2669900	I can kind of understand it a little differently and I think it's probably because it's toned
2669900	2670900	down a little bit.
2670900	2674300	It is an entry level MOBA and for somebody like me, that's great.
2674300	2675300	Not to knock the other games.
2675300	2679540	I understand why they're big, but just as an entry level game, heroes is really, really
2679540	2680540	good.
2680540	2686060	Um, so besides those, I've also been playing Mario Kart eight because the new DLC came
2686060	2687060	out this week.
2687180	2692220	I was talking earlier, uh, that, you know, if you haven't jumped into a game or if you
2692220	2695360	haven't played Mario Kart eight in a couple of months, you probably put it in and checked
2695360	2697660	it out this week because of the new DLC.
2697660	2700060	And uh, yeah, it's a, it's a strong DLC pack.
2700060	2703740	Uh, I kind of think that there's really only one new character.
2703740	2709020	I think Tanooki Mario and cat peach or whatever, kind of a stretch for new characters, but
2709020	2710080	all right, whatever.
2710080	2711820	But having link is awesome.
2711820	2713420	Having the new cars is pretty cool.
2713420	2717040	Uh, and the new tracks, it's really about the tracks and the, the tracks are, are, are
2717040	2718920	are pretty good for the most part.
2718920	2720960	Um, like I love the Zelda track.
2720960	2722240	The Zelda tracks are great.
2722240	2726760	Uh, I especially love the fact that instead of collecting coins, you get rupees, they
2726760	2727920	change it to rupees.
2727920	2731640	And when you run over the question mark blocks, instead of the usual roulette noise, it makes,
2731640	2734880	it goes, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
2734880	2735880	and then your item comes up.
2735880	2739720	Like it's those little changes like that that make that course really a lot, a lot of fun
2739720	2740720	to play.
2740720	2744760	Um, now you're probably wondering what I think about the F zero course.
2744800	2748160	And my answer honestly is, eh, eh.
2748160	2749960	It's not an F zero game.
2749960	2755160	And honestly it just feels like an F zero skin on what is otherwise a very Mario Kart
2755160	2756440	course.
2756440	2761820	And I was not really a fan of the Mute City remix because they, it's kind of super jazz,
2761820	2766600	like saxophone, like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
2766600	2769760	Like it's like, ugh, no, they, did Kenny G perform in this?
2769760	2770960	I don't know how to feel, I don't know.
2770960	2775760	But I mean, I get that it fits in with the other Mario Kart stages, but it just, I didn't
2775760	2776760	like that.
2776760	2780960	I was not my, I rejected that remix, I didn't care for it.
2780960	2782160	But whatever.
2782160	2784340	The Excitebike remix was really good though.
2784340	2786120	That was, that was a really awesome song.
2786120	2791000	The stage was a little boring because it's a big oval with just a bunch of ramps that
2791000	2793960	are straight out of what you used to see in the Excitebike games.
2793960	2799540	So like that stage for what it is, is pretty cool, you know, but it's not like the most
2799540	2801100	exciting thing in the world.
2801100	2803700	So yeah, played some Mario Kart 8 as well.
2803700	2809740	So and then, randomly the other night, I played a couple stages of Kid Icarus on Virtual Console.
2809740	2812860	That's right, 8-bit, hard as hell, Kid Icarus.
2812860	2813860	Why?
2813860	2816500	Because I realized I didn't have Metroid on the Wii U for some reason.
2816500	2819860	I was gonna play Metroid, and for some reason I don't have that on Wii U Virtual Console,
2819860	2821940	and I was like, yeah, I don't want to spend any more money.
2821940	2824780	I'll play what I have, and I have Kid Icarus, so I played a little bit of that.
2824780	2826780	That's where that ended up.
2826780	2827780	Alright.
2827780	2828780	Let's see.
2829020	2834020	I saw someone in chat telling me that, Cat Peach purrs, it's disgustingly adorable.
2834020	2840700	Let's see, Akuma JP says, I am sick, I heard Sky say, instead of coins, you get rabies.
2840700	2845660	No, no, no, no, no, Cat Peach does not get rabies, Akuma JP, that would be, that would
2845660	2852060	be a whole other game, that would be Zombie U2, featuring Peach, no, no, rupees, rupees,
2852060	2855660	the official currency of Hyrule, rupees.
2855660	2857420	Do they call, do they call them something else in Japan?
2857580	2859580	Do they have a different name over there?
2859580	2860580	It's rupees in Japan as well?
2860580	2861580	Okay, there we go.
2861580	2867940	Alright, sadly absent, sadly absent from the Zelda DLC, I will say, this is a perfect opportunity,
2867940	2869060	it's not there.
2869060	2874220	You could have had Tingle as the flag waver on the Zelda course.
2874220	2878460	Where was my Tingle on that course?
2878460	2879460	Come on.
2879460	2880460	Loki?
2880460	2882040	Come on, you gotta be disappointed at that too.
2882040	2884540	No Tingle in the Zelda DLC?
2884540	2885540	No.
2885540	2886540	It's travesty.
2886660	2887660	What are they doing?
2887660	2889420	Could be an easter egg, who knows.
2889420	2892860	Maybe, maybe I gotta like, up, up, down, down, left, right, maybe that's how they get Tingle
2892860	2893860	to show up.
2893860	2894860	It's kinda like flappy-vog.
2894860	2900260	Alright, anyway, alright, let's move on.
2900260	2903300	Jonas, how about you, what kind of games have you been playing this week besides, you know,
2903300	2905180	like, you know, winning competitions and shit?
2905180	2912900	Okay, now that I came back, I did play a bit of Mario Kart 8, decided to try a couple
2912900	2913900	of tracks.
2913900	2915900	What'd you think of the new tracks?
2916860	2919540	The new ice levels were actually pretty nifty.
2919540	2922660	The shortcuts were a little bit more difficult than most other shortcuts in the game, it's
2922660	2927300	like, oh, this is gonna be an interesting challenge, let's try it.
2927300	2932660	The excite bike, I mean, that's actually pretty fun, despite the fact that it is, quote, boring.
2932660	2937860	Well, at least it gives people an excuse that Baby Park is not coming back.
2937860	2939820	Fuck that course.
2939820	2941620	No Baby Park.
2942620	2947140	Yeah, we need Waluigi Pinball, though, if Waluigi Pinball doesn't show up in the Animal
2947140	2951540	Kart, or Animal Kart, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, why don't I just throw it together as
2951540	2955700	Animal Kart, if Waluigi Pinball is not one of the retro courses coming, I'm gonna be
2955700	2956700	pissed.
2956700	2957700	I'm gonna be pissed.
2957700	2958700	That course is so fun.
2958700	2960700	I thought that was already one of the courses.
2960700	2965380	No, it's in the 3DS, but it's not, it's no.
2965380	2969700	And I believe Waluigi Pinball was originally in the Wii version, right?
2970700	2972580	I thought the regular DS.
2972580	2974860	Maybe, no, you're right, it was the regular DS.
2974860	2979860	Anyway, so yeah, that's the one retro course I haven't seen yet that I wanna see is Waluigi
2979860	2980860	Pinball.
2980860	2987980	Let's see, the dragon course is actually pretty interesting for its design as well.
2987980	2992020	F-Zero is like one of the only courses where coins do not show up, you have to actually
2992020	2996900	recharge your coins, which is actually an interesting feature for those who have been
2996900	3003500	waiting for F-Zero but can't get an F-Zero game for the Wii U as of yet, who knows, given
3003500	3007340	how popular Mario Kart 8 is.
3007340	3010660	What other games are you playing this week, anything else besides Mario Kart 8?
3010660	3015540	Unfortunately, no, because right now I've been busy with other stuff at the moment and
3015540	3023420	hopefully catch up with Pokemon or us and of course Smash Brothers next week.
3023420	3028420	I'm very excited about Smash Brothers next week because I can't get into it on the 3DS
3028420	3033500	the way I can on a console, so I'm very excited to be able to sit on the couch and really
3033500	3037940	get into the Smash Brothers game, it's gonna be fun, if I can put down Dragon Age and Little
3037940	3039940	Big Planet 3, which I'm also getting next week.
3039940	3041460	Ooh, I forgot about Little Big Planet 3.
3041460	3042460	Right?
3042460	3045860	I was just saying that before you got here, I was like, Little Big Planet 3, when that
3045860	3049300	is the release that's kind of bubbling under compared to other things, you know you have
3049300	3050300	a big week.
3050300	3051300	You have a big, big week.
3051300	3054100	Yeah, I mean I played in E3 and oh my god that's amazing.
3054100	3055100	Alright.
3055100	3058420	Anyway, let's see, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, we have a little bit of housekeeping
3058420	3059740	then we'll get into some gaming news.
3059740	3062500	For housekeeping tonight, a couple big things to talk to you about.
3062500	3066020	First off, YYR is gonna be here on the show tonight, a little later in the show, we're
3066020	3069500	gonna talk to him, probably at the top of part B is when we're gonna talk to him.
3069500	3075780	The reason why he's coming on the show tonight, he is here to unveil a new OLR inspired game
3075780	3078140	that is releasing tonight.
3078140	3083460	A new OLR inspired game releasing tonight, YYR is here to talk about that, so we're gonna
3083460	3084860	get that later in the show.
3084860	3087720	If you haven't checked that, if you're newer to the show and you didn't know about this,
3087720	3091980	if your 360 is still hooked up, you've got like, spend the dollar, you probably have
3091980	3097980	the fucking points and change them out, spend the dollar on Bungie Ferret Tossing, which
3097980	3101660	is in the XNA Arcade, the, what do they call it?
3101660	3102660	Indie games.
3102660	3104700	Indie games, the indie games section of 360.
3104700	3109580	Look for Bungie Ferret Tossing, that was the first YYR OLR inspired game.
3109580	3113340	And to be fair, to give YYR some of the plugs, he's done some other really good games.
3113340	3114340	Snake 360.
3114340	3119820	Snake 360 was a lot of falling, was totally underrated, I think he told me he didn't sell
3119820	3124300	a lot of copies of that, which really sucks, because that really kind of is a throwback
3124300	3126020	to like old 80s arcade games.
3126020	3129620	He needs to port that stuff, that'd be a green iOS game, I bet.
3129620	3130620	Yeah, I bet.
3130620	3134460	So anyway, so just a big plug for YYR Games and what he's doing, and hey, people that
3134460	3139380	are gonna take the dumb shit that comes out of our mouths and actually turn it into games,
3139380	3141700	we gotta applaud that, we've got to applaud that, so.
3141700	3143900	I have to keep being clever.
3143900	3149660	Yeah, I hear this game, this game was you, it was something that came out of your mouth,
3149660	3153340	that's what I know, it's something you said, Dark Sakura, became this game, that's all
3153340	3154340	I know.
3154340	3157820	Because I'm such a lovely and polite young lady.
3157820	3163420	Oh lord, here we go, now we're not, can we get an OLR dream game that's like, keep Jamie's
3163420	3170420	ego in check, fit Jamie's ego through the door, fit Jamie, your ego and Gemet's ego
3170420	3172500	could do battle, it would be like a.
3172500	3176460	How about this, ego buffer.
3176460	3179300	Or I have to wax your ego.
3179300	3182900	And then you have to buffer the size of it, so that it will filter properly.
3182900	3188820	Alright, YYR is saying, by the way, tonight's game, not a 360 game, tonight's game is a
3188820	3191300	browser game for free.
3191300	3195780	So that's right, I like free as well, so get ready, y'all ready for this, cause he's gonna
3195780	3197660	be on the show later to talk about this.
3197660	3201780	So I have an excite, I know I'm excited too, good times, are you enjoying?
3201780	3202780	I am.
3202780	3207120	Alright, also of note, mark your calendars folks, December 7th, we're gonna be doing
3207120	3212660	something a little special here at OLR, I get asked, we all get asked, several times
3212660	3218620	throughout the year, you know, I love your show, but you're on way too late for me, you're
3218620	3223380	on too late in the day for me, I live in the UK, and you guys are on at like 3 in the
3223380	3226420	morning, I wanna participate with your show, but I can't, cause you're overseas, well mark
3226420	3233340	your calendars for December 7th, cause OLR on December 7th will be at noon pacific time,
3233340	3238940	OLR will be broadcasting at noon pacific time on December 7th, so for those of you guys
3238940	3239940	overseas.
3239940	3241220	This will be 8 o'clock in the UK.
3241220	3248300	8pm in the UK, and a distinct time zone shift for many of you folks, so look out for that.
3248300	3253940	Now don't worry, if you are the person that is here religiously every week at 6 o'clock
3253940	3259860	pacific time, as we usually tape at, the show will rebroadcast in its entirety whatever
3259860	3265380	is done at noon, we'll rebroadcast unedited at 6pm, right, or whenever Bobby finishes
3265380	3267700	his show that night.
3267700	3272260	The reason why we're doing this, Dark Soccer and I are going to a holiday event in the
3272260	3276100	Bay Area with a mutual friend of ours, we're gonna eat a lot of food and drink, yes, so
3276100	3280300	we thought, you know what, this is a great, we want to tape the show in advance, a lot
3280300	3284080	of our overseas folks say, when are you gonna do a show earlier in the day, this is a way
3284080	3287980	we can kind of kill two birds with one stone, Dark Soccer and I can do our dinner, and those
3287980	3291180	that want to participate that live in a different time zone will have their opportunity.
3291180	3295620	Of course, I'm not saying, if you happen to be west coast or east coast, and you want
3295620	3300700	to be here at noon, or 3pm or whatever, no you're not allowed, you can still come, it's
3300700	3304860	not like UK only or whatever, but this will be your chance, so mark your calendar for
3304860	3307640	December 7th.
3307640	3308640	So there you go.
3308640	3309640	Alright.
3309640	3313420	And you have some folks in chat asking, so what time is that, and Jamie's saying, well
3313420	3319140	what time is it now, cause that's the time it's gonna be at, well it's 7pm now, so it'll
3319140	3320140	be...
3320140	3324860	Well no, I'm trying to figure time difference for what time noon would be, so like for right
3324860	3325860	now...
3325860	3329180	7 hours behind now, wherever you're at, anyway.
3329180	3332940	So, like where Ekuma is, it's already tomorrow I think?
3332940	3338100	Yeah, sadly I think Ekuma will get stuck in one of those time zones where noon is overnight
3338100	3342660	unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, but you know, it's one show, it's one show, and it will
3342660	3347660	rebroadcast at 6 o'clock, so I'm just, you know, this way Dark Soccer and I can be festive,
3347660	3348660	dammit.
3348660	3350900	I think it'd be like 3am for you, sorry.
3350900	3356420	Yeah, sorry to say, I think Japan's gonna get the overnight on that, but again...
3356420	3357420	Right now it's noon.
3357420	3360740	Yeah, and it will rebroadcast at 6pm, so just saying.
3360780	3364580	It's one show, guys, it's one show, Dark Soccer and I have to go eat a lot of turkey.
3364580	3366140	Nom nom nom.
3366140	3368380	Alright, so that's December 7th.
3368380	3372580	Alright, that's it for housekeeping that I can think of, let's get into some gaming news.
3372580	3376660	There's been a lot more than Assassin's Creed stuff and Sonic stuff going on this week,
3376660	3377660	so let's get into it.
3377660	3378660	Loki.
3378660	3382500	So, Sony announced this week that they're gonna be bringing a cloud-based TV service
3382500	3388100	to consoles called PlayStation Vue, and what it's gonna...
3388140	3392420	I guess it's gonna debut on PlayStation 4 and PS3, and they're even saying it's gonna
3392420	3398940	come to non-Sony devices, I guess, tablets and that kind of stuff.
3398940	3400260	What exactly is it gonna contain?
3400260	3408380	I have no fucking clue, and they said, you know, it is gonna be competitively priced.
3408380	3412620	And I don't know, based on the screenshots I've seen, it looks kind of like, you know,
3412620	3416460	you're like a Netflix or something, but one of the things that they did say is besides
3416460	3421740	like on-demand stuff, I think they're also gonna have actual streaming stuff, like it's
3421740	3428940	gonna be like TV, where you're gonna have stuff being broadcast and that kind of thing.
3428940	3437060	So I don't know, I'm kind of excited because I don't pay for TV, and to be fair, I know
3437060	3441340	Microsoft had originally talked about doing some cloud-based stuff, and that kind of fell
3441340	3446220	through, I guess, and I know Sony probably is in a little bit better position to do that
3446220	3449860	since they also are a media company that produces content.
3449860	3452700	And Microsoft scrapped theirs, unfortunately, yeah.
3452700	3458300	So it would be nice if that was a part of PlayStation Plus, but...
3458300	3460300	Yeah, well, don't hold your breath.
3460300	3463700	Here's the thing that I don't get, well, you know how they're talking about that PlayStation
3463700	3466660	Now is likely to have a subscription service in the future?
3466660	3468580	What do you want to bet it's tied to this?
3468580	3472060	You know, it'd be like a PlayStation Super Plus or something, I don't know, who knows
3472060	3473060	what they'll call it.
3473060	3475240	Whatever it is, if it makes sense.
3475240	3478700	Maybe details to come at that experience event in December, who knows?
3478700	3479700	Could be.
3479700	3480700	Could be.
3480700	3481700	This could be something they're going to talk about.
3481700	3490560	But anyway, my question is, how is Sony expecting to get away with launching a cable competitor
3490560	3492680	on cable internet?
3492680	3500960	Like surely Comcast and Time Warner are looking at this going, wait a damn minute.
3500960	3501960	Or can they?
3501960	3504000	Would that be antitrust if they tried to block it?
3504040	3505040	I think it would be.
3505040	3508640	I don't think they really have a say, I mean, I don't know.
3508640	3510640	Like for example, they're saying right now, the partners that they have...
3510640	3515280	This is why net neutrality is important, because if we don't get net neutrality, then these
3515280	3520400	companies can block this because they don't want the competition.
3520400	3521400	But if we have net neutrality, they will do that.
3521400	3522560	Well, they're not going to block it.
3522560	3523560	They're not going to block it.
3523560	3527200	What they're going to do is they're just not going to partner with them to provide stuff.
3527200	3530400	But it's kind of twofold.
3530400	3536560	It's one, they want to have their product in as many places as possible to get revenue
3536560	3538320	from that streaming stuff.
3538320	3542480	That's ideally how it should be, is where let's get our content on as many things as
3542480	3543480	possible.
3543480	3549860	But then sometimes they get greedy and they want that revenue to be just strictly coming
3549860	3550860	to them.
3550860	3554560	They don't want to have partial revenue coming from other things.
3554560	3561720	So right now they've got some of the partners, CBS, Fox, Viacom, so your MTV, Comedy Central,
3561720	3562720	that's kind of stuff.
3562720	3564680	Well, that's all an extension of CBS anyway.
3564680	3569720	Discovery Communications, NBC Universal, Scripps Network Interactive, which I have no fucking
3569720	3570720	clue with that.
3570720	3575240	Okay, interesting the NBC's on there though, because NBC is Comcast now.
3575240	3584520	So yeah, and of course they also said that Disney and Time Warner are in active discussions.
3584560	3587560	So nothing firmed out yet on that.
3587560	3590840	So Disney's a holdout, which is kind of a big deal because that's ABC.
3590840	3594280	Well Disney I thought was supposed to be doing their own thing, like they want their own
3594280	3595280	service.
3595280	3596280	I heard.
3596280	3597280	Yeah, they do.
3597280	3599400	But that's more of a Netflix competitor.
3599400	3603280	But still, Disney, they're very picky choosy on what they do with that.
3603280	3605000	But Disney does include ABC.
3605000	3608400	Disney owns ABC, which is a whole big broadcast network.
3608400	3609760	What are the big shows on ABC right now?
3609760	3613280	I keep thinking Lost, but that's been off the air for Lord knows how long.
3613280	3614280	Oh, Scandal.
3614280	3615440	I like that show.
3615440	3619400	Olivia Pope will not be on the, uh, the last season.
3619400	3620400	I love Scandal.
3620400	3621400	Shut up.
3621400	3622400	Yeah.
3622400	3623400	But that's already, that's on Netflix.
3623400	3624400	You just wait a year.
3624400	3625400	That's true.
3625400	3626400	I don't know.
3626400	3627400	It's not a big deal.
3627400	3628400	All right.
3628400	3629400	Fair enough.
3629400	3630400	Happy endings.
3630400	3631400	I love that show.
3631400	3633600	They scrapped that too.
3633600	3634800	Maybe ABC kind of sucks.
3634800	3635800	They keep getting rid of the shows.
3635800	3636800	I like, I don't know.
3636800	3637800	All right.
3637800	3638800	Anyhow.
3638800	3642680	Um, well, I, I'm looking forward to more details on this.
3642680	3647200	I'm hoping we'll see some of it at the PlayStation event in Vegas in a few weeks.
3647200	3652300	Meanwhile, I mentioned there's a lot of drama going on, uh, this week and some of it is
3652300	3654920	around World of Warcraft.
3654920	3660160	The new expansion for World's Warcraft Warlords of Draenor came out this week and, uh, lots
3660160	3662000	of technical issues going on.
3662000	3665200	Lots and lots of technical issues happening with the game's launch.
3665200	3670400	Um, part of what's to blame for these issues is that Blizzard is saying that they are getting
3670400	3676000	a DDOS attacked, uh, right at the same time that they're trying to launch the game.
3676000	3682200	I can't imagine that the comments that were made at BlizzCon have anything to do with
3682200	3688160	why they suddenly became a DDOS target, but I'm sure Blizzard's always a DDOS target as
3688160	3689160	well.
3689160	3690160	That plays into it.
3690160	3691160	Yeah.
3691160	3692160	I don't know if I'd necessarily blame that.
3692160	3693160	It's just, you know.
3693160	3697040	The, I'm sorry, but there's that part of me that goes, you know, the internet sucks sometimes
3697040	3699600	and I wonder if that didn't make them a target.
3699600	3702640	But I kind of think World of Warcraft is always a target.
3702640	3708000	I sort of think that's always a target for, you know, uh, script kiddies and wannabe hackers
3708000	3714480	to want to attack, uh, to get a little attention to whatever thing they're pissed off about.
3714480	3720080	Um, so anyway, Blizzard blaming the DDOS attacks for a lot of their server issues and to combat
3720080	3724320	it, they had to severely limit the amount of people that could log into the game.
3724320	3728520	So players were looking at queues of thousands of people ahead of them.
3728520	3732720	One of my friends on Twitter waited 10 hours to get into our server yesterday and it was
3732720	3737480	one of those log in to get in the queue, go out, do something with the day and then come
3737480	3739500	back and maybe you'll be able to play later at night.
3739500	3742840	Now I'm hearing the expansions really good.
3742840	3745600	They're saying it is the best expansion since Burning Crusade.
3745600	3750600	Again, I'm hearing this from work, from, from fans on my Twitter that are kind of slant
3750600	3754800	that I met through Horde House that are already kind of slanted pro wow.
3754800	3758000	But I mean, that's a pretty strong endorsement that in spite of all those technical issues,
3758000	3761480	people are still really enjoying the game once they get in there.
3761480	3764480	Not everybody having such a happy experience though.
3764480	3771040	One of the folks that really took a stand against what's going on is the administrator
3771040	3775220	of the large Reddit community r slash wow.
3775220	3781440	The administrator of that community chose to shut down r slash wow until he could log
3781440	3783040	into the game.
3783040	3790080	Basically, there was a lot of crap going up onto the main Reddit Warcraft Reddit about
3790080	3794400	like screenshots of queue times, just like the same types of crappy posts over and over
3794400	3795400	again.
3795400	3796920	And the administrator was getting sick of it.
3796920	3800900	But a lot of folks also seeing this as the administrator just lashing out that because
3800900	3806640	they can't log into the game, that they're going to take it out on the entire 200,000
3806640	3810920	almost user base that is on Reddit for World of Warcraft.
3811000	3818120	In fact, earlier this evening, this is unfolding live as we're on air earlier this evening,
3818120	3822480	the wow Reddit was shut down once again, it opened up finally, I guess the guy could log
3822480	3823480	in.
3823480	3826640	But by then a lot of people were just basically like fuck you and your power trip, we're going
3826640	3828020	to a new Reddit.
3828020	3833880	And it is down again with a message from the moderators of r slash wow, the World of Warcraft
3833880	3837280	subreddit has been shut down due to doxing.
3837280	3841920	That message changed early about an hour ago, it said, there's a bunch of other World of
3841920	3844520	Warcraft Reddits out there, you can go check one of them out.
3844520	3850200	So this, this guy who's an administrator is having a fit, and basically shut down the
3850200	3851200	Reddit over it.
3851200	3853940	And a lot of people are saying, can't you take the Reddit away from him?
3853940	3856800	Can you petition the admins of Reddit to take it away from him?
3856800	3860800	But the answer a lot of people are getting is, that's not how Reddit works.
3860800	3864640	You make a subreddit, you can do anything you want with it, essentially, you're the
3864640	3865640	moderator of that.
3865640	3867400	So why don't they just make another one?
3867400	3869200	That's what a lot of people are doing.
3869200	3873600	But what's happening now, guess, guess what's happening as a result of that, Darsagra?
3873600	3877520	It's getting diluted, because everybody wants to make the new, everybody wants to make the
3877520	3879000	new World of Warcraft subreddit.
3879000	3884800	So you have r slash real wow, you have some people that are taking it to r slash Warcraft,
3884800	3888000	although those people are like, wait a minute, this is for lore discussion.
3888000	3891880	There's another one I just saw on Twitter, world underscore of underscore Warcraft.
3891880	3893480	What were some of the other ones?
3893480	3894480	I don't know.
3894720	3898120	Now what's happening is like five different people are launching World of Warcraft ones,
3898120	3900240	and no, you know, where's everybody gonna end up?
3900240	3902240	Who knows?
3902240	3910080	r slash wow was a pretty catchy, easy World of Warcraft sub, so, yeesh.
3910080	3914400	Dungeon Buster in chat says, did someone call the Wambulance for him?
3914400	3918720	Tiger Claw says, people take wow so seriously, good thing I'm not a part of it.
3918960	3926560	It should be noted that Blizzard's community management team endorsed Reddit's wow community
3926560	3932360	as an official fan community of sorts, and you can bet that a lot of that is in question
3932360	3935240	over the past couple days and what's unfolded there.
3935240	3940080	One of the CMs basically called the guy out on Twitter and said, this probably isn't the
3940080	3942600	best way to handle the situation.
3942600	3947240	It was professional, it wasn't like, fuck you asshole, which is probably what a lot
3947240	3951160	of people are saying to this guy, but, you know, it was a little more professional than
3951160	3952160	that.
3952160	3953160	Let's see.
3953160	3958680	Seattle in chat saying, usually you can't take over a Reddit unless all the staff haven't
3958680	3962000	logged in for X amount of time.
3962000	3968200	Apparently all the other moderators of the wow subreddit were demoted, so it's only gonna
3968200	3970480	be the one guy, so maybe that'll happen, who knows?
3970480	3971480	I don't know.
3971480	3974760	But obviously that is drama that is still literally unfolding live.
3974760	3979480	So apparently the admin got doxxed at some point, because maybe that's why he shut it
3979480	3980480	down again.
3980480	3982680	This is all unfolding.
3982680	3987320	But my understanding is people are logging into wow now, the queues aren't as bad, the
3987320	3988800	caps are back up to where they normally are.
3988800	3994280	If you play on a high pop server, you're gonna have some queues, but like, I know my buddies
3994280	3999040	over on gamebuoy.org, they play on a low mid-pop server, so they're not facing queues.
3999040	4002000	The Horde House Guild, though, was on a high pop server, so they're getting some minor
4002000	4005200	queuing, but no more than like 30 minutes.
4005200	4006200	So.
4006200	4007200	Alright.
4007200	4011720	So that's the drama unfolding in the World of Warcraft this week.
4011720	4013700	Is it because of DDoSing?
4013700	4016360	Is it because this expansion is so damn popular?
4016360	4021640	A lot of people are coming back to wow that apparently didn't do the same thing when it
4021640	4027600	was Pandaria or Cataclysm, like this seems to be attracting gamers in a different way.
4027600	4028680	Very interesting.
4028680	4029680	Let's move on.
4029680	4030680	DarkSakura.
4030680	4035280	Well, you know how there are those studies out there that say, oh, gaming rots your brain
4035280	4038800	and it makes you violent or stupid or all of that.
4038800	4045480	Well, there's actually a much better research study that indicates quite the opposite.
4045480	4052060	It's a study that's actually put out by Princeton University and the University of Rochester
4052060	4058380	to see exactly how gaming, especially certain types of gaming, affect your skill level and
4058380	4060700	your ability to learn.
4060700	4066420	And what they did is they found that people who are gamers are actually much better learners.
4066420	4067860	They learn faster.
4067860	4075780	But those who play the more like fast paced strategy games, something like Call of Duty
4075780	4083260	or Mass Effect or something, they're going to have better speed and cognition than someone
4083260	4086860	who plays a much slower strategy game.
4086860	4090300	But that's just because it's pretty much brain conditioning.
4090300	4095580	It's conditioning the brain to think quickly and, you know, basically be able to make a
4095580	4099800	quick decision like that and have it be a quick and educated decision.
4099800	4102960	So it's pretty cool.
4102960	4104780	So you learn how to think on your feet.
4104780	4105780	Yeah.
4105780	4109660	But the other thing, too, is that this actually, while they put out this, it's still just an
4109660	4111540	initial release.
4111540	4115700	They're running this as an ongoing study, you know, testing different.
4115700	4120620	This one right here is basically, this part was just the ability to strategize and learn
4120620	4122660	in situations.
4122660	4126040	They're checking a long term cognition and improvements on that.
4126040	4128300	You know what else will help you learn how to think on your feet?
4128300	4132500	Doing a live radio show.
4132500	4137060	But no, it's kind of, you know, what's funny is that I always, when I hear a story like
4137060	4141220	this, I kind of think back to what we used to tell our parents growing up.
4141220	4148100	But mom, video games are good for you because it's your hand-eye coordination.
4148100	4154280	I remember hearing that study before, like, I think 2003, like with the same results talking
4154280	4157260	about dexterity, like brain dexterity.
4157260	4163740	Well, think about how the Nintendo Wii really caught on in a lot of senior citizen homes
4163740	4169180	because the whole, like, you know, again, that, you know, the motion and the motion
4169180	4175060	and the interactiveness was really a good workout for the brain for things that are
4175060	4176060	fun.
4176060	4177140	Like bowling, like who doesn't know bowling?
4177140	4180620	Like a lot of senior citizens know what bowling is, okay, and golf.
4180620	4185660	So and you could do that, you know, very easily with this system and that's what really helped
4185660	4186660	the Wii catch on.
4186660	4193660	Well, the biggest items that they were focusing on were things like multitasking, perception,
4193660	4197220	attention, task switching, and decision making.
4197220	4202260	So basically things that would require quick decision making.
4202260	4207220	And I have to say that it's actually, I found this not on any video gaming website either.
4207220	4216140	I found it on I Fucking Love Science, which is very, very, a very good site for, you know,
4216140	4219740	cool science, which all science is cool, but this is really cool.
4219740	4224760	YYR in chat says, I bet you all five bucks that Rob is sitting down right now.
4224760	4226100	So much for thinking on your feet.
4226140	4227140	Nope, he's standing.
4227140	4230820	Well sir, you just lost five bucks because I'm standing right now and my co-host can
4230820	4231820	vouch for that.
4231820	4235260	Cause I get, if I sit during, I do sit for a lot of the show, but when I sit during the
4235260	4237540	whole show, like my butt gets sore.
4237540	4238900	I got to stand up once in a while.
4238900	4239900	Does your butt fall asleep?
4239900	4240900	Long show.
4240900	4241900	What?
4241900	4242900	Does your butt fall asleep?
4242900	4244580	I wouldn't say it falls asleep, but I just have to get up and move.
4244580	4245580	Get up and move.
4245580	4246580	Once in a while.
4246580	4249020	Do you get twitchy cheek syndrome?
4249020	4251020	Do do do do do.
4251020	4252020	Fine.
4252020	4253020	Get up and move.
4253020	4254020	Come on.
4254020	4255020	I figured YYR would appreciate that.
4255020	4256020	Rob's just trying to avoid swamp ass.
4256940	4257940	Yes.
4257940	4260900	I'm trying to avoid swamp ass or whatever I've got going on my, basically J-Lo ass back
4260900	4261900	here.
4261900	4263900	I'm trying to prevent a little bit of that.
4263900	4264900	All right.
4264900	4265900	You should do what I'm doing, Rob.
4265900	4266900	What?
4266900	4267900	Fuck it.
4267900	4268900	That's right.
4268900	4269900	Fuck it.
4269900	4270900	All right.
4270900	4271900	Loki, what do you got?
4271900	4275900	Um, so there's been some issues with share play and um, you know, it's been known that
4275900	4280580	I guess call of duty is blocking share play cause they say that they haven't tested it
4280580	4282260	with their game yet.
4282260	4284680	Um, I don't know, whatever.
4284680	4288280	But um, apparently also people are having trouble with FIFA 15.
4288280	4296280	Um, now it's not known yet if this isn't necessarily where EA saying, Hey, we're just not going
4296280	4297280	to share this.
4297280	4301960	Um, we're not gonna allow you to share game play on this, but apparently there's issues
4301960	4306400	with it right now where if you try to do it, sometimes it gives you a problem where it
4306400	4308520	says you can't, um, do that.
4308520	4313080	And I guess it's not necessarily just FIFA, but also they're having trouble with like
4313080	4320680	a FIFA 15, WW2K 15, Guacamelee, uh, middle earth, shadow of Mordor, um, stuff like that.
4320680	4324040	So apparently it worked at one time, but now it's not.
4324040	4327840	So they're saying, you know, kind of your mileage may vary.
4327840	4332840	Um, is this related to some of the, like, cause a PlayStation was tweeting out the share
4332840	4334800	play was broken earlier this week.
4334800	4335800	Yeah.
4335800	4339240	There was like a, you know, they're saying, no, some PlayStation four owners are currently
4339240	4341540	unable to access share play.
4341540	4346580	We are investigating the error message displayed on PS4 is inaccurate and that's in regards
4346580	4351420	to, you know, it being disabled because you know, the error message is popping up right
4351420	4352420	now.
4352420	4356460	If you try to do that, um, you know, viewing the game screen that the host is currently
4356460	4361300	playing is not allowed due to content restrictions in your country or region.
4361300	4367060	If the host starts a game that you can view a game string, a game screen will be displayed.
4367060	4373980	Um, so it's almost sounds like a ESRB or like a Peggy lockout type thing, but you know,
4373980	4375300	it's a rated E game.
4375300	4379740	Well, at least, you know, I'm not sure what the Peggy equivalent is, but yeah, it's for
4379740	4380740	everyone.
4380740	4383620	So I don't know why that would be the case, but I wonder, can these games be streamed
4383620	4389180	on Twitch because I mean, I know you can lock out certain scenes of your game when you're
4389180	4392220	live streaming on Twitch, but can you lock the whole game out of Twitch?
4392220	4397700	I mean, surely people would just use an outside capture card to get around that if they wanted
4397700	4398700	to.
4398700	4404060	True, but, um, they apparently were saying, I guess it was, um, what was it, it's, it's
4404060	4410620	a feature that's, you know, basically in every single, um, every single game that's out there,
4410620	4416060	but it's just, you know, the up to developers, they can lock the, you know, basically here's
4416060	4417060	what it says.
4417060	4420900	The share play is a system level feature available for all PlayStation four titles.
4420900	4424840	However option, the option is available to developers to disable the feature according
4424840	4431520	to what they feel is best, uh, will be the best benefit to the consumer experience.
4431520	4436820	So it's possible that they can disable it, but I don't know if that's what's going on
4436820	4437820	here.
4437820	4438820	Hmm.
4438820	4439820	All right.
4439820	4447660	Well, whatever the case may be though, um, it's, um, not just FIFA 15, there's, you know,
4447660	4452500	a few other games that are out there and it's just kind of, I don't know, maybe, maybe
4452500	4456100	it's going to be fixed soon, but it's not just FIFA 15.
4456100	4457100	Hmm.
4457100	4459540	Um, you know, yeah, here's some other games.
4459540	4466660	They said the 14 games known to block share play, um, include, and this is kind of stupid.
4466660	4471060	I don't know why all these are like this, but, uh, another world call of duty, advanced
4471060	4478220	warfare called duty ghosts, child of light, hotline, Miami, Metro redux, Minecraft, pixel
4478220	4483780	junk shooter, ultimate Rayman legends, steamworld dig thief, tomb Raider and Wolfenstein.
4483780	4488620	The new order steamworld dig is a PS plus game.
4488620	4489700	Almost everybody has that.
4489700	4491100	It's weird that they'd lock that out.
4491100	4495020	If that's, if that's intentional, it's up to the developer that maybe if it doesn't
4495020	4500520	run well with it right in there, I don't know weird.
4500520	4504360	To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at volknetwork.com
4504360	4505960	use the passphrase copy.
4505960	4510800	All right, well, uh, hopefully this game runs well cause it sounds like a pretty cool concept.
4510800	4514920	You know, uh, you know, Tyto, a big classic game developer and they were responsible for
4514920	4519240	a couple of classic arcade games back in the day, Arkanoid, you ever played Arkanoid the
4519240	4521240	whole like breakout, right?
4521240	4525200	And then of course space invaders, right?
4525200	4532560	So how about a mobile game for iOS and Android that combines the two?
4532560	4533560	That's right.
4533560	4536440	Arkanoid versus space invaders.
4536440	4541880	That is a real thing that's out there, uh, where you will absorb incoming attacks until
4541880	4547280	your meter is full and then you fire the energy back in ball form to wipe out the invaders.
4547280	4548640	You wipe them out with your balls.
4548640	4549640	All right.
4549640	4554380	Anyhow, uh, it's not out yet, but it will be on its way out in Japan in the winter.
4554380	4558580	No word if it is coming out worldwide, but I can't see how it doesn't come out worldwide.
4558580	4562820	Like I know we got things like groove coaster and some of the other, um, uh, Tyto stuff
4562820	4563820	here.
4563820	4564820	So there you go.
4564820	4570140	Um, and maybe, maybe could a 3ds or PlayStation Vita, could, could that be in the works as
4570140	4571140	well?
4571140	4572140	Oh, I don't know.
4572140	4573140	Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
4573140	4574140	All we know now for sure.
4574140	4578180	iOS and Android, but looking at some of these screenshots, it does look kind of fun and
4578180	4581840	I like space invaders and I like Arkanoid if the price is right, if it's like a 99 cent
4581840	4586160	game or even like a dollar 99 and if it has an excellent soundtrack, cause I'll tell you
4586160	4591600	what a lot of those Tyto like space invader games have a fricking awesome soundtrack.
4591600	4595160	So yeah, that's a good soundtrack that'll, that'll be make it worth it right there.
4595160	4599040	Arkanoid versus space invaders, Jamie, you're a fan of classic games.
4599040	4600040	How does that make you feel?
4600040	4601040	Hearing about that?
4601040	4602040	Tingly.
4602040	4603040	Tingly.
4603040	4607480	Uh, SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, wow, feels like this should have happened ages ago, right?
4607480	4609920	Fifth dream says best fucking game ever.
4609920	4610920	OMG.
4610920	4614080	Well now let's not get ahead of ourselves.
4614080	4615080	Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
4615080	4619880	I, especially after some of the things we've learned this week, let the reviewers have
4619880	4622240	a crack at it first.
4622240	4623240	Then we'll make our decisions.
4623240	4624240	All right.
4624240	4625240	Uh, let's move on.
4625240	4627120	Dark soccer release dates after this.
4627120	4629720	Well, we have some other stuff going on.
4629720	4637000	Um, you know that, that a dumb ass who on Twitter decided to threaten, uh, Gabe Newell,
4637000	4638000	you know?
4638000	4639000	Yes.
4639080	4640080	Yep.
4640080	4641720	Pretty, pretty stupid.
4641720	4649920	Um, well anyway, uh, Mike Malbeck, his, uh, basically he was, uh, uh, with, uh, the, the,
4649920	4651320	the, I'm all tongue tied.
4651320	4655080	Um, he developed, he was, uh, the developer on Paranautical Activity.
4655080	4660600	Well, um, he left the company he was with and now he's back.
4660600	4662840	And Code Avarice is doing a new game.
4662840	4666620	So he, uh, he decided to leave.
4666620	4667620	He came back.
4667980	4672380	He's just sort of still a douche.
4672380	4673380	I don't know.
4673380	4674380	What do you think?
4674380	4677620	Uh, I think this guy kind of ruined his reputation already some time ago and it's going to take
4677620	4681060	a very, very, very, very, very long time to get that back.
4681060	4685300	Cause unfortunately you have people like us and the websites that were also running these
4685300	4691140	stories kind of already, uh, you know, commenting based on his behavior, which is, um, you know,
4691140	4692140	too bad.
4692140	4693140	But he said it.
4693140	4694140	So.
4694660	4700980	The new, the new game is called Spinal Destination, which is a mix of Lush for Dead, TimeSplitters
4700980	4701980	and Painkiller.
4701980	4702980	Oh, wow.
4702980	4703980	That's kind of funny.
4703980	4704980	That's a funny name.
4704980	4705980	Yeah.
4705980	4706980	I don't know.
4706980	4709860	I don't want to judge the games based off of one douchebag.
4709860	4710860	That's true.
4710860	4711860	That's a good point.
4711860	4713500	Cause there might be other hardworking people on it.
4713500	4721820	But we, I mean, as long as he's not like the, you know, owner of everything ever with it,
4721820	4725420	then I wouldn't, I wouldn't judge the company based on just him.
4725420	4730860	Now, if it was someone like say, oh, the CEO and owner of said company, like dead guy who
4730860	4735260	owned that chicken chain, you know, then that's, that's a little different story.
4735260	4736260	Uh, let's see.
4736260	4739100	Bobby Lockwolf in our chat says he realized he couldn't get a job.
4739100	4740780	So he went back to his old job.
4740780	4741780	Yep.
4741780	4744800	Uh, Tiger Claw in chat says, sounds like the guy is desperate.
4744800	4748860	He found out leaving the company, he wouldn't be making the money he was when developing
4748860	4749860	games.
4749860	4750860	So.
4750900	4751900	All right.
4751900	4754620	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates cause uh, I believe it's
4754620	4755620	a busy week.
4755620	4756620	Right?
4756620	4757620	Loki?
4757620	4758620	Yes.
4758620	4759820	It's probably one of the biggest busiest weeks in November.
4759820	4763720	So this is going to be as busy I think as it's going to get meaning the busiest week
4763720	4764720	of the whole year.
4764720	4765720	Yes.
4765720	4766720	The busiest week of the whole year.
4766720	4772980	So, um, let's see this week we have Hatsune Miku Project Diva F second for Vita because
4772980	4778060	it's already come out on PlayStation three, uh, Dragon Age Inquisition on PlayStation
4778060	4785340	three, Xbox 360, PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC, the PlayStation four and Xbox one
4785340	4788860	versions of WWE two K 15 come out this week.
4788860	4792460	Escape Dead Island, a game I completely forgot was coming out.
4792460	4798340	PlayStation three and Xbox 360, a little big planet three on PlayStation four and PlayStation
4798340	4799340	three.
4799340	4808020	Uh, MX versus, uh, was it MXGP 14 on that's on Xbox three 60 and I believe PlayStation
4808020	4809580	four as well.
4809580	4810580	Yeah.
4810580	4812580	PlayStation four and maybe PlayStation three.
4812580	4815900	Uh, let's see what else here we've got.
4815900	4821260	Oh, I guess Hatsune Miku Project Diva F um, second is coming out this week as well in
4821260	4822260	PlayStation three.
4822260	4825220	I thought that came out already.
4825220	4826220	Not the second.
4826220	4827220	That's, that's the difference.
4827220	4828220	Ah, yes.
4828220	4829220	Okay.
4829220	4830220	This is a new one.
4830220	4838260	David's invasion on, um, Xbox three 60 PlayStation four and Xbox one.
4838260	4841300	That's the interactive TV show thing.
4841300	4844740	Watchdogs finally coming out on Wii U this week.
4844740	4848100	Um, so I guess you can pick that up now.
4848100	4854380	Uh, let's see my favorite game of the week, grand theft auto five on PlayStation four
4854380	4856340	and Xbox one.
4856900	4862580	Uh, far cry for coming on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 PlayStation four and Xbox one
4862580	4868740	and PC, a middle earth shadow of Mordor on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 cause
4868740	4871100	those versions were delayed.
4871100	4876340	Uh, Minecraft, the Xbox one edition gets a disc release this week.
4876340	4883100	A monopoly, the family fun pack on Xbox one and PlayStation four.
4883100	4891060	Um, smash brothers for the Wii U it's going to be coming out on Friday.
4891060	4896740	Also along with that Pokemon alpha Sapphire and Pokemon omega Ruby on three DS.
4896740	4900380	And I think there's a whole host of accessories and amiibos and shit.
4900380	4902540	They're going to be coming out this week as well.
4902540	4904820	All right.
4904820	4905820	Busy busy.
4905820	4906820	You want to name all the amiibos coming out?
4906820	4907820	I'm just kidding.
4907820	4908820	Fuck if I care.
4908820	4909820	Don't do that.
4909820	4910820	All right.
4910820	4911820	Nintendo characters.
4911820	4912820	All right.
4913540	4915180	Japan's, uh, got some stuff this week as well.
4915180	4918900	Um, Assassin's Creed unity gets its Japanese release on November 20th.
4918900	4923700	If you are daring and wanting to check that out, Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires comes
4923700	4925860	out in a regular and premium box edition.
4925860	4927900	By the way, these are both on PlayStation four.
4927900	4929460	That is also out in Japan this week.
4929460	4933500	EA sports UFC getting its Japanese release as well this week.
4933500	4937500	That all is on the PlayStation four, uh, on the Xbox one.
4937500	4941100	A lot of that same stuff I just named over on the Xbox one as well, because remember
4941100	4942100	that is out in Japan now.
4942380	4948540	Uh, so Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires also in Japan this week on the PlayStation three,
4948540	4953460	you can also pick up once again, Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires there as well.
4953460	4960020	Um, as far as Japanese stuff on the PlayStation three though, not a lot else this week.
4960020	4962820	Uh, let's see the Vita and the 3DS.
4962820	4971340	The Vita has Senju no Enbu Kyoku comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita and on the
4971460	4977340	Nintendo 3DS this week, if I can get to my list, uh, I think it's a little busier there
4977340	4985180	on the 3DS because we have Doriego Nobita Tohyusei no Fushigi collection comes out as
4985180	4990260	well as Mahokore Maho Aidoru collection.
4990260	4991860	Magical idol collection.
4991860	4993980	It's probably a collection of idol games.
4993980	4994980	Let me look.
4994980	4995980	Well, let's look.
4995980	4996980	Magical something.
4996980	5001300	The title's not going to be any, yeah, this looks like a, like an idol game mixed with
5002140	5005940	uh, like kind of like a farm-esque type of thing.
5005940	5006940	Looks like.
5006940	5007940	Yeah.
5007940	5008940	Farmer Idol.
5008940	5009940	I don't know.
5009940	5010940	It's interesting.
5010940	5022060	Uh, Sumiko Gurashi Koko Ga Ochisukundesu comes out as well this week and that is adorable.
5022060	5025460	It looks, it looks like Pusheen the cat, but they're different characters, like a penguin
5025460	5026980	and a dog.
5026980	5029260	And I don't know what the hell they're doing, but it's cute.
5029260	5030660	They're eating sushi in this picture.
5030660	5032060	Doesn't that game look cute?
5032060	5034060	They look like little things with singular eyeballs.
5034060	5035060	They do.
5035060	5036860	They look like those Pusheen stickers on Facebook.
5036860	5037860	Pusheen's amazing.
5037860	5040580	I know, but they, they look like Pusheen's cousins.
5040580	5041580	That's what I'm going to call that game.
5041580	5043040	Pusheen's cousins comes out.
5043040	5046620	By the way, uh, there is, uh, some releases as well.
5046620	5047740	Um, oh, nevermind.
5047740	5049560	That's Australia I'm looking at there.
5049560	5053460	Some 3DS's XL, the new 3DS XL is out in Australia this week.
5053460	5055740	I guess it's worth mentioning that there.
5055740	5060580	Pokemon Alpha Sapphire also this week in Japan and Omega Ruby, of course.
5060580	5064820	So a busy, busy week and a lot of peripherals coming out to support that.
5064820	5065820	Dr. Sakura.
5065820	5069020	Uh, there's some stuff coming out in the UK, but who cares?
5069020	5070020	And I'm kidding.
5070020	5071020	I love you guys.
5071020	5075140	Um, on the 17th we have Company of Heroes 2, our Den's Assault.
5075140	5083660	Uh, on 18th we have Grand Theft Auto 5 on Xbox, on the Xbone and PlayStation 4.
5083660	5090820	21st of November we have Adventure Time, The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom and Dragon
5090820	5093940	Age Inquisition on Damn Near Everything.
5093940	5101620	We also have Escape Dead Island, Far Cry 4, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, Sonic Boom
5101620	5105220	and WWE 2K15.
5105220	5110140	So uh, save thine pence.
5110140	5111140	All right.
5111140	5112140	Any other stories for you guys?
5112140	5113980	And then the classic game of the week.
5113980	5114980	Loki.
5114980	5115980	All right.
5115980	5116980	This is kind of cool.
5116980	5121020	Um, there, you know, you're not the way a little bit for the actual Oculus Rift to be
5121020	5128860	coming out, but remember that whole Samsung Galaxy Note 4 attachment that's, it was the
5128860	5131140	Samsung Gear VR?
5131140	5133580	Well, it's coming out next month.
5133580	5138980	Um, they in fact have a price point of $200 for the attachment.
5138980	5143180	Now granted, you're gonna have to actually buy the, you know, Galaxy Note 4 to plug in
5143180	5148300	there and that's probably a little bit more expensive than that, um, but yes, you can
5148300	5149300	own that next month.
5149300	5153060	Um, to go along with that, of course, they've released, uh, Oculus released their mobile
5153060	5160420	software development kit and um, you know, I guess it should be interesting to check
5160420	5161420	out.
5161420	5165980	I guess the VR headset though, the Oculus Rift, not expected to be hitting until mid
5165980	5172100	2015, but I don't know, I do need a new phone.
5172100	5177580	Note 4 is kind of expensive to buy out of a plan, so, I don't know.
5177580	5179580	Are you thinking about it though, Loki?
5179580	5182460	Thinking about it, but I probably wouldn't.
5182460	5185740	It's not a lot of money to jump for that and honestly, you don't necessarily have to get
5185740	5186780	the first one either.
5186780	5190540	You know, next year is going to be a huge year for this stuff, so yeah, and honestly
5190540	5195380	I'd be more interested in picking up probably, uh, Project Morpheus whenever, whatever the
5195380	5196940	hell they decided to actually call that.
5196940	5198540	I'm sure it's not Project Morpheus.
5198540	5200660	Call it something Matrix-y though.
5200660	5202700	I wonder if, uh, the name will be unveiled.
5202700	5204820	Ooh, like the Sony Matrix would be pretty sweet.
5204820	5205820	The Sony Matrix.
5205820	5206820	Hey, why not?
5206820	5207820	Project Morpheus.
5207820	5208820	I mean, hey, I'm down with that.
5208820	5209820	Or the Sony Neo.
5209820	5211540	The Sony Neo.
5211540	5212540	The Sony Blue Pill.
5212540	5213540	No.
5213540	5214540	The Sony Trinity.
5214540	5215540	The Sony-o.
5215540	5216540	Ah, hey, that's a...
5216540	5217540	I'm smart.
5217540	5220540	I'm the one that came up with O.L. Army, I mean, hello.
5220540	5221540	I thought that was puppy.
5221540	5222540	I thought that was puppy.
5222540	5223540	I thought that was puppy.
5223540	5224540	I thought that was puppy.
5224700	5225700	I kinda like that name.
5225700	5226700	That would work.
5226700	5227700	No.
5227700	5228700	It was a combination, I think.
5228700	5231540	But I did one of the tank with O.L. Army on the side.
5231540	5232540	Ten years ago.
5232540	5233540	Anyway.
5233540	5234540	Uh, well, you know what?
5234540	5238540	Speaking of coming up with new names, uh, the VGAs, the Video Game Awards, they're gonna
5238540	5242620	have a new name because, you know, game tactics is not really a thing anymore.
5242620	5251620	Uh, so, now, uh, the VGAs will become the Game Awards 2014, uh, speaking, uh, to Jeff
5251660	5256820	Keeley, the producer, saying, quote, the Game Awards 2014 will celebrate our collective
5256820	5261100	love of games and the passion we all hold in our hearts for this incredible entertainment
5261100	5262100	medium.
5262100	5265020	Gaming has never been stronger, and this year we will recognize the fastest selling launch
5265020	5269060	year in history for new game consoles, the rise of esports, and mobile gaming around
5269060	5274060	the globe, and preview the games that will make 2015 the biggest year yet.
5274060	5279020	Uh, this is gonna take place in the AXIS Theater, uh, in Vegas, and, uh, you will be able to
5279020	5281500	see it pretty much online, uh, anywhere.
5281500	5287060	I believe it's gonna be on Xbox, it's gonna be on Sony, it's gonna be on Twitch for sure.
5287060	5290820	It will not, however, be on television, uh, it's no longer tied to Spike TV.
5290820	5296560	That might not be a bad thing, though, because, uh, as this thing's getting more independent,
5296560	5301020	so a lot of that crap stunt stuff you have to do for TV, like celebrities who don't actually
5301020	5304860	play video games, they won't necessarily have to do, so it could be interesting.
5304860	5307780	It wasn't, was it last year that it was all fucked up?
5307780	5311220	There was something really, um, embarrassing with Jeff Keeley.
5311220	5313580	Was it the E3 stuff last year?
5313580	5315620	Was that, like, um, the awards last year?
5315620	5316620	Well, where do we begin?
5316620	5319900	Was that the Doritos and the Mountain Dew, or is that the, uh, you're probably thinking
5319900	5324340	that the awards last year was online only, I think, and it was, it was, it was weird.
5324340	5328580	It was, yeah, it was, like, it was awkward, yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't that good.
5328580	5335860	It wasn't Conan O'Brien doing it as well, no, it was, um, it was Jeff Keeley and, um,
5335860	5346380	what's his name, from The Soup, um, why can't I remember his name, uh, Joel, uh, who's the
5346380	5347380	guy from The Soup?
5347380	5348380	Joel McHale.
5348380	5349380	Yeah.
5349380	5356580	Uh, let's see, and they're telling me in chat I misspoke, uh, it's Game Trailers was the
5356580	5357580	site, right?
5357580	5358580	Yeah, Game Trailers.
5358580	5359580	Game Trailers.
5359580	5365580	Yeah, Joel McHale last year, remember, I, I like the guy, but I think he was kind of
5365580	5373060	annoying last year, and, um, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see, you know, obviously
5373060	5378500	Keeley loves games, and I think he'll do a good job with it, it's just, I don't know,
5378500	5379500	I'm interested to see it.
5379500	5382900	Well, this is the other interesting thing about it, you know, and, I don't know, I'm
5382900	5387820	skeptical about the whole thing, but this, this does make me go, well, shit, he ain't
5387820	5388820	fucking around.
5388820	5393940	Uh, Jeff Keeley is laying down the money himself to make this work, uh, and there's also a
5393940	5398260	part of me that goes, must be nice to have that kind of money to risk on the investments,
5398260	5399380	but you know what?
5399380	5403780	He works hard, he's shown up on freaking everything that has to do with video games, he was at
5403780	5409020	BlizzCon on their thing, so, seems like he's, he's a lot of times the face of game journalism,
5409020	5413060	for better or worse, um, so he's putting the money down, the investment is my own, I'm
5413060	5417420	bankrolling it and we're trying to sell some sponsorships, but there's no submission fees,
5417420	5421140	I didn't even realize that they had been charging submission fees, but, uh, there's a fair amount
5421140	5425940	of risk involved, uh, uh, but he will not say how much of his money he's putting up.
5425940	5431100	He did say, I thought about doing a kickstarter, but I would feel awkward doing that, I think
5431100	5435420	I need to take this on myself to prove that I can do it, I need to prove to everyone this
5435420	5438460	is going to be great, if I were to kickstart it, there would have been a fair amount of
5438460	5441300	skepticism, you know what?
5441300	5447420	That statement alone raises my hopes a significant amount, that he kind of realizes that, he's
5447420	5448420	like, you know what?
5448420	5453260	I could do that, but I'm going to just, I believe in this enough or I'm just going to
5453260	5454260	take the risk.
5454260	5455260	I mean, good luck.
5455260	5459420	I, the thing that worries me about it is this seems to be happening kind of quick, like
5459420	5465100	this was just announced and isn't this ceremony happening like the week, the PlayStation thing?
5465100	5467140	It's like, it's not a lot of time.
5467140	5470060	Yeah, usually it's in the early part of December.
5470060	5471060	Yeah.
5471060	5475840	So I don't know, but maybe, if he gets some good exclusives, it'll have a lot of people
5475840	5480000	talking, you know, especially if he's able to, and I don't know what he will, won't be
5480000	5488000	able to say, but if he's able to say like, the world reveal of the new XYZ game will
5488000	5491160	be during the game awards, that alone will get a lot of eyes on it.
5491160	5495080	If he can, they have a lot of world exclusive trailers and stuff that, you know, they like,
5495080	5499200	they had a new, I think that was one of the, that's where they announced Skyrim years and
5499200	5500200	years ago.
5500200	5501200	I remember that Skyrim.
5501200	5502200	Yeah.
5502200	5506800	And then, um, I think they had a new trailer for No Man's, it was either the first time
5506800	5509160	they showed off No Man's Sky or that was the second time.
5509160	5511760	That was their big thing last year, the No Man's Sky footage.
5511760	5512760	Yeah.
5512760	5513760	That was, that was last year.
5513760	5514760	I was like, yeah.
5514760	5517720	That was like the one thing everybody was happy they tuned in for.
5517720	5518720	So yeah.
5518720	5522720	And that was ironic part of that is that was the game that got the most hype out of everything
5522720	5523720	that they showed.
5523720	5525120	It was like, yeah.
5525120	5527480	So I, I'm, I don't know.
5527480	5528480	We'll see.
5528480	5529480	It's kind of one of those.
5529480	5533120	We'll see what I'm doing on that day when it's area, which from around I'll, I'll maybe
5533120	5534120	tune in.
5534120	5535120	Speaking of which, I want to play No Man's Sky.
5535120	5536120	Don't play No Man's Sky.
5536120	5537120	I want No Man's Sky.
5537120	5540800	Can I come out soon, please?
5540800	5541800	We'll see.
5541800	5542800	We'll see.
5542800	5543800	All right.
5543800	5545680	Um, let's see.
5545680	5546680	Let's move on.
5546680	5551360	We're going to get to the classic game of the week because, uh, every week dark soccer
5551360	5555840	likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys should
5555840	5557000	be checking this game out.
5557000	5559640	You know, screw, screw all this new fangled stuff.
5559640	5561120	I'm going to walk into the vault.
5561120	5565600	I'm going to find a classic game for you all to worship this week.
5565600	5566600	I'm a school y'all.
5566600	5567600	So you know what?
5567600	5571720	There's a screw Dragon Age Inquisition to hell with Pokemon.
5571720	5572720	Okay.
5572720	5573720	To hell with Pokemon.
5573720	5579120	Fuck little big planet and go eat a bag of Dick Smash Brothers because classic games
5579120	5580120	is where it's at.
5580120	5583080	So dark soccer, just take all that other new shit to the dumpster.
5583080	5585620	And what classic games should people be playing this week instead?
5585620	5591020	I have gone for the edge of the 10 year rule and gone for Capcom fighting evolution or
5591020	5595080	as it came out in Japan and Europe, Capcom fighting jam.
5595080	5597100	It came out in 2004.
5597100	5602220	It was a fighting game from Capcom that originally came out in the arcades, um, for the Namco
5602220	5607760	system two 46 hardware and came out on the Xbox, uh, Xbox and PS two.
5607760	5612740	It has, uh, basically characters from three different, uh, incarnations of the street
5612740	5617540	fighter series as characters from red earth and characters from dark stalkers.
5617540	5620860	And they use the same fighting system for each character does.
5620860	5623780	And it almost seems like they pulled exact sprite rips from it too.
5623780	5626780	So this game actually had some issues around it.
5626780	5633440	Um, so basically, uh, the only original character in this one was Ingrid, as we've seen her
5633440	5635620	show up in other games before.
5635620	5643460	And then you had the bosses, Pyron and, uh, Shin Akuma, um, or a Shingoki as, uh, he was
5643460	5644460	in Japan.
5644460	5650740	Um, you also had, uh, two on two and you had the two on two endurance style matches like
5650740	5652820	you saw in rival schools.
5652820	5658300	And, um, you could choose, uh, different, uh, you know, a series of characters together
5658300	5662540	and the Japanese version, if the current character is defeated for one round, the next round
5662540	5666780	begins with the other version, although in the North American one, you can keep the same
5666780	5667780	character.
5667780	5674380	So we have the street fighter, two turbo edition versions of, uh, Ryu, Kyle, uh, Vega, well,
5674380	5677620	bison over here, Vega in Japan and Zangief.
5677620	5681340	And in Dark Stalkers, we had, um, Anakaras, Dimitri, Felicia and Jetta.
5681340	5684140	I love freaking Jetta in all the games ever.
5684140	5688220	Um, and Street Fighter Alpha, I know a lot of people that would want to play this just
5688220	5691500	so then when they knock out Felicia, they can go, bye Felicia.
5691500	5693060	Just saying.
5693060	5694060	Okay.
5694060	5701060	Street Fighter Alpha version, we had Guy, we had, uh, Karin, uh, Rose and Sakura.
5701060	5708460	And then, um, from Red Earth, which is a game that only came out in arcades, um, was, uh,
5708460	5714960	you had, uh, Leo Houser, Hydron, who was called Newell in Japan and Kenji, who was, uh, Mukuro
5714960	5715960	in Japan.
5715960	5722660	And then we had Street Fighter 3 editions of Alex, Chun-Li, uh, Urien and Yun.
5722660	5726880	The original character was Ingrid, who also came back in Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max on
5726880	5731160	PSP, um, as a time traveler.
5731160	5736780	And of course you had your bosses, which was, uh, Pyron and Shingoki.
5736780	5739860	So it had a really, really good soundtrack too.
5739860	5745100	It had just music from all the various different games and different versions thereof and its
5745100	5746400	own original pieces.
5746400	5753240	But the sad thing is that the game was very well received because of how it seemed like
5753240	5755800	the animation had been cut down.
5755800	5761220	Um, the only really well received character was Ingrid because she actually really did
5761220	5763800	have the most work done for her.
5763800	5770320	And then it was admitted from, um, Yoshinori Ono that, uh, the game was a salvaged version
5770320	5773320	of Capcom fighting all-stars.
5773320	5780300	And, um, by trying to incorporate the various different styles of all these games that it
5780300	5782580	was causing a balance issue.
5782580	5784500	And so basically it wouldn't work.
5784500	5788700	So really this game is, like, Capcom-Lugen style.
5788700	5789700	So.
5789700	5795820	But it is worth mentioning because it brought us a character who's shown up in other Capcom
5795820	5796820	games.
5796820	5797820	It's...
5797820	5802300	It was a very, I think, unique take on Capcom's own fighting games.
5802300	5804640	And so it's definitely worth a mention today.
5804640	5810080	So we have Capcom Fighting Evolution, AKA Capcom Fighting Jam.
5810080	5812840	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5812840	5816100	Capcom Fighting Evolution or Jam.
5816100	5818480	Whatever you prefer there.
5818480	5822280	Not to be confused with Kurota Berry Jam because that was from a different game.
5822280	5825920	Uh, available on the Xbox, Playstation 2, and Arcade.
5825920	5826920	Yerp.
5826920	5827920	Here it is.
5827920	5831160	All right, uh, now, uh, we've got plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come.
5831160	5835420	We are gonna take a break, but when we come back, YYR's gonna be here to pull the curtain
5835420	5839260	back on his newest OLR dream game creation.
5839260	5841420	I'm so freaking excited, I can't stand it.
5841420	5846020	Uh, we're also gonna get into rapid fire news, the Fugu question of the week, um, and more
5846020	5851260	news and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
5851260	5855740	All when we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.
5862140	5868260	Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio, live on this Sunday evening with the 575th
5868260	5872580	episode of our show already in progress, and I gotta tell you, it's been a very busy night
5872580	5873580	so far.
5873580	5877140	We've, uh, talked a lot about some of the controversies going on in gaming this week,
5877140	5881780	but you know what, now we've got some good news coming in because, uh, this is always
5881780	5887540	a hoot and a pleasure to announce when somebody out there takes one of our OLR dream games.
5887540	5891400	If you're newer to the show, sometimes we get these crazy fucking ideas for games, and
5891400	5893240	we'll just be like, someone needs to make that game.
5893240	5897560	Like, I think, I think one of the first ones I ever remember was puzzle sluts.
5897560	5902560	Somebody said, you know, there needs to be a puzzle game that's just, just, you know,
5902560	5903560	all these sluts.
5903560	5904560	Puzzle sluts would be the best.
5904560	5905560	Exactly.
5905560	5906560	Like, inspired by the 8-bit games.
5906560	5908320	I'm not, I don't mean that all the sluts have to be women.
5908320	5911720	Women, men, everything, cats, dogs, sweaty cats.
5911720	5912720	Pantsless rage.
5912720	5913720	Exactly.
5913720	5914720	All that could be included.
5914720	5921060	Over the years, the list of, uh, dream games has grown and grown and grown, and, um, not
5921060	5926980	that long ago, uh, probably about two years ago, a listener by the name of Aaron or YYR
5926980	5933780	actually took one of the games from the OLR, uh, dream game list called Bungee Ferret Tossing
5933780	5938140	and made it a reality, and it's available on the Xbox Live Indie Arcade.
5938140	5939500	And it is addicting.
5939500	5940500	It is.
5940500	5947760	And, uh, tonight, he is back to unveil the second, the appropriately number two project,
5947760	5953520	uh, for, uh, his OLR dream game, uh, it is Aaron or YYR, and he's there on the line with
5953520	5954520	us tonight.
5954520	5955520	You there?
5955520	5956520	You there, Aaron?
5956520	5957520	Hello?
5957520	5958520	Aaron, can you hear me?
5958520	5959520	Uh, yeah.
5959520	5960520	Yeah, I am.
5960520	5961520	There you are.
5961520	5962520	Hey, how you doing?
5962520	5963520	Can you hear me?
5963520	5964520	Hello?
5964520	5965520	Hi, we can hear you.
5965520	5966520	Can you hear us?
5966520	5967520	I hope so.
5967520	5968520	Uh, yeah.
5968520	5969520	Yeah, I can hear you.
5969540	5971540	How you doing?
5971540	5973740	Uh, not, not so bad, actually.
5973740	5979220	It's, uh, it's been a really busy couple of weeks, and, uh, well, uh, this has, uh, not
5979220	5982880	helped, but actually, it didn't take very long to put this game together.
5982880	5989100	It's, uh, obviously very Atari 2600 inspired, um, but it was the first thing I thought of
5989100	5991880	when Jamie said Pixel Shits.
5991880	5992880	That's right.
5992880	5993880	Somehow.
5993880	5997120	You just pulled back the curtain before we went to break here live on your newest game
5997120	6002500	Pixel Shits, which, I don't know, Jamie, when did this ever come, I don't, it's, that's
6002500	6005780	the thing, is, like, sometimes YYR will be like, hey, I made this game based off something
6005780	6006780	you said.
6006780	6007780	I honestly don't remember-
6007780	6008780	When did we fucking say that?
6008780	6015680	But I remembered saying something about, like, if I remember right, I said something about,
6015680	6021340	I think I tried to say Pixel something else and said Pixel Shit instead, so then we started
6021340	6022340	talking about-
6022340	6023340	Something like that.
6023340	6028060	Taco Bell, and then I don't remember.
6028060	6031420	It was during the Rod Caliber, the same episode where you mentioned Rod Caliber.
6031420	6036380	Oh, yeah, Rod Caliber, because that was Sega Bass Fishing for Classic Game.
6036380	6037380	Yeah.
6037380	6038380	Fish!
6038380	6041160	So if folks want to check this out, we will link it in the show notes, so if people are
6041160	6045620	looking at this on VOG or whatever, they can check it out, but if they don't, uh, you know,
6045620	6050540	they don't have the show notes in front of them, you can head on over to yyrgames.com,
6050540	6058100	and it's slash PS, so, uh, for Pixel Shits, so yyrgames.com slash PS, and this is an
6058100	6063220	Atari 2600, I've been watching Loki play, by the way, he's been playing All Break, is
6063220	6064220	he still going?
6064220	6065220	Oh, no, he went back into chat.
6065220	6066220	I had 101.
6066220	6067220	You had 101?
6067220	6071860	Okay, so, so to explain what you do in this game, well, let me, I'll let you do it.
6071860	6075540	What is, what is the object of Pixel Shits?
6075540	6083620	The object is to shit everywhere, so as to prevent, no, it is, so as to prevent the joggers
6083620	6090760	from getting to, from one side of the park, I guess, to the other, and, uh, they just
6090760	6095780	randomly spawn from, you know, a random side of the screen and run towards the other side,
6095780	6102060	and your only method of attempting to stop them is by shitting, and, um, by hitting the
6102060	6107340	space bar, you can shit, and by the way, I apologize to anyone who's offended by the
6107340	6115020	use of the word shit, but it, I, I don't know, it, but at any rate, yeah, I, I was given
6115020	6118060	Pixel Shits to work with, so I went with it.
6118060	6123260	I can already see the box art now, like, you need some, like, you know the 2600 box arts
6123260	6127740	were all, like, these epic paintings and things, and this could be, total 80s jogger with the
6127740	6132620	sweatband and everything, exactly, and it'd be, like, up to the neck and poop, the first
6132620	6138100	video game that encourages you to shit on it, like, it should come with a free packet
6138100	6139100	of Metamucil.
6139100	6140100	Oh, man.
6140100	6144940	Now, Tigerclaw's asking, probably, you know, a Jim Boy's coupon, who is doing the Pixel
6144940	6145940	Shits, birds?
6145940	6150780	But no, it's you, it's the hero, it's human shit, this is human fecal matter, it is, it
6150780	6157260	is the player, yes, all right, um, when you start the poop meter is at max, by the way,
6157260	6164780	the internal unity object is actually called poop meter, and, you know, as you poop all
6164780	6171620	over the place, it depletes, however, there's a conveniently located Taco Bell in the upper
6171620	6177140	right corner of the screen, pixely Taco Bell, and if you line up alongside it and then just
6177140	6183300	continue mashing the space bar, you will recharge your poop meter by presumably eating, and
6183300	6185540	then you are ready to shit again.
6185540	6191300	This game is also called Break Your Space Bar The Game.
6191300	6200580	I love that it has a very authentic 2600 feel to it, I mean, you might, if you go check
6200580	6204620	out Pixel Shits right now, your first reaction is gonna be, it's probably gonna be one of
6204620	6209340	two things, probably gonna be like, what the fuck, and then it's gonna be like, this game
6209340	6215900	is kinda ugly and stupidly simple, but that's the point, like, a lot of 2600 games were
6215900	6220460	like that, like, one of my favorite 2600 games, I don't know if you've ever played this one,
6220460	6226020	there's a game that Activision did, it was called Frostbite, have you ever played it?
6226020	6230900	That I was hoping you'd mention Kaboom, I do love Kaboom, Frostbite I have not played,
6230900	6234980	okay, that's all right, I love Kaboom, and that's a stupid simple one too, that's just
6234980	6239340	collect bombs with the paddle, that's it, these little ugly ass bombs fall and you pick
6239340	6243620	them up with the paddle, it's stupidly addicting, but then Frostbite, all you did, you would,
6243620	6248200	you go down the screen by jumping on ice bricks, then you go up the screen, you go down the
6248200	6254300	screen, you go up the screen, it's kinda like Frogger over and over, near, far, near, far,
6254300	6259380	and you don't want to fall on the ice, is the whole thing, so, a lot of the 2600 games
6259380	6264660	are stupid simple, so I love that it's kinda like an homage to that, in fact, I strongly
6264660	6270540	believe that Pixel Schitz should be on the Flashback 5, whenever Atari puts out the Flashback
6270540	6277820	5, I think Pixel Schitz should be there, it's just me, it's just me, so, and if anyone cares,
6277820	6284300	all the sound effects were created on the Korg DS10 synthesizer software for Nintendo
6284300	6285300	DS.
6285300	6291620	Oh wow, so what, okay, Korg things make me happy, okay, I have to ask though, let's take
6291620	6298020	a step back for a minute here, okay, how did we get from Dark Sakura saying Pixel Schitz
6298020	6303580	to where we're at tonight, walk us through what happened in your mind getting from idea
6303580	6305540	to product.
6305540	6312820	Well, I was listening to the podcast in my car while I was driving back from a random
6312820	6320020	trip to Jersey, and, you know, I hear this, and all I can, and she mentions, you know,
6320020	6323780	Pixel Schitz and Dream Game, so of course I start thinking, what else am I gonna do,
6323780	6330060	I'm just driving, and I pretty much had the game concept within the minute that I thought
6330060	6331340	that.
6331340	6336380	I mean, it just popped into my head basically.
6336380	6339580	I'm glad I was inspiring.
6339580	6345100	The thing is, like, I've been wanting to learn how to use Unity, and I mean, I went through
6345100	6349580	like, you know, a simple demo of roll a ball, okay, you can roll a ball around and pick
6349580	6359460	up cubes, but I had yet to actually use Unity to create anything of actual substance.
6359460	6365100	So this was a great excuse to get started with Unity 2D, and so I threw this together,
6365100	6368780	you know, an hour here, an hour there, over the course of about two weeks, and that's
6368780	6369780	it.
6369780	6370780	And I finished it early today.
6370780	6375340	That's kind of funny, because the story behind when Bobby created Flappy Vog a few months
6375340	6378900	ago was very similar, it was kind of like, I need a project to learn Unity, so here you
6378900	6385300	go, Flappy Vog, and now we've got this, so we helped you learn all about Unity.
6385300	6386300	You did.
6386300	6388260	You guys did me a favor.
6388260	6389260	That's awesome.
6389260	6396060	So now you can make a game that maybe won't have an offensive title for some people, right?
6396060	6398180	Warrior Bob is now the best shitter in chat.
6398180	6400780	Warrior Bob just got three seventy three shits.
6400780	6405580	Now Bobby's number two.
6405580	6406580	Holy shit.
6406580	6409060	That should be the sequel.
6409060	6410060	Holy shit.
6410060	6412820	I'm going to be back in chat after this, but I need to know, is the game too easy?
6412820	6419620	Because if it is, I can certainly change that, or make a hard version.
6419620	6423180	We're beta testing this a little bit here, and Pow again asking the site for the game,
6423180	6429660	that's yyrgames.com slash p s, and you guys have to check this out, it's too damn funny.
6429660	6435300	Maybe we need power-ups, and we'll make the game harder and have power-ups for explosive
6435300	6436300	diarrhea.
6436300	6437300	Don't get crazy.
6437300	6438300	Don't get crazy.
6438300	6440340	And don't forget about the slippery piles of pee.
6440340	6442500	You guys are nasty, nasty people.
6442500	6445100	Alright, but let me ask this on a serious note.
6445100	6449620	They should have other things other than joggers, like little squirrels or dogs or something
6449620	6450620	like that.
6451620	6452620	Maybe the dogs eat the shit.
6452620	6455620	Will you knock it off with that shit?
6455620	6456620	Alright.
6456620	6460700	I like the idea of the shit-eating dog.
6460700	6461700	You guys are so stupid.
6461700	6463700	Alright, but what else-
6463700	6466140	You hang with us, what's that say about you?
6466140	6468140	What else are you working on these days, YYRE?
6468140	6470820	Because pixel shits, you're not going to make any money off this.
6470820	6471820	What-
6471820	6472820	I don't know, man.
6472820	6476500	You put this on iOS, I think you can make some money.
6476500	6481660	The thing is though, on iOS, how would you control this with the twitch precise precision
6481660	6483980	that you would need?
6483980	6489380	I mean, I guess I could be like, tap the upper part of the screen to move up, tap the lower
6489380	6491380	part of the screen to move down.
6491380	6492380	Use the-
6492380	6493380	I don't know, I guess it might work.
6493380	6494380	Accelerometer.
6494380	6497020	But would it pass Apple's certification?
6497020	6498020	Yes.
6498020	6503420	You might have to go Android.
6503420	6504420	No comment.
6504420	6505420	Alright.
6505420	6511060	As far as what else I'm working on, really the main thing I'm working on these days is,
6511060	6513540	has nothing to do with game development at all.
6513540	6520060	It's preparing my apartment because, although I know I mentioned to you guys that I was
6520060	6526180	looking for a job out there in San Francisco, it turns out my fiance felt that she had been
6526180	6529220	waiting too long, so she started looking for a job out here.
6529220	6535180	I applied to 15 or so places, and within two months of her starting to look, the New York
6535180	6540420	Public Library offered her a position, so she's actually moving here on Friday.
6540420	6541420	Wow!
6541420	6542420	Well, congrats.
6542420	6543420	Look at that!
6543420	6544420	That's amazing.
6544420	6549340	I mean, I'm bummed out to see you're not gonna end up on this coast after all, but I'm happy
6549340	6550340	for you at the end result.
6550340	6551340	That'll be great.
6551340	6555820	Well, I know we will be back to visit, so we may yet be able to play that game of Bishi
6555820	6556820	Bashi.
6556820	6557820	Awesome.
6557820	6561300	Bochi Kawa has an idea, by the way, for iOS controls.
6561300	6564420	Tap the screen to move, but yell at it to shit.
6564420	6568940	Oh my god, your voice would go dead within minutes.
6568940	6574260	SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
6574260	6575260	SHIT!
6575260	6576460	Oh god, alright.
6576460	6581100	Maybe it's one of those things in there that's, like, intended to be a novelty where you can
6581100	6584060	use it, but it's probably not the best idea.
6584060	6588500	Alright, so why are there any easter eggs in the game we should know of?
6588500	6593380	Actually, there are absolutely none, but I will say this much.
6593380	6599980	One thing that will definitely improve your performance, if you will, if you leave a lot
6599980	6605500	of the medium-sized shits around, you know, enough for the jogger to get stuck in it for
6605500	6611060	a couple of seconds, but not enough to stop them, you can go and basically crap on the
6611060	6615500	jogger while they're stuck in the medium shit and make it big.
6615500	6619820	So you can actually, like, cover the jogger and shit in a way?
6619820	6625420	Well, I mean, the effect is the same, as if they had just run into a big one, but basically
6625420	6632060	you can cover more places with medium shits than large shits in the same amount of time,
6632060	6636420	so you could just kind of leave medium shits in places, and then as long as you can get
6636420	6641340	to it before the jogger gets free, you can add to it and then trap them.
6641340	6646140	And then you can imagine the joggers are your enemies and take a shit on them.
6646140	6648060	When somebody asks me, what have you accomplished?
6648300	6651780	And by the way, I have nothing against joggers.
6651780	6656420	When somebody asked me, when somebody asked me, Rob, what have you accomplished in 12
6656420	6657820	and a half years of Orange Lounge Radio?
6657820	6662060	I'm just going to send him this little snippet of us talking about Pixel Shits.
6662060	6663060	That's uh...
6663060	6664060	I endorse this activity.
6664060	6665060	That's right.
6665060	6668860	Well, YYR, I do have to let you go so we can move on with the show, but I do encourage
6668860	6670380	people to check out Pixel Shits.
6670380	6673580	It was, it was, it was clearly a project you did out of love.
6673580	6677300	You are truly doing the Lord's work, my friend.
6677780	6678780	Well, thank you.
6678780	6680940	I don't know which Lord exactly, but uh...
6680940	6681940	Dark Sakura.
6681940	6682940	Clearly.
6684300	6685300	Bless you, my child.
6685300	6689460	But as long as you keep mentioning ideas for dream games, I'm going to keep listening.
6689460	6692100	So uh, just be careful about what you say.
6692100	6693100	That's amazing.
6693100	6694100	All right.
6694100	6695100	We will try it.
6695100	6697300	Now, we also, we've got to be careful because we don't want to be like every week, be like,
6697300	6698300	oh, that's a dream game.
6698300	6699300	Oh, that's a dream game.
6699300	6700300	Because then that's going to jump the shark.
6700300	6704540	We, we have to make sure that our dream game ideas are carefully selected.
6704540	6705540	That's so key.
6705540	6706540	Like Pixel Shits.
6707540	6708540	All right.
6708540	6709540	Well, uh, best of luck.
6709540	6714340	By the way, I would encourage anyone else who wants to, you know, get us started programming
6714340	6719540	to also go ahead and listen to Orange Lounge Radio for dream game ideas.
6719540	6721540	Go ahead and...
6721540	6722540	Games.
6722540	6724540	You don't, oh no, we're losing you a little bit.
6724540	6726540	You don't, you don't have to clone games that are already out there.
6726540	6728540	Make our shit.
6728540	6729540	Yeah.
6729540	6730540	All right.
6730540	6731540	We can think of some real shit.
6731540	6732540	All right.
6732540	6735540	YYR, I'm going to let you go so we can get back into some news, but you are so amazing,
6735540	6736540	my friend.
6736540	6737540	Thank you so much.
6737540	6742540	Hey, I have to live up to your standards of being amazing.
6742540	6743540	I love you guys.
6743540	6744540	Oh, stop, stop.
6744540	6745540	We love you too.
6745540	6746540	All right.
6746540	6747540	Take care, buddy.
6747540	6748540	All right.
6748540	6749540	Later.
6749540	6750540	Take it easy, guys.
6750540	6751540	Bye.
6751540	6752540	Bye.
6752540	6754540	Unfortunately, Skype wasn't cooperating there at the end of the call, but that's all right.
6754540	6755540	Uh, still a pleasure to hear from YYR.
6755540	6760540	That's so adorable that, uh, he's going to be moving with a fiance Friday.
6760540	6762540	That's no pressure whatsoever.
6762540	6763540	That's great.
6763540	6769540	Uh, please, uh, if you, if you do believe that we do, that Aaron is doing the Lord's
6769540	6773540	work, uh, please consider supporting his other projects that do make him money because he's
6773540	6775540	not going to make shit off of Pixel Shits.
6775540	6779540	Uh, but he will make some money off of, uh, um, just a little bit, just a little bit of
6779540	6783540	money off of like Bungee Ferret tossing and falling and Snake 360 and some of his other
6783540	6784540	projects that are available.
6784540	6788540	You can read all about all of those games at YYRgames.com.
6788540	6792540	Uh, meanwhile, have fun shitting everybody.
6792540	6795540	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.
6795540	6797540	Uh, Loki.
6797540	6798540	Okay.
6798540	6805540	It's hard to, hard to come off of that, but let's, it's just, it's so easy to make this
6805540	6807540	transition, but okay, we're going to do it.
6807540	6808540	Okay.
6808540	6813540	Speaking of shit, uh, Nintendo's got some more amigos going to be coming out here.
6813540	6815540	Not nice.
6815540	6818540	Yellow flag, Loki.
6818540	6819540	No.
6819540	6824540	Um, yeah, they're going to be, they're showing off the second kind of wave of amigos they're
6824540	6826540	supposed to hit around February of next year.
6826540	6830540	Um, includes, uh, let's see here.
6830540	6834540	Lucario, Rosalina, and Luma.
6834540	6841540	Um, Bowser, Toon Link, Sheik, Ike, Meta Knight, and King Dedede.
6841540	6848540	And of course, uh, also, they're going to have, uh, was it Shulk, Sonic, and Mega Man
6848540	6849540	as well.
6849540	6855540	Um, those I think are supposed to, was it, they don't really have firm dates yet for
6855540	6862540	North America, but to give you an example, in Europe, um, I guess, um, everything up
6862540	6866540	to Meta Knight, Sonic, and King Dedede is supposed to be out January 23rd, and the rest
6866540	6869540	are coming out February 20th.
6869540	6875540	Um, Toon Link is, I guess, compatible with Mario Kart 8 and Hyrule Warriors, as well
6875540	6881540	as, um, Sheik is also supposed to be compatible Hyrule Warriors, and then, um, I'm not really
6881540	6882540	sure about the rest yet.
6882540	6885540	I'm assuming those will be Smash.
6885540	6890540	The only thing is, North America, you're kind of getting screwed a little bit, because if
6890540	6895540	you want to get Shulk, then you're going to have to do business with GameStop, because
6895540	6902540	once again, Nintendo's thought, hey, it's going to be a great idea, let's go ahead and
6902540	6905540	make them exclusive to GameStop.
6905540	6907540	So, thanks.
6907540	6909540	That's fantastic.
6909540	6912540	Um, let's see.
6912540	6918540	And I guess, um, what else?
6918540	6920540	I guess that's it.
6920540	6925540	Um, and of course, each of those is going to be $12.99, so, not bad.
6925540	6929540	I think it was funny that just last week, we were talking about, like, third-party amiibos.
6929540	6932540	Like, I remember this coming up, like, um, what if third parties would start making their
6932540	6936540	own amiibos, and sure enough, like, within the week, Sonic and Mega Man.
6936540	6937540	Yeah, but those are just Smash Bros. still.
6937540	6939540	It's not really a third-party thing.
6939540	6943540	Still, though, the fact that they're figurines and Smash Bros., I mean, the figurines is
6943540	6946540	another thing that had to be licensed and talked about and acquired.
6946540	6949540	I mean, it's not just like, oh, because you're in Smash Bros., we get to do all this shit
6949540	6952540	with your character.
6952540	6953540	I don't know.
6953540	6956540	Um, I was going to mention, though, I don't think we were talking about tonight, because
6956540	6960540	it wasn't really that big of a deal, but they were saying, there was, like, a little tease
6960540	6966540	I saw saying that, uh, the next, was it Zelda, uh, Majora's Mask is going to play differently
6966540	6970540	on, you know, the new 3DS, but we're not telling you how.
6970540	6972540	It's fucking amiibo support.
6972540	6974540	I'm telling you right now, that's what it is.
6974540	6978540	It's fucking amiibo support, because that shit supports near-field communication.
6978540	6979540	That's what it is.
6979540	6981540	It's not anything fantastic.
6981540	6982540	So, whatever.
6982540	6984540	Um, okay.
6984540	6985540	This is kind of cool.
6985540	6987540	I saw this, and I was like, fuck yes!
6987540	6993540	Um, Just Cause 3 announced to be coming out next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and
6993540	6998540	PC, and it's going to be on the cover of Game Informer, um, next month.
6998540	7000540	That is awesome.
7000540	7005540	I've been waiting a long time for Just Cause 3, and, uh, you know, Just Cause 2 is fantastic.
7005540	7009540	Hopefully we get some multiplayer in there, and hopefully it's as awesome as Just Cause,
7009540	7015540	um, I forget what they called it, um, the multiplayer mod on PC, where you can play
7015540	7017540	it to a thousand people at a time.
7017540	7018540	Sounds fucking awesome.
7018540	7026540	Um, but yeah, next year, so I'm assuming we'll see something about that during E3, and they're
7026540	7032540	telling us it's coming, but I'm still skeptical until I actually see it out, but Rockstar
7032540	7037540	are saying that Grand Theft Auto Online will be getting heists shortly after the launch
7037540	7040540	of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.
7040540	7045540	Uh, quoted, you know, we know you're all excited for more updates to come, and we've got some
7045540	7049540	really exciting stuff in the works, and continue adding and expanding and involving the world
7049540	7053540	of Grand Theft Auto Online, including the highly anticipated launch of Online Heist,
7053540	7059540	which will be available on all four consoles, as of the first, um, as the first Grand Theft
7059540	7064540	Auto Online update to happen after the game launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7064540	7069540	I hope that's true, because it's been delayed several, several, several, several times.
7069540	7071540	So, yeah.
7071540	7073540	Alright, you need this Online Heist to happen.
7073540	7079540	Yeah, after all, it was promised for, you know, before the game even came out, so...
7079540	7080540	True.
7080540	7081540	Yeah.
7081540	7085540	Alright, well, um, speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, um, some Black Friday deals are starting
7085540	7091540	to show up, because, you know, the crazy shopping hysteria day in America is next Friday, right?
7091540	7094540	No, not this coming Friday, but the Friday after, but it's like two weeks away, right?
7094540	7095540	Okay, so we're getting close.
7095540	7101540	Um, and, uh, yeah, if you are, uh, if you're the type that's gonna go out and wait in the
7101540	7105540	line all frickin' night and get your little redemption slip and, I don't know, pull out
7105540	7109540	weaves trying to get to, you know, the best deals in the store, then good luck.
7109540	7110540	Me?
7110540	7112540	I'm more of a Cyber Monday person.
7112540	7117540	I'll sit in my pajama bottoms with my cup of coffee and try to order stuff online.
7117540	7118540	Isn't...
7118540	7119540	Huh?
7119540	7122540	Isn't this around the time when we expect another Steam sale?
7122540	7123540	Oh, of course.
7123540	7124540	Of course.
7124540	7125540	Not ready.
7125540	7126540	Thanksgiving.
7126540	7127540	I know.
7127540	7128540	It's not...
7128540	7129540	Well, here's the good news.
7129540	7130540	It won't be the huge one.
7130540	7131540	That'll be winter.
7131540	7133540	That'll be the winter sale that takes place across, but they'll do, like, a Black Friday
7133540	7134540	sale at Cyber Monday.
7134540	7135540	They'll do something...
7135540	7136540	Cyber Monday!
7136540	7137540	Absolutely.
7138540	7140540	Black Friday deals.
7140540	7146540	PlayStation Blog revealed that there are some $399.99 bundles for PlayStation 4 that will
7146540	7149540	have some different included games.
7149540	7154540	One will have a disc-based copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 and a download voucher for The Last
7154540	7155540	of Us Remastered.
7155540	7160540	The second will have a physical copy of Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham and a voucher for Little
7160540	7161540	Big Planet 3.
7161540	7164540	So those are gonna be available especially for Black Friday.
7164540	7168540	So, I mean, if you think about it, two games, and those are kind of newer games, you know,
7168540	7169540	those aren't, like, years old.
7169540	7173540	It's not like you're getting Knack or something that's kind of last year's news.
7173540	7177540	Those are very recent games, so that's, like, $100 worth of games being thrown in there,
7177540	7181540	so that's how they are justifying the price there.
7181540	7182540	Pretty cool.
7182540	7188540	Also, some Black Friday discounts unveiled on PlayStation TVs and PlayStation 3s.
7188540	7194540	Amazon and GameStop both gonna be offering PlayStation TVs for $80 and PlayStation 3s
7194540	7196540	for $200.
7196540	7201540	This will be throughout the holiday season but is temporary and first come, first served.
7201540	7206540	So, wow, if you're in the market for a PlayStation TV, this might be the time to take the plunge
7206540	7207540	on one of those.
7207540	7212540	Many of you last week took the plunge on Valkyria Chronicles on Steam.
7212540	7218540	In fact, Valkyria Chronicles was released on Steam and PC and during the first 24 hours
7218540	7224540	apparently became number one, beating Assassin's Creed Unity for a short period of time.
7224540	7228540	I'm not sure how things have played out in the week since then, but obviously Valkyria
7228540	7233540	Chronicles is doing very well on PC and that's great because on PlayStation 3, I think a
7233540	7236540	lot of people missed it, so the fact that this game is getting a second chance on PC
7236540	7240540	is pretty cool and a lot of people are supporting it, so good job, y'all.
7240540	7243540	You're not gonna be able to support this, but you know what, guys?
7243540	7244540	It was probably crap.
7244540	7250540	There was a Family Guy game that was in development for the Wii and the Nintendo 3DS.
7250540	7252540	This was called Back to the Multiverse.
7252540	7255540	It was being developed by Heavy Iron Studios.
7255540	7261540	It was originally on the PC, the PlayStation, and the Xbox 360, but the Wii version was
7261540	7267540	then dropped and the 3DS version quickly after, probably just because, I mean...
7267540	7270540	Yeah, I didn't even realize it was coming out on those platforms.
7270540	7274540	Yeah, I didn't even know the game came out on other platforms and the Wii in 2012 is
7274540	7277540	already kind of, you know, yeah.
7277540	7279540	It probably was for the best.
7279540	7281540	Sorry, guys.
7281540	7282540	Dark Soccer.
7282540	7284540	It was for the best because apparently that game sucked.
7284540	7285540	What a surprise.
7285540	7288540	The other thing I was gonna mention, though, I don't know if you mentioned it, the PlayStation
7288540	7290540	TV discounts, that's effective now.
7290540	7292540	You don't even have to wait until Black Friday.
7292540	7293540	Oh shit, that's great.
7293540	7295540	It's already at Amazon and GameStop.
7295540	7297540	I think it's already at those prices.
7297540	7301540	Well, we have some different Nintendo news.
7301540	7305540	Actually, a little bit of a report about the Zelda Wii U version.
7305540	7311540	Aonuma says that it's actually even better than before the previous announcement.
7311540	7316540	It looks a lot better, a lot prettier, and they said there's gonna be a lot more coming
7316540	7318540	up for the next E3.
7318540	7320540	So that's pretty good.
7320540	7322540	I know a lot of people have been excited about it.
7322540	7327540	And then Captain Toad Treasure Tracker almost had Link in it.
7327540	7332540	Actually, when they did the demo of the game, they needed to use a character that wasn't
7332540	7336540	in the Mario franchise because it was trying to do a non-jumping character.
7336540	7345540	So they used Link, and Miyamoto thought they were actually gonna have it as a Link game,
7345540	7347540	so that, of course, didn't happen that way.
7347540	7353540	And then, last but not least, we do have some news about Super Smash Bros.
7353540	7357540	It is the Wii U's most pre-ordered game to date.
7357540	7362540	Lots of people wants it, and I know that the handheld one was super awesome,
7362540	7366540	so I can only imagine what the console version is like.
7366540	7368540	So there you go.
7368540	7374540	Actually, it's supposed to be out on November 21st in North America and the 28th in Europe.
7374540	7376540	So, there you go.
7376540	7377540	I'm looking forward to that.
7377540	7380540	I think we're gonna be talking about that game a little bit on next week's show.
7380540	7381540	Call it a hunch.
7381540	7383540	But I think that game's gonna come up a little bit.
7383540	7385540	All right, let's get to the FOOGLE Question of the Week.
7393540	7397540	You take Facebook and Google+, and you throw those words in a blender, and you get FOOGLE.
7397540	7402540	And it's where we ask our two social communities at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
7402540	7405540	and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
7405540	7411540	We ask them a question, and we say, hey, you should answer this so we can get your feedback on the air.
7411540	7417540	This week, we decided to ask about Amiibo, because, you know, Amiibo was kind of a mystery for a while.
7417540	7418540	We didn't know a whole lot about it.
7418540	7420540	We figured it was Nintendo's ripoff of Skylanders,
7420540	7424540	but now that we know the full picture on what Amiibo is really all about,
7424540	7428540	we want to check in with listeners and say, you know, are you into it?
7428540	7429540	Do you just want the figures?
7429540	7431540	What's your stance on Amiibo?
7431540	7433540	Have you pre-ordered, or are you saying no way?
7433540	7434540	So let's check in.
7434540	7437540	We'll go over to Google first, and ActDeft says,
7437540	7440540	at first, I was skeptical on whether these were a good idea or not,
7440540	7443540	but after the two latest Nintendo Directs, I got sold on them.
7443540	7444540	I have two reserved.
7444540	7445540	One is Yoshi.
7445540	7447540	I'll let you guess on who's the other one.
7447540	7449540	And if you don't know ActDeft,
7449540	7453540	I'm just going to tell you his avatar is a little stuffed Kirby,
7453540	7455540	so just, you know, take that for what it is.
7455540	7459540	Redertainment says, remember our discussion from a couple weeks ago
7459540	7463540	about buying in-game content for supposedly free games?
7463540	7468540	I feel Amiibos are similarly unnecessary to enhance the gaming experience,
7468540	7472540	but feel peer pressure will press on gamers to buy the Amiibos.
7472540	7476540	Also, my iPad corrects Amiibos to Amigos.
7476540	7478540	Well, it hasn't learned the word Amiibos yet,
7478540	7484540	because remember, now the iOS is going to learn what you like to say.
7484540	7486540	Let's check out on Facebook.
7486540	7490540	Critical Myth says, I'm still not sure what the Amiibo thing is supposed to really do.
7490540	7494540	At least Skylanders and Disney Infinity have a clear use for the figures,
7494540	7496540	even if it's total cash grab.
7496540	7498540	This just has the cash grab feel to it.
7498540	7501540	Well, Critical Myth, you're probably not alone in that,
7501540	7505540	and I think part of the problem is that, you know, Skylanders is one game.
7505540	7507540	Well, I take that it's more than one game,
7507540	7511540	but it's one series where essentially all those figures do the same thing in those games.
7511540	7514540	Amiibos vary from game to game to game,
7514540	7517540	so I think that's what's causing people to not really get it.
7517540	7520540	Like, it is one thing in Smash Brothers, but then like in Mario Kart,
7520540	7522540	it gives you a suit for your racer.
7522540	7524540	Whoopee! You know what I mean?
7524540	7526540	Stupid.
7526540	7529540	Yeah, so I think in some games the value is much more than others.
7529540	7532540	But here's the thing, it's like, and that's why I understand with that,
7532540	7537540	it's like, it's almost like that shit was going to be free anyways,
7537540	7540540	but now it's tied to this figure that they want you to buy.
7540540	7541540	Right.
7541540	7544540	Well, but at the end of the day too, they're just outfits.
7544540	7548540	You know, my, well, I'll get to how I feel about this when we get here for some more listeners here.
7548540	7550540	Cial supplies and says,
7550540	7552540	Not sure what they're supposed to be used for and why.
7552540	7556540	Depending on their purpose and build quality, I might be talked into getting one or two.
7556540	7561540	Sounds like Nintendo might need to get some more info out there besides just those directs,
7561540	7566540	or maybe, you know, not force people to watch the entire direct to understand what Amiibos are all about.
7566540	7567540	Dark Charger says,
7567540	7572540	As a lifelong Nintendo fan, I'm picking up some figures primarily for their looks and for collecting.
7572540	7575540	The added functionality is pretty much just a small bonus.
7575540	7577540	Erica M. replied and said,
7577540	7580540	I think they're so cute. Can't wait to get some.
7580540	7581540	Dark Tetsuya said,
7581540	7584540	I'll likely try to pick one or two when I get Smash Brothers this week,
7584540	7587540	even though there doesn't seem to be much to do with them outside of Smash yet.
7587540	7592540	One idea I had was saving your character parts, cart config, and Mario Kart 8 to the figure
7592540	7596540	so you wouldn't have to remember what exact parts you use in-game at a friend's house,
7596540	7601540	like the Wii-motes used to do for the regular Wii.
7601540	7602540	They still do that.
7602540	7604540	They still do that. It's just very few games use it, right?
7604540	7605540	Yeah.
7605540	7608540	Like saving your info to the controller.
7608540	7610540	Tom S. replied and said,
7610540	7616540	I'm going to collect all the Zelda-related Amiibos because I am a junkie for anything Zelda-related.
7616540	7617540	Brad B. says,
7617540	7621540	This is a slippery slope. I'd better steer clear of them totally.
7621540	7625540	I made the mistake of starting with the Marvel Disney Infinity figures
7625540	7627540	and Stitch, who snuck into my cart at checkout,
7627540	7631540	and those suckers are like crack for a completionist like me.
7631540	7635540	It's true. If you are the type that has to have everything, be careful.
7635540	7636540	Renji2214 says,
7636540	7639540	I'm thinking about picking some of them up after the release
7639540	7644540	because I think for the price the figures look pretty decent along with being able to be used in Smash.
7644540	7646540	Winston H. replied and said,
7646540	7648540	Personally, I don't really care for the Amiibo.
7648540	7651540	I don't see any real reason to purchase something like this unless you're a big collector
7651540	7654540	or you like your Skylander-like products.
7654540	7655540	Ragenator says,
7655540	7658540	I suppose they're neat if you're into gaming-themed paraphernalia,
7658540	7662540	be it the Amiibos, the old-school Nintendo comics, or whatever,
7662540	7665540	but I don't think the Amiibos are a must-have.
7665540	7667540	Surping Slurpee replies and says,
7667540	7670540	What the fuck is an Amiibo? They're for Nintendo? Who cares?
7670540	7674540	I haven't played a Nintendo console since N64 was still relevant.
7674540	7677540	Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a hater.
7678540	7681540	Sound the hater alarms. We've got a hater.
7681540	7682540	I'm just teasing.
7685540	7687540	I am very angry and I'm going to post on the internet.
7687540	7689540	No, I'm making fun.
7689540	7692540	You know what? You're not the only one, actually,
7692540	7694540	so there's other people out there that feel similarly.
7694540	7698540	But by not at least trying some of the GameCube stuff,
7698540	7700540	there was some really sweet games on GameCube.
7700540	7704540	I mean, if you've been on loop since N64, at least visit the GameCube.
7704540	7705540	At least visit that.
7705540	7707540	Crylo responds and says,
7707540	7710540	Going off the pictures I've seen here and there, I think they look beautiful.
7710540	7713540	As for collecting them, I only plan on buying the ones I like.
7713540	7714540	Lastly, Hitstun says,
7714540	7717540	Sure, I'll buy one so I can try some Amiibo stuff.
7717540	7722540	I'll have to do the research to find which Amiibos are compatible with the most games.
7722540	7725540	There's the answers from Facebook and Google+.
7725540	7728540	You know what's interesting? Not a single person who said,
7728540	7729540	I'm getting them all.
7729540	7733540	I would have thought there was at least one Uber Nintendo fanboy who said,
7733540	7734540	I'm getting them all.
7734540	7736540	Got to catch them all.
7736540	7739540	But anyway, as I was going to tell Loki a minute ago,
7739540	7742540	I think I felt similar to the people who said,
7742540	7745540	I want to just get them because they're cute little figures,
7745540	7749540	and the fact that they tie into some games is like a little bonus.
7749540	7751540	And I think that's kind of my stance on it,
7751540	7753540	is that I want the Samus figure,
7753540	7757540	and I'll probably have to get that Mega Man figure for sure,
7757540	7759540	and there'll be some other figures here and there where it's like,
7759540	7761540	I just want the figure because it looks cute.
7761540	7765540	Pretty much the only reason I could see wanting one of those is just the figure,
7765540	7771540	but really so far they haven't really given us a reason that we need to have these.
7771540	7774540	It's not like Skylanders and Disney Infinity, like I said,
7774540	7776540	where it seems to be necessary to play with those.
7776540	7779540	But at the same time, I don't want Nintendo going down that path either.
7779540	7784540	I actually kind of like that Nintendo kind of turns the Amiibo into,
7784540	7789540	oh, it unlocks a skin here, a weapon here, like it's little things.
7789540	7793540	Or it's like, okay, it's a little enhancement, but it's still something.
7793540	7798540	But they even haven't really discussed too much about training your character in Smash Bros.
7798540	7800540	or what exactly that does.
7800540	7803540	I mean, it's just kind of, it's like, ooh, it's a figure,
7803540	7805540	but it kind of does some other things too.
7805540	7806540	I mean, that's really all it is.
7806540	7809540	I would like to see more of, and what I think would be really cool is
7809540	7812540	if the Amiibos really function between all the different games.
7812540	7815540	I'd like to see more about how will it work between games.
7815540	7820540	Like, if I make progression in Smash Bros., can I use my Amiibo in another game,
7820540	7823540	and it rewards me for what I've done in Smash Bros. with that Amiibo?
7823540	7825540	I think that it would be a really, okay,
7825540	7829540	Nintendo's lacking a trophy or achievement system or thing like that right now.
7829540	7834540	The Amiibos might be a neat way to explore that a little bit.
7834540	7836540	I'd be down if they did something like that.
7836540	7838540	I just don't think they're going to do something like that.
7838540	7841540	I think they're going to talk in a big, like they did with the whole,
7841540	7845540	oh, you can put your Miis on the Wii remote and bring them with you type thing.
7845540	7847540	They're going to talk it up big, and then they're not going to do anything with it.
7847540	7852540	Or like, you know, how they had this really cool functionality with MP3s and stuff
7852540	7856540	being able to be played on the Wii for Excite, you know, Excite Truck,
7856540	7858540	and then, oh, fuck it, we're just going to totally forget about it,
7858540	7861540	except for, you know, the one Undersea game we had.
7861540	7863540	You know, it's just, I don't know.
7863540	7865540	They come up with these cool ideas, and then they never do anything with them.
7865540	7868540	Pao in chat says at live.vognetware.com,
7868540	7873540	Pao says, if Amiibo unlocked a big part of the game, gamers will rage on the internet.
7873540	7874540	That's absolutely true.
7874540	7877540	Fifth Dream says, like, you can't catch them all unless you buy an Amigo.
7877540	7879540	Fuck that.
7879540	7880540	That's true.
7880540	7883540	Jonas, haven't checked in with you in a little while.
7883540	7888540	You play a lot of the Wii U stuff, and a lot of it is very popular on the anime circuit.
7888540	7891540	How do you think Amiibos might change things up a little bit?
7891540	7894540	Do you see people bringing their Amiibos to anime conventions to be like,
7894540	7896540	oh, I've got to play my villager in Animal Crossing?
7896540	7901540	It might be possible, but again, I'm not really sure how Amiibos will work on the anime conventions.
7901540	7903540	We'll allow it and see how it works.
7903540	7907540	For my own personal benefit, it's more like, see, so far it's just collectors.
7907540	7911540	I don't know what Nintendo's going to do in terms of support, like everyone's saying.
7911540	7914540	Let's say if, or, let's say if I buy a Mario.
7914540	7921540	A Mario will work for every game, like Mario Kart, Mario, Mario 3D World, and all the other games and stuff.
7921540	7925540	Or if I wanted to use it for, like, even a Zelda game, just for shits and giggles.
7925540	7932540	It's gonna, they're gonna put out a ton of Pokemon Amiibos, and they're gonna have a fucking carrying case.
7932540	7934540	I guarantee it.
7934540	7935540	I don't-
7935540	7936540	That looks like a fucking Pokeball.
7936540	7940540	I actually, I don't see Nintendo putting out 151 Pokemon Amiibos, though.
7940540	7941540	That seems like too much.
7941540	7942540	That's overkill.
7942540	7946540	They're not gonna put out, they may not put them out, all of them, but they're gonna put out a ton of them.
7946540	7953540	And I guarantee you that's gonna be one of the things, like, look, you can train your own, it's like having your own Pokemon.
7953540	7957540	You train them, and then you bring them to battle, boom, put it down, and just...
7957540	7959540	Yeah, I could see it going that way, too.
7959540	7963540	What I'm also maybe concerned with, just forgetting development's perspective.
7963540	7968540	What if they do, like, an on-disc DLC, quote, unquote.
7968540	7974540	Ooh, you can either pay four bucks for that thing, or just use your Amiibo to get it for free, kind of thing.
7974540	7979540	I don't see Nintendo going down that path, because Nintendo is not the $4 DLC type of company.
7979540	7983540	You know, we mentioned that earlier in the show, is that a lot of the DLC that Nintendo has done so far,
7983540	7989540	I mean, anything can happen, but a lot of the DLC Nintendo has done so far has been very rich in what it's doing.
7989540	7993540	And I'm okay that these Amiibos just do little things in the game.
7993540	7997540	Like, you know, okay, I get a custom suit for my racer in Mario Kart.
7997540	7998540	That's not a big deal.
7998540	8001540	You know, that's a fine little, like, okay, little enhancement.
8001540	8004540	I mean, is that on-disc DLC?
8004540	8009540	Sort of. I think it was patched in, technically, but it's so minor in the big scope of things.
8009540	8013540	And I do like that the one figure will work in several games.
8013540	8017540	That is kind of neat. That's something that Skylanders and Disney Infinity don't necessarily have.
8017540	8020540	I mean, they do work in several games in the same series,
8020540	8025540	but even Skylander finds ways to make you buy new shit for the same series every year.
8025540	8027540	Like, you know, oh, this year they're going to swap.
8027540	8029540	The top halves and the bottom halves are switchable.
8029540	8032540	Or, you know, what is it this year? The trap team or something?
8032540	8036540	You have these stupid trap crystals that you can trap enemies in and play as the enemies.
8036540	8039540	Yeah. Little much, little much.
8039540	8042540	All right, so there you go. Thank you guys for your feedback there.
8042540	8046540	And be very curious in a couple weeks to check in and see how much you guys have used them.
8046540	8050540	Or if they're just sitting on your shelf looking pretty, which I suppose is okay,
8050540	8052540	because they are figurines. They're meant to do that.
8052540	8055540	In the meantime, let's get back into some other gaming news.
8055540	8058540	We will be taking your calls here in a little while at 1877 Game O-L-R
8058540	8061540	or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. But first, Loki.
8061540	8065540	So this is kind of cool. Even though the official Nintendo Magazine has shut down,
8065540	8070540	Nintendo UK has gone ahead and put out a digital magazine called Nintendo Extra.
8070540	8078540	And so now you can, you know, check that out to find out all the latest Nintendo information.
8078540	8084540	It's pretty much just an advertisement piece, but it's still kind of neat, though,
8084540	8089540	that they're doing some sort of an official magazine type thing. I don't know.
8090540	8097540	But yeah, I guess you can check it out now. Let's see, nintendo.co.uk slash miscellaneous.
8097540	8101540	That's Nintendo Extra. I'm sure they've got a link on the front page, though, for it.
8101540	8106540	All right. Is that something I could actually look at on my Wii U tablet or something?
8106540	8107540	That would make sense.
8107540	8115540	Probably. It's just an HTML page. I mean, they've got some of the things that are in Nintendo Extra issue one.
8115540	8120540	Stuff about Smash Brothers. It looks like a big ol' advertisement.
8120540	8129540	So they have a how to play, you know, Mario Kart or, you know, Adventures in Walleye Tumble Temple, Captain Toad comic.
8131540	8135540	You know, I don't know. It's just a big advertisement.
8135540	8140540	All right. Well, get your tinfoil hats ready, everybody, because here's a big one.
8140540	8146540	And I feel like this kind of comes up. Like, every year we get a rumor on this, but it is gaining steam yet again,
8146540	8154540	as some folks have noticed that there is a trademark that you can actually view for yourself on the USPTO.gov website.
8154540	8161540	You can look this up. It is a trademark for Microsoft for what? Battle Toads.
8162540	8167540	Battle Toads has been trademarked by Microsoft.
8167540	8172540	Now, see, here's the thing, though, is I kind of feel like, well, this could just be them protecting their property
8172540	8176540	and renewing the trademark because maybe they want to do something someday.
8176540	8181540	It doesn't mean that they're doing something now, right this minute, but they don't want somebody else coming in
8181540	8184540	and doing a Battle Toads game just because they let it lapse.
8184540	8189540	By the way, if you forgot, Battle Toads was a NES game and I believe had a Game Boy version as well.
8189540	8190540	An NES version.
8190540	8191540	An arcade.
8191540	8192540	An arcade.
8192540	8194540	They had many variants, like, for the Sega Genesis.
8194540	8195540	And Super Nintendo.
8195540	8196540	Oh, that's right.
8196540	8198540	Which is the easier version of the NES version.
8198540	8204540	Which was all Rare that did that, but then Rare was, of course, picked up by Microsoft several years ago,
8204540	8208540	which is why you have Killer Instinct on Xbox One and so on.
8208540	8211540	But I don't know if they could file a trademark for something that they're not going to use
8211540	8217540	because you have to show that you're using that trademark in order to be able to register the trademark.
8217540	8221540	That's hard to say because I remember this was an issue with, quote, Killer Instinct at the time.
8221540	8225540	I just know that because I looked in the registering trademarks, so...
8225540	8233540	So, in order... Yeah, you have to show that you're using the trademark in order to actually register said trademark.
8233540	8235540	I don't...
8235540	8236540	As far as I understand.
8236540	8239540	I don't see why they wouldn't try doing something like this,
8239540	8242540	but that doesn't mean it's going to necessarily be the game you expect either.
8242540	8246540	I mean, this could be like a kid-friendly property for all we know.
8246540	8247540	Fuck no.
8247540	8248540	Well, hell no. Hell no.
8248540	8251540	It can be kid-friendly, but it better beat the shit out of you when you play it.
8251540	8253540	Because it's got to be hard.
8253540	8256540	I don't know. Again, I am literally pulling this out of my ass.
8256540	8258540	Nobody knows anything on this.
8258540	8262540	This is all just fanfic based on the trademark, literally.
8262540	8263540	So...
8263540	8268540	But the potential, or the possibilities and the potential here is pretty exciting, if nothing else.
8268540	8272540	As long as the game is hard as shit and you have the queen as the final boss, okay, cool.
8272540	8275540	Yeah, that's true. A lot of people really attach to the characters.
8275540	8280540	You know, the original NES version had those cinematics that were, at the time, were pretty epic.
8280540	8284540	I don't know, but it's also been a good 20 years since then.
8284540	8286540	I like Super Battletoads. That was pretty awesome.
8286540	8288540	Yeah, Super Battletoads is cool.
8288540	8290540	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
8290540	8292540	Well, we have some stuff.
8292540	8296540	Now, this one is, I would say, a near and dear one for us anyway.
8296540	8301540	We've been big supporters of GamerX, right?
8301540	8310540	Right. And, well, this has been associated with GamerX, I would probably say, pretty tightly.
8310540	8312540	So...
8312540	8314540	Technically, it's the same company.
8314540	8321540	Midboss puts on GamerX and this is like their first game, which is basically MatCon and Air Brainchild.
8321540	8324540	Yeah, well, that was good too.
8324540	8327540	And his people. It's not just him, but his people.
8327540	8331540	Well, anyway, the playable demo of Read Only Memories is out.
8331540	8336540	And you can get it online. It's for Windows, Linux, and OS X.
8336540	8346540	And, basically, they want you to try it out and tweet back to atrom2064 and let them know what you think.
8346540	8352540	There's a pre-order available on Humble Bundle and the Ouya store, because there will also be an Ouya version.
8352540	8354540	Although, there's not a demo for the Ouya yet.
8354540	8359540	You can get your copy at Mega Limited.
8363540	8366540	I'm trying to get the direct address, but I don't have it there.
8366540	8371540	But we'll have to get it for you guys and put it somewhere for you guys to play the demo.
8371540	8375540	Or just Google it. You can find it there. Look up their Twitter.
8375540	8376540	Do the Google thing.
8376540	8377540	All over.
8377540	8380540	So, yeah, pretty cool. I'm excited, because, yay.
8380540	8386540	Yeah, it's inspired. If you didn't know, the game is inspired by Snatcher pretty heavily.
8386540	8389540	And some of those more cinematic games from the past.
8389540	8391540	It's a total cyberpunk game.
8391540	8396540	Don't download this expecting next-gen graphics, because that's not what you're going to get.
8396540	8398540	But this is more a story-driven type of game.
8398540	8399540	Think Sega CD.
8399540	8400540	Yeah.
8400540	8406540	Yeah, I'll have to check that out. I didn't get a chance to do that this week, but maybe I will do that soon.
8406540	8408540	Alright, let's move on. Loki.
8408540	8409540	Alright.
8411540	8414540	So this is interesting. I don't know.
8414540	8419540	Kind of since we were talking a little bit about, you know, Microsoft maybe bringing back old properties.
8419540	8424540	But Killer Instinct apparently was originally supposed to be for Xbox 360.
8424540	8430540	They even had like a Killer Instinct prototype build that was being shown off.
8430540	8433540	And they have some footage now online for it.
8434540	8438540	I guess I'm not surprised and actually didn't look that bad.
8438540	8441540	Although they do have some placeholder things.
8441540	8449540	Like I guess Chief Thunder kind of looks like this weird silvery humanoid thing instead of Chief Thunder.
8449540	8451540	But pretty cool.
8451540	8455540	And yeah, you can check it out on YouTube. They've got some footage of it.
8455540	8458540	Killer Instinct prototype for Xbox 360.
8458540	8462540	Yeah, you have to wonder if maybe at one point this could have been something we saw on the 360.
8462540	8469540	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. It makes sense that they put it on Xbox One to kind of bolster up the lineup that they had coming out at launch.
8469540	8471540	Makes sense.
8471540	8476540	Alright. Let's see. Moving on to this. This is a game.
8476540	8479540	It seems like between Battletoads and Killer Instinct.
8479540	8482540	We've got a little segment here made up of retro games that people love.
8482540	8487540	And I know a lot of people have a lot of love in their hearts for Earthbound.
8488540	8492540	Or Mother, if you will. That series over in Japan which we knew as Earthbound.
8492540	8494540	Well, did you know? I didn't know this.
8494540	8499540	The game was apparently number 10 on the Wii U eShop charts last week.
8499540	8504540	Higher than Zelda, A Link to the Past, Shovel Knight, and Super Mario Brothers.
8504540	8509540	So I mean Earthbound is still performing. I mean this game that's years and years old still performing well today.
8509540	8514540	Which is funny because it didn't perform so well when it was out in the States the first time.
8514540	8516540	But that's neither here nor there.
8516540	8522540	Apparently, Fangamer had an upcoming documentary, CD book, and E-zine project on this.
8522540	8528540	And it's doing very well. It's collecting over $200,000 with six days of its Kickstarter campaign left.
8528540	8536540	So with the money, Fangamer is going to throw an Earthbound or Mother convention next summer.
8536540	8538540	That's right. An Earthbound...
8538540	8541540	Gonna pack up the tea bag or gear and head to the Earthbound convention, Jonas?
8542540	8549540	Well, here's the thing. It is intentionally going to be a small event. Only about 450 attendees.
8549540	8552540	300 of the tickets will be made available to backers first.
8552540	8556540	And the rest of the 150 they're hoping won't sell out instantly.
8556540	8558540	But they probably will. Let's be real.
8558540	8559540	Where's this location supposed to be?
8559540	8564540	I haven't seen it. I'm actually going to look here at the Kickstarter page to see where it's at.
8565540	8568540	The convention was their stretch goal for $200,000.
8568540	8573540	Oh, here it is. Tucson, Arizona at the Hilton Tucson East.
8573540	8577540	You could drive it. That's a bitch of a drive. But you could do it.
8577540	8580540	It's about a 10-11 hour drive to get to Tucson.
8580540	8581540	Not bad.
8581540	8585540	Think about it. I'm volunteering Jonas' service. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
8585540	8589540	But that would be fun. That would be fun.
8589540	8595540	The main event, the Earthbound Bash. Two days of playing a 20-year-old RPG for charity.
8595540	8598540	Oh, that's cool. They're doing it all for charity. Ticket price is $50.
8598540	8601540	They're also going to have retro gaming rooms.
8601540	8604540	Somebody's doing it, Jonas.
8604540	8610540	Live music performances, panels, and more. That's really cool.
8610540	8614540	I mean, even though it's going to be a small to-do, that's really cool for fans of Earthbound.
8614540	8617540	Tucson, Arizona. That is an interesting place.
8617540	8618540	When is the date supposedly?
8618540	8624540	When is it? July 18th and 19th, 2015. Saturday and Sunday and a possible pre-party on Friday night.
8624540	8629540	Summer convention in Tucson, Arizona.
8629540	8635540	You will not be going outdoors during this time. I can guarantee you that. That is for damn sure.
8635540	8636540	That sounds like fun.
8636540	8639540	Would you go to an Earthbound convention, Dark Sakura? Would you consider that?
8639540	8640540	I might.
8640540	8641540	That might be fun.
8642540	8649540	Let's see. If you need some special speakers, I know some people that have an affinity for Earthbound.
8649540	8651540	I hear Bose makes good speakers.
8653540	8658540	Alright, well Dark Sakura's going to do some speaking right now as she dives into the email bag.
8658540	8659540	It's all sticky.
8659540	8661540	Every week you guys email us.
8661540	8664540	Participate at Orangelauntrader.com.
8664540	8667540	If you want to participate with the show again, that's participate at Orangelauntrader.com.
8667540	8670540	Well, I just got freaking logged out again, so whatever.
8670540	8673540	It just keeps happening over and over. I'm sick of this.
8673540	8676540	Well, I don't know what to tell you.
8676540	8679540	I'm going to be replacing my iPad soon.
8680540	8682540	Weren't you thinking about getting mine?
8682540	8685540	No, I'm actually getting a MacBook Pro in two weeks.
8685540	8688540	Oh, lucky you. That'll be fun. That'll be a lot of fun.
8688540	8693540	Alright, well Dark Sakura's getting logged in there and you can send your emails if you want.
8693540	8695540	Participate at Orangelauntrader.com.
8695540	8699540	Remember, if you're a podcast listener, which thank you for checking out the show.
8699540	8703540	I know you can't be in the live chat room and participate that way, but you can always email us.
8703540	8707540	You can also tweet us. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8707540	8711540	And you know what? We even read random messages sent to us on Facebook. We do.
8711540	8714540	We don't always respond to every one of them, but we read them.
8714540	8717540	Alright, well are we ready for the first of the mails?
8717540	8719540	Alright, we are. There's more than one email tonight?
8719540	8720540	There are two.
8720540	8722540	Oh, and I looked earlier. There's just one. Alright.
8722540	8726540	Hey guys and gals. IngramAV98 here.
8726540	8731540	Once again, I keep putting off emailing and as a podcast listener, I don't get to enjoy the musical gifts.
8731540	8734540	But you'd be still on us when there are no emails to read.
8734540	8741540	As I listen, you're threatening the Star Wars music, so now this is the get out of jail free card?
8741540	8745540	I was listening to another podcast and someone mentioned the subject of growing up.
8745540	8749540	Now the hosts of kids are married or whatever and their gaming diets and habits have changed somewhat.
8749540	8753540	It made me think how I have changed and what I look for when gaming.
8753540	8758540	This of course led me to think about the future as I've never thought about stopping my gaming hobby.
8758540	8764540	When I start a family, I hope to share this with my children and currently I share it with my girlfriend as she has a casual interest.
8764540	8775540	I like to think that even when I hit retirement, I'll still be gaming, still schooling the kids on Halo 30 Super Gold Turbo Anniversary Edition on my YBox 1080.
8775540	8783540	Gaming for a much older generation is not something anybody really talks about, but it is something we will probably face at some point.
8783540	8791540	Sensibilities and priorities will change, but hopefully not our desire to explore, compete, or socialize, which is essentially the basic motivations behind gaming.
8791540	8798540	Back in the UK, I know some care homes for the elderly introduced the Wii because of the motion controls and how it encourages more physical activity.
8798540	8803540	In Japan, the DS XL was popular among pensioners as a way to keep the mind active.
8803540	8810540	Have any of you thought about your gaming in the future? How huge will Jamie's gaming thought get in 20-30 years?
8810540	8817540	Will Loki have retired because his game and its sequels are raking in the cash?
8817540	8820540	And will Rob have started even more podcasts?
8820540	8830540	We spend a lot of time thinking about where gaming is moving to in terms of an industry, but us gamers shape that in many ways.
8830540	8840540	We don't really look at ourselves in that future. More importantly, will we still be able to listen to the show in 30 years, or will we have sold the movie rights to an aging Michael Bay for a blockbuster origin story?
8840540	8851540	It's always great to hear you all in the community every week, so thanks for everything. And that's IngramAV98 from Dusseldorf.
8851540	8855540	Rob Roberts stars in Don't Fuck With Me, Ferret.
8855540	8865540	Well, I will go ahead and speak about the vault that Dan and I have actually talked about downsizing it, and then we actually had decent room for the vault, so now we're talking about rebuilding it.
8865540	8872540	We're actually talking about how we can get every single video game system we own hooked up at the same time on Switch boxes.
8872540	8876540	And if they will fit on those weird cube-shaped IKEA shelves.
8876540	8885540	So when our emailer asks about where are you going to be with gaming in 30 years, I mean, it's kind of like gaming is in your blood at this point.
8885540	8896540	Whereas maybe you may not have as much as the physical shit, like if life causes you to have to downsize things or whatever, that's one thing, but there's always going to be that part of you that has an appreciation for games, right?
8896540	8902540	I mean, that's kind of like what you and Dan sometimes bond over. I know Alan and I do.
8902540	8906540	Well, we were long-distance dating. We played World of Warcraft a lot.
8906540	8915540	Yeah, well, you know, when Dan and I first met each other online, our big bonding point was bad fanfiction.
8915540	8924540	And we had our mutual love of anime. It was right when anime started to go kind of mainstream.
8924540	8931540	And we would watch episodes of Ranma together on the VCR next to the computer.
8931540	8939540	And Dragon Ball Z fan subs were the big thing, especially the Hekto fan subs. You old-school people should know this.
8939540	8946540	But we also would talk about video games and whatnot. And when I moved out here, the first thing I unpacked was my Super Nintendo.
8946540	8951540	And Dan was like, I'm in love, at least as far as my translation of it went.
8951540	8958540	So, you know, that brought us together and we've been playing, we keep playing.
8958540	8963540	We haven't really gotten many of the new, new things, but we're probably still going to keep playing together.
8963540	8966540	At least our old games are still going to get some love.
8966540	8970540	I think it's pretty impressive how fast technology progresses.
8970540	8974540	So when you talk about gaming in 20 to 30 years, there's a few factors at play.
8974540	8979540	I mean, like, if you go back 20 years, you're what? The 1990s?
8979540	8982540	And I imagine most of our listeners are old enough where they remember the 1990s.
8982540	8986540	You may have been a child during the 1990s, but you probably have some memories of the 90s.
8986540	8990540	Such as when cell phones were the size of your face.
8990540	8995540	Or they were just car phones because they were on a big brick that was in your car.
8995540	9003540	And now cell phones are stronger than like 50 of the computers from 20 years ago in the palm of your hand.
9003540	9006540	I mean, that's how much technology has progressed in 20 years.
9006540	9008540	So in 20 more years, think about that.
9008540	9012540	You're going to have 20 times the power of the desktop computers in the palm of your hand.
9012540	9016540	You know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's going to, the technology is going to keep progressing so rapidly.
9016540	9019540	Like, who knows? And we always kind of joke here at OLR.
9019540	9022540	Gaming always gets one step closer to the holodeck.
9022540	9028540	But I kind of believe that. Like, I think there's a distinct possibility in 20 to 30 years.
9028540	9034540	I mean, it may not be the way we imagine it on like sci-fi TV and stuff on like Star Trek.
9034540	9038540	But I sort of think gaming is moving closer and closer to those sorts of experiences.
9038540	9040540	I mean, look at the Oculus Rift.
9040540	9043540	Look at a Luma Room and things like that.
9043540	9046540	I mean, think about how much that's going to progress in just like 20 years.
9046540	9051540	SSJ 100 Matt said, gaming 30 years from now, we'll still be waiting for Half-Life 3.
9051540	9055540	And then Fifth Dream says, I remember the 70s firsthand.
9055540	9059540	And all I had to say in response is this, I had an 8-track player.
9059540	9063540	I could repair said 8-track player when I was three years old.
9063540	9065540	So I could listen to my Muppets 8-track.
9065540	9069540	See, I was born in 78, so I can't really say that I remember the 70s.
9069540	9070540	But I sure remember the 80s.
9070540	9071540	Baby.
9071540	9072540	I sure remember the 80s.
9072540	9078540	Let's see, Bobby Blackwell says, there's more computing power in your iPhone than there was on the space shuttle.
9078540	9083540	So, so all that aside, I really do believe that gaming is getting one step closer to the holodeck.
9083540	9087540	Let me give you an example of that it might not be what you think it is today.
9087540	9095540	Speaking of remembering the 80s, big cartoon that they played a lot in the 80s, and they probably played a lot in the 60s and 70s, was the Jetsons.
9095540	9099540	And one of the big things in the Jetsons was video phone calls.
9099540	9101540	And remember, that was the wave of the future.
9101540	9104540	And I remember reading about that in computing magazines in the 1980s.
9104540	9105540	It was video phone calls.
9105540	9109540	Someday you're going to be able to call people and you're going to see what they look like.
9109540	9114540	You pick up your phone, you dial somebody, and you're going to see the video projected on the wall.
9114540	9116540	Well, we have that.
9116540	9119540	We have video calling in the palm of your hand.
9119540	9120540	And no one cares.
9120540	9121540	FaceTime.
9121540	9122540	Skype.
9122540	9127540	Well, some, we find, it's interesting.
9127540	9132540	Now that it's there, it's not as commonplace as maybe we thought it was on the Jetsons.
9132540	9133540	Computers on your wrist.
9133540	9134540	Yeah.
9134540	9136540	It's, it's, right?
9136540	9141540	Like, I find that people, instead of doing voice or video calls, what do they want to do?
9141540	9143540	They want a text message.
9143540	9145540	That ended up being, like, I don't, I don't need to be seen right now.
9145540	9146540	I'll just text message.
9146540	9148540	That seems to be the thing that most people opt for.
9148540	9152540	However, look, you can't deny that FaceTime and Skype and all that stuff has its uses.
9152540	9156540	Such as showing off a baby to a relative on the other coast.
9156540	9165540	Or a deaf person being able to communicate, you know, more with, with folks over telephone technology.
9165540	9167540	And so on, you know?
9167540	9172540	Well, we even, now, again, I really don't talk about where I work.
9172540	9181540	But, I mean, we have it incorporated now with the technology where there are voice and guided recognition for the blind to use the devices.
9181540	9182540	Yeah.
9182540	9183540	You know?
9183540	9191540	And then, conversely, we, there's also increased image improvement, you know, contrast change.
9191540	9195540	Different ways to make it easier for people who have poor vision or might be losing their vision.
9195540	9198540	So, it's got graduated steps.
9198540	9204540	And I think that we're going to see a lot more games come out down the line that are going to be more accessible for other people.
9204540	9205540	Yeah.
9205540	9209540	YYR in chat says smartphones really have changed everything.
9209540	9213540	OLR didn't mention a new big game launch this week, Candy Crush Soda Saga.
9213540	9214540	Who cares?
9214540	9216540	Well, there's a good reason for that, YYR.
9216540	9217540	But I know you understand.
9217540	9218540	Let's see.
9218540	9220540	So, that's, yeah, wow.
9220540	9221540	It's so, so interesting.
9221540	9228540	Tigerclass says, do you think people will look back and remember the zeros or the nots or, you know, the first decade of the 2000s?
9228540	9229540	Absolutely.
9229540	9230540	20 years.
9230540	9232540	What has to happen when the teenagers turn 30?
9232540	9235540	That's when, that's why 90s retro stuff is so big right now.
9235540	9237540	The Backstreet Boys are on tour.
9237540	9239540	The Spice Girls are on a reunion tour.
9239540	9242540	Because the 90s are hilarious again.
9242540	9244540	And that will happen in the next decade.
9244540	9247540	The first decade of the 21st century will be hilarious again.
9247540	9249540	So, yes, it will absolutely come back.
9249540	9250540	They always come in 20-year cycles.
9250540	9251540	Always.
9251540	9252540	It's like the boomerang.
9252540	9253540	Mm-hmm.
9253540	9256540	Anyway, there's so much more we could say on this.
9256540	9257540	In the interest of time, I'm gonna move on.
9257540	9265540	But just the idea that our, the people that are grandparents today didn't necessarily grow up on games.
9265540	9266540	Maybe some did.
9266540	9269540	Maybe some, I mean, you're seeing it more and more the way we did.
9269540	9278540	So, I think when we're older, I think you're gonna see that there is gaming that is catered to a senior generation that grew up with it.
9278540	9283540	When I'm 60, 70 years old, you bet your ass I'm gonna want to be catered to.
9283540	9285540	We'll have our new version of Pixel Shits.
9285540	9288540	It'll be called the Geritol Edition.
9288540	9291540	That'll be called the Don't Shit while you're playing.
9291540	9296540	That'll be called the Pixel Shits, you know, sponsored by Depends.
9296540	9298540	So, we have one more email.
9298540	9300540	And it's from Warrior Bob.
9300540	9301540	Hi, Warrior Bob. I miss you.
9301540	9306540	It is actually, it's called Haiku Fan Mail for episode 575.
9307540	9310540	Oh, my God. How did we miss that?
9310540	9313540	That it's, this is the Haiku episode 575.
9313540	9316540	Warrior Bob, this is another thing we do a lot carefully.
9316540	9319540	We do the Dream Games carefully and these are very carefully selected as well.
9319540	9326540	Warrior Bob Gold Star email for that alone for reminding us that this is a Haiku episode of OLR.
9326540	9327540	Thank you, Warrior Bob.
9327540	9330540	And I would love if you would go back and repost this on our forums because that would be awesome.
9330540	9332540	Or someone should.
9332540	9335540	Alright, so, aw, thank you. I miss you.
9335540	9338540	Well, I mean, I would have said that, but thank you for missing me, too.
9338540	9340540	Anyway, congratulations.
9340540	9343540	575, that is quite a lot.
9343540	9346540	In honor of that, I thought I'd send an email written in Haiku.
9346540	9350540	Oh, well, I guess since there aren't any nature words, it's a Senryu.
9350540	9354540	Hold on a second. Fuck, not how many syllables are in a Senryu.
9354540	9357540	Moving on, that is a shitload of shows.
9357540	9362540	For some perspective, when you first started, arcades still existed, but the iPhone did not.
9362540	9366540	Some video games are marketed to children younger than this show.
9366540	9369540	Why do you do that?
9369540	9373540	The episode list on the OLR Wiki is like 10 feet long.
9373540	9378540	500 more shows, you'll have more shows than miles walked by the Proclaimers.
9378540	9382540	Pretty freaking good for a show named after the Mobomoga guy.
9382540	9384540	Anyway, you rock, thanks, and keep up the great work.
9384540	9386540	Reject false icons, Warrior Bob.
9386540	9388540	That was an amazing email, thank you.
9388540	9390540	You're my hero now.
9390540	9391540	I know, that was so cool.
9391540	9394540	You get, like, a double gold star. You get the double plus good gold star.
9394540	9399540	I can't believe that I could have done a Fugu question of the week around the Haiku thing.
9399540	9401540	You know I love me some Haikus. Oh, man.
9401540	9404540	Haiku singular and plural. Watch your grammar.
9404540	9407540	You who read the Japanese games of the week.
9407540	9408540	Oh, shush.
9409540	9413540	Some important follow-up notes here from the chat, by the way.
9413540	9417540	Some things that, you know, we had screwed up a minute ago.
9417540	9422540	Okay, some folks pointing out the Earthbound convention being in Tucson, Arizona.
9422540	9424540	There's a joke there.
9424540	9428540	Tucson was one of the towns in Earthbound.
9428540	9432540	So they are having the convention in Tucson.
9432540	9435540	To which I say, well played.
9435540	9437540	I see what you did there.
9437540	9440540	I can't believe I didn't think of that. I give that credit to Fifth Dream for that.
9440540	9443540	SSJ100 Matt said the N-Gage existed when the show started.
9443540	9444540	Oh, God.
9444540	9446540	And you know what? We had two.
9446540	9448540	Now they're gone.
9448540	9450540	The N-Gage was just coming out, I think.
9450540	9452540	It was the taco phone.
9452540	9455540	I remember going to the E3. They had, like, Civilization on the N-Gage and I was crying.
9455540	9460540	Why would you buy a phone that you can play games on? That's ridiculous.
9461540	9466540	I remember going to that E3 and busting out my N-Gage.
9466540	9472540	And the guy running the poor chirpy, you know, and I mean chirpy as in crickets chirping,
9472540	9477540	no one over there N-Gage area said, oh my God, someone has one.
9477540	9482540	And then they sold it after E3.
9482540	9484540	So, yeah.
9484540	9489540	Fifth Dream says talking in Haiku is pretty easy to do. I make it rhyme, too.
9490540	9495540	YYR says real sweet episode. Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. What is a Haiku?
9495540	9498540	All right. All right. That's going to do it for e-mails.
9498540	9503540	I got to play this because Bobby had sent this to me saying the link is pod safe.
9503540	9507540	It's the AT&T ads from the 90s that predicted everything.
9507540	9511540	So going back to the e-mail before a little bit, check this out.
9514540	9518540	Have you ever borrowed a book from thousands of miles away?
9520540	9522540	Across the country.
9524540	9527540	Without stopping for directions.
9529540	9532540	Or sent someone a fax.
9534540	9536540	From the beach?
9536540	9538540	You will.
9538540	9541540	And the company that will bring it to you, AT&T.
9542540	9545540	And there's like seven of these all together. I'm not going to play them all.
9545540	9548540	But that commercial, by the way, from 1993.
9549540	9554540	And you're looking at that stuff going, wow, that's just GPS they just showed there.
9554540	9557540	And that wasn't a thing that we had in 93, but we do now.
9557540	9560540	The borrowing the book from a thousand miles away.
9560540	9563540	I mean e-books is certainly a thing.
9563540	9565540	Technically you can borrow from libraries.
9565540	9569540	Oh, and the Prime. The Amazon Prime has that whole loaning the books out.
9569540	9572540	And Google Book has a lot of the old public domain books in there, right?
9572540	9574540	So you can kind of do that.
9574540	9576540	And then doing the fax from the beach.
9576540	9581540	It could be a fax per se, but you kind of have something that nobody faxes anymore.
9581540	9583540	No, you'd be surprised.
9583540	9584540	It's a PDF.
9584540	9586540	Doctor's office says fax a lot.
9586540	9589540	There's tons of people that still fax. I don't know why.
9589540	9591540	But there's an app for that.
9591540	9596540	So yes, you can do it from your iPad while sitting on the beach with Wi-Fi. That's amazing.
9596540	9599540	And I guess AT&T did some of it.
9601540	9603540	That's, wow.
9603540	9606540	So look at the commercials today predicting the future.
9606540	9609540	Because that's where we'll be in 20 years, but maybe a little differently.
9609540	9611540	Maybe a little differently.
9611540	9613540	Or it may not have the reception you think it was. Like the video calling.
9613540	9615540	That was supposed to be the norm.
9615540	9618540	You video call everybody, but that's not really the way it works.
9618540	9620540	Anyway, good stuff.
9620540	9622540	Thank you for the e-mail bag.
9622540	9626540	If you want to send us a mail for a later week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
9626540	9631540	It's time to get angry with the segment we do every week here called the FUs of the Week.
9631540	9633540	And in 30 years, there will still be angst.
9661540	9668540	The house is in really great condition, but the previous tenants had this thing for sticking sticky hooks on the wall.
9668540	9671540	And I mean, they're fucking everywhere.
9671540	9674540	I found sticky hooks where I didn't think sticky hooks should go.
9674540	9678540	They're just everywhere. I can't.
9678540	9682540	And the sticky hooks are stuck and they pulled the paint with them.
9682540	9686540	And I hate them. I hate them, Rob. I hate them.
9686540	9689540	So you'll fix it. Don't worry. Fix it, Jamie. You'll fix it.
9689540	9691540	Or fix it, Dan.
9691540	9692540	Sticky hooks.
9692540	9694540	FU sticky hooks.
9694540	9696540	Uh, Loki.
9696540	9701540	Uh, it's FU that, you know, gets into it.
9701540	9703540	Aw, sorry to hear that. I hope they feel better.
9703540	9706540	All right, now reminding Jonas that it is almost midnight on the East Coast.
9706540	9708540	Your FUs of the Week, sir.
9708540	9712540	FUs to bad drivers for causing me traffic from going,
9712540	9715540	just going to pull something downtown, it should only take me like 20 minutes,
9715540	9717540	because there's three accidents.
9717540	9719540	It took me an hour and 30 minutes to get to my destination,
9719540	9722540	so fuck you bad drivers for causing a lot of this ruckus.
9722540	9728540	Fuck you to Carl's Jr. for taking 40 minutes just to get a meal done.
9728540	9730540	40 minutes for a frickin' meal?
9730540	9731540	Yeah.
9731540	9733540	Oh no. Hell no.
9733540	9737540	Well, I'll keep my FUs short, so I'll just leave it at that for now.
9737540	9741540	All right. I don't really have a serious FU of the Week,
9741540	9743540	so I'll just give a tongue-in-cheek FU this week.
9743540	9746540	I'm gonna say an FU to the Resistance, an Ingress,
9746540	9749540	because, yeah, yeah, if you're a Smurf, I'm talking to you.
9749540	9750540	You know it.
9750540	9753540	Because we had all these beautiful enlightened fields.
9753540	9756540	This level 14 player was in our neighborhood, and we helped.
9756540	9759540	I gave him some gear, and he set up all these beautiful fields
9759540	9762540	in the neighborhood of enlightenment everywhere.
9762540	9765540	And, you know, one of these Smurfs came by today and knocked it all down,
9765540	9769540	so FU. FU to how addicting that game is, that's Ingress on the iPhone.
9769540	9772540	I'm having a lot of fun playing it, and it gets me out and about.
9772540	9774540	So I say that very tongue-in-cheek.
9774540	9777540	I know there's some of you that play Resistance out there that listen,
9777540	9781540	but a fish shake in your direction.
9781540	9784540	All right. Let's move on with a few more stories for you guys,
9784540	9785540	and then we'll get to the calls.
9785540	9788540	So 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype,
9788540	9789540	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
9789540	9790540	Loki.
9790540	9791540	All right.
9791540	9794540	So there's some more updates regarding Tales from the Borderlands,
9794540	9798540	which is Telltale Games' take on the Borderlands series,
9798540	9803540	and apparently they give a little context to what the game's gonna be about.
9803540	9807540	I guess it revolves around two characters, Rise,
9807540	9810540	which is kind of this, like, Handsome Jack wannabe.
9810540	9814540	Kind of looks like Handsome Jack, but obviously it's not Handsome Jack.
9814540	9818540	And Fiona, who's some sort of con artist.
9818540	9821540	And looks like it takes place after Borderlands 2,
9821540	9824540	so it's not gonna be kind of a prequel-type thing.
9824540	9827540	It looks pretty cool, just based off of, you know, what they were showing.
9827540	9830540	I guess Zero Sum's gonna be the first episode,
9830540	9834540	and I'm not seeing when that's supposed to be slated.
9834540	9839540	I guess maybe before the end of this, before the year's up.
9839540	9843540	They're saying $20 for the season, $5 per episode's gonna be on PlayStation 3,
9843540	9848540	PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC and Mac.
9848540	9850540	I guess PC and Mac's gonna be a little bit more expensive,
9850540	9854540	$25 for the season.
9854540	9855540	Oh, looks cool.
9855540	9857540	Nolan North and Troy Baker in there.
9857540	9859540	So I'm down.
9859540	9862540	Nice. Very cool.
9862540	9868540	All right, and one more story I have for you guys on a good charity drive,
9868540	9871540	and this is one, like, if you've been on the internet in the past couple years
9871540	9873540	in gaming culture, you've probably heard of this one.
9873540	9876540	Desert Bus for Hope. That's right.
9876540	9879540	You can visit their site, desertbus.org, and if you weren't aware,
9879540	9884540	the eighth Desert Bus for Hope charity drive is underway right now.
9884540	9887540	And the folks at Loading Ready Run, they actually sit down
9887540	9890540	and they play Desert Bus for a long time.
9890540	9893540	And if you've never heard of Desert Bus, this is an infamous game.
9893540	9899540	It was from a Penn & Teller collection that was on the CDI? Question mark?
9899540	9900540	It was Sega CD.
9900540	9902540	Was Sega CD? Oh, shit.
9902540	9904540	But it was one of those CD platforms.
9904540	9910540	And Desert Bus, what you did, you drive a bus from Las Vegas to Tucson.
9910540	9912540	They're going to the Earthbound Convention.
9912540	9915540	You're driving a bus from Las Vegas to Tucson in real time.
9915540	9919540	So it's an eight-hour drive, and you drive the whole drive,
9919540	9922540	and you get one point if you correctly do it.
9922540	9925540	That's it. It's just a long stretch of desert road, and that's it.
9925540	9927540	Of course, the bus kind of veers slightly to the right.
9927540	9929540	Yeah, so you have to correct every once in a while,
9929540	9933540	or you'll drive off the road and kill everybody on the bus in a big fire, I guess.
9933540	9934540	So there you go.
9934540	9938540	Well, no, if I remember correctly, if you crash, you have to wait for a tow truck,
9938540	9940540	and then you wait to get towed back.
9941540	9945540	So it's even worse if you crash.
9945540	9947540	Don't crash.
9947540	9950540	So if you want to check out people playing the game and see if they're going to crash or not,
9950540	9953540	and donate money to a good cause, the Child's Play charity,
9953540	9956540	you can check that out again, desertbus.org.
9956540	9959540	That's pretty cool. Good luck to those guys that are suffering through that game.
9959540	9960540	But you know what?
9960540	9962540	With all the shenanigans that go on with that
9962540	9964540	and all the people on the Internet that are having fun with it,
9964540	9966540	is there really that much torture?
9966540	9968540	No, that's how they can do it every year.
9968540	9970540	So good times, good times.
9970540	9973540	Congrats to all you guys doing a good thing there.
9973540	9976540	All right, that does it for the news right now.
9976540	9978540	We are going to open up Skype line.
9978540	9980540	It is time, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9980540	9983540	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
9983540	9984540	if you want to give us a call.
9984540	9986540	I'm only going to keep this open for a little bit
9986540	9988540	since we are already to midnight on the East Coast.
9988540	9990540	So if you want to get in, get in soon.
9990540	9995540	Meanwhile, I believe we're going to say bye to DarkSakura,
9995540	9996540	is about to go on her way out the door.
9996540	9998540	She has to leave a little early tonight
9998540	10000540	because you're house sitting on top of everything else
10000540	10001540	that you're doing right now, right?
10001540	10002540	I am.
10002540	10005540	My friends George and Amanda went to the Disney half marathon,
10005540	10008540	the Avengers half marathon thing.
10008540	10011540	And so I said I would cat sit
10011540	10014540	and so I get to go take care of Coconut and Nestle.
10014540	10015540	Fun.
10015540	10016540	It's the kitty's names.
10016540	10017540	Those are cute names.
10017540	10018540	All right, so have fun.
10018540	10020540	And DarkSakura, before we let you go,
10020540	10023540	your final thought for tonight to leave our listeners with?
10024540	10025540	That's it.
10025540	10026540	A deep sigh.
10026540	10027540	A deep sigh for all of you.
10027540	10028540	Again, if you want to give us a call,
10028540	10031540	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype,
10031540	10032540	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10032540	10033540	You know, I'm looking at the Twitter,
10033540	10035540	twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10035540	10036540	I might need to scroll back a little more.
10036540	10040540	But I am seeing some retweets and some love for PixelShits.
10040540	10043540	And I'm seeing screenshots are hitting the internet.
10043540	10046540	I'm almost thinking I need to do a Let's Play a little later.
10046540	10049540	Do some streaming on Twitch TV.
10049540	10052540	Make this hashtag go.
10052540	10053540	What, PixelShits?
10053540	10054540	Hashtag PixelShit.
10054540	10055540	Hashtag PixelShit.
10055540	10056540	We did it for President Cat.
10056540	10058540	We can do it for PixelShit.
10058540	10060540	Except we actually got PixelShits.
10060540	10061540	Anyway.
10061540	10063540	PixelShits tournament.
10063540	10064540	There's still time.
10064540	10066540	We can do President Cat.
10066540	10069540	If Joystick doesn't run an article on PixelShits tomorrow,
10069540	10071540	we're doing something wrong, people.
10071540	10072540	We're doing something wrong.
10072540	10073540	All right.
10073540	10075540	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype,
10075540	10077540	Orange Lounge Radio.
10077540	10080540	Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories
10080540	10083540	while I look at the Twitter feed for stuff before the PixelShits.
10083540	10088540	I'm kind of distracted because there's still people streaming footage.
10088540	10091540	Well, I'm not actually streaming it, but look at the screenshots.
10091540	10094540	Footage from the next-gen version of, or I'm sorry,
10094540	10098540	current-gen version of Grand Theft Auto V.
10098540	10100540	Oh, it looks so nice.
10100540	10104540	And apparently, they even had, I don't know,
10104540	10106540	the first-person stuff's pretty crazy.
10106540	10108540	Now, this is kind of funny.
10109540	10113540	Say you want to take your PlayStation TV and make it portable.
10113540	10117540	Well, they have a thing that you can plug it into to do that.
10117540	10119540	It's called the Decavita 7.
10119540	10123540	It's a seven-inch screen that you can plug the Vita TV into the back of it
10123540	10128540	and make an even bigger PlayStation Vita, and it makes it handheld.
10128540	10132540	I actually want one of these, but not for that reason.
10132540	10133540	Why?
10133540	10136540	Because remember, I was trying to make a second-screen portable system
10136540	10139540	to work with any sort of game system,
10139540	10141540	and so guess what I could do with this?
10141540	10143540	Because it has an HDMI in.
10143540	10146540	It has power coming out of it.
10146540	10151540	I can make my system and just run it through a Cronus Max
10151540	10156540	to map the controls over to the Bluetooth from a PlayStation 3 controller,
10156540	10158540	and away I go.
10158540	10162540	I've got a system that works second-screen for Xbox 360,
10162540	10164540	Xbox One, whatever I want.
10164540	10166540	So I'm going to pick one of those up.
10166540	10168540	Maybe it's $200, though, if you're interested.
10168540	10170540	It's coming out next year.
10170540	10172540	So it looks kind of cool.
10172540	10174540	All right, I'm going to put a last call for calls.
10174540	10176540	If you want to participate, talk about anything we've talked about tonight
10176540	10179540	or bring up something maybe we didn't discuss,
10179540	10181540	at least we have YYR on earlier in the show.
10181540	10183540	We got to talk to somebody on Skype tonight.
10183540	10186540	I have nothing else, but we'll give one more chance for those calls.
10186540	10187540	Loki?
10187540	10191540	And then the other thing is say you want to pick up those Amiibos and stuff,
10191540	10194540	if you're not sure, you know, if you want to drop all the money.
10194540	10197540	Apparently Nintendo has teamed up with Loot Crate to offer
10197540	10203540	some sort of Loot Crate edition that's going to feature Amiibo figures.
10203540	10205540	It's still like 100 bucks or something.
10205540	10206540	It's ridiculous.
10206540	10208540	It's not that great a deal.
10208540	10210540	More expensive than buying them separate, I don't know.
10210540	10211540	Yeah, right.
10211540	10213540	All right, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
10213540	10215540	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10215540	10216540	Hey, this is Azor Man.
10216540	10218540	I'm sorry, say that again.
10218540	10219540	Azor Man.
10219540	10220540	Azor Man, what's up?
10220540	10226540	Yeah, I was listening to the show earlier about the Pixel Shits.
10226540	10228540	Yes, that is the game.
10228540	10231540	Yeah, what do you want to say about Pixel Shits?
10231540	10238540	I was just wondering if, like, is Loki now inspired to do any type of, like, you know,
10238540	10244540	Pixel Shit X game for, like, Orange Launch Radio?
10244540	10250540	Loki, have you been inspired by Pixel Shits for your own creations that you're creating?
10250540	10255540	No, but it does remind me that, like, you know, a lot of really great games are simple,
10255540	10258540	and, you know, kind of what I'm doing right now is really complicated.
10258540	10262540	In fact, I, like, earlier this week, I had, you know, I'd gotten to the,
10262540	10265540	I'd been working on my editor to make stuff,
10265540	10270540	and I'd gotten it finished to the point where all my brushes were sort of working,
10270540	10277540	and I was messing around with it, but then I realized that it's not as optimized as I want it to be,
10277540	10281540	and I got really frustrated and kind of just kind of said, you know,
10281540	10283540	Fuck, am I going to have to start over again?
10283540	10288540	You know, and so I kind of contemplated that, and I may start over again on it.
10288540	10294540	I just need to tweak a few things and do some stuff that I didn't want to have to do,
10294540	10297540	but now I'm going to do, I guess, if that makes sense.
10297540	10300540	But, yeah, something like this would be fun where, you know, yeah,
10300540	10305540	you could take a concept like this and make it really fast, and it's still fun,
10305540	10309540	and that's, you kind of, you know, with all the games that come out nowadays,
10309540	10312540	with all the features and stuff, and you kind of forget that, hey, you know,
10312540	10317540	the stuff that you used to enjoy was actually really simple, so I don't know.
10317540	10319540	That's a, you know what, that's an awesome lesson,
10319540	10324540	and I think if I was YYR, I'd be very happy to know that, you know,
10324540	10329540	you kind of remind people of that, is that sometimes the silly, simple ideas
10329540	10330540	are really, truly all the best.
10330540	10333540	Look at Flappy Bird, perfect example, Flappy Bird. Extremely simple game.
10333540	10334540	Yeah.
10334540	10336540	And that's, you know, you could have had something like that easily,
10336540	10338540	like on an Atari or something like that.
10338540	10341540	Even Minecraft, I mean, not to say Minecraft is simple,
10341540	10344540	because there's definitely a very complex layer underneath it,
10344540	10348540	but the concept is really basic.
10348540	10351540	You know, it's moving cubes in a 3D space, essentially.
10351540	10353540	Yeah, there's other things you do with it, rail cars and stuff too,
10353540	10356540	but Minecraft's kind of a stupidly simple game too.
10356540	10360540	Yeah, I was looking at that as well, and then like,
10360540	10367540	it just seems that maybe something simple like that would come out,
10367540	10369540	you know, with some lokis, like, you know,
10369540	10372540	like it's clanking around, making these new games,
10372540	10374540	because I remember you were starting with this like last year, right?
10374540	10378540	I started trying to learn how to program last year.
10378540	10380540	Right, I remember the whole process.
10380540	10383540	I was just wondering if that soon comes out,
10383540	10385540	because now this guy, Aaron, came out with this game,
10385540	10386540	it would just be cool.
10386540	10388540	Maybe, I don't know,
10388540	10391540	Orange Lawn's radio game should maybe come out soon, don't you think?
10391540	10396540	You know, I've toyed with an idea like that before,
10396540	10399540	but that was back when I was thinking of RPG Maker and stuff,
10399540	10402540	but our caller here is a manager in training, look at that.
10402540	10404540	Don't you think you're going to do this?
10404540	10405540	I listen to you guys a lot,
10405540	10407540	and like I don't really speak too much of the chat,
10407540	10408540	but like it's been over a decade.
10408540	10410540	It's like hearing you guys talk about this,
10410540	10411540	like hearing him talk about it last year,
10411540	10414540	and then like now there's like absolutely something he's creating.
10414540	10417540	I'm just like eager to like see something of it.
10417540	10419540	Yeah, and I'm eager to have something to show.
10419540	10422540	You're slower than Duke Nukem Forever is what the caller's trying to say.
10422540	10425540	Well, the problem is it's hard just making the engine,
10425540	10426540	because it's from scratch,
10426540	10429540	and unfortunately, see, I was trying to keep it away
10429540	10432540	from like being like a straight up voxel engine,
10432540	10434540	because, you know, all the voxel engines out there they have,
10434540	10436540	you know, you have your voxels, you have your chunks,
10436540	10439540	and, you know, that's how you load data and stuff,
10439540	10443540	and, you know, with Unity, the problem I ran into was
10443540	10445540	I could put all these blocks down,
10445540	10448540	but when I had my thing checking for, you know,
10448540	10450540	what neighbors were next to, you know,
10450540	10452540	so if I have a cube next to a cube,
10452540	10455540	I don't draw the sides that are, you know, hidden,
10455540	10456540	basically, in the geometry,
10456540	10459540	but those checks were taking so long,
10459540	10462540	once I got a lot of, you know, blocks on the screen,
10462540	10463540	you know, I'd put one down,
10463540	10466540	and I'd wait a few seconds before it unlocked again,
10466540	10468540	and that's the problem,
10468540	10470540	is I have to find a more efficient way to do that,
10470540	10474540	and so, unfortunately, I'm probably going to have to create
10474540	10477540	some sort of chunk system in order to get that to work,
10477540	10479540	so that it's not, you know, looking for something.
10479540	10481540	I apologize if you may have a blog or anything,
10481540	10483540	like your troubles?
10483540	10485540	No, this is his blog.
10485540	10487540	Yeah, that's the other thing, too.
10487540	10488540	I need to create a dev blog,
10488540	10490540	because I have a website now,
10490540	10493540	but I haven't done any of that.
10493540	10497540	The Loki game is going to end up like Titan.
10497540	10499540	He's going to work on it for seven years,
10499540	10501540	and then throw it all out and be like,
10501540	10503540	ah, I should have just made Team Fortress 2.
10503540	10506540	No, no, no.
10506540	10508540	All right, going to the chat,
10508540	10510540	because you know the chat room is having a field day with this,
10510540	10511540	Bobby Blackwolf saying,
10511540	10513540	Loki game is vaporware.
10513540	10515540	AkumaJP, Loki forever.
10515540	10517540	Act F to Loki ghost.
10518540	10520540	I have stuff.
10520540	10523540	I put, I posted images from the editor the other,
10523540	10525540	it was like last week.
10525540	10526540	We're eagerly awaiting it.
10526540	10529540	Maybe YYR can do some consulting with you for a small fee.
10533540	10534540	It's just figuring it out.
10534540	10536540	But I learned, see that's the thing though,
10536540	10537540	is I learned based on, you know,
10537540	10539540	you do it wrong and you learn the right way to do it.
10539540	10540540	That's right.
10540540	10542540	Chatters, let's start taking bets.
10542540	10543540	What will we see first?
10543540	10545540	Loki's game or Half-Life 3?
10545540	10546540	What will we see first?
10547540	10548540	That's so wrong.
10548540	10549540	All right.
10549540	10550540	Thank you so much for the call.
10550540	10553540	Anytime we can razz Loki out of a call, I appreciate it.
10553540	10554540	And I really appreciate the support.
10554540	10556540	A decade of listening to the show.
10556540	10557540	That's amazing.
10557540	10558540	You rock.
10558540	10559540	Good.
10559540	10560540	Thank you a lot.
10560540	10561540	All right.
10561540	10562540	Take care, my friend.
10563540	10564540	All righty.
10564540	10566540	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10566540	10567540	Or use your name on Skype.
10567540	10568540	Orange Lounge Radio.
10568540	10569540	If you'd like to give us a call,
10569540	10571540	I'll leave it open for just a little bit.
10571540	10573540	Did you have any other last minute stories here?
10573540	10575540	I forgot that this is actually a VCD.
10575540	10576540	This isn't even a DVD.
10576540	10578540	Oh, the thing that you loaned Jamie that she brought back?
10578540	10579540	She could have kept it.
10579540	10580540	I don't even want it anymore.
10580540	10581540	Tell Liz it.
10581540	10582540	What is this?
10582540	10583540	She found some-
10583540	10584540	I don't remember what it was.
10584540	10585540	Para Para Para.
10585540	10586540	Excuse me.
10586540	10587540	Para Para Dance.
10587540	10592540	It's a VCD, which means the resolution on it's gonna be shitty.
10592540	10593540	That's like 300 by 200.
10593540	10594540	What is it?
10594540	10595540	It's just like concert.
10595540	10597540	VCDs are like disc versions of VHS.
10597540	10598540	They're crap.
10598540	10602540	No, it was, if I remember correctly, I don't remember what it's about.
10602540	10603540	To be honest, it was-
10603540	10604540	Well, let's be real.
10604540	10605540	The plot probably wasn't important.
10606540	10609540	No, it's about obviously Para Para.
10609540	10614540	I just don't remember why I bought it, because obviously I thought it was funny for a reason.
10614540	10617540	You know, that's why I bought it, but I don't know.
10617540	10624540	Alright, well, it looks like the phones aren't lighting up, so I'm gonna go ahead and close down the phones so we can wrap up the show for the night.
10624540	10626540	Jonas, thanks for joining us.
10626540	10631540	Sorry we didn't get to talk to you more tonight, but you know, when an OLR dream game gets released, it's gonna-
10631540	10634540	But I'm glad you could be here for the unveiling of Pixel Shits.
10635540	10637540	That's gonna be a holy shit moment.
10637540	10644540	Tell us a little more once again, what can we expect T-Bagger, the big anime game room to be up to, and what cons are you going to next?
10644540	10649540	We're actually gonna be starting to do some streaming at random days now, so-
10649540	10650540	Nice.
10650540	10656540	Because we had a streaming on Friday for doing just random games, to show that we just play other games outside of the common games.
10656540	10663540	Because there's a bunch of games out there, but we're not gonna just keep playing the same ten games over and over and over.
10664540	10666540	That's good, to show a little bit of variety.
10666540	10670540	I mean, hey, we could probably do a Pixel Sh- a Pixel Shit stream.
10671540	10678540	I'm telling you, I want everybody within the sound of my voice to do a Twitch TV stream for Pixel Shits this week.
10678540	10679540	I'll take fifteen minutes.
10679540	10687540	You know, even though I don't really follow it too much anymore, can we get like, you know, maybe Pixel Shits and Omega-Thon or something like that?
10688540	10690540	That would be awesome.
10690540	10691540	Awesome.
10691540	10695540	But yeah, that's just something new we're adding to the plate and stuff.
10695540	10698540	Alright. Where can folks find your Twitch channel if they want to check that out?
10698540	10703540	Oh, twitch.tv slash TBAGR underscore TV.
10703540	10711540	Okay, TBAGR underscore TV. Awesome. I'll make sure I friend you on Twitch, because I'm not sure you're my friend yet. Or follower, whatever it's called.
10711540	10719540	And also, because YouTube can do 60 frames a second videos nowadays, we're playing on doing videos that are gonna be 60 frames a second at 1080p.
10719540	10720540	Nice.
10720540	10724540	Starting, actually, we're starting right now with the Pump It Up videos.
10724540	10725540	Nice.
10725540	10727540	Which I still need to finish.
10727540	10736540	Alright. Congrats once again on your amazing show. I mean, second place in the US for Pump It Up's freestyle. That blows my mind.
10736540	10742540	You're like one of those Starcraft all-stars that I saw at Blizzard last week, except you play with your feet.
10742540	10744540	You dance. You're a dancer.
10744540	10747540	Alright, too bad it's a radio show and we can't make you show everybody your moves.
10747540	10749540	No problem.
10749540	10751540	The videos will be on YouTube.
10751540	10752540	Alright, sounds good.
10752540	10753540	Hopefully this week.
10753540	10757540	Sounds good. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
10757540	10759540	Oh, it's good to be back again.
10759540	10760540	It's good to have you.
10760540	10766540	And finally not actually have too much on my mind, just a competition. I was like, okay, I can go back playing video games again.
10766540	10774540	You can just take it easy. That's right. You know what? A lot of the big stuff I had going on in my life has finally calmed down.
10774540	10779540	And so, yeah, I'm starting to get weekends where I'm like, alright, I get to play video games.
10779540	10785540	And with Thanksgiving coming up, that's going to be a huge catch-up weekend for me. I'm so excited. You don't even know.
10785540	10789540	That'll be the weekend that finally I get suckered into going back to, wow, just wait for it.
10789540	10794540	Alright, let's see. I want to thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
10794540	10800540	Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you like the show, always say tell a friend or two or five about the show.
10800540	10802540	Help spread the word because that's all we got.
10802540	10809540	We didn't have some huge website back in us. I don't have the money to throw to rent a hall in Vegas and try to find some sponsors.
10809540	10813540	I'd love it if we did, but we don't. We really rely on your word of mouth. That's all we ask.
10813540	10819540	So thank you guys. Let's get the last final thoughts here. Loki, your final thought tonight?
10819540	10825540	A couple of things. First off, Grand Theft Auto looks awesome. Second thing, apparently Far Cry 4,
10825540	10834540	you may not see the PC reviews soon because they have not given codes to anybody that's reviewing the game
10834540	10839540	because there's going to be a day one patch and it won't be up until Monday.
10839540	10843540	And so same thing happened with Unity.
10843540	10844540	Interesting.
10844540	10846540	Just giving you a warning. Although on console, though, apparently really good.
10846540	10850540	So hopefully that's still the case on PC, but buyer beware.
10850540	10857540	Interesting. All right. And my final thought is, you know, I just every week, I'm so humbled by the support you guys give us.
10857540	10862540	I mean, from the fan games created by something someone said off the cusp
10862540	10867540	to the fact that some of you have literally grown up with the show listening for over a decade.
10867540	10870540	I'm just I'm so humbled. And thank you guys so much.
10870540	10877540	And, you know, to kind of build on that email we got earlier, you know, gaming and the culture and everything,
10877540	10884540	even when there's stuff that pisses us off. And this year there's been a lot of stuff that got really heated.
10884540	10888540	Let's put it that way. Even when a lot of that stuff is going on, you know, at the end of the day,
10888540	10890540	this gaming culture and everything, this is this is stuff that's in my blood.
10890540	10898540	And I'm so happy and fortunate to have this place to lend my voice every week.
10898540	10903540	And the fact that even one of you listens and gives a shit means so much.
10903540	10905540	So, you know, we're going to keep doing it.
10905540	10913540	The idea that I'm going to have five more podcasts in 50 years, probably not too far from the truth.
10913540	10917540	So that's it. Have a great week, everybody. Thank you so much.
10917540	10923540	And we will see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
10923540	10927540	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
