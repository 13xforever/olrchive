Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
Tonight, November 9th, 2014, we're fresh back from BlizzCon and ready to talk about their first big new IP in over a decade. Also, games start to disappear, including one EA MOBA and Ubisoft games from Steam. We didn't disappear, and we'll talk about all this next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November 9th, 2014, with the 574th episode of our program.

00:45.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and yep, I made it back. We're good to go. If you've been following the show recently, I literally just got off a plane an hour and a half ago, and here we are doing the show with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
We drifted a few times and took some curves, and I had to cut off some guy.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.000
Jamie actually gave me a ride from the airport. Thank you so much. Deeply appreciated. But as the kickoff song tonight for OLR, I played an old Bamani favorite that seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway.

01:22.000 --> 01:32.000
If any of you have ever played Initial D or anything like that, it's all Eurobeat music, so it seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway, except her music in the car is Let's Have a Kiki.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
Actually, right when you got in the car, it was an Apollo Throwdown, and then it was Let's Have a Kiki, and eventually ended into a remix of Calista.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
It was a very Jamie ride, Mass Effect remixes and so forth. And then it ended.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Although that version was from a racing game. It was from Midnight Club, I think.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And then it ended with a burrito.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
With a burrito. Tacos for you, tacos. Rolled tacos.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Tacitos, a little snack told me over till the real dinner.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Rob put something long and cylindrical in his mouth.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hey, hey. Watch it.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Alright, also joining us in the studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hello.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Doing okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So I heard your PlayStation 4 is already back.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Yes. That was surprisingly fast.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
But it's not your PlayStation 4.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
No, it's just a reverb, but whatever. It's mine now.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
You see this? It's mine now. So they sent you a better one, basically.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, it was less scratched.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Nice.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And didn't have a weird smell to it.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, I know we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that in a little bit.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
But let me ask, just overall, how has your experience been now that you're playing PlayStation 4 games?

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
Good. I wish they had some better control over when you're downloading stuff.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Because I was downloading my digital version of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
And I wanted to download other things first.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And I paused stuff. And then even when it said it was done downloading, it went into the game.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm like, cool. I'm going to play some of the campaign.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Because I told it to download the single player first.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Even though I played the campaign like six times now.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
So I played the campaign and got through the first level.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And it's like, please wait for the rest of the content to download.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm like, what? It's got like seven minutes left. What the hell?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So I thought this was done already.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
That was like Destiny, playing that for the first time.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Because you put the disc in and it spins up and a little bar fills up.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
You're like, all right, it's installing.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
All right, we're good to go.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And you go into the game and it's like, downloading game updates.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Download, download, download.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I haven't even touched Destiny yet.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Just warning you, you're going to have a similar experience.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
So be ready.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
But we did play more of, or I should say Josh was very excited to be able to play more Ninja Bots again.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh good. Something for everybody in the household.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
All right, well joining us in studio tonight, we have a very extra special guest here for Orange Lawns Radio.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Those of you who have been listening to the show for a long time will recognize this voice.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Somebody who is only able to grace us with her presence once in a blue moon.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
But we're so happy she's here tonight in studio.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Say hello everybody to Marissa.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Hello.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Hi, welcome back.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Hi, it's great to be back.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And Marissa, if you have not been following the saga of Marissa.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
How many parts is there?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I think there's 27.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's a sonnet in 27 movements.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
No, but you say you're not a gamer, but you totally are.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Like, you know more about the Thief franchise than anyone I know.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
We're not going to talk about the new one.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Marissa's very irritated.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
What went wrong? What went wrong with New Thief?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Everything.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
How about one example?

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
They really wanted to, they tried to cater to too many people at once instead of taking advantage of what made it lovable in the first place.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
So it created a really scattered vision and they got rid of the lead voice actor, who is a motherfucking genius.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, let's talk about voice acting for a little bit.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Because I know that in the earlier days of OLR, because the show's been around a while, so people's lives have changed over the past 12 years.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
For a while you were really into folk music, and you still are.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I mean, I know that's not something you've really abandoned.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
But somewhere along the way you got the itch to get into voice acting, right?

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
It's actually what I had wanted to do ever since I was about eight or nine.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Really?

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I had even studied it. I studied acting intently and I was an actor for many years.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And this is actually, back in my day, this is when it wasn't cool.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
When all my theater friends would tease me, that's not real acting.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Now they're like, can you help me get an agent?

05:30.000 --> 05:41.000
And I had done all these other things, honestly, because it takes a lot of courage, as anybody knows, when they are the sole proprietor or an independent contractor, to represent yourself.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
It's a lot easier to hustle for other things.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
And a lot of my friends came together and they gave me, I guess, a talent intervention or something.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
They're like, we can't have you crying anymore because you're coming home working at a law office.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
We think you're good at this thing and you should do it.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Which also meant a lot to me because I know if I went to them and I was like, I would like to be a ballerina, they'd be like, really?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
No. That's how I knew they weren't BSing me.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I love that. A talent intervention. That's amazing.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So you are doing voice acting now.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
Sadly, I can't say, oh, Marissa's been in this game you've all played, but it'll be a road to get there at some point, right?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Right.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, I don't know how time, because I know that the show's starting right now, but we can talk about how people start that later.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Because it's a little bit lengthy to talk about that process.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We'll get into that part B, I guess, a little bit.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Just remind me.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
My mind's going 100 miles an hour right now since I literally was in Anaheim earlier today and now I'm here.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
It's also one of those jobs where you're like, hey, what do you do?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I go, oh, I do this and they go, oh, how can I get into it?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You know what? A lot of people want to know that.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
But a lot of people want to hear video game talk, too, so we'll get to that a little later in the show.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
We'll ask all about how you got into that.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
Now, usually I would say let's talk about people, because you know a lot of voice actor people, but I want to keep it really positive.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I want to talk bad about anybody.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So who are some awesome voice actors?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
If we aren't following their stuff, we really should be.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Who is doing the video games that are just awesome people?

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't have anyone that I've ever even heard anything negatively about, because everyone I've ever met has honestly been wonderful.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
I know that people are people and we don't necessarily get along, but it's a community where it's very small.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
You think about video games and who is voicing stuff. It's like Jennifer Hale is in every game and Troy Baker is in every game.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
This weekend was the Troy Baker game weekend.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
That's not a bad thing. They are both gods.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It makes the game that much better.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, exactly.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
You hear that Jennifer Hale is going to be in a game and it's like, yes please.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
There are so many facets to that too, because they know that they are amazingly talented, but they are going to show up and they are good to work with.

07:57.000 --> 08:07.000
Although, now that we've gotten to the age where we are digitally scanning actors, a lot of the characters in the games I'm playing are starting to look like Troy Baker.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
You must have been playing Infamous this week, I believe.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We'll get to that in a little bit though.

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the voice of Geeks Network.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm going to do my best voices tonight with Marissa President.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
I'm in the presence of voice acting soon to be royalty. I need to do my best.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Alan Alchemy is asking a question saying, Marissa, have you worked on anything with Chris Hardwick?

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I know that voice acting work is rarely done in a group studio setting anymore.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
No, I haven't. Although, yes, that's true.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
Specifically with American animation, that's when it's done in a room.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Actually, it is amazing. You have to give serious credit to people who do video games and anime.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
They give them the least amount of anything and as little as possible, they just go, make your magic, do something.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
Taliesin Jaffe, I'm pronouncing his name wrong because I put the emphasis on the wrong syllable.

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
He's an amazing actor who came into our class and talked about one time they just threw this thing at him at the last second.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
It turned out in the game that he was kind of playing this butch woman.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
They didn't tell him that at the time, but they just threw this at him.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
It ended up being hilarious and funny, but they gave him so little to go on.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
To start to transition into what I'm going to talk about next,

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
there was a voice acting stage at BlizzCon where all weekend they had voice acting talent up there on the stage.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I was joking with you before the show, I thought of you and I really did.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Just seeing some of that talent on display, there were some panels,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
and I'll admit I didn't stay to watch anything start to finish,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
but there were some demos that were near there so I kind of absorbed what was going on.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
I heard some Q&A, but I also heard one panel, talking about a little bit to go on,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
where they were doing monster voices as requested by the audience.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
It was like design a monster voice over panel or something like that.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Some guy got up there and was like, zombie, turkey, thanksgiving, rat.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't know what the heck it was, but it was crazy.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
This man made the most hideous noise I've ever heard in my life,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
but he pulled it out of thin air, like I imagine you have to do sometimes.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
You had to be able to do that at the last second.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Video games are one of the most grueling things you can do to your voice because of those efforts.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Getting stabbed lightly, deeply, getting stabbed and the knife pulling downwards to the side.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
And also, if you have something like this, you have to be able to have range within that.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
If you audition and you get the job like that, you can't move within an emotional range within there.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You're screwed and you're actually going to be sounding like that at the end of the day.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, wow, wow. Oh my gosh, wow.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Any other games you've been dabbling in lately, Marissa?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't know if your voice acting lends any time to games.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I've actually really just been studying what other actors have been doing more.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
That's really been a lot of my time.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
I just completed a move and then all my grief over the thief game.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Fair enough, fair enough. I like that.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
You might be looking for influence in some of the art that's out there with voice acting.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's really cool.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Absolutely.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Well, we'll talk to Marissa more throughout the show and please feel free to chime in at any point.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
If you guys have questions for her in chat, we can do that as well.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
But let's move on to our kickoff topic tonight, BlizzCon.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm back from BlizzCon and I literally just walked off the plane about 90 minutes ago and here we are at OLR.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I spent...

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Rob, that's figuratively just walked off the plane.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Whatever.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
If you literally did it, we would be filming a recording of the airport.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Really? Because that would be kind of fun, I think, if we could all get past security.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I'd like to point out that my positive spin on your coming out from Anaheim,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
yeah, he's like, Anaheim sucks, doesn't it?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I was really positive about that.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Not the city block I was on because I was within one mile of Disneyland at all times.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That is awesome, yes.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So you did the BlizzCon?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
No, I didn't go to Disney this time. There was no time.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I arrived on Thursday and the first thing I went to was this event called World of Podcasts.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
It was a kick-started event for the community and this was their second year that they'd done the event.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
It was a lot of World of Warcraft podcasters and fan communities that came together to do this.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
It was a really awesome event, I've got to say.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
They did a fantastic job.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
They really outperformed last year.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And not to knock last year, but everything starts somewhere and then gets better, right?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
So, I mean, it was like five times the size of what they had last year.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
They had a room dedicated to panels and I was fortunate enough to be on a panel where I was talking about podcasting,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
which, you know, I can talk a lot about, right?

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
They had a room where you could take your pictures in front of a green screen.

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
So, myself and Dr. Ken from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and our friend Talrix all got a photo with Sylvanas,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
thanks to the green screen magic, so that was fun.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
And there was an art gallery in one of the rooms and this fan website, AskMrRobot,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
those of you that listen to Hoard House probably remember when we had V on the show from AskMrRobot.

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
But AskMrRobot is a site that really aims to make players better through data that is submitted to them from logs

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
and through analysis and lots of big complicated math basically.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
But AskMrRobot actually sponsored this art gallery where they had a bunch of photos from the fan community.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
They were up on the walls and everywhere and I got to tell you this.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
At the con, I got a tweet from V and she said, hey, come find me, I'm over by the Illidan statue.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
So, I went over, she said, I got something for you.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
So, I went over to the statue and she gave a gift on behalf of AskMrRobot to Hoard House

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
and believe it or not, what she gave us, one of the prints that was on the wall on display at World of Podcasts.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And each print was specifically picked to match the podcast.

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
So, we got a picture of an orc baby with a handwritten card from V that said,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
so you can hang it in your studio and have a picture of grandpa.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It is fantastic and I'll give you more information.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
There's not enough vodka.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I'll give you more information about that on the next episode of Hoard House.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
But if you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Is it supposed to look like a troll doll?

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's supposed to have a distinct look to it.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I mean, it does look like an orc as a baby.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
And my favorite is that he has that confunk coming off of him with all those little flies there.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Oh, that's what that is.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I love his hair.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
If you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I know we talk about ethics and game journalism and all this stuff.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And I'm really not supposed to let bribes win me over.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
But that one kind of won.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm just full disclosure.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Like, you give me something like that and yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to say AskMrRobot.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
But you're not selling the product.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
And we are commentators here at Orange Lounge Radio.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
There's a big difference.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
All right. Anyway.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
We aren't above selling out here at Orange Lounge Radio.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's the highest bidder. We're not going to lie about it either.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I just sold out for a painting.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
We don't have any ethics, so we can't sell them.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Now hold on. We have some ethics.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I can't.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
We have some ethics. All right.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Anyway, so that was awesome.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And let's see.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
So the con itself, I'm sure a lot of you guys have been following the news.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
They didn't say a lot about World of Warcraft because their big expansion is coming out.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
They announced Starcraft 2, Legacy of the Void, which we all knew that was coming.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
So it wasn't really a big surprise.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Got to play that a little bit on the show floor.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm not very good at Starcraft, but lots of intricate cutscenes and things you'd expect was pretty cool.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Diablo 3, my favorite Blizz title right now, sadly.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
All they could really talk about was the next mini patch.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
But we did get to play that on the show floor.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
They're going to have one new map that has these really cool spike traps on it.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
And they're going to have different types of treasure gnomes, like treasure gnomes that drop only gems, drop only blood shards, and things like that.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So just a little bit to get into there with Diablo.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
And then some bigger news with Hearthstone.

16:02.000 --> 16:11.000
They announced the Goblin vs Gnomes expansion, where the cards have a lot to do with the mechanical things that these two races make.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
A lot of unpredictability with that.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And I got to play a match against Dr. Ken, and I made the biggest stupid noob mistake I could.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Because I haven't played Hearthstone in like a year, okay?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
So I'm playing this, and Ken gets up from his computer and he's like, you win.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And I'm like, what do you mean I win? I haven't killed you yet.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
And he's like, you have all these monsters out, you can attack me for two damage and I'm dead.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
And I was like, oh, I thought I had to clear all your minions first, like in Magic the Gathering, before I could attack you.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
And he's like, no.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And I was like, I ended my turn on accident.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And so we went back to playing, and he beat me.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I made the biggest dumb noob mistake.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
But the expansion was a lot of fun.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
It motivated me to give Hearthstone another look.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I haven't played it in far too long.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Got to play Heroes of the Storm, which they're bringing some new heroes to.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Jaina, Thrall, you know, some of those people you know from World of Warcraft.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I think Tyrael was new, I can't remember if he was already in the game or not, I apologize.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Sometimes with the hero rotation, I forget who is and isn't there.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So they announced some new heroes, which was cool.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Sylvanas was one that they announced for Heroes of the Storm, that was awesome.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
She looks like a lot of fun.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
And got to play that, and again, had a lot of fun playing that, so I need to give that another look.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
And then, of course, the big one that everybody's talking about.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
Blizzard announced a new IP franchise.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I mean, they say it's their first in 17 years.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
You have Heroes of the Storm, though, in Hearthstone, so it's not really their first new thing.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
But heroes based off existing characters.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Hearthstone based off existing lore and characters.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
So this is their first, like, from scratch thing.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
And as that trailer is playing, which I'm sure you've all seen by now,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
if you haven't, check it out on YouTube, Overwatch trailer, BlizzCon.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
It looks like Pixar did it, like it was a really good trailer.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Did any of you, the rest of you, see the Overwatch trailer by chance?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You really should check it out when you get a chance.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I didn't.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
It was really cool. It looks like a Pixar movie, like you're watching The Incredibles or something.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
And my jaw hit the floor as I was watching this because I realized this was Project Titan we were looking at.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Because there was no way, no way that this was pulled out of somebody's butt in a year.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Now, maybe Titan had started as one thing and became this other thing that's now Overwatch.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't know. We'll never know.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Blizzard will probably never peel back the onion on that so we can really see what's in the middle there.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
But whatever this was was the product of many, many years worth of work, clearly.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
And Overwatch, which is a lot of people are comparing to Team Fortress 2.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I played it twice. I'm comparing it to Team Fortress 2.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
It is a lot like Team Fortress 2. At least the component we played was very similar to a match in Team Fortress 2 where you control one checkpoint.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And then once you take over that checkpoint, you move to the next one and the next one.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
So it was very much like that.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
But the characters in Overwatch, very, very good.

18:57.000 --> 19:06.000
I mean, just to, you know, Blizzard took some heat last year because there wasn't enough women in World of Warcraft and a lot of strong female characters.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
Which, you know, you look at Overwatch and they've got men, women, robots, big, small.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
I mean, just a great diverse roster there in Overwatch.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
But it's not just the diversity. It's not just that.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
But it's the fact that all of these characters were so strong and so fleshed out.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
It wasn't like a reskin of another character. I mean, this was really a new cast of characters.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
Sometimes I feel with a female thing, though, that strong female character just means not being a prostitute being murdered in a bikini.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Anything above that is nice to know.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, and you know, there was one character I played named Symmetra that definitely had that side cut dress that was a little bit revealing.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And she had kind of an Egyptian look to her.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And she was kind of, you know, like sexy.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
But then there was another one, Tracer, that looked like she was like a throwback to one of those Amelia Earhart aviators.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What they would look like in the next century.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The orange goggles and things like that.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
And she was really cool and she is the lead mascot for the game. At least that's the sense I get.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So, you know, it's around the board.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
There's going to be a little bit of sexy there.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But there were some sexy men, too.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You know, a little bit of everything.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
But the characterization at the end of the day was really, really strong.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
And yeah, man, there's a lot to devour there.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
The first time I played it, I wasn't really feeling it because I played Symmetra and I didn't get her at all.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
And I guess her thing is you want to set up as many turrets as you possibly can, fast, figure out where people...

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
And I didn't get that. I thought, oh, I can only have one turret up at a time.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Here I am with the lowest score.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
So, I don't know, it wasn't a lot of fun when you feel like you don't know what the hell you're doing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
But I went back, I said, you know what, I'm going to try it again.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So I went back through the second day and I tried it again.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
I played a character named Mercy, which is almost exactly like the medic in Team Fortress 2, like with the heal ray.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
But you can heal or you can buff.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's left click, heal, right click, buff.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
So you have something to do when somebody's health is full, besides the invulnerability thing that Team Fortress has.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
But the other cool thing is that when you hit the shift button, medic will fly to whatever person you have targeted.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Because she's like an angel type character, so she flies right to somebody.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So that was really fun to like zip around.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
And so once I played her, I was like, all right, that was a lot of fun, even though we lost.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
That was really cool.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So Overwatch won me over by the second day.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
They haven't said if it's free to play or if it's going to be a $60 game, we don't know.

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
I would think because Team Fortress 2 is free and that's going to be the big comparison, I would think Overwatch will be as well.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But I don't know, they could also get away with it for $60.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I would not be surprised at all if Overwatch makes it to consoles, but they didn't announce that.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
PC is really the only thing we have.

21:41.000 --> 21:48.000
One other thing I wanted to say, I got to say kudos to Blizzard by the way they started their opening ceremony.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
And not to get into that whole controversy thing again, but the bottom line is,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
and this is what Mike Morhaime said at the beginning.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
Like, you know what, there's been a lot of harassment and bullying in the past couple months.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
And I think it's important for all of us to take a stand against harassment and bullying.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
And he didn't call anyone out specifically or whatever.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
But you have to remember, harassment and bullying unfortunately in gaming go way back.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
They go back years and years.

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
And unfortunately, games like WoW, games like Heroes, people get trolled and yelled at and nerd raged at all the time.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
So despite all the other drama and hysteria going on in gaming community right now,

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
I thought it was just really cool for the president of a company who sometimes is associated with games that lend themselves to cyberbullying and so forth,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
to come out and say, hey remember, there's somebody else on the other side of the monitor.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
And we here at BlizzCon want to kind of start today with creating that environment.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Like, I was one over. I was clapping at that point. I was clapping. Marissa?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
No, I'm doing my church wave.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Oh, you're doing your church wave. Yes! Yes, mama, yes!

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
So, anyway, I just thought that was like a super classy thing to do.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
So, anyway, there you go.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
So I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
ActDeaf reminding me that the medic does have a similar metagun called the Kritzkrieg, which buffs the player you're healing.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Oh, interesting. I wonder if it's like an all-in-one thing, though. I haven't played enough Team Fortress 2. Sorry about that.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
Kaijuta says, as far as Hearthstone, me and a few people spammed Blizzard about putting Hearthstone on the Android and they closed the thread.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Well, they did announce Android tablets are getting it in December, so you won't have to wait too long.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
But no phones yet. It's not on iOS phones. It's not on Android phones, as far as I know.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
So, yeah, that was BlizzCon.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
And, you know, now that I've attended both BlizzCon and FanFest, Final Fantasy FanFest, you know, the two big MMOs.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
I mean, obviously WoW is behemoth, but Final Fantasy is kind of like up and coming with a very different kind of cultural background, right?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Being Japanese-based as opposed to American-based.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
It was really kind of cool to see how similar the events really were.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
I mean, BlizzCon was really well organized.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
A lot of the line issues that I bitched about with Final Fantasy weren't really present at BlizzCon.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Like, the lines moved really briskly.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
Remember when I had that seeding issue at Final Fantasy I bitched about here on the air?

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
Well, Warcraft had very clearly marked, this section between this time and this time is for VIPs only.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
You will be asked to look. It was very clearly marked and I thought, okay, that's fair.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
You know, they have it very marked and that's what they do.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
And they were just very efficient at getting people to do all the things they wanted to do.

24:30.000 --> 24:40.000
But, in Final Fantasy's corner, I kind of thought, like, I didn't need to play WoW at BlizzCon because the expansion is coming out in a week.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I don't need to just play.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
So, why not, you know, what Final Fantasy did is, oh, here's a new boss you can play.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Or, here's a special event we made just for the fan fest, like a roulette mode where you have to do a boss with these certain restrictions, you know.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
It's kind of like putting little spins on the game that make it more interesting.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
And I think BlizzCon could have had a little more of that for the games that weren't really popular.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Like, people weren't really lined up to play Diablo 3 because it was just a mini patch.

25:04.000 --> 25:13.000
But, what if they had had, like, a greater rifts contest where if you could get to, like, level 15 on a rift at the show, you'd get a special little pin or something that you could use to train on the board.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
I think that is something maybe they could have gotten from the fan fest side of things.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
But, at the end of the day, both cons were good and the reason why, one word, community.

25:23.000 --> 25:33.000
The communities for both games, excellent. And, just, I met so many great people at both BlizzCon this past weekend and at fan fest a few weeks ago.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
The communities for the games are really spectacular and you all behaved yourselves.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
And, I did not smell butt the entire weekend. Like, everybody was well bathed and using cologne.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
That or the ventilation in the Anaheim Convention Center is primo.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Very well done. So, I did not smell butt the entire time I was there.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
So, Marissa, why are you giggling?

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Just laughing at the low bar we have.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Alright. One other thing I'll quickly talk about because a lot of people talk about this out of BlizzCon.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
On the third floor, they showed footage from the Warcraft movie.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
You're not going to see it on the internet because it was very much under lock and key.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
They were demonstrating a new Dolby surround type system where the speakers are actually on tracks.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And, I'm sorry, I forgot the name of this. Maybe somebody in the chat remembers this.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
The speakers actually move on the tracks so that if you hear something move, the speaker might actually move the sound from left to right.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
They're on a 360 rail. It was kind of a trip.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
But, they played the teaser and some of the Blizzard trailers on this sound system.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
And, it was a teaser, essentially, for the Warcraft movie.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
They said it was extended BlizzCon footage, excuse me, extended Comic Con footage.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
But, I'm sorry. They had the Dead Can Dance music in the background, which I instantly recognized.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm like, that's host of Seraphim. I love this song. Perfect movie trailer song, right? Especially for somebody at Warcraft.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
And, then they had all these shots.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
And, I'm sorry guys. I can't remember every little detail about the trailer because there was a lot of rapid cuts.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Rapid, rapid, rapid, rapid.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
But, there was definitely an orc baby coming in that movie because there was a very pregnant orc out to give birth.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And, my jaw hit the floor when I saw the night elves. Not going to lie.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
When I saw the night elves, I was like, oh my. Like, I gay gassed. I did.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
That's all you can do. Like, the visual effects in that movie look stunning.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
And, I think that's going to really capture a lot of people that maybe aren't even Warcraft fans are just going to check it out for the visuals.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
After they showed the teaser, they said, by the way, the visual effects in that aren't complete.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
And, I was like, what? I'm like, that looked great.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
And, then they showed us a completed visual effects.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
Literally, just 15 seconds of an orc up close showing emotion.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
And, it looked to be Durotan during the birth of Thrall.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
That's what we speculated that scene was that we were seeing.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So, you could see, like, the emotion in his face.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
And, I was just like, it definitely has human elements.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
But, it didn't look stupid like Shrek would be.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Like, Shrek's supposed to be stupid. I'm not knocking Shrek. It's a kids movie.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
But, it looked like the box art of where it looked like.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
It's a kids movie with half the dialogue written for the grown-ups.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
But, yeah.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
But, you get what I mean, right? Like, it just, wow.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It looked like the Warcraft art in motion.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
And, I was like, this is a really good sign.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I really hope the story doesn't screw this up.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
But, I think they're doing the smart thing by not jumping right into the MMO.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
They're going to do the backstory.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Original OG Warcraft.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And, I think that's the smart way to do it.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
Because, most people playing WoW forgot the story of the original Warcraft.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Which is a great way to retell it.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
See, I love the original Warcraft story.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I hated playing the games.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
So, this is actually going to be good for me.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Even though I still want Sylvanas fuck shit up the movie.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
That would be great.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
And, thank you chatters.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Tigerclaw says, Dolby Atmos was the name of it.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
That was the system that we saw there.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And, Alan Android in chat says,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Do the night elves look like Avatar people?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Um, no.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Here's the thing though.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
I gasped because I thought they were blood elves at first.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I was like, blood elves are in the movie?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
They're very similar in look.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And, then I realized, oh wait, no.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
That's the night elf city that they're in.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That's the night elves I just saw.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But, they looked really good.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Like, the glowing eyes and everything.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah, but also keep in mind that the blood elves before they were blood elves.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That's true. So, maybe I did see that.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I don't know.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Who knows?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Because, they went to...

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, you're right.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
More? No, I'm kidding.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Well, you know me.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
When I play World of Warcraft, I'm like, click, click, click, click, click.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Give me loot. Click, click, click.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I don't read.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
I actually have to agree with your experience you're talking about with Blitzcon.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Because, you know, it's convention central down there.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Everyone I know looks forward to Blitzcon.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Everyone has a great time.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
And, I hear the least amount of complaints about it too.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Which is, you know, everybody and all has a good time with that one.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
And, there's, you know, so many conventions going on down there all the time.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
It was a huge party.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I mean, every night something was going on at the Hilton.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Just in the lobby.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Just people drinking and being merry.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
They had a big street party Friday night for Warcraft's 10th anniversary.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Or, sorry, World of Warcraft's 10th anniversary.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Warcraft's 20th anniversary.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
They had food trucks out there the whole time.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Gourmet trucks out there.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It was just well done.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Very well organized con.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Loved it.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Skye, even though it takes place before WoW, don't be surprised if they planted Easter eggs throughout the film.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
I mean, you could just have a scene of the characters going into a cantina.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And, there you'll see all the races.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
You never know what's going to be after the credits, right?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Unless it's a Christopher Nolan movie.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
You never know what's going to be after those of you that were paying attention to the news this week.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Alright.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Let's see. What else is said here?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Act F says,

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Hey, what if after the Warcraft movie we get an Overwatch movie or maybe a TV cartoon series?

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
I think they've said, I want to say they said in some media panel,

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
they are open to that type of expansion of the Overwatch universe.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I mean, this is Blizzard.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
There is everything for World of Warcraft.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Toys, comics, movies, you name it.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
And now, you know, the big, big movie.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Diablo comics and all this.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Starcraft, I mean, is huge.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Overwatch, Blizzard completely plans to be next in line.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
And that's the thing that they can't really do with Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone as much.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
As much as those games are good, they're borrowing on things that already have been existing and selling in these other franchises.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
So, Overwatch is their chance to, you know, monetize all the things over again.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
And I think they will. I think they will.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
The characters were very, very strong.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
That's something that Blizzard does very, very well.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Anyway, I've rambled on enough about BlizzCon, but if you want to know something else, just ask.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'll get to it at some point in the show.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
But before we get to the news, let's catch up with all of our hosts in how was your gaming week?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I played Final Fantasy XIV.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
And, uh, some Final Fantasy XIV.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
And, um, I played with Kat.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, that's about it.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I played with Kat.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Okay.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
She was pretty fun.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Sounds good. Well, lots of MMOs.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I did play Mass Effect 3 for N7 Day.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And ordered my new hoodie.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Did they do anything special online for N7 Day?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Yes. 25% off hoodies, actually, through...

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
What's today's date?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Um, the 9th.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I think it's through the 11th that they're doing it, so...

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Nice. Maybe I'll check that out. I saw the faux leather jacket.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It looked really hot. I wanted that.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
But, um, they also did the pre-order for the Italian Garris statues.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And I want the Garris one, but I don't have the money for it, so...

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
I will say, I was at, uh, I was at BlizzCon, obviously, on N7 Day.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
And I was wearing my Final Fantasy XIV shirt just to see if anybody would get the joke.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
And, spoiler, nobody said anything. Or if they did, it was behind my back.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
But I did notice that there were at least three people that were wearing N7 gear to BlizzCon on N7 Day.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And I felt really stupid.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
I felt really stupid not having worn my hat to the con that day.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Geez, Rob.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Even after I went to all the effort to say, you can keep it.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I wore it the next day. Leave me alone.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And I wore it to World of Podcasts the night before.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
So I just forgot that it was the 7th of November.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I'm allowed to give you a hard time.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Alright, uh, Loki. How was your gaming week?

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
Um, I actually played a few things. I played more Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare, did some multiplayer.

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
Um, had a little trouble getting the game, um, to preload on, uh, PlayStation 3.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
Because, um, because I had originally preordered it on PlayStation 4 and it was cross-buy.

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
So, um, they didn't tell you that you had to, I guess, what was it, you had to download the pl-

33:44.000 --> 33:51.000
Even though I already had, like, it on one system, I had to rebuy it again on the Sony, uh, network.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
And then, because it said free, so I had to rebuy it and then it would unlock everything.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
But it was just a pain in the ass trying to get it to unlock.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
Even, because it's a Day Zero edition, it should be unlocked on Monday.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
But it was being stupid, so.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
You were a very angry Twitter user that day, I noticed.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
You were, you were, uh, definitely letting your feelings be known.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.000
So, um, so I finally got it to work and I played some multiplayer and that was fun.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Really, really fast, um, so I enjoyed that a bit.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I got up to level 18, I think.

34:23.000 --> 34:32.000
And then, um, you know, I had sent off my, um, my PlayStation 4, actually, I think it was on that Monday.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
And I got it back on Saturday, um, all fixed.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
So I got to, uh, actually play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, which is, it's okay.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
I don't know, I wasn't a huge fan of, like, Infamous.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
I, I got it free when they did the whole PlayStation Network outage thing.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Um, it just looked like a kind of a fun game based off of the trailers I saw.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
And, it's okay. I don't know, like, it's open world.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
It's very similar to me, like, like a Crackdown type of game, although Crackdown's a lot more fun.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
Um, maybe even a little bit like, um, you know, was it Saints Row IV, I guess, where you have, like, the superpowers and stuff.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
And you kind of do different things to collect power-ups to level your character and thing.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I don't know, it's okay. The storyline so far is not really hooking me.

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
It's just kind of bland, but I'll play it a little bit more and see, I guess.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Uh, but Call of Duty is pretty awesome.

35:25.000 --> 35:32.000
I've already played through the first half of the campaign about four or five times, because I did it on about three different systems now.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And, uh, yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Can you, can you explain to me a meme I've been seeing on the internet?

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
And, um, uh, granted, this is because I've been kind of out of it.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I was busy with BlizzCon and stuff before that.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
What is the push F to pay respects thing? Can you explain that for me?

35:45.000 --> 35:54.000
Okay, so there's a, I guess, an interactive cutscene or part of the game where you're, it's spoiled already.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
And, uh, you know, the, the E3 footage I think they had where it showed the dude.

35:59.000 --> 36:07.000
Basically your partner in crime in the, um, the Marines happens to be the son of the guy that runs Atlas or Kevin Spacey.

36:07.000 --> 36:16.000
And so in the very first mission of the game, he gets his arm stuck in this, uh, mobile, like, um, anti-aircraft, uh, launcher thing.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
And, you know, with a bomb on it. And so it explodes and he dies.

36:20.000 --> 36:30.000
And so your pain or your respects to him at funeral in the very beginning, that's when, uh, the Kevin Spacey's character invites you to Atlas and gives you the prosthetic arm because your arm gets chopped off in the first level.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Um,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Oh yeah, that was in the E3 thing. I remember that.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah, that's the E3 thing.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
That's not really a spoiler.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
So that's not really a spoiler. So yeah, anybody, anybody who cares has already played through that part of the game.

36:40.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah, it's really what it is, is it's just, it's an interactive cut scene and you don't really have to push a, I mean, you shouldn't really have to push a button, but I think they do it on purpose so that, because when your pain or respects, it also shows that, look, your arm is amputated.

36:53.000 --> 37:02.000
You know, like in case you didn't catch that by dragging it away and your arm's staying there, you know, it's not super stretchy arm now, it's your arm is gone. So, um,

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Go, go gadget arm.

37:03.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah. So they give you a prosthetic one later on, but, uh, it's just kind of doing that. It, they have a lot of weird, like, you know, cut scene things that are in the game where they have you interact with it that really aren't necessary, but they have them there.

37:16.000 --> 37:28.000
So I guess they thought, Oh, it's jumping the shark and whatever. It's just like, you know, I didn't really need to have a cut scene where I'm taking off the straps that are holding me into my harness or something in the drop ship and stuff.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
It wasn't really necessary. That could have been done just as a cut scene, but they had you interact with it.

37:33.000 --> 37:43.000
All right. I get it now. I just, I've seen all these like pictures on Twitter, like somebody photoshopped the scene from final fantasy seven where cloud is holding Aerith after Sephiroth did the thing.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
And I'm cheering in the background.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
And it says, push F to pay respects. And I was like, okay, there's a joke here about the new call of duty somewhere.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
And then I also played a ninja bots, which is the AR it's a DLC for play room that they had.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
And it's kind of like a, like a runner type game. And it's a great kids game.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
My son loves playing. He can actually play it by himself without me needing to help him and stuff.

38:08.000 --> 38:15.000
The only thing is it's only one level and they programmed it so terribly that like once you're finished with level and it's kind of cool as you earn coins throughout the thing.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
And when you're done, all the coins pop out and they're in your room and you can kind of interact with that stuff.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
But there's no way to play the game again without backing out and then going back into it. And it's only one level.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
And that's like, you know what? I'd fucking buy more levels for this shit if you would just put them out.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
I mean, it can't be that difficult or, and even just program it so that I can go back into it when I'm done playing.

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
Like, Hey, would you like to play again instead of having to go out to the main menu and go back into ninja bots again and fucking have them do that shit again.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Um, but it's fun. He likes it. So, um, I just wish more DLC. I would totally buy it.

38:48.000 --> 38:55.000
All right. More DLC. Do it. Um, Marissa, I know you said you haven't had a whole lot of time to game, but I'm going to check in with you anyway.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
My gaming week has consisted of playing Waze driving up to Sacramento.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
Hey, you know what? Geolocation games. Waze is kind of the game.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Warning, police ahead.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Yeah, but you run over candy and you get points.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
That is true actually.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
I've also been playing don't break your phone and I've been playing, uh, studio one and pro tools.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Fantastic. That's all right.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
Although, although you know what the call of duty game, the most disappointing part is that you don't get to play as Kevin Spacey.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I would like to play Kevin Spacey the game.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
Maybe that's an Easter egg at the end. Maybe like something you get in the end. You know what? DLC.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Kevin Spacey the game.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
It's Kevin Spacey DLC. That's what they do now. That's the thing you really want is DLC.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
No, what you're going to want is probably new.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Push F to spend $9.99.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
New player skins for multiplayer. That's probably the only way to build.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
Boy. Oh boy. All right. I talked a lot already, so I'm not going to ramble on my gaming week.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
I already talked about everything I checked out at Blizzcon.

39:52.000 --> 39:59.000
Uh, before that more Diablo three, more Final Fantasy 14, um, was playing Binding of Isaac a little bit this week on PlayStation four.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
Um, but I also, I pushed A and B on the plane ride home today.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
I pushed A and B to pay respects to Metroid, which I had on my 3DS.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I was like, what do I want to play on my 3DS?

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
Cause Theatrhythm doesn't really work well on an airplane because you know, you're just hearing the rrrrrrgh of the engine or whatever.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So you can't really like hear Theatrhythm.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
But I played Metroid. I was like, what the heck? Let's, let's play an old 8-bit game.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
So I played some Metroid and I was having fun and I was like, I need to do more like classic game live streaming.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Invite friends over and, and just have fun with these classic games and, and see how much I can remember.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
Because like my, my Metroid muscle memory will take me like, okay, I remember to go get the, the thing that lets you morph into the ball.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Uh, I remember you go get the missile after that and then you go get the bomb and then you go get the ice.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
And then I was like, wait, what's after the ice?

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
I'm like, is this where I go and get the jump boots or, shit, I don't remember.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Do I go with the Varia suit now? Damn it.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
And I kind of hit like a wall, like a mental wall. I was like, I don't remember where I go at this point.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
So it's like your muscle memory only takes you so far and it's kind of sad.

41:02.000 --> 41:10.000
And then I, I realized after I shut it down, that's the part where you backtrack all the way to the beginning, freeze the bird and get the extra energy tank.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Or do you need the, you know, you need the high shot, the long shotgun for that, huh?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Dang it. Damn this memory loss.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Oh well, that's why there's game facts, right?

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
All right. So that was my gaming week, getting irritated at how much I'm forgetting in my advanced stage.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
So let's, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Hey, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
We are also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

41:37.000 --> 41:43.000
And as far as I know, no shows off in the near future, maybe December 7th.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
I'll pencil that in for right now, but I'll find out about that for sure in the coming, coming weeks.

41:48.000 --> 41:55.000
But, uh, at least for the next few weeks, we will be here and, uh, we hope you, if you're available Sunday night, you'll come check us out live sometime.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Uh, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vog network.com.

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
Let's get into some gaming news, producer Loki tonight of tonight's episode since I was in the air.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Let's get to it. Start us off.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
So Ubisoft, um, I guess briefly, cause, uh, Bobby had said that these have come back now silently,

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
but they had, uh, pulled off their upcoming PC titles from steam.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
And that includes, you know, far cry for, um, assassin's creed unity and the crew have been, uh, they disappeared off steam.

42:26.000 --> 42:35.000
And, you know, I guess the statement that, um, they gave was we've been in discussions about valve, about assassin's creed unity,

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
but for the time being, the game is not widely available and, uh, via steam in the UK.

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
In the meantime, UK customers wishing to purchase a digital copy of the game can do so by visiting the Uplay store.

42:46.000 --> 42:54.000
I don't think anyone wants to visit the Uplay store to be honest, or our retail partners or other digital distributors.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
Um, and they were also saying that was, it was also gone from the store in North America.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
And I haven't gotten checked to check and see if it's back yet.

43:01.000 --> 43:08.000
And also, um, you know, still on other sites other than steam, like green man gaming and that kind of stuff.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
No, I, I heard they came back today.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

43:13.000 --> 43:22.000
So whatever, whatever disagreement or whatever, whatever, uh, issue, I guess quickly got resolved fairly quickly, I guess.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah. I was going to say, um, yeah, it's, it's back on the store.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
It looks like I see assassin's creed unity right here, uh, for sale,

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
but they never really got into like the real reason why they disappeared.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Just who knows? Interesting.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
I hope this doesn't go down a road. Like, um, uh, we, we worry about with Netflix.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
And I actually was thinking of this today because I saw a commercial on the,

43:47.000 --> 43:57.000
the inflight TV for Disney anywhere or something is what it's called where Disney is basically taking all their movies and doing their own type of Netflix type service.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
And we all know there's HBO go yet. Everybody's doing their own type of service.

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
And we're all kind of sitting here going, uh, this is like, there needs to be one hub with multiple things.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
That's the thing is that unfortunately everybody was like wishing, geez, I wish I could get everything out of cart.

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
You know, I wish I could have all my, you know, I don't want to watch, you know, Fox or this, I want, you know, I only want to watch Disney.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Well, here you go. Here's our Disney stuff. But yeah, at the same time though,

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
stuff like Netflix is going to get gutted with all these shows being taken off there.

44:27.000 --> 44:33.000
Although they kind of cycle stuff through like they have the old 19 was it 1990s Ninja turtle movie there now.

44:33.000 --> 44:41.000
Yeah. It seems like Netflix is at least thinking ahead a little bit and they're trying to get their own series and they've done, you know, obviously like I'm a huge fan of orange is the new black.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
And you know, I know they have a lot of other, uh, critical shows on there. People really dig.

44:44.000 --> 44:51.000
So at least they at least kind of seem to be preparing for this possible future where maybe Netflix has to have its own shows worth subscribing for.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
Um, but, uh, yeah, I just, I don't want to see things get fragmented like that and just, you know, again, I'm making stuff up.

44:57.000 --> 45:05.000
I don't know why Ubisoft really ended up doing the game pull. Um, but I just hope it isn't something like probably a whole lot of stuff.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
We just don't see like, you know, the inside stuff. Maybe, maybe it's something that you play.

45:10.000 --> 45:17.000
Maybe it's just something that they want to implement that valves not okay with, or I don't know. Who knows?

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
Um, ACT F says, I want to say they removed them and added them again because of region pricing and locks.

45:23.000 --> 45:30.000
That's a thing there. Uh, ACT F says it seems like new games added to steam can be cross region gift locked. Interesting.

45:30.000 --> 45:37.000
A power in our chat says everyone wants a piece of the pie, but they don't realize the dividing the market is the worst thing they can do.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
And dungeon buster says capitalism running wild and Y Y R says unlimited Disney movies.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
Sounds great for kids and their parents. Yeah. I mean, I, I was looking at, I think they were given away wreck it Ralph for free.

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
And I was kind of looking at it. They go, well, maybe I should, maybe we should get that. I like record Ralph. So there you go.

45:54.000 --> 46:02.000
All right. Well, uh, moving on to another story. Uh, this is, you know, what's funny is that this link to the story actually like wasn't working before the show.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Oh, now it's working. There it is. I thought it was like, because the website went down.

46:06.000 --> 46:16.000
Well, I thought maybe the website went down during the week. Uh, but, uh, well, what happened is that the game went down and, uh, I thought maybe they were cleaning, cleaning house.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
I've never heard of this game. I had heard of it, but it was in a very diluted market. And the game we're talking about is Dawn gate.

46:22.000 --> 46:33.000
It was electronic arts or EA's answer to the MOBA genre. You know, where league of legend, Dota 2, smite, heroes of the storm, all of these games already exist.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
So unfortunately it's a, it's a pretty fragmented market and Dawn gate tried to get into that market.

46:38.000 --> 46:49.000
And unfortunately in a letter written at, uh, Don gate.com from group general manager, Matt Bromberg, he said, today I have the unenviable task of announcing that we've decided to stop development of Dawn gate.

46:49.000 --> 46:56.000
Um, so, uh, you know, they basically talked about, you know, we were trying to do this and it's all, he said, we knew going in, it was extremely competitive.

46:57.000 --> 47:07.000
But as being a EA, just because we stopped development doesn't mean we're not going to release it. We're going to put it out there. But, uh, we've just stopped development. If anything's buggy, we're just going to leave it in.

47:07.000 --> 47:19.000
You gotta want, you know, they could, they could repurpose it a little bit and just like put it out. There's like a $20 game where you could just go, you know, all the characters there and you can just go ahead, head of your friends or something like they could do that.

47:19.000 --> 47:27.000
I don't know if they will. I mean, they've got origin set up as the storefront. Why not make a little money off of everything you invested, but, uh, we'll see.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
But they are saying as part of the process of closing down, gone, Dawn gate will continue to operate the game for the next 90 days.

47:32.000 --> 47:38.000
All players will be entitled to a full refund of any money spent during the beta. Uh, so there you go.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
If you did spend money on Dawn gate and you were a big Dawn gate fan, at least you're getting the money back, even though this news probably sucks for you.

47:44.000 --> 47:54.000
Why are they charging people during a beta? To be fair, Blizzard does this too. It's to quote unquote test the store. Oh yeah. Test the store.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
It's working. We're making money. To be fair, whatever you buy in the beta, you will have when the game goes live.

48:01.000 --> 48:10.000
And these are free to play games where the transactions are based off of these characters or these mounts or these skins or the, I mean, that is what all of these mobas do.

48:10.000 --> 48:18.000
Oh, they have an in-game store at, uh, for EverQuest online or not EverQuest. Uh, I'm sorry. The, uh, elder scrolls online for the elder scrolls online.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
I don't think they do, but, uh, final fantasy 14 rolled one out just a couple of weeks ago, the two, four patch mounts and minions.

48:24.000 --> 48:37.000
They were very clear at fan fest to say, and he even said in English, you know, they don't, they all speak Japanese and not a lot of English, but he said in English, no pay to win.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
So he wanted to make that very clear, uh, but, uh, just like mounts and minions and things like that only, but that's still pissed off some of the fan base.

48:44.000 --> 48:53.000
And I get it. I don't, I don't, I never bought that crap and wow. The only time I did it was when it was a charity minion and, uh, you know, props to Blizzard.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
One thing they did announce a BlizzCon, they'll be doing another charity minion for American Red Cross Ebola relief.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
They're going to do a 100% charity minion there. So.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Which all of five people have.

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
Well, but to be fair, I believe the American Red Cross is also helping the people in Africa. So, you know.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Well, that's better.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Yeah, that's better. So.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Hey, do you want to hear a joke about Ebola? You probably won't get it.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah, it was going around Facebook. It's the pun dog.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Wow.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
All right. Pun dog. Why don't you give us the next story?

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
Did you just call me a bitch?

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
It, you make it sound like it'd be the first time I've ever said that, but to be fair, you've called me a bitch more than I've called you a bitch.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Because I usually know better than to do that.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Hey.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
You know what? That's okay.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the art of shade.

49:49.000 --> 49:58.000
You better watch out because I just watched a Real Housewives of Atlanta marathon on the right home.

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
Why do I come here anymore? I could have just made you walk.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
Probably be lifting up that pant leg.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
I just get on, I just get on Lyft and then I'd write a nasty tweet about you. I'm just kidding.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm just kidding. If you couldn't, you couldn't.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Bitch, please.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Ah, see? See? Who called who that word?

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
At least I didn't call you late for dinner.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
So anyway, does anyone remember Direct to Drive?

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Was that the one that GameStop bought?

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
It was the one that IGN bought.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Oh, okay. I knew somebody bought them.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Well, basically, yeah, they were bought by IGN.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Point for Loki.

50:45.000 --> 50:55.000
It was basically the AtGames Digital Media said that it got the GameFly digital distribution platform,

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
which had been bought by IGN before and called Direct to Drive.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
So now Direct to Drive is going back to what it used to be.

51:03.000 --> 51:10.000
AtGames is going to be relaunching it under the original name and not GameFly anything.

51:10.000 --> 51:19.000
So basically, it's going to give people a way to buy and play and rent, I believe, games.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Pretty cool, though, that it's coming back. I mean, I guess that they're like,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
we miss it. We're going to bring it back.

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
So a quote on here says that the vision for new Direct to Drive is to create the best destination

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
both for gamers to find their favorite titles and for publishers to showcase their lineups.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
We will bring a retail quality experience to the digital world with the best incentives

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
and events that gamers both expect and deserve.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
So it's a steam competitor, essentially.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah. But anyway, they're offering gamers a chance to win 12 legendary gems of The Chosen One

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
or a flashback console, whichever one they want.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Nice.

51:57.000 --> 52:04.000
I guess the 12 legendary gems are basically 10 randomly drawn people

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
will get one game every month for the 2015 calendar year.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Nice.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
And the flashback consoles available are the Atari Flashback 5, Sega Genesis,

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Sega Genesis Portable, ColecoVision, or Intellivision.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
My Intellivision flashback should be getting here this week, by the way.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
If you remember the show a couple of weeks ago, I went on Groupon and bought that boy.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
But anyway.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
You know what? I have an Intellivision.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I know, but I don't.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
You gonna buy mine?

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
No, because I just got a flashback console.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
But anyway, what I wanted to say is that even though I just talked about,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
I don't want to see the marketplace diluted, I'm okay with this.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Steam needs some competition.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
And they do have, you know, there's Desura, there's Humble Store.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
There are still other competitors out there.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
But the difference here and why I say this is okay is because a company like this

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
relies on distribution agreements.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
It's not publisher-owned, so it's not going to be just one silo of games.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I mean, it is competing on the same level.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Although, well, okay, to be fair, Steam is publisher-owned.

53:05.000 --> 53:14.000
But I suppose, you know, because Steam also has a lot more than just Valve stuff,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
we let it slip by a little bit.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
So, anyway.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Let's move on.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Loki.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
All right.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
So, let's see.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
Let's talk a little bit about other companies like Activision,

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
which they're not really my friends right now,

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
despite the fact that I'm playing a ton of Call of Duty.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
They've raked in, apparently, for a quarter of three, $753 million.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Of course, a lot of that is Destiny.

53:43.000 --> 53:50.000
And, of course, they also, I guess, released Diablo III, the Ultimate Evil Edition,

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
back in August.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
So, a lot of it's that stuff.

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
And, of course, you know, the Blizzard side of things.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
Of course, that brings now their revenue for 2014.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
They're expecting to earn $4.325 billion in that revenue.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
And I guess another $1.492 billion, which is expected, I guess, this next quarter.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Probably, hey, that's probably Call of Duty.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
So, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're going to probably rake in a ton of money from that

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
and, hell, even the World of Warcraft expansion.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
The thing that I'm a little peeved about, though,

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
is you may remember we talked a little bit about SharePlay,

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
which was part of the brand-new PlayStation 4 2.0 patch,

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
that it's that wonderful feature that you can take a game that you own

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
and share it with your friends.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
In other words, like, say, Rob wants to play some Call of Duty.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I could say, hey, you know what, I'm going to SharePlay that

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
so we can either play, you know, split-screen deathmatch or something like that

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
or he can play the single-player version.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
Oh, wait, no, he can't because Activision decided to be unique about it and say,

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
hey, we're going to disable SharePlay functionality on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
That's right.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Is this something where maybe they're only going to do it for a little while?

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Like, maybe like 30 days you can't do it or something?

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
They didn't say. Their excuse, though, according to it right now is...

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Well, I can't wait to hear this.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Yes, and this is totally not PR speak.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
This is, I'm sure, a completely honest reason why it would work.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
From the heart.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Delivering a great gaming experience for our fans is our top priority.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
We're focused on launching Advanced Warfare and ensuring that people

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
have a great time playing it, which our fans seem to be.

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
SharePlay is a new feature that was introduced as part of the recent PS4 firmware 2.0 update.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
Our engineers didn't have access to it before it launched,

55:37.000 --> 55:43.000
so we haven't had a chance to evaluate and see how it will impact the experience across all modes of play.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Of course, we wouldn't include a feature in our game without having the chance to test it.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
Once we fully analyze its performance, we'll determine how to support it going forward.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
It's too new.

55:53.000 --> 56:01.000
Really, that's kind of strange because all the other games out there that were before Advanced Warfare

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
that definitely didn't know about it seem to be working just fine, so...

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Okay, I'm going to humor this train of thought for a minute

56:10.000 --> 56:17.000
because I believe an argument could be made that SharePlay will help people demo games.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
I mean, you're going to be able to play your friend's game and get an impression of,

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
do I like this game? Do I want to buy this game?

56:23.000 --> 56:29.000
And if the streaming technology lags or has too much frame skip

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
or too much artifacting or something like that, you might decide as you're testing this game,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
ah, this is kind of crappy, I don't really want to buy this, this doesn't look very good,

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
and it doesn't respond very well, it doesn't play, it's not fun.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
I could see, you know, I'm trying to give Activision the bit of the doubt,

56:44.000 --> 56:52.000
I could see an argument made there where they don't want people's impression of the game to only be through SharePlay.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Okay, then put out a demo.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
And I think that's a fair exchange, then put out the demo you want people to see, right?

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
Because, you know, put out the first level or something like that, or put out whatever.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
I mean, put out something then if that's what your excuse is going to be.

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
But, I don't know, I just, all these other games that are out there now,

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
I don't see them using this as an excuse.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
I could see Activision as, we want to sell more copies of this game,

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
and god damn it, you're not going to share your copy, you're going to buy a new copy.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
If you really want to play Call of Duty, you're going to buy another copy.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
I would actually totally understand if companies wanted to,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
as much as I think SharePlay is really great and everything,

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
I understand if companies want to be like, you know what, for 30 days we're going to lock it out.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Like, I would kind of get that.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Okay, well then that's fine, but be honest about it.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
I mean, I don't know, it's just, we haven't had a chance to test it out yet.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
I mean, come on, I don't think they're leaving developers in the dark about this stuff.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
And let's be honest here, SharePlay, this is a feature that they were talking about

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
when they first talked about the PlayStation 4.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
We've known about SharePlay that it was coming since E3, if not E3 of last year.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
I kind of have a hard time believing Activision didn't have some access to a preview 2.0 PlayStation build.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
You know, I mean, you have to suspend a little disbelief to believe that, I think.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
Well then I guess you better not put any of those Call of Duty games on PlayStation Now

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
because they're just not going to play as well over the internet, right?

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
You know, streaming, it's just not going to work.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
YYR in chat says, but who hasn't played Call of Duty, which actually I haven't.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Hand raised.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
We all know how it works, but I've watched other people play it, I will say that.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I actually haven't even watched other people play it.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
To be honest though, the new game is a little bit different.

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
I mean, the Exosuit stuff makes the game a lot faster than the standard Call of Duty game.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
There's a lot more verticality to it.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
It does feel different.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
It is, I would think, worthy of a demo or some sort of way to get people to check it out

59:00.000 --> 59:08.000
because I think it's going to be one of those games that it actually may appeal to people that didn't like Call of Duty in the past.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, to tell the truth, I can't see how share play benefits the game makers.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
To which YYR responds, Fifth Dream, quote, hey, this is pretty cool.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Maybe I'll buy it to play with my other friends.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
Yeah, to be fair, I just told you I've never really played Call of Duty, but if Loki could share play it with me,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I would try giving it a go.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
What do I have to lose? Time.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I'd say time you can't get back.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
That's true.

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
My understanding of this game is that it's the one where my boyfriend gets called crude expletives by 8-year-olds.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I'm sorry, that's Xbox Live.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
That's a lot of video games, actually, Marissa.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Yeah, it's not so bad on the PlayStation.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Which is why I talked about earlier, it's a good thing that the CEO of one of the biggest companies came out and said,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
you know, there are people at the other side of the monitor, stop it.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
I'll just be at the kitchen making dinner and I hear all sorts of the crudest of expletives from young children.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm like, oh, Call of Duty today, huh?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
You'd be surprised that actually on all the games that I've played on Advanced Warfare, I haven't really heard any of that.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And even like Modern Warfare 2, I haven't really heard a lot.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I mean, there's a few times you run into a hacker, but that's Modern Warfare 2. It's a fucking old ass game.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Halo is always the worst for me.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Do you think that's more associated with Xbox? People always insist on that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That there's like people, like more college kids or something.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I think maybe the 360.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Maybe because it was the PlayStation 4 version I'm playing,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
maybe a lot of little kids don't have PlayStation 4s that they're playing Call of Duty on right now.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I don't know.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Marissa, I think the thing you were saying, I think that was a little more unique to 360 versus PlayStation 3.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Maybe so much as the one versus PlayStation 4.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And I would say it was because the 360 came out sooner and it was more affordable.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And at that time, you know, PlayStation 3 took a long time to catch up.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Like it didn't really make headway in that console race until a few years into it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So I think the Xbox One really was kind of like that predominant system.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But now I don't necessarily know that the stereotype belongs to Microsoft in that regard.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And then also on top of it is now they've added a lot of things since the 360 came out.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And even on PlayStation's side I think where you can rate people.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So if you run across a really annoying little prick that, you know, is just shouting expletives.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
First you can mute him and second you can rate him down.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And I think, I don't know, I haven't played a lot on 360 recently.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But I know there's definitely people out there like that.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And unfortunately it's little kids.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Because little kids that think they can get away with all sorts of shit because they're anonymous.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And singing. What's with the singing?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Some people just love to sing. I mean, I don't know.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I have heard some of the worst things. Like kids yelling at parents.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Like, oh my god, if I were there I would be spanking you right now.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Like for real. Like you little brat.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And props to Sony, I was almost going to buy a new headset.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But then I read up on the patch, or whatever, 1.6 for the PlayStation 4.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It now supports my old headset I have for the PS3, the Sony stereo one.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I'm like, oh yes, surround sound wireless. Woo!

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Alright, well let's move on to talking about some classics here for a minute.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
No, not the classic game of the week yet. We'll get there in a little bit.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But let's talk about what the EFF, or Electronic Frontier Foundation, did.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They actually filed a petition with the Library of Congress and the United States Copyright Office this past week.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Over modifying abandoned games, especially those that you need an online connection to prevent piracy.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You know how this was a trend we started to see in games.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Probably about 10 years ago it started to pop up here and there in some games.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So what the EFF wants is they want the laws to be modified.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So mods that strip out these authentication checks will be fair.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Because if the developers take the servers offline and are done, then people still want to play these games.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So people should be able to mod them to take this out, and that should be legal.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Civilization V and Mario Kart Wii cited as examples in the petition.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Though there's many, many, many games.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I know Mario Kart Wii, but I thought Civ V you could still play online.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But maybe that'll be something down the road.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Why would Mario Kart Wii need online to play?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You'd, well you'd, but, I guess that's true, huh?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
That doesn't make any sense.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Maybe in that case it was a modification to be able to play online on a private server?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I'm thinking that's what, when I read it I thought that's what it was.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That you'd be able to basically run your own servers, I guess.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
To play those Nintendo Network stuff.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I could see maybe also, maybe it's both.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That it's multiplayer servers and it's authentication servers.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I wish more developers would realize that there are people there that still really want to play classic games and do this themselves.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Like if they're going to turn off these servers, allow people to do custom servers themselves.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We've seen some games do this.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Like I remember when Phantasy Star Online was sunsetted on PC.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
They were really good about being able to export your data to set up custom servers and so forth.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Like they kind of embraced that, and I always thought that should have been like a model for others.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But speaking of MMOs, like Phantasy Star.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
The petition did note that MMOs and persistent world games would be exempt from the change.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Since the audio visual content is primarily stored on the developer server and not in the client.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Speaking of old games and the ever controversial quote unquote abandonware.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
This link circulating Facebook.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I thought we might have mentioned this last week, but last week was a week ago.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So forgive me if I'm mentioning this again, but with good reason because this is really cool.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
The Internet Archive has put out the Internet Arcade.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Over 900 classic arcade games you can play for free inside your browser.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
It's basically MAME that's endorsed by the Internet Archive.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That's essentially what it is.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Yeah, but who's the Internet Archive?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
It's a company in San Francisco, I believe, whose sole mission is to archive everything that's on the Internet.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The Wayback Machine.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's archive.org.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's where you find your old GeoCities page.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yes, and I have.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Hey, I still haven't seen my old AOL Ranma page.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I should go check and see if my GeoCities page is there.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I know, right?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You might be able to go see the old Orange Launch Radio website, the old site we had for that.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But here's my thing.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's like, yeah, I understand it's MAME and stuff and these are ROMs, but is this legal?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I mean, because if it is legal that I can just play these for free.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Then what's to stop me from like...

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Doesn't copyright expire on hardware after 25 years?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Hence why we have systems like the Retron 5?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I don't know what the thing is, but this isn't hardware, though.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
This is software.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
There are arcade machines.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
There are arcade machines, but it's emulating the arcade machine.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
It's data stored on chips.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's emulating the hardware.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
This is the legal gray area that we live in.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
This would be the same argument they'd be making in court.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I'm just surprised that, especially with Bionic Commando being in there,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I'm surprised Capcom hasn't said, ah, we're going to sue you.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I am kind of surprised they're able to do this, especially because it really wasn't that long ago

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
where on Nintendo Wii, Virtual Console had arcade games in it.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I want to say that Mappy and some of the Namco classics were a part of that.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Don't you remember that?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And every now and then we get those retro arcade collections,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
like the infamous OLR Cameo in the Namco collection.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Yeah, Namco, yeah.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Well, Dig Dug.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It seems like there's all sorts of cools and ghosts.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
There's another Capcom game there.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Frogger from Atari.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
They put Nintendo games in there.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Is Donkey Kong in there?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I was just looking for that.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I don't believe Donkey Kong is in there.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Maybe that would be the one where I'd be like, you know,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
if they put a Nintendo game in there, they're the ones that really go after their old IP.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Mario Brothers original would be another one to look at?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
No Mario Brothers.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Marvel Madness though is in there.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Interesting.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But see, that's what I'm kind of wondering.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's like, okay, so if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Like Street Fighter II?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I mean, that's pretty well known.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
So if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Like say, you know, if I had an...

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Granted, I'm going to put whatever the fuck I want on my own MAME machine,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
but like let's say, you know, I put these 900 ROMs on there,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
so that's completely legit, right?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It says it's on here for free.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I'm assuming that that's free for me to use as well on my machine.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That's a good question.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And let's, you know, take it a step further.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
You know, people, when they make MAME machines and stuff like that,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
when you sell them on eBay, you're not allowed to sell ROMs with them

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
because they're copyrighted.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But if these are all free of copyright,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
because now that they're available on the internet for free...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Oh, and Tron's on there, by the way.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Fifth Dream Notes in our chat room.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
They have Pac-Man Plus, but no other Pac-Mans,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
so there must be some rhyme and reason to it.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
So...

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Namco.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So I'm wondering, like, you know, if that would be legit or something.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I don't know.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
There's a lot of Konami games on there because the first game I played,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
because, you know, it's an alphabetical list, and I was like,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Amidar, I like that game. That's a Konami game.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Space Harrier.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Ooh, there you go.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
All right, well, anyway, I'm sure many of you have already checked that out,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
but just in case you haven't, check that out.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Archive.org, I believe.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
The full link was...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Archive.org slash details slash internet arcade.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Perfect. Thank you.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
One more story before release date.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Dark Sakura.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Mass Effect.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
What? You have my attention.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Mass Effect All the Things.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yes.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
All the Things.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yes.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Well, there is a sort of poll out there.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Kind of a poll.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Do you like Mass Effect? Yes or sure.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yes or no.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The fuck you mean do I like Mass Effect?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Basically, the current Bioware boss, Aaron Flynn,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
was on a post on NeoGaf, basically,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.000
listing what the most requested features you'd ever heard for a Mass Effect trilogy re-release.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And the ideas were basically 1080p, 60 frames per second support,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
high-res textures, especially for Mass Effect 1, and seamless DLC.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And basically, that's one thing that he said that would definitely be included if it were done,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
where the DLC would be as if it were already parts of the game.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
At places in the game, it would make sense.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Maybe some new multiplayer maps just for fun.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Just as the icing on the cake.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
A little more multiplayer.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well, here's a quote too.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
ME3 combat mechanics in ME1 comes up relatively often,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
but it's not on my radar against speaking personally.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
First, it would be a hell of a lot of work.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Secondly, I hate the idea of us being accused of retconning ME1.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Basically, the big thing is that there really are addresses that people have asked for.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
He said, there's no plans right now, but the quote says,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
when we do, we'll share ASAP.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, soon needs to happen sooner.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Soon needs to be like now.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Right.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
How soon is now, to quote.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
BioWare, you shut your mouth.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
How can you say, we're going about things the wrong way?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I am human, and I need Garrus' love.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I need to love Garrus.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Just like anybody else does.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Marisa just gave a toast.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Alright.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Do you know Garrus?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Of Garrus, Marisa, have you seen the character?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I know, yes.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'm sure Jamie's told you a lot.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Absolutely.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That voice.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Guy's goofy looking, by the way.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Utterly goofy looking, and he's got the hottest voice.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
This tells you a lot about the people in real life.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And he was in a really bad episode of Buffy.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
He does say a radio phrase for nothing.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Now, Marisa, you're a very lovely lady.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Thank you.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
But he was also in a really bad episode of Buffy, which I don't hold against him.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Alright.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Well, let's talk about some things coming out a whole lot sooner than a Mass Effect remake.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Loki, release dates.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
This week we have lots of stuff coming out.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Starting off with Pro Evolution Soccer 2015.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
The Halo, the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One this week.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Minecraft, the PlayStation Vita edition on, obviously, the Vita.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Assassin's Creed Unity on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Assassin's Creed Rogue on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Hello Kitty Racing on 3DS.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yay! Except that series actually isn't that good.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You're the guy who has Kitty the Cool.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't think I bought that for myself.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
You bought that when I got Vibribin.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Oh, that's right.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The Wii U, the 3DS, and I believe the Vita as well.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Oh, and probably PC to go along with that.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric on the Wii U, as well as Sonic Boom Shattered Crystal.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
That's the new Sonic game that he has longer legs.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Tropico 5 on Xbox 360.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Digimon All-Stars Rumble on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze on 3DS.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
As opposed to the Secret of the Ooze, now it's the Danger of the Ooze.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's the Danger of the Ooze.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Will Vanilla Ice be there to tell us, go Ninja, go Ninja, go?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
No, but he'll be there to build him a house.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Let's see what you did there.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Let's see, Payday 2, the Safe Cracker edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Shape Up on Xbox One.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor on PC.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
What else? Am I missing something?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
If you really want to shop at GameStop, Tales of Heart R is an exclusive for the Vita at GameStop.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
For the record, by the way, in my defense about goofy looking guys, I did marry Dan.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Well, he's the goofiest of them all.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I mean that with love.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
He is kind of goofy looking.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But that Tales of Heart R is not on the online store.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I don't know.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Interesting. I would be surprised if it was.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Lisa, it may be online, but they may have the physical version exclusive to GameStop.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Interesting. Let's look at Japan.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Last week was a slow week in Japan and this week makes up for it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
There's a lot more coming out in Japan this week.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
On the PlayStation 4, Battlefield 4 Premium Edition.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, their edition that's subtitled is out this week.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
There is a new camouflage DualShock 4, I believe, to match that.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And World Soccer winning 11 2015.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
That's Konami's big soccer series.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It's huge.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
That is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Xbox One also gets the Call of Duty release and winning soccer, or sorry, excuse me, World Soccer winning 11 2015.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
There's also some new Xbox console collector sets for Xbox One out there in Japan this week to try and motivate some sales, I suppose.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
PlayStation 3 gets Call of Duty.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
World Soccer winning 11 and Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I do not believe this is the popular dice game that my mom used to play.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
It just happens to have Bunko in the title.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
This is actually, looks like it's based off like an anime.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
There's a lot of anime characters fighting each other.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:10.000
There's a girl on a motorbike and people with swords and epic anime cutscenes and all the things you expect in an anime fighting game.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
That is on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, yes, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
On the Wii U this week, there is a new Wii U Mario Kart 8 set.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
32 gig black and white additions coming out.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000
There's also a game called Susume Kinopio Taiko comes out this week, which is, oh, it's Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I did not realize that.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
That's out in Japan this week.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Wow, they get that way earlier than we do.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
We have to wait until December for that.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So that is out in Japan this week.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And on the Vita, that Dengeki Bunko fighting game is out there as well, including Marginal No. 4, Idol of Supernova is out.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And there is a new PlayStation Vita Mercury Duo, light pink white version that's out this week.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Disc Wars Avengers Ultimate Heroes, One Piece Super Grand Battle X,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and Osawari Tante Ozawa Rina Nameko Rime comes out this week in Japan.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
There's your Japanese release date.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So there's actually quite a bit this week.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Busy week in Japan.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Dark Sakura.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You're still getting better every week, Rob.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Thank you. I'm trying.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
All right.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Well, in UK releases on the 12th, we have Retro City Rampage DX.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And I'm waiting for it to reload once again because, yuck.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I don't know why it does this.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I'll have it loaded and it'll be like, no, we're going to reload.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Okay, so as I was saying, Retro City Rampage DX.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And we have Toy Box Turbos for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
On the 13th, we have Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:03.000
There's also PES 2015, World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor, also known as Warlords of Draeno.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Warlords of Draeno.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
As I heard said.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
We'll unclog that lack of content from the past year.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And then on the 14th, we have Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on Fuck Near Everything.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And that's it.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Some folks in chat letting us know that that is Toad's name in Japan.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I didn't pick up on that.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I actually didn't know that.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Like, I've probably heard that before, but, you know, I don't play a lot of Japanese Nintendo games.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So, Kino Game Guru, specifically in chat.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Kino Pio is what Toad is called in Japan.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I never realized that.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So, there you go.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Alright.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Just a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But first.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Alright.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
So, apparently, the first DLC for Mario Kart is right around the corner.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Did not even realize it was that close.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Probably because I don't have Mario Kart 8.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But, Mario Kart 8, the first piece of DLC will come out.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And, including with that, I guess they've confirmed that when you use your amiibo in Mario Kart 8, you get a character-themed costume for your in-game Mii character.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And, also, they're gonna have new characters and new courses.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I believe, if I remember correctly, the first piece of DLC is the Hyrule Cup.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Or, Triforce Cup, I'm sorry.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The Triforce Cup.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And they've already kind of gone over, I guess, according to the Nintendo Minute video.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Which courses are going to be in there.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
So, including with that, Wario's Gold Mine from Mario Kart Wii.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Rainbow Road from the original Mario Kart.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Ice Ice Outpost, which is a brand new track.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And, Hyrule Castle, which I guess has rupees instead of coins.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And, there's even shortcuts that trigger the secret fountain chime from The Legend of Zelda.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So, that's pretty cool.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That Excitebike track looks really cool, I gotta say.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But, that F-Zero track really pisses me off.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And, then, the Yoshi Cup, which I believe is also part of that.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yoshi Circuit from Mario Kart Double Dash.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
The Excitebike Arena, which is a brand new track.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Dragon Driftway, which is also new.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And, Mute City, which apparently they said there's no coins on the course except when you drive over the recharge strips.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And, the entire track is racing her mode.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Interesting.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I don't know how I feel.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
On one hand, it makes me really sad because this means we're never gonna get an F-Zero game again.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Like, can't Nintendo just announce one for 2016 or something?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Like, get me a little bit excited, please?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I love F-Zero.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
We'll get more details about new games that they're working on.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And, I'm sure you'll be excited.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
We'll see. We'll see. Alright.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Well, one of those games that we got some details on is the fact that they're remaking Majora's Mask.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It was announced that the Majora's Mask remake is going to be coming out for the 3DS in Spring of 2015.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
You know what? There's a lot of fans that really wanted this.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I wasn't huge on Majora's Mask, but there are some people that this is their favorite Zelda in the whole series.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So, you know what? I'm glad they're getting this remake.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Because the remake of Ocarina of Time, again, I hold the unpopular opinion that the Nintendo 64 Zeldas really never match the Super Nintendo Zelda for me.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But, that's my opinion.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I share that with you.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I know. But, other people think we're totally wrong.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And, you're entitled to be wrong.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That's right. So, some people love this Majora's Mask.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And, they do look really good in 3D. At least the Ocarina of Time did.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So, the fact that Majora's Mask is getting that same treatment is pretty cool.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
So, you'll be able to experience that in Spring of 2015.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And, they did a whole little announcement trailer during their Nintendo Direct.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Now, speaking of Zelda games, Amiibo figures will work with Hyrule Warriors.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So, if you do happen to get an Amiibo character, you can use that on Hyrule Warriors.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
If you use the Link Amiibo, for example, you'll get the Spinner.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
This is a weapon that was originally in Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Other figures are just going to give you random weapons, materials, or rupees.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So, it's basically, hey, if you spent money on this stuff in real life, we'll give you something in the game.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
So, I mean, it's not like you're going to be playing as Princess Peach in Hyrule Warriors.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And, if you thought that was ever going to be the case, you were...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Can we get Mushroom Kingdom Warriors? Because that would be pretty sweet.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Actually, that would be fucking rad.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I'd like to see something like that, Dynasty Warriors cross Mario. That would be amazing.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
But, sadly, probably not going to happen.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Alright, DarkStalker, you have another story for us.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I do, and it's also about Amiibos.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Although, I really feel like extending the Mii because it's two eyes.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Amiibo!

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
But, apparently, there is going to be some talk, because third parties have shown interest in using the Amiibo technology.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And, they might be allowed to use them, to have them of their own.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Or, to be able to use them in their own franchises.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
What third party game? Sorry, somebody had to say it. Somebody had to say it.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
No, Sega would be the likely candidate, right?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Probably Sega. Maybe some Capcom?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I mean, I know that this doesn't mean that the third parties get to make Amiibos, but I could totally see where Nintendo would produce a Sonic Amiibo for Sega.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I mean, it's still a hugely popular character. Just none of his friends.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
If Mario was able to go into, say, Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric, or something like that, would he have extra long legs, too?

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Would they give him all lanky legs?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Except, I guess, Waluigi would be perfectly fine there.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Well, the quote from Damon Baker, who is the Nintendo of America licensing manager, says that they've been getting some creative ideas coming from third parties, and they're working on opportunities for next year.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Sorry, I can't hear you over my machine printing all that money.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when, you know, gaming was a little bit simple. You didn't need all this other stuff to attach to your game to get stuff.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
You just put in the game, insert cartridge, and play game. Hurray. It's the classic game of the week.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And, again, I find myself without the music, so I suddenly have made this the new song.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.000
It's for the classic game of the week. Oops. Hey, I got off a plane three hours ago. Give me a break.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
But not literally.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Figuratively got off a plane three hours ago. Although, that wasn't a lot. Yes.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Uh, I left the- I got you around 4-4. It's not quite 7-40 yet.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I literally am sick of this conversation. Alright. The classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Misuse of literally makes me figuratively insane. How about- I'm gonna come over there and bop you with this mic, and it'll hurt.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I'll throw up on you.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
These things are foam coated, it might not. What's the classic game of the week?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Star Wars trilogy arcade.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Cause I'm still going with the Sega model 3 theme.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000
You would pick a game that has the, uh, you know, March of Darth Vader in it, or what do they call it? The Death March?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
We just have to start with the very beginning, and then we can skip forward a little bit. But the 26 minute mark?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So yeah, you would pick this.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I remember this in the arcades when we were playing DDR.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Oh yeah, this game was awesome.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I wonder if James Earl Jones ever messes with people on the phone that call him.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I would.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I don't know, I'm just now imagining him saying, hello, this is Mufasa.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Tell us about the game!

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Fuck! Star Wars, shit!

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Um, okay. It came out in 1998. It's a 3D rail shooter that was based off of Star Wars.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And it had, uh, also, uh, it actually came out at the same time that these special editions did.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Um, it also came out with the Star Wars trilogy pinball game, so it was sort of like this big batch of Star Wars all at the same time.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And it was the second in Sega's Star Wars arcade series preceded by Star Wars arcade.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And, uh, followed by Star Wars Racer arcade that came out in 2000.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:40.000
So it basically has two, uh, big themes which are reenactments from the first, uh, three star, from the actual three Star Wars movies instead of the shit ones that didn't exist at the time.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Um, they have two missions each and a bonus battle, uh, against either Darth Vader or Boba Fett.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Um, the normal gameplay has you moving across here around and shooting shit.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And you have a special event button at certain points that will, uh, highlight and trigger different events on screen.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Uh, your first, uh, basically your, uh, first mission is, uh, the battle that you have in the X-Wing, uh, against the TIE Fighters.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And then, um, the second part is, uh, flying around the Death Star shooting, you know, Darth Vader's TIE Fighter.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And the third part is basically the trench run.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
So the Empire Strikes Back has the Hoth battle.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Um, the second part has, uh, the escape from Hoth and, uh, you know, shooting, you know, going around in the Millennium Falcon.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And the third part is in the hangar shooting, uh, snowtroopers and a wampa.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Poor wampas. They never asked for that.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And Return of the Jedi has you doing the speeder bike reenactment.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Then you, uh, move toward the base on Endor and the last one you have to, uh, basically just shoot down a walker.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
The game's very final mission has you as an X-Wing pilot to destroy the second Death Star.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It also has the bonus stages, like I said. One of them you use a lightsaber to def, uh, deflect Boba Fett's blaster shots.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And then the last one is versus Darth Vader on the second Death Star.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Really freaking good game, um, especially for its time.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000
It was really, I'd say, it threw back to having the old original Star Wars arcade, but it was just really fun.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And I still think that, you know, graphically and playwise it still holds up today.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So, that's the classic game.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Let's hear it for the Sega Model 3.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
It was also specifically on the Step 2.1 hardware.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Give us some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Dungeon Buster says, you could kill the wampas on Hoth, but you had the button mash like crazy, which with the joystick could look a little embarrassing.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
A friend of mine was really good at the game.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
YYR says, I have to say, Star Wars trilogy arcade bordered on really unfun when the difficulty was set to maximum.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
The game basically bends you over and takes your wallet. Other than that, awesome.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Well, yeah, if you have it on normal difficulty, though, it was super fun.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And yes, there was a lot of money spent on this machine by me.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
You don't say.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Like, I'm tired of playing DDR. I'm gonna go shoot some TIE Fighters.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Fair enough, fair enough. It was a fun game. It was really cool for the time, too.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:25.000
It just reminded me of something. Remember how we've been trying to get people to, you know, submit us, you know, stuff in the mailbag or, you know, the participate email?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Sure.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And how we were punishing them with music from the, uh, what was it?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I think...

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Paris' eyes just lit up like, please don't.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Oh my god.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I think that instead we should be punishing them with music from the Star Wars dance section of the game.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Oh, the Kinect Star Wars.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
The Kinect Star Wars music?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I don't remember the popular music, but we changed them to have Star Wars lyrics. Would be quite appropriate, I think, for punishments.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Uh, let's consider that maybe for a future week. I think that will be, we'll put that challenge out, uh, soon.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I'll be absent that day.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Alright.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
These aren't the droids you're looking for. Oh my god.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Alright, um, we're gonna take a break. Actually, remember the chatroom didn't really, like, hate the Kim Kardashian music.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
We were playing it on air, and we were like, it's actually not that bad.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Like, the Kim Kardashian game music is, it's kinda like, you know, it loops an awful lot, but it's not awful.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Masochist level low.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Alright, uh, we're gonna take a break, guys. When we come back, there's plenty more of Orange Dance Radio.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Rapid Fire News, the Fugu question of the week, which sadly was only the Facebook question of the week this week, that was my bad.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I'll explain why when we come back. Uh, and your emails that you may or may not have sent, and plenty more.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
We're gonna talk to Marissa about voice acting as well, let her expand a little bit on, so you want to be a voice actor.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Uh, so we'll talk a little bit about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 9th of 2014, with episode number 574 of our program.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:32.000
If you're just joining us here live at the Voice of the Geese Network at voggetnetwork.com, I am just back from BlizzCon, and I had the hilariously timed, uh, vacation where I was going to BlizzCon and going to be in LA, the same time that our dear friend of the show, Marissa, would be up here in Sacramento.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But we're fortunate that it didn't totally crisscross, so she's able to join us here tonight. So, hello again, Marissa.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Hello.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Now, earlier in the show we were talking about, um, that you, you were gonna tell a longer story, but I wanted to get right into the game news for some of our, you know, podcast people that, you know, I want my, I want my commentary, I want my Loki rant as soon as possible tonight, let's get to it.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:59.000
But now that we're a little deeper into the show, I thought, you know, I think there are a lot of people that might be curious, like, what do you go through to become a voice actor? How did you get down this path?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So, Marissa, how do I become a voice actor?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
As I said earlier, now we're gonna transition the show just completely off topic into Rob Marissa's giggle time.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
That's A-OK. I think some of our listeners would be A-OK with that.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Well, it's just one of those things that you can't even just talk about yourself, you know, like, hey, I do this because everybody has to know, you know, how do I do it?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And then it also explains, you know, what I've been doing, but, um, excuse me, that's a great moment to voice over right now.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That's all right. I always tell people hiccups are like the internet radio guy's, like, biggest enemy, so, you know, it happens.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Oh, yes, my allergies came up here.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Oh, yes. Welcome to Sacramento.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I was like, I don't have these down south. I got them up here, though.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That's okay. You're breathing in cancer living down there, so.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
That's true. Watch out for those sentient yellow clouds that follow you around.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Hey, I don't live in, um, that foggy place that we go up to on the five. That's different.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Anyway, anyway.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Um, uh, it's just something that I always want to do, and I was inspired.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I was actually studying to be an animator as a child, and then I watched behind the scenes, and they were showing the voice acting, and I've always been in love with the human voice.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It's just, it's such a versatile instrument, and, you know, animation combined with that, and then, you know, games.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I'm going to have to send you the bit from Mass Effect 3 where Trainer talks about wanting to lick Edie's voice.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
You ever had somebody tell you, I want to lick your voice.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I wish it was voice.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
If your voice had a body, I would lick it from head to toe.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Anyway, stop interrupting her. Stop interrupting her.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Sorry, sorry.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Uh, I guess, though, um, uh, it's interesting, like, thinking about it, because I know there are people most, every time, again, when you say this is what you're doing, people ask what to do to get ready to get into it.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It's funny, because the industry has changed so much with the internet, as so many industries have.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
But the one thing that stays consistent is that you still have to be the best.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I came back from a major convention that I was blessed to attend, and I'm lucky to live in a major hub.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But there's just so many opportunities, it's really easy to get caught up.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Not a lot of people know that the first, you know, the thing that most people make the bulk of their income on is commercial.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Because there's going to be, you know, thousands of commercials per one video game, per, you know, one piece of animation.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And there's a website, actually, called voicebank.net, and you can look up all of your favorite actors, their demos will be posted there.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Huh. David Hayters is pretty fun.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And if you want to talk about talent, I mean, it's always amazing to listen to, you know, all the different, like, you know, those types of leaps and bounds.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000
But when you listen to somebody within a constrained space, you know, like when they have to do, like, you know, Rob Paulson, he's your friendly Honda dealer.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You know, in addition to, you know, Pinky, when you listen to someone's commercial demo, and then you start to recognize them, it's fascinating to realize how much versatility they can demonstrate in a constrained space of, you know, being a regular guy.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Wait, so me being a regular guy, could I just upload what I think are good Rob Roberts voices to this voicebank.net, or?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Believe it or not though, what you said though, as being a regular guy, that is the style of advertising that you hear right now.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Well, we talk about this right now. Like, when we talk about the class, like, people don't want to hear that anymore. Our generation is too simple.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You know what happened to the wacky morning DJs? They all got replaced.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Yeah, no more morning zoo. You want some free t-shirt.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:38.000
So, yeah, though, they are obsessive about that when you, you know, take classes, listen to what you like to hear on television and radio.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Like, as a good friend of mine says, you know, find styles that you like, because it starts with emulating for a lot of people, but you have to learn to go out of that, because you listen to all your favorite, when you're talking about games and animation.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:35:02.000
When you listen to your favorite people, they will constantly tell you it is not about the voice, which confuses people, because these people, you know, like, Greg Berger and Rob Paulson and Tress McMeel, like, they can do such beautiful, beautiful and wildly, you know, versatile voices.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It's because if you can't act, it doesn't matter. You know, you still have to be underneath all of that. You have to be able to act first.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I remember seeing this guy come to our group. He had this beautiful, you know, like, Don LaFontaine type voice, but he didn't know how to connect with what he was reading, and that's what you have to learn to do.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:36.000
But now, thanks to the internet, I mean, you can, you know, with a microphone at home, you can, you're capable of pursuing a career at home. They make that sound way, you know, much easier than it actually is.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.000
It's not like that is, hey, kids, just get a computer and plug in and you could be a voiceover star. No, but it's given a lot more opportunities.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And you just, you know, like in any entertainment field, you have to be careful and focused because at the end of the day, the most competitive thing you have is to be the best.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.000
It's interesting because there's a lot of parallels there to podcasting and some things that are like completely opposite because, you know, any idiot with a microphone can podcast. Hey, how you doing?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Many of them shouldn't.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Well, no, you know.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Okay, okay. There are people who should, I think, think their ideas through a little more.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Yes, yes, that's exactly it.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:31.000
But a lot of this stuff about driven and really like striving to be the best and I think just kind of having that drive is so crucial because if you, like, if we didn't sound like we wanted to be here at Orange Lawn Radio, would we have people listening to us?

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Well, that's why it's called acting.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Well, not that I'm going to play any of this garbage coming out this week, but we have these fucking games coming out and this whole industry is a joke.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Which is true.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:05.000
On the other hand, though, it's really easy to replace, though, drive for the drive to be the best, you know, because, you know, you can go to all of the podcast conventions and you can obsess about your Facebook page, but, you know, you could completely lose track of being good at your podcasting.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
You know, that's what you have at the end of the day and, of course, the first step to that is, you know, honing your talent.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You can do that privately and here's the thing I always tell people, too, is that, you know, record at home and you can do that and it's pretty easy, you know, to do it nowadays or even on your phone.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And then, like, you know, continue to practice, but like a month later or two, you know, listen back on what you did.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And if you think you were fantastic, you're a bad actor.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
You're right. We are our own worst critics.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I always listen to O.L.R. and it's not that, like, I like the sound, I like to hear my own voice.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
In fact, that's actually, I'm not like, who is that nasally gay guy on that show?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
But, like, you know, it's a, I am my own worst critic, you know, and I will fix the problems.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Of course, but, you know, we're artists. We're all broken on the inside.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
But the thing being, though, if you're like, oh, I can do this crazy, I'm so great because I can do these voices.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Like, if you, if you listen to that a month later and you think that you're great, then you haven't grown.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Because right now I'm up here and I have a friend of mine who's a recording engineer and Lord knows that there's plenty of those in L.A.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
But he's a good friend of mine and I love working with him and I'm working on another demo.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And it'd be really easy to go, you know that thing I did? Shit, I'm good.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
But if you look back and you think that, it means you haven't grown.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Like, my friends go, aren't you beating yourself? I go, no, I know what to do now. I can do it better.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Act F in our chat room says, actually, it's about acting in games journalism. Anyway.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Slow clap for you, Act F. Slow clap for you. All right, look.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
So when you say practice, what does that mean? Should I, should I invent a character? Should I try to emulate something I've already seen?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Like, can I practice doing my Grover? Near, far, near, far.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Should I practice my own Grover for a while or should I come up with my own thing?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Well, you, like, if you were to just specifically do that, you would take your, like, a lot of funny and good character voices and characters have come from a bad impression of somebody else.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000
But it's true, though, like, not that that was bad. But no, like, some, like, they weren't able to do it correctly and it turned into another character.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000
But if you, let's just say you don't have an acting background, like, you would write down a little sheet and, you know, like, you know, it's like a, you would write it down like, like you would a gaming character, though.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Like, if you're doing RPG, you would write down your character and that's the way you remember it, too, because it's not a voice.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Everything that you love and the people that, that do what you love, it's, it's because they're all indistinct characters, not just funny voices, you know.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Although, I do have a funny story about Jim Cummings and I told this to him and it's so cute because I did a show with one of his, one of his kids and this girl kept saying, oh, you know, she was so sweet.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I just got a kick out of her, but she's like, my dad keeps embarrassing me. And I go, why? And she goes, he does voices.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And I was a 12-year-old, 14-year-old, like, voiceover geek and I don't know why this didn't occur to me, but all of a sudden her dad comes to pick her up at the cast party and it's Jim Cummings.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I'm like, oh, yeah. Like, her last name, I just, you know, and I told him the story and he laughed because it's true, he's talking about how, you know, your kids, you know, you're never cool to your kids.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
L.A. can be hilarious like that though.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
But their friends are like, come on, please do it. She's like, dad, don't, please. So he's delightful and wonderful as well.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So I know that voice is a great documentary. It's on Netflix right now.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Yes.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Yeah.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Jeff just talked about.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.000
It's also on, oh, the premiere that was so much fun. You're on the people that you love in the bathroom. And June Ferre, she's like this big and amazing.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Amazing, flawless goddess of the universe. I, oh my God, June Ferre.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I also recommend, of course.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Magic of the Spell, right? You've all played the DuckTales game, Magic of the Spell, June Ferre.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That's true.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
No, no, don't even, you have to go further than that. Rocket Jay Squirrel.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Fair enough.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Yeah, Natasha. Also, you know, Rob Paulson's podcast is amazing talking tunes and on Netflix.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
It is still weird hearing him as Donatello, just saying.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And on Netflix, it's funny because for me and a lot of people get a kick out of seeing it, you know, in a fictional like narrative form in a world.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And I still need, I still want to watch that.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
The trailer for that was.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yeah.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Yeah, that's the movie where the idea is that people are volleying to be the next Don LaFontaine.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Let me ask you before we get back into gaming news, because I do have to get back to that channel.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Let me ask you one more question here, and that would be specifically about, you know, practicing.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
And here's one common practice. You know that Twitch TV is a thing, right?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know Twitch TV and the people who are playing the video games on it.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
This is something I see on Twitch TV all the time.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And that is people are playing role playing games and they decide they're going to act out the dialogue text that's on the screen.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And they like to read it, you know, you spoonie bard. And they just, they do all these like weird voices that don't even sound.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Would you encourage that sort of behavior or like, stop, stop, enough, enough.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Depends on whether you're in public or not.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Well, Twitch, Twitch is pretty public.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It just, you know what, you can be as silly as you want, as long as it's not, as long as you believe what they're saying, you know.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:24.000
And that's a lot of people's method of practice. Of course, you still have to be able to, again, deal with the natural voices.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
You know, like the commercials. I can't stand it right now, especially as a woman.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You'll turn on the TV and it's like, hey, come on down to Guitar Center, like you can or you won't, like whatever.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Like, advertising is fantasy. Like, you'd think you'd want to hear beautiful voices.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But, you know what, I was wondering too, I was like, why did they use this voice so often?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Because I've gotten into the world too, but I'm like...

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Hey, you know, sometimes you get that not so fresh feeling.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Yeah.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
So, that's why there's like, you know, Kotex.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Get some fucking Tampax.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Just like, find it at the grocery store, okay?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
You know what though, maybe the reason they use that ad is because like, especially that Guitar Center ad is like, she doesn't sound like she knows anything about guitar.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
She doesn't sound enthusiastic about the store, but she kind of sounds like...

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
She's the bored girlfriend.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
No, the groupie that, you know, you might want to get with.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And she kind of sounds like that bass player.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
The vocal fry.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
YYR says, shit, I need to go to Guitar Center right now.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
She sounds like the one character on Saturday Night Live that kept one-upping everybody.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Oh, the Kristen Wiig character. You know that one, the one that would always, she'd one-up everybody with their story.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Like, you know, yeah, what Alan perked up, what is it? You know this.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You know that character though.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
It's like, I gave birth to five baby cows.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Yeah, you know, I did that one thing.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Baby arm thing.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Like, you know, I'm Prince of Tom Cruise, we're really close, yeah.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah, just be as silly as you want, as long as though you do have to make sure that you are acting and in the moment.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And there's lots of different theories about that.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Like, a lot of people don't have any acting background, but they understand music.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
But either way, you have to, you know, understand a character, understand how having to get in a character and things like that.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I think if Rob and Marissa ever do a Giggle show, I think we should consider doing a Twitch stream where we act out role-playing games.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Completely inappropriate voices, I think would be, you know, yeah, you spoonie bard.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Just play games with dialogue in them, but turn the voice volume down and just make up the voices for them.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Some people though, like, they've got publicity for themselves.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I mean, a lot of people that, and through successful YouTube videos, but I mean, you know the same thing.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
They'll be like, all you need is a microphone.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
All you need is a camera, get yourself on YouTube and you'll be famous.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
No, but you know, you know what I mean.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Like, Melger Solid 5.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Well, I just can't wait for the show because now I'm imagining we might be playing Mass Effect and it's like, you know,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Hey you guys, my name's Garrus and I got to go do some calibrations.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Oh my, who wants a free bubble sticker?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
All right.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'd watch that.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
All right. Marissa, it's always so lovely to talk to you and I wish you lived up here.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I do, but I understand you get it. You got to be where your industry is and best of luck with all that.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And I hope that next time we have you back on the show, you, you are having this huge list of games and anime to promote.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Cause I know you, I know you could do it.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
You can go to my site, listen to my demo. You can feel the embarrassment.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
You know, we do, we, believe it or not, we have industry people listen to this show.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
So you never know where, where's your demo, where people can hear it.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Marissa Meisel.com. It's M E I Z E L.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Okay.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I'll answer to Meisel, but this smells like crack.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Oh yeah. We have pumpkin pie. Uh, we're distracted now.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Thank you so much.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I'll let you ladies get to your pie and we'll get to rapid fire news. Loki.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
All right. I'll just talk about pie.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Sorry. SSG 100 Matt in chat says, Oh, it's Wolfman Jack. And this is my favorite spot on the Citadel.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
All right. Anyway.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com use the passphrase crowd.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Loki. Uh, all right. Uh, well, they talked a little bit about, um, the instant game collection for PlayStation network.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Um, these are going to be the brand new games.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:17.000
You're going to be able to check out, um, if you're a member of PlayStation plus and because, because, uh, drive club PlayStation plus edition has been kind of delayed for a while now.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Our first retail game coming to the, um, instant game collection for PlayStation forest in justice, gods among us, the ultimate edition, which is cool because I've not played that game.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Yeah. I already own it cause I bought it in a mega sale, but I cool that we're taking this step. I can't really be that mad.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Um, they're also going to have, I guess the standalone infamous, uh, second son expansion, infamous first light.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Um, so if that's free, that'd be pretty cool because yeah, that's, that'll be interesting. Yeah. And I'm also a secret ponchos and the swapper.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I'm sorry. First light and the swapper are going to be for January. Whereas the other two work for December.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I forgot that they put in both months there. Um, see, I didn't see what they had on. Oh, that's only PlayStation four.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:14.000
So I don't know what they're going to have for PlayStation three yet, but, um, maybe injustice for PlayStation three.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It makes sense. So that'd be kind of cool. Um, all right. And then, uh, see here, this is kind of cool.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Grand theft auto five and you know, they are going to be having the HD remake coming out here in just over a week.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Not that you're counting down or anything. I don't do the counting down the, my, uh, pre-order does the counting down for me.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Uh, anyways, so they're going to be having that come out and, um, to go along with that, they're actually going to be putting out the, um, soundtrack for the game on vinyl as well as the CD.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Um, that's pretty amazing. That's going to be on vinyl now only listen to vinyl and hipsters were a part of the game.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So, um, it, I guess it's going to include 59 tracks from the game. Um, it's too bad though that they're not actually going to be having, uh, the full soundtrack, which they're going to be including.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Cause they're adding like 150 some songs, I think into, um, the HD five version of the game.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:32.000
So I don't know. I'm very interested to play that. Can't wait. Um, but yeah, three CD soundtrack or six, six record vinyl, uh, collection they're going to have there.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Wow. And uh, how much is that going to cost me? No idea. Probably not going to buy the vinyl cause I obviously don't have any record.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Wait, I do still have a record player. Yeah. You know what, if hipsters really wanted to do it right, they'd bring back the eight track.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I mean like a million eight tracks. So just to, you know, true, true. Um, and then last but not least, um, you know, this must be exciting news if you're a fan of Pikmin, but guess what?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:16.000
You know, instead of working on say something like, I don't know, a new F zero game, they're going to take, you know, Pikmin three, which was kind of okay, but they're going to make a Pikmin four.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Um, you know, they're working on games. This is continually launching campaigns after release of software will lay the groundwork for the next iteration of Pikmin in the future.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And needless to say, uh, we want it to be one of those motivations for potential consumers to purchase a Wii U. We are making a very, or making very, a variety of different efforts.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I don't think the Wii U, I don't think Pikmin's ever going to be a reason why people purchase the Wii U. I mean, it's, I mean, I think it's, it's more one of those things where it's like it helps bolster it up.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:06.000
It's a nice, it's a nice thing to have in the pocket. There are definitely a lot of Pikmin fans out there. Maybe we don't have any hardcore Pikmin people, but I know people that really enjoy the series and so forth, but it doesn't seem like the type of like system seller that Mario or Zelda or even Bayonetta is, you know?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Um, and to go along with that, Pikmin 3 is also getting a demo, which I'm surprised they didn't have a demo for that yet, but now that's a great idea. Gonna put one out.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Um, but seriously though, focusing on Pikmin 4 and you haven't even brought F-Zero out yet. I mean, I would think F-Zero would be more of a system seller than say Pikmin.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Depending on what the whole like, you know, how many resources they're having to pour into it, what they're having to pull from other projects, like it's kind of like one of those, you know, I realize there's enough Pikmin fans out there.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I'm cool if they want to go down that road and explore Pikmin 4 as long as like it's not coming at the cost of, you know, my dream F-Zero game or hell Animal Crossing Wii U, which I think we all anticipate will be the next big thing they announce at E3 or, you know, whatever.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:09.000
So, well, they haven't really announced anything beyond, I mean, they've announced a few things for like 2015, but maybe that could be something that takes place in the second quarter because they haven't really said, you know, I know they have for the first part of the year they've got, what was it, um, Splatoon, but, and I assume Zelda's fourth quarter, so beyond that.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I know what you're saying, but I keep hearing Splatoon and thinking of my old uncle Roy.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Very different, very different.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I know.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Alright, I got a few stories for you guys. First off, Duke Nukem 3D, the Megaton edition, it is coming to the Vita and the PlayStation 3. I actually didn't know that this was being planned, but if you somehow still haven't experienced Duke Nukem 3D, you know, the good one, then come and get some on the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Devolver Digital did announce that on Twitter, January 13th, 2015, and in Europe the next day. I guess this was announced way back in August of 2013, I just somehow forgot, because, you know, I've been happy with my Steam version.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
So, uh...

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
You know, I still haven't played the Steam version even though I bought it. What's...

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Shocking that I bought something on Steam that I have not played.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I think you should make a note. I think we should, I think we should battle each other this week and stream it or something. That would be fun.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Come on, Loki, an old school battle.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I wouldn't be willing to do that.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Well, God, it's been so long. I used to play the exclusively just keyboard, so I would use like the arrow keys or whatever it was to look around. I would never use the mouse.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Well, if you are interested in buying somebody's garbage, you can do so. The ET game cartridges that were in the New Mexico desert are now available on eBay.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
And I think, I remember we talked about this, like they were going to be going to eBay or something. We just brought this up like the last week, so that's why we're putting this in rapid fire news tonight.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:41.000
But they are out there on eBay, and if you want to know how much these are getting, there's one up on eBay for $500.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I could just take a crap on one of mine and put it on eBay.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
These cartridges are not guaranteed to work, just so you know.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Oh, well, then it sounds like a DT.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000
They have been in a dump for 25 years or so, so yeah. There are other games available, by the way.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
When I see a game like Sword Quest is available, I'm kind of like, well, that's kind of cool.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I don't know, there's a part of me that's like, oh god, the big video game fan that I am should own a piece of gaming history like that.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
But then I'm like, that is fucking garbage. What would I do with a piece of garbage? Can you even hang it on the wall?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Like, look at this garbage I have up on the wall.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Shadow boxes.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:27.000
You could have the arcade, you could have the Atari shit pile shadow box.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
You could just buy a copy of ET, hit it with a hammer, and put it in a shadow box. It would be just the same.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I don't know, so, you know what, there's people that are into this and collecting this, and don't let our little cynicism get you down.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
If this is a piece of gaming history you want to own, then more power to you.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Where's my HD remake?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Of ET?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Yeah.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Maybe when they release ET2, Electric Boogaloo.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Anyhow, Luigi's Mansion. Remember that series? Luigi's Mansion is going to be getting an arcade game.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Here's the funny thing, it's made by Capcom, developed by Capcom.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
The arcade version was being actually tested about a week ago, October 30th to November 3rd.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
But now the arcade game will be coming out.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
The arcade game is based on Luigi's Mansion 2 that was on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's only playable in a first person perspective, but Luigi does appear in cut scenes, so it's not like you're never going to get to see him.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
So, that's pretty cool.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Summer 2015 is when the game is set to be released in Japan.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Is it like a shooter? Is it like an on-rails shooter or something like that?

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
No, it's Luigi's Mansion.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Sounds like it's along the lines of the, maybe like the gun survivor games.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
You think?

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Perhaps. I'm trying to see if it says anything here.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Gloomy Mansion is a stage that's in the game.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
You get an in-game tutorial from Elvin Gadd.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And there's a Poltergust shaped controller which sucks in ghosts if you shake it.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And then there's a start button and a bomb button.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
It sounds very similar to how the game on 3DS controls.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Well, I know something better than that.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:06.000
There's going to be the Golden Age of Arcade Gaming on the Nintendo 3DS by Sega.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Basically we're getting a new batch of Sega 3D classics that are going to be the best of them.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:21.000
There will be the 3D Fantasy Zone 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Oh, and also After Burner 2 is going to be in early 2015.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
But I don't care about any of the rest of them because Fantasy Zone.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And I'm sure Dan's going to be happy about having Outrun.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
But Fantasy Zone is really the best Sega game in the universe.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And that and Space Harrier.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
When I read that earlier this week, I was like, oh, Jamie is going to have some heavy breathing on OLR this week.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I'm screaming internally.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You know that cat picture with heavy breathing?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
I know. I might need new pants.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
YYR in chat says, OMG, really? Is this happening?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
This is happening. This shit's going down.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Jamie's going to be a happy, happy bunny.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Also, we can finally kill our Sims in the pool.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Yay, Sims 4 has pools.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You can drown your Sims, which is the best thing ever.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I want to make the best ghost house ever once I get Sims 4.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
There need to be more mods for it.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Can I make a family and call them the sorrows so I can drown my sorrows?

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I'm going to just have two characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and they're going to be dead.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Like the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
You all got problems.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
You know what? I only have one problem. It's named Rob.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
It's a problem.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
You had 99 problems, but a Rob ate one.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
No, Rob's actually included in problem.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
You can't have a problem without Rob.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I would love to see a psychological study on your mental health compared to what you do to your Sims.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:01.000
You know, when you start writing that paper, I will give you something to write about.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I was always disappointed in the Sims that you couldn't put a diving board on the second floor of a house

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
so they would be able to dive into the pool that way.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
You can, but it has to have the pool as an interactive thing.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But you can actually, there's a code to make items clip and put them anywhere.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So you can put a diving board on the second story and have someone jump off of it.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:30.000
ActDeft is referencing a years old meme in our chatroom by putting in all caps, pools opened.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I'm having flashbacks to those theme park games and doing sadistic things in those games.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Like half finished roller coasters.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
You mean the hell coaster?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Like Final Destination 3 reenactments.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
What was that one ride? Was it like there was the one that was really long? Mr. Bones something?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
It's been so long since those games.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I think it was Mr. Bones Wild Riders.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I just remember the one where then you could ride the ride yourself.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
In like the first, remember when like virtual reality.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Oh yeah.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
They had this roller coaster. They had like a one where you could build the roller coaster and ride it.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
That was the Disney one because I remember getting that one.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Because I always, you know, they wanted me to use the chain drive to go up and I was just like,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I'm just going to have it go in a corkscrew and I'm just going to have accelerators the entire way up.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
And kill people with G-forces that way.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000
SSJ 100 Matt says, have a family called the Gatsby's and have the game end without them all dead in the pool.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Alright. Anything else Star Saga?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Spoilers for an old book.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Look, Nintendo has confirmed that Splatoon will have a single player mode.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
They have a trailer out for it now.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
But yeah, you can be single player.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So if you only like playing with yourself, you can play with yourself all night.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I love playing with myself.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I don't have any friends.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Single player mode is going to be great for me.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
At least it's single player and not single handed.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
People are not always available to play Splatoon at my beck and call.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Marissa, do you plan on playing Splatoon by yourself?

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
What did you ask me about?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
The Splatoon was the end result.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I'm asking you about your love.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000
You're not supposed to have an interest in these activities. I'm a female.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Am I what by myself?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Even females can love the Wii U.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Everyone eventually goes Splatoon.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
What about you? What's the name of the game?

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Myself.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I've had too much soda. I'm sorry.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Where we ask our listeners...

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Well then what are we going to do?

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Giggle time!

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
No, we're definitely doing the foogle question of the week.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
So here's the thing.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I might have screwed up.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
So you all know Loki produced tonight's show.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Which, by the way, Loki has done a fine job with tonight's show.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Yeah, it was very last minute.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Well that's okay. All the shows usually are.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Wink.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
But here's the thing.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000
So Loki did tonight's show, but Loki actually didn't have admin access on the Google Plus community.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Because I had no idea that Loki was actually on Google Plus.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
So I never gave it to him.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
So he did have admin access to the Facebook community.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So I apologize to our Google Plus people.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
The foogle question only went to Facebook.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:27.000
But usually the foogle question of the week is where our Facebook and Google Plus communities come together to answer a question that we ask of our listeners.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
And asking this week...

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:37.000
With so many releases coming out this holiday season, what is a game you think people might overlook and really should be playing?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
This is a good question. Good job, Loki.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
What are people going to forget about?

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
There's a lot of things you can forget about.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
There's like 50,000 games coming out over the next month or so.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
What's the one that's going to get swept away that people need to not forget about?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I think that's a great question.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
So Alan starts us off. Alan Alchemy is saying,

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I keep hearing about this little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition that might be a sleeper hit if enough people gave it word of mouth.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000
In all seriousness, I keep hearing about fantasy life on Tumblr from everywhere.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
It's like a cross of Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, I guess.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And a ton of people don't really know about it.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I've heard of this from some of my fellow podcasters that are really into the Nintendo games.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
But I haven't checked this out myself.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
But that's a great example of one that might be getting lost right now.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
A little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I doubt anybody's going to be playing that.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Oh, shut up. Everyone's going to be playing it and shipping everybody with everybody.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Because that's what we do in BioWare games.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
We ship.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
HypnoToad replies and says,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Final Fantasy VI. Play it. Live it. Love it. So says HypnoToad.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
See, here's the thing though. Its release is coming out this holiday season.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Not holiday season 20 years ago.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
It could be the mobile release because that just came out not that long ago.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
It could be that.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
But it is a classic. Why not?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Didn't they just put, was VI one of the ones they added on Steam?

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Not on Steam yet.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
But I don't see why it wouldn't happen.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
But V has to happen first.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
So we'll see.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Oh, I guess it doesn't have to. They can do whatever the hell they want, really.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I would say HypnoToad's answer really amounts to,

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Screw the new stuff. Go play a classic.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I think that's kind of what I'm hearing in that answer.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
ActDeaf replied and said,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
The levels on Super Mario 3D World are really fun and get really challenging towards the end.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Though I expect many to just dismiss this title because it's more of the same in the price.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But I'm looking forward to it and playing it this holiday season.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
You know, I gotta say that Nintendo Direct thing that they showed for Captain Toad's Treasure Tractor.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Say it four times fast.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Treasure Tractor.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
That would be awesome.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
It's just a Mario version of, like, Farming Simulator.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
God, you know what? I would totally play that if it was Farming Simulator.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Right? Mario Goes Farming? That'd be great. Yeehaw.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Anyway, seeing the Nintendo Direct and seeing really how varied a lot of it looks,

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I was like, alright, maybe I'm one of those people that's writing this game off and not really giving it a fair shot.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
So, good example.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Of course, if you're a Wii U owner only, you know, that's one of the three games you have to buy this holiday.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Serpingslurpy says, I don't have enough time to play the games I already have, let alone those that are coming out.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
But one game that hasn't been receiving a lot of attention is The Forest.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Think survival horror meets Minecraft.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I think I've heard of that once, but I haven't seen much on it.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I came super close to buying it, but then I was like, no.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.000
AZHP says, with the PlayStation TV out, it's a great time to play games you might have missed with a low investment PSTV at $99.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:48.000
It's $100 less than Evita, and you can play great games like Persona 4 Golden and Super Danganronpa 1 and 2.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
PS, shoutouts to Jonas for taking second place at the US Pump Festival yesterday.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Freestyle is dead, long live Freestyle.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I heard actually that Jonas, I don't mind you derailing that, because thank you for the reminder.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I had read a tweet from Jonas that he did very well in that Pump It Up competition.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
He won second place. National.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
It's amazing.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
So, where's my video? Pics or it didn't happen.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I want one of whatever Alan made.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Yeah, they're cooling right now. He made some cookies is what he made.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
They're chocolate peppermint cookies.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
So anyway, less cookies, more video games.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Crylo responded and said, I agree with Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Super excited and it looks like so much fun.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
How about here in studio? I'll just open Mike, whoever wants to answer.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Any games coming out this holiday that you're afraid people might miss?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
No.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
That's tough, because...

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Go outside and play.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Um...

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Gosh, I don't know. I mean, there's...

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
It would probably have to be an indie title, because I'm kind of familiar with a lot of the stuff.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Yeah, that's where I'm kind of like, I'm like, I feel like there's that indie title I haven't played yet.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
You know, ironically, I think The Crew.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I think a lot of people aren't going to be really paying attention to that, because...

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But it looks like an interesting driving game.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Um...

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Gosh, I don't know. Dragon Age Inquisition, I keep forgetting, is coming out.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Um, so I may look at that.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Maybe there was some truth to Alan's answer there.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Seriously, I mean, I keep forgetting that that game is coming out.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
If you're on Tumblr, you will never be allowed to forget.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Um, I've never played Dragon Age, although I have...

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
What is it? Origins, I think, on...

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Origin, so...

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
To be fair, Jamie, if you're on Tumblr, there are a lot of things you're not allowed to forget.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Oh, I'm not on Tumblr, so...

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
So I guess that's...

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Probably all the better for you.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
It's a scary place.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I don't know. Straight white men are not allowed on Tumblr.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Is that, like, is that one of the questions that you have to answer when you sign up for Tumblr?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Are you straight white male?

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Are you, like, are you...

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It's all checker privilege. Sorry, nope.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Are you a straight white cis male? Do you need a bodyguard?

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Check here for privilege. No, alright.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Ah, we kid, we kid, we kid. Alright.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Uh, let's...

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Let's get to some more stories. Loki.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Alright.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Um, let's see.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Let's talk a little bit about Tony Hawk.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Yes, Tony Hawk. Who's that guy? I mean...

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
You mean he's relevant?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
He is, nowadays, I guess.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Or he's coming back.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
You know, because he did do a mobile game.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
You may remember. I was kind of disappointed that it wasn't a console game.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
But, apparently Activision is getting desperate for a Tony Hawk game.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Because they haven't had one for several years now.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
So Tony Hawk will be making a comeback.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Or at least they're going to have another game come out in 2015.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Please, please Activision.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:44.000
No games that require some sort of weird looking, you know, snowboard-like controller.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Because that was stupid. Please don't do that.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Just make a Tony Hawk game.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And I totally played a new Tony Hawk game.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I'm sorry, cookies.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I like the pro skater games.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And Skate 3, though, I do want to try Skate 3 even though that is not a Tony Hawk game.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Because the glitches look so awesome.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
You know, it's been on a break for a little bit.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
So, why not?

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Like, I even think it's time to try another Guitar Hero.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Why not?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I want a new DJ Hero.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I want a new DJ Hero.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Me too.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
So, I want a new DJ Hero.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I need to play DJ Hero.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I've got the controller.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I was even looking at it the other day.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I'm like, ooh, I still have DJ Hero.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yeah.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Anyhow, unfortunately you can't play DJ Hero on your PlayStation 4.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Which is why we need a new DJ Hero.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
But PlayStation 4, as you know, there was some dramas with the firmware that came out.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Meaning you couldn't put your PlayStation in rest mode.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Well, here is patch 2.01 to save the day.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:43.000
2.01 addresses issues some users have encountered when powering on the system from rest mode.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Now, I didn't hear if this actually released or not.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
But I thought I'm hearing it did in Europe.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
It has.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It has here.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Because I updated when I got my system back.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
And it does work.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Yay.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Because I liked rest mode.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Because that's how you charge your controller when you're not playing.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Yep.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
So, alright.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Good to know that's back.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
And using the charge controller and using it to download Call of Duty.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Because it was like 40-some gigs.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Speaking of updates, Xbox One is getting their last update of the year.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
And it just started rolling out.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.000
And this is where you can now customize the background image for each account's dashboard on the console.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I guess similar-esque to PlayStation 4 themes.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:27.000
You can also have locations and bios and six game clips or achievements that you would like to share on your profile.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
These are the six most meaningful.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
This is the teabagging moment that really meant a lot to me.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
So, you can do that on.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I called some guy an asshole online and didn't get banned.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000
So, also there's some marketplace tweaks to help make it, you know, more navigatable.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Also, there's a trending tab in one guide that shows the 20 shows that are most popular with the general Xbox audience.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Probably Walking Dead, Walking Dead, and Walking Dead.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Within reason.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I get a feeling Downton Abbey probably won't be making the list.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Just call it a hunch.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Call it a hunch.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Barefoot Contessa on the Food Network.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Don't think she's gonna be in the top 20.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
All my children? Probably not.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
What?

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Because it's walking-

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
She makes delicious food!

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
How can you hate delicious food?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
You can't hate delicious food.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
You can't eat the delicious food.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I guess that's where the anger could come from.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
How dare I? How dare I?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Is that Rob you were saying something? Because there's cookies.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I'm in a cookie coma over here.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
You know what? Barefoot Alan Alchemy just made you all cookies.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Yeah.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
So enjoy it.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Bye, Alan!

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Alright.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Anyhow, if you want to see more, Major Nelson did a little tour that you can look up on YouTube and get everything detailed.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
But honestly, if you're an Xbox One owner, you probably already grabbed it, and I don't blame you.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Hey, Dark Sakura is going to take a break from cookie eating and dive into the mailbag and find some emails that our listeners have sent us this week.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
These are not treated like this.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Or she'll make Marissa read them in a silly voice.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Oh, I know, man.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I'm going to put her on the spot.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I read them in a silly voice.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Alright.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
It is the mailbag.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Participate at orangelawnsready.com if you would like to participate with a future mailbag segment.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I'm going to try to be the guitar center lady.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Alright.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It's probably been, probably a week late to ask, but I was wondering, are there any horror games that would have made good haunted house slash maze attractions?

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
No, I'm going to do one in one place.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
You became a Gen-Xer.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Huh?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
You became a Gen-Xer.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:38.000
They do usually prefer to keep the lines moving, so I doubt one could watch monitors in a room for ten minutes or find picture fragments in a seemingly endless maze of hallways.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
This one's from Robert M.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Wait.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I'm actually going to be, um, I'm not too big on many of the haunted house ones myself.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I'm going to be playing Five Nights at Freddy's soon.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Wait, so we're talking about what game should become a haunted house?

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Like the Silent Hill thing?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Like the Silent Hill thing?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Okay, okay.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I just want to make sure I understood the question.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Well, they did one just recently, I think this year, for The Evil Within.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
So they did one for that.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
It's like a promo thing.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Makes sense.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Um, they may have done one in the past for Resident Evil, I guess.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I can see that.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
That would make a really good one.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Thief, Deadly Shadows, The Cradle.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
That's my vote.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.000
No, seriously though, if you haven't played anything in the game, that's one of the scariest levels I've ever played in the game, ever.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
The Cradle.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
And then one day I played it, and no one was at home.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
The dark was raining.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And my friend came home and was like, are you okay?

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Yes.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
I was playing The Cradle of the Dark.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I was like, I told you not to do that.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
You know what would be cool though, is if they took the PT.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:44.000
And then did that sort of like, a whole house like that and have monitors on the various levels.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
You have to track the ghost.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Or they just do the Silent Hills trailer and just recreate that like, fuck, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I'm gonna go with what was already said, Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Come on.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
That is, somebody's got a nightmare.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
That is a movie franchise waiting to happen.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
That's all of my childhood nightmares.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
That guy's gonna make some bank.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
That guy's gonna make bank.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000
It's not gonna be like Minecraft Bank, but it's gonna be like the next big anything.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Let me put it this way.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000
There's so many cult horror movies out there nowadays, somebody's gonna license it.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
They've run out of ideas.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
They made a goddamn Ouija movie.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Yeah, they did one of those before it was called The Exorcist.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
They did one before that, it was called Witch Board.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
They're attorneys writing up the agreement.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Actually, The Exorcist came out before Witch Board.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
This is a great case, by the way.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Actually, you have a Ouija board case for, what is that?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
My Ouija wallet.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Oh, your Ouija wallet?

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000
So she can be thrifty and contact the dead.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Should I buy that bag?

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Y-E-S-S-A-L-E question mark.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Maybe I can find a spirit with better credit than me.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Are you Steve Jobs?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
N-O-J-K.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
How about Yaris?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Mommy needs an ointment.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Yaris, only the remake would be scary.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I'm just kidding.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Alright, we've thrown ideas out there.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Next email.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Hello, LR.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Oh, oh, sorry.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Chat, chatter.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
What?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Alan alchemy.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Amnesia.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Nope.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Nope.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Nope.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
My favorite let's play of that game is where the guy starts the game and in 15 seconds,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
something starts coming down the hall and he goes, nope, nope, and he turns it off.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
What was that?

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
That's the other one that they have, the other survival game that's on PlayStation 4

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
or whatever.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Oh, with the old penis that's in it.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Yes, old penis.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Outlast?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Outlast, yeah.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I like being on the outside of this conversation.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Where Rob's just jerking off some air.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Marissa, that old penis, you know what I'm talking about?

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Hello, LR.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Oh, hi.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I just wanted to say thank you for the really nice retrospective.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
And reminisce, that was episode 573.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Do you ever still go to that parking lot diner?

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
No.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Not that one.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Not that one.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Not that one.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
But other ones in the franchise.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Yes.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
There's more often the one in Rancho.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Yeah.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
In the Cho.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Me too.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
In the Cho.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
That's what Dan calls it.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I'm not even from here and I know that you all call it Rancho Cambodia.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Margaret Rancho Cordova.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.000
No, from the days of working at the Funko Lantern GameStop turned Radio Shack, they

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
called it the Cho.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Got it.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Anyway, it reminded me of many a day spent waiting in coin lines to play DDR Max 2 and

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
then Extreme.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.000
All of us slowly working our way through DDR's content while actually forming meaningful

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
relationships and groups.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I would have to say that my favorite old school DDR license was so deep from DDR Max.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
So deep.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
With my runner up being every other license from DDR Max.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Well, my favorite non-license was definitely Insertion from Fifth Mix.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
You also said insertion.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Insertion.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I'm just saying, if we're going for every possible euphemism.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
There was a song in DDR called Insertion and it even had this, if you listen very carefully,

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
there's a point where it goes, ah.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Like, it's part of the song.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Herders.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
And I go, was that the insertion?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I don't know.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Anyway.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I personally still play In the Groove 2 at least one to two times a week as my only exercise

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000
and folks in the community are still creating new charts all over the difficulty scale.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Times definitely have changed, even on weekends.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I generally don't have to wait in line and I'm usually the only person on the machine

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
at the overpriced, under-populated local stomping ground.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
But hey, at least I still have one.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Strangely enough, in a, I'm going to mispronounce this, Nanuet, New York, close to the semi-famous

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
and fairly enormous Palisades Center Mall, a New Yorkade is opening on Saturday, November

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
15th, called Nanuet Arcade, which will feature stepping games, among other things.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Will it have Spider Stomp?

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
It's not complete without Spider Stomp.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
I hope the owner has gobs of money and isn't afraid to lose them, but I digress.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I did want to remind folks of something.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
For many of us lucky enough to be located in several pockets around the US, Bimani is

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
still very much alive and well.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Thanks to both the ingenuity of the community and Konami's indifference, it is possible

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000
to play current or recent versions of Bimani titles, such as DDR 2014, 2DX22 Pendual,

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Pop Up Music's Sunny Park, and more, plus to utilize the network features of the games

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.000
using actual Konami EMU cards, which I have one, purchasable either online or at the same

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
arcades that have the games.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I got mine at Classic Gaming Expo a couple weeks ago.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I mean, years ago.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I want to say weeks.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Some locations include Game Underground in the Boston area, a new Chinatown fair in New

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000
York City, 8 on the Break in, I'm going to mispronounce this too, Dunellen, New Jersey,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas, Press Start in Las Vegas in Super Arcade, as well as several

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Goughland locations in California.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.000
The new Nanowet Arcade I mentioned earlier will also be joining this list when it opens.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Further, a few of these locations still host yearly tournaments, such as Champions of the

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Coast at 8 on the Break, and Best of the West at Sunnyvale Goughland, both of which feature

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
simultaneous competitions on almost every music game they have, and there are many.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I just wanted to throw out there that I believe it would be truly awesome for OLR to record

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.000
a segment at Best of the West next year, which will likely be in August 2015.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
So yes, in closing, I just wanted to say that not all of us are done with music gaming.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I would go so far as to say I still spend about as much time playing music games as

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I do everything else, and that's unlikely to change.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
We drink Ritalin.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Aaron, why YR?

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
But I am still a huge fan of music games.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I mean, maybe I don't obsess about Bomani so much, but any time Konami releases a game

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:15.000
on iOS, I check it out, even though I know I'm gonna be like, hmm, whatever.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
But I love music games still.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
All they have to do is release anything as an actual retail release, and I'd buy it.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I just bought Hatsune Miku not that long ago on PlayStation 3 because it was on sale, and

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I really wanted to check it out.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
It's a great Dreamcast game for my PS3.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
There's still lots of music games today I really do enjoy, so I just want to make sure

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
that's a genre I'm always gonna love.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000
And I wish they would make a new rock band, dammit!

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Even Marisa's nodding her head over there.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I have all my instruments in my garage.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I'm for that too, and I liked the latest Rocksmith.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I mean, that's with an instrument, but I love Oasis.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
My friends are teasing me like, you know how to play the songs for real?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
I'm like, yeah!

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Maybe I should go to Guitar Center and pick up a guitar.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Guitar, yeah.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I was like, but I can play it in a game!

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
This next email I sort of thought about whether or not to read it.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Rob, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
No, because I thought those were the only two emails we had.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Oh, that's right. We had two more.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
One of them is, I will go ahead and just put this out.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Sure.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
We have a listener who, just to rephrase this,

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:28.000
has a Wii U that is having trouble reading disc and he created a GoFundMe.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
And asks the community for assistance.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Yeah, I'm of two minds about it because there are some of us who are,

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
you know, we go out and buy our own things when they're broken.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Right.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
But some people may not be able to afford it.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Yeah.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I don't know if you're in that situation.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Buy a replacement disc drive.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000
You know what, I'm going to say, because we haven't had this situation before,

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I'm going to read this one, but let's not open the floodgates to more of these.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Absolutely not.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
But since this guy thought of it first, go ahead and read it

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
and I'll let everybody make their own decision,

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
because he'll have the pitch on the GoFundMe page.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Okay.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Go ahead.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Basically saying, over the next few months,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
my Wii U has occasionally had trouble reading discs.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Now I won't read them at all.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I tried Nintendo's lens cleaning kit as well as several home remedies,

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
but nothing worked.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.000
When I called customer service, they told me the disc drive would have to be replaced,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.000
which would cost about $150 including shipping, which I can't afford.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000
So with several other upcoming non-gaming expenses,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I thought I would have a go without a Wii U for the foreseeable future,

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
but a friend suggested I try crowdfunding.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
What better place to start, I thought, than the OLR community.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.000
So I will go ahead and give you a plug on this one.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
You will probably be the one and only that we do this for.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Mm-hmm.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.000
But it's GoFundMe.com slash H1065K.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
And then ended saying, thank you in advance for your time and kindness,

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
and thanks especially to you, Dark Soccer Sky and Loki,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.000
for informing and entertaining me for most of the past decade.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Sincerely, Justin Masterclaw.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
P.S. If my goal is met within the week, I might be able to give back to the community somehow.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
At least I've heard this name before, so it's somebody that, you know,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I know has posted on Facebook a lot and so forth.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
And I just want to say, I don't want, like, I don't want this guy to think,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
like, God, what jerks they're being, like, I'm trying to do, like, a thing.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000
You know, it's just like, unfortunately, we've been around a very long time,

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:29.000
and we've seen a lot of, like, dark things, so we have to question everything.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
That's just part of, sadly, what we have to do.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Like, I'm going to tell you guys, I don't want to get into all the details yet,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
because I don't, I haven't been able to put it all together,

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.000
but something happened with Hoard House this week that we didn't really talk about on air,

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
and I'm not going to get into it so much,

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000
but, like, it really was something where I was, like,

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I kind of got an email that was a little bit of a mindfuck in a way,

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
and I'm worried it might have been a catfish thing,

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
and I feel really bad, like, going to that negative place,

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
but something didn't connect in my head, and so I had to do a little research,

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000
and there was some things that didn't line up.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Yeah.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000
But it was a very, like, serious kind of email, and I was just like, yeah.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Yeah, so anyway, I just want to say, like, unfortunately, yes,

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
even little old podcasts that very few people listen to like us,

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.000
sometimes, you know, we've had some not-so-great things happen,

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
so anyway, sorry, I don't want to-

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
It's a universal rainbow of trolling, huh?

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Yeah, well, yeah, but again, I don't want to make this guy,

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
like, I'm sure this guy is well-intentioned, I hate to-

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Oh, yeah, I didn't mean that about him.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000
See, I'm more inclined, since I remember the name,

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
and he's been around since 2004, listening to us blab about shit all week.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Right.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I was inclined to give him benefit of a doubt.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
That's fair, that's fair.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
And, you know, it's up to our listeners whether or not they want to be kind.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Just keep in mind, and that's always going to be a thing when it comes to money,

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000
and we here at OLR, we haven't asked for your money, like, besides charity things,

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
you know, we might have said donate to the MS Foundation or, you know,

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
things that we've done charity drives for in the past,

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
but, you know, we don't usually ask for money, so we,

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
when other people ask for money, we have to really question that.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
And if we support a charity, we are going to research the fuck out of them.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Yeah.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Because we're not going to have, like, a Komen walk.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Because fuck them.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
We did just have guests, we had, like, three weeks' worth of guests

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.000
that were talking about Kickstarters.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Yeah.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
So, it's fair.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Fair is fair.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
This is last email.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Hi, OLR, and the ever-lovely Marissa.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
You got a fan.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Aww.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Watch this.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
They're all going to be like, this is the best person ever,

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
the next line, something critical.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Shit.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
That'd be a great way to open, you know, a good...

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
It's your friendly neighborhood rage-nator.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Aww.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I just thought I'd throw out a random topic to discuss tonight.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Arcades.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
That's random.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
At one point or another, you have professed your love of arcades

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:48.000
and how playing music game at the arcades has led to the creation of OLR.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
That being said, I'd like to pose these questions.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Do you remember your first visit to an arcade?

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000
What did you play?

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Please elaborate.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
I can tell you.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I mean, I've been in arcades since I was probably an infant.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Yeah.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:04.000
I remember our Aladdin's castle.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And this one had been there since, like, the 70s.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
It was the same one I went to when my brother Matthew was six

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
and got hit by a car.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
And nearly died.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
They had carpet on the walls.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
That's how old it was.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
It was like going to the freaking roller rink.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
It had carpet on the walls.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And I remember going there and beating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
at that arcade.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
That was when they shut off the power right when we had beaten the game.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000
You know, I remember going to play pinball when I was a kid.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I remember having to stand on a crate to play kangaroo.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
So I remember Pong.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I remember the sit-down Pong tables because you did have that weird burnout in them, remember?

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:55.000
And I remember, you know, even sometimes going to the bar with relatives

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:01.000
and sitting down at the table to play Pac-Man, you know, is craziness.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000
But, yeah, I've got very strong memories.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Okay, the first movie my mom ever took me to was Star Wars.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000
My dad took her to see Exorcist 3 as a romantic date.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:18.000
So, yeah, I've been in arcades and fun places since I was very young.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.000
My first arcade memory that I can remember.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I mean, I'm sure I was taken to an arcade before that,

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000
but my first memory that I vividly remember was I was probably about four or five years old.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
I think I was about five years old.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
And it was something to do with my sister's wedding.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000
It wasn't the reception, obviously, but I think it was like the rehearsal celebration post-dinner or something.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
It was at Chuck E. Cheese.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:45.000
And I remember that I had to stand on a box because that's what they used to have for kids.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
They'd have like a big wooden box that you'd stand on so you could reach the controls and see the screen.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.000
And I was playing Crystal Castles with the trackball.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Remember the little dude that goes around and gets all the gems and, you know, when you get hit by something?

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Oh, no, Di.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.000
That was my earliest arcade memory was Crystal Castles.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000
It was a little bear.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I did that for Classic Game.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Bentley Bear.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I did that for Classic Game.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
You have done that for Classic Game.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000
And the 2600 version, I remember playing that a couple years later going,

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
It doesn't look a damn thing like the arcade version.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Anyway, Loki, do you have an earliest arcade memory?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
God, I don't remember.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I know I played Chuck E. Cheese a bunch of times, but I don't remember the first arcade I went to.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Because this was back in the 80s.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000
There was arcades everywhere.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
So, probably at Chuck E. Cheese, but I don't remember.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
It could have been at Golf Land because I did live in San Jose down there.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.000
So, I went to Milpenas Golf Land before they had all the cool stuff.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000
That was the DDR capital.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Yeah, before all that.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And I had Sundayville Golf Land too a bunch of times because it was right near my grandparents house.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
But it is one of those.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I don't remember, which was the very first.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
But I played a lot back then.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000
This is also in Alabama for me.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000
So, that we had arcades actually was pretty cool.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Other than going to Godfathers or Showbiz.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I'm sad that there's not arcades in malls anymore.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Tilt. Remember Tilt?

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Tilt was purchased by Namco.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Tilt.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
They have an arcade at the Roseville Galleria.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000
But it is seriously nothing but ticket redemption machines.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.000
And I think they have that one Konami shooter game that every frickin' place has.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
They do have Derby Owners Club, don't they still?

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Do you think Dave & Busters?

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
That was it. Dave & Busters had Derby.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I think this place is called Fun Factory or something like that.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Yeah, it's right there by the carousel.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.000
What was the other one that I was trying to think of?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Oh, Dan, when he was out on his route to Adventures at Work, sent me a picture of a cyber station.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Nice.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
There was still one open.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Marissa, do you have an early arcade memory that you remember?

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Definitely Chuck E. Cheese.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I can't remember the game in particular.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:06.000
At a young age, with the exception of going to Chuck E. Cheese, they were always really cheap with the coins.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000
But I remember spending many of my teenage years playing Crazy Taxi in the mall.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.000
And we had a Marvel vs. Capcom game at the college that's still there, actually.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Wow. Crazy Taxi was so much fun, though.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000
It wasn't. Everybody knocks it. That shit is fun.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
We love Crazy Taxi when we go all out.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
We want to make some crazy money.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000
That's a fun game. That's one of the most fun driving games to this day.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
And everyone says that's what happens.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
We used to go to...

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Take me to the Pizza Hut.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000
When I was in elementary school, or even junior high and stuff, we used to go to...

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000
They usually have an arcade game in a random restaurant.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000
We used to go to Rico's Pizza, and they used to have a bunch of arcade games there.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Rico still has a decent supply of arcade games.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.000
And Rico's with the big party pizza. It's like 30-inch-long slices.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
They still make that.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I haven't been there in years. They used to have them all over, and now there's one.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
And it's the same... I think it was the original one, still. The one on North Gate.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Is that where it is? North Gate.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Yeah.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:10.000
The one that was in Antioch.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:17.000
We used to go to a diner-type place, and they had Captain Commando.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:23.000
We'd go play that, or go down to 7-Eleven, and they'd have one arcade machine that they'd change out.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Usually it was Street Fighter.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Lots of fun stuff.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
It'd be fun just to go to different convenience stores and be like,

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Oh, they have an arcade game here! What's that?

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Oh, it's Street Fighter. Or whatever other games they have.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Hey, adult men over 18, for an interesting gaming experience, go to your local Chuck E. Cheese. By yourself.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I don't think they let people in.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
No, they don't.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
You're creepy. Get out of here.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
At my local one, me and Chris could go and play Skee-Ball.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Except when I lived in Chico. Chico is a big college town, and college rules that town, right?

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
We used to go to Chuck E. Cheese as a group of college kids, but I think that's different. They expect that.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I had my graduation party at Chuck E. Cheese.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Did you really?

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Yeah, one of my graduation parties.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000
The only plus about Chuck E. Cheese nowadays? Everything's one token. Every single game is one token. That's awesome.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Now one other arcade memory I just want to throw out there is playing, I think it was Star Wars Arcade at Shakey's Pizza.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Oh.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Remember Shakey's Pizza? I think they still have a Shakey's Pizza in Oroville or some shit.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Why on earth would I go up there, but there's a Shakey's Pizza.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:35.000
We still have some down south, and they're still with the old colored glass, you know, ye olde pizza parlor stuff.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:42.000
When Dan and I were newly together, we used to go to Crestview Lanes, which makes me sad every time I drive by it,

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.000
because it's been closed and now all the homeless people live in there, which I'm glad they have a roof over their heads.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:55.000
But that was like where we would go play Air Guys on arcade and Blazing Star and just some of the coolest games that we didn't see anywhere else.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Some of our chatters joining in answering this question over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
SSU100Matt says, Sport Time USA was probably the first stand-alone arcade I went to.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:09.000
It's actually featured in the Anamanaguchi Meow music video. That's fun.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Was that it for emails or one more?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
No, there's more to this one.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Wow, okay.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:17.000
As for me, my first arcade visit was to Showbiz Pizza Place in Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo,

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:23.000
in the fall of 1983 as a reward for doing well as I did my elementary school fundraiser.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Side note, I came in second place at the school.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.000
When I first stepped inside and looked around, my jaw hit the floor and I thought I had died and gone to gamer heaven.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Aside from eating pizza and watching the animatronic band, I ended up playing stuff like Skee-Ball, Popeye, Gauntlet, Mario Brothers, and a whole host of other games.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:42.000
It's because of that place that I love pizza, gaming, and associate with each other.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Oh my god, Popeye. I played the shit out of that on Commodore 64. It was so good.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:51.000
You know what actually I always will associate forever with Chuck E. Cheese's?

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Pole position. Sit-down pole position.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yes.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Always a sit-down pole position.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Like early voice acting in video games.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Get ready for Link in the Road.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:11.000
And the first showbiz that I ever went to was, it was in Mobile, like the whole shopping center since gone since then.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:16.000
But they had this room that you'd walk into on the way to the bathroom that had light-up walls, and it was like the seizure room.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
And it was right by the speaker.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Yes, they had like an amazing stroby seizure room.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000
And it was on the way to the bathroom so you could not, and they had the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:31.000
We could do this topic all fucking night because like I could talk about at Roller King out in Roseville when they had a Spy Hunter machine,

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000
and I used to play that with skates on, and that's probably why that pedal broke after six months.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
But my god, we'll be here all night.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I could only play frog-grown roller skates.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000
We could do a whole podcast about retro arcade memories, but anyway.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Thank you, Raginator.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Alright, was that it?

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Yeah.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Alright, you too can email us.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000
And Dark Soccer will consider reading them next week.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:00.000
But I'm just going to say, if we go another week and don't get a single email, we will play music from Star Wars Connect.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
So I want one damn email this week. One damn email or you get Star Wars Connect music during the break next week, I'm just saying.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
And it's not just any Star Wars Connect music. It's the dance mode Star Wars Connect.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I will play I Am Han Solo or whatever that song is. It's so awful.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Alright.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:19.000
We should do the Kim Kardashian game music with her speaking over it.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I think I'd rather have you as Kim Kardashian speaking over it.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:31.000
This is what you get, you guys. And you don't love me enough. Is that I'm just going to play this music for you.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Anyway, let's get back into some news. We're going to open up the phone lines here in a little bit.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTrader. But a few more stories for you first.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Yes. This is exciting. And I actually didn't see this right away when it came out.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
They had a brand new trailer, of course.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000
We knew that they were teasing a first person mode for Grand Theft Auto 5, which is, you know,

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Grand Theft Auto's been traditionally third person action game.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:08.000
But now they have a brand new first person mode that's completely customizable that will be in the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000
And what's kind of cool about it is, you know, literally everything has been tweaked for first person.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000
So it plays, you know, like a Call of Duty or something like that. You can limit it to, you know, I only want first person in driving.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:25.000
And you can do that. Or I only want first person in, you know, the non-driving stuff.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.000
I want it, you know, in third person in driving. Or I want to tweak whatever, depth of field, whatever you want to do.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:40.000
It's completely customizable. And they're even going to have, I believe, for Grand Theft Auto Online, modes where it's only players that are playing in first person.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:52.000
And I believe, if I remember correctly, it's toggleable, like, while you're playing the game. I think it's just tapping the L stick or something like that to go between the modes.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:00.000
So that's pretty cool because actually first person, for me, usually would be beneficial, especially when you're chasing people down in cars.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:07.000
It's kind of hard sometimes to shoot people out of the front of the car, you know, in third person.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:13.000
But I think first person, you'd be a little bit more accurate, get headshots and stuff like that, you know, in the car.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I can't wait for the first person shooter footage to be splashed all over CNN the next time there's a violent act that's blamed on video games.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Because you know what's going to happen.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.000
The first person, you know, stripper mode or strip club, you know, all that fun stuff.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:35.000
But yeah, it looks pretty cool. So that'll be on the 18th. Not too far away.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
How ready are you for this, Loki?

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.000
I am extremely ready. I wish I could take time off, but unfortunately starting a new job can't do that.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But I will have the game preloaded and I'll be playing it that night.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000
That, you know, probably on the-

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
You're training for a few weeks, right?

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
You have a red bull. You can get a red bull to keep you awake for a little bit. I'm just kidding.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Oh, I can stay up just fine. Yeah.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I know a lot of you are looking forward to the Oculus Rift.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:05.000
If you haven't tried this, you know, we've talked about the Oculus on the show before.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:08.000
It's one of those things where like when you hear about it, you're like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.000
But then when you actually try it, you're like, okay, I'm a believer.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Like, you know, virtual reality has come a long way from the days of the virtual boy

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:20.000
and hard driving in the speaking of old arcade games.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Virtual reality has come a long way. The Oculus is pretty awesome.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Try it at a convention near you sometime.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Or, soon, the first consumer Oculus headset.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
They are saying this is months away.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:42.000
This was a comment that Oculus VR CEO Brendan Eribe said at a web summit in Dublin 2014.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:45.000
We're all hungry for it to happen. We're getting very close.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
It's months, not years away, but many months.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So, like, probably- I would say that makes me think summer, fall next year.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000
That was my thought.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.000
They're saying that the biggest issue right now is that an input system, a proper input system is tough.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Standard keyboards, mice, and game pads really aren't working.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Gesture control is still a little bit primitive.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I don't know. I've played games under all those things and it's worked fine.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000
But I see why they need to establish their standard or whatever.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
So, there you go.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Oculus Rift coming sooner rather than later.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will be picking one up if nothing else.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And hopefully bringing his to the next DragonCon.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Honestly, now that I have a PlayStation 4, I'm pretty excited about when Project Morpheus comes out.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Because for the Oculus Rift right now, I'm not positive that my laptop would be able to run it well.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Whereas Project Morpheus, you know, that's its own box.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I really think- I don't necessarily think we'll get a full game announcement for Morpheus.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
But I really think with this PlayStation event really coming out of nowhere that they're doing in December in Vegas,

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000
I really think they're going to let more people experience Morpheus.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000
And I think that's going to cut- you know, because nobody's really talked about it since E3.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:04.000
But I think it's going to kind of be back on everybody's- on the tip of everybody's tongue come this December event.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000
And I don't know if they'll announce- maybe they will announce a game. Who knows?

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000
I think it's too soon maybe to announce when it's coming out.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
But that maybe is the next E3.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.000
But it'll be interesting to see how Morpheus has kind of evolved in the past six months.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Definitely.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
We haven't really seen it since E3.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.000
So. But again, I was fortunate enough and very lucky to get to try it at E3.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.000
And I was really impressed. Really impressed.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
And yeah. So.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
DarkSakura.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.000
It'd be nice if it loaded.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Okay. So there is a new trademark in Japan and Europe by Square Enix.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Called Brave Exvius.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.000
The application was submitted on November 7th and on September 26th in Japan.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
There is not a lot of information about it.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:03.000
It just says- just the information that came from Kabushiki Kaisha Square Enix.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.000
So that's about it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:15.000
However, there is- it may possibly be related to Mavius Final Fantasy trademark that was filed last month.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
So. Could be.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I wonder if it isn't some iOS game, though.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Because they have a few of those free-to-play games.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Square Enix has a whole little branch of the company that's kind of doing that stuff.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And a lot- some of them are kind of rooted in Final Fantasy-esque sort of universes.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.000
So. Be curious.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
It'd be cool if it was a new Brave Fencer Musashi.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000
That might be a stretch. But we'll see. We'll see.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Alright, well, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Because here at Orange Launch Radio, sometimes, you know, believe it or not, we get upset.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Like, we get really upset.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And so we vent to you, the listener, as we have every week since the very beginning in a segment we call

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
The Caffeine of the Week.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:14.000
F you to having a sore throat off and on.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Given that I work a ten hour shift at Locat.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
You know.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.000
I come home unable to talk.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000
And I mean, I love what I do. I love where I work.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
I love everything about my job.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Except the sore throat.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And it's just- it feels like a-

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Okay, this is really gross. It just feels like a constant pile of mucus in the back of my neck.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000
But my ear's feeling better. So that's good.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I think it's just something you'll get conditioned to after time.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Well, I've been there almost a year. I would hope I'd have been conditioned now, except that-

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Yeah?

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Wow, time flies.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Let's see, Loki, you have an F you of the week?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Yes, F you to the local teriyaki joint that's opposite of the devil named Nippon Teriyaki Bowl.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
I love that place!

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I do too!

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:10.000
What I don't love is their non-posted hours and their fucking odd-ass open times.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Because they used to be open from sometime in the morning that I wasn't there to 8 PM during the week.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:22.000
And, you know, open to 3 on Saturday and closed Sunday, which I'm still mad that they're closed Sunday, but whatever.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Now, so I'm like, okay, well I don't know what their fucking hours are.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
I looked it up on the internet, it says 5.30 is when they close it.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
My sweet, cool, I'm gonna go pick up dinner.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000
They're fucking closed.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:34.000
So, I don't know when the fuck they're open anymore.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
And I look on the door, there's no fucking hours.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000
So it's like whenever the hell they feel like being open is when they're open.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000
And so, it kinda pisses me off because they're so good.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
And I want it not just for lunch.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I want to go there for lunch and maybe dinner too.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Bring some of that home. But I can't because you're fucking closed.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:59.000
You would think I'd give an F.U. that's related to the trip I just took, but everything really went rather well.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I can't really complain about a whole lot.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Like, I'm really trying to think of something to complain about.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.000
I would say F.U. to P.F. Chang's, because it made me a little bit sick.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Like, what was I thinking eating there?

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
What was I thinking?

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I want Chinese food that doesn't taste like Chinese food.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I want really whitewashed Chinese food.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Like, I want, like, what if...

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
They do have decent dim sum.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.000
No, here's the thing. I was going out and meeting Dr. Ken from Starboard Power Coupling and his friend.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Their guildies all decided to go there.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Because, you know, there's only so many eating places in that safe spot.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
It's all chains over there, yeah.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000
But I will say this. To P.F. Chang's credit, great drinks.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
I had a great drink there.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
By the way, I do have to clarify for the chat room.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
This has only been happening within the last three weeks, the issue with my throat.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Oh, so it's not something, okay.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000
No, no, no. Keep in mind, I worked on the phones for seven years before that.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
So, I'm conditioned. Trust me.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000
And if you want to give some You're Not A Doctor advice to DarkSakura,

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.000
live.vognetwork.com is where you can join our live chat.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Marissa, do you have an F.U.?

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.000
F.U. to my lack of prosperity.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:13.000
To my inability to, I cannot eat as many cookies as I want and stay svelte.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
These are delicious.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:20.000
And F.U. to everything between L.A. and Sacramento.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
The exception of the coast.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
F.U. to the smell of cow poop.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
It just really, really ruins that drive.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Yeah, that was a hoot.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
That's why I'm glad I flew this time.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I don't get to fly to L.A. very often, but this time I got to fly.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.000
It's an interesting flight, too, because you never reach altitude.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000
It's like you are now free to get back in your seat.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
It really is.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
We're now beginning our descent into Sacramento.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
It's like 25 minutes away.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Yeah.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Anyhow.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
All right. Let's get back in. Just a couple more stories.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to participate with tonight's show.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Loki.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
All right. So this is kind of cool.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.000
It's a brand new game that's on Steam and Greenlight.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
I guess they're trying to get approval right now.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
It's called Scrap Mechanic.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
And you build machines out of all sorts of parts and stuff.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I guess it's sort of like that Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
But it's its own thing.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000
And so they've got some footage right now on Steam and Greenlight.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
So go check that out.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:32.000
There's another one I saw too that someone was working on Unity actually.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
That was kind of like that.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.000
But it was a racing game where you had a certain amount of time to build your machine.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Like 30 seconds or something like that.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
And then you had to race it with whatever parts you had.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
And it was really silly.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
So I'd be curious to check that out too.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
But Scrap Mechanic.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Sounds like your kind of game.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Yeah. It's supposed to come out sometime in 2015 it says.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
All righty.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.000
One more story for you guys.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:58.000
And it's about a classic franchise called Bomberman.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Do you guys know Bomberman?

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.000
That's a fun series except that Xbox 360.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Bomberman Zero.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Oh my god. Oh my god.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
So bad.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
But they did a download digital title later on.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
It was like Bomberman Returns or something like that.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.000
It was cute.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.000
It was good.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.000
It was fun.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Well anyway, Bomberman 3DS was supposed to be a thing.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
But it got cancelled.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.000
There really hasn't been a proper Bomberman game in our lives for quite some time.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.000
However, Bomberman is coming to smartphones.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
There's not going to be a story mode in the smartphone game.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000
But it will be going back to the classics with competitive versus modes.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
You can go against the CPU.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Or you can go into a competitive multiplayer mode.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Up to four players via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Well that might be kind of fun.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I guess Bomberman was pretty simple controls.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
So maybe it won't be so terrible on a smartphone.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.000
But again, there's no tangible buttons on a smartphone.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Anyway.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Bomberman Colosseum will be another mode in this.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000
It's like a time attack mode.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
You take on various CPUs.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.000
And you can unlock boss characters by defeating them in the Bomberman Colosseum.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:07.000
It is in Japan right now for Android and iOS.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000
And I would imagine it's a matter of time.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.000
It's not out already.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I didn't have time to check before tonight's show.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
But it's probably imminent in the US.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Unless they're doing a lot of translation.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000
I don't know.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Because the screenshots are very, very Japanese.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Anyhow, that does it for our news tonight.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.000
But what do you guys think?

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Do you have an opinion on tonight's news?

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Or something we haven't yet discussed?

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Or you just want to say hi to Marissa.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Give us a call.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Or our username on Skype.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
If you'd like to give us a call.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
And while we wait for some calls to come in.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Do we have any last minute stories from Loki?

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
There was one thing I saw.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
And of course I closed the damn page.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Oh there we go.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:51.000
I guess another one of these games that's out there

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:58.000
that's trying to hide negative reviews through DMCA takedowns.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And of course it being on Steam was at the slaughtering grounds.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
So kind of look out for that.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Because it looks like a really terribly put together game.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.000
And they're putting DMCA takedowns for any negative reviews that they have.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I heard about that.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000
That is so sketchy.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Like seriously.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
You think the internet's not going to figure that out?

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Have they not learned?

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Are they brand new to the internet?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Because it hasn't worked for everybody else that's tried that.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000
So I don't know.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
The internet.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
On Wednesdays we wear pink.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Hey!

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.000
We got a phone call coming in.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Who's this?

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Hey this is Akdeft.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Hey Akdeft.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
How you doing?

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.000
So when are we starting our Overwatch clan or guild?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Right now.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Right now?

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Well when the game comes out I suppose.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
We have to wait for the game to come out.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Yeah.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:56.000
I was trying pretty much all evening trying to retrieve my password from battle.net because

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
I didn't remember it.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.000
And yeah I got locked out even.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
I eventually got it so yeah.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Are you trying to sign up for the beta?

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Yeah.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000
I wouldn't blame you at all.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Yeah I'm pretty excited about the game.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Even though the comparison to TF2, Team Fortress 2, is pretty much uncanny.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Uncanny.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Sorry.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:24.000
But still it looks like a fun game to play.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Tell us, because you are such a fan of Team Fortress 2.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.000
You probably play it more than any other listener that I'm super familiar with that calls in

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000
to OLR.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.000
What was your reaction to hearing that Blizzard's going to kind of take on this genre?

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Were you like, oh god how dare they touch such a franchise that really Valve has kind

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000
of owned.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Or were you kind of like, wow this looks like awesome.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.000
At first I was reading about it and people were talking, oh it's a TF2.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000
It's TF2 with mobile elements and that.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:01.000
And I was a little confused about it because I hadn't watched the video until later that

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
day.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:08.000
And I had only watched the cinematic trailer and that looked pretty awesome.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I got pretty interested because of that.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Until that day later, or even I think the day after, I watched the gameplay trailer.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:24.000
I pretty much thought it's pretty much the same as Team Fortress 2.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:31.000
It's even the same modes, it has the same character types and all that.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:40.000
But I don't know, even though the gameplay looks similar, the components and everything

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:46.000
in the game looks different from TF2.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Something to add to your question is that a lot of people I know that I started playing

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.000
TF2 with are not playing TF2.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:04.000
So I was saying to you on Twitter that if Overwatch is free to play, I know a lot of

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:12.000
people that may get interested in it because a lot of people, like I said, I know they

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:19.000
left TF2 because they thought the game got stale or the game didn't evolve that much

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
from what it was.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
So it got boring.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
So possibly Overwatch will fix that.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I'm very curious to see if Valve might have a response to this because it's interesting

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.000
how Valve and Blizzard are becoming more and more competitors.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.000
The Battle.net launcher could very well become a storefront.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
It is in many ways.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:44.000
It only sells Blizzard stuff, but in some ways it is a storefront.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000
It kind of goes on that whole fragmented thing I talked about earlier.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.000
So I kind of have to say, look at them for that.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.000
It's interesting how they are competing with Valve, not just necessarily in that space,

02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:00.000
but the fact that they also did a MOBA where Valve had Dota 2.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.000
We remember there was even that lawsuit where they were going to call the game Blizzard

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Dota, is what Blizzard was going to call their game, but they got into a little tiff with

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Valve and ended up settling.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
But it is kind of interesting.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Now they've got a game that's very similar to Team Fortress 2.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000
I wonder if Valve might be pressured to announce some sort of Team Fortress 3.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Although, I don't know, Valve kind of does what Valve wants to do.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Valve has had many competitors against Team Fortress 2.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.000
True, true.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Like Monday Night Combat and some other games.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Bethesda had one.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:40.000
The only one that comes to mind is that one because that one at least got some, I don't know,

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.000
War of Mouth out, but it didn't grow that big.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000
But there are other games like Team Fortress 2.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.000
There's another game free-to-play on Steam that's called Road Out.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.000
They're really similar too, but not that popular as Team Fortress 2.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Even though those games are free-to-play, Team Fortress 2 is still the game to play if you want to play

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
team first-person shooters.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Bethesda had one that they showed at E3 because I remember that was the only other thing they were

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:10.000
showing besides the Evil Within.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.000
And so that's one.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.000
I remember playing that and going, oh, this is Team Fortress.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
So they've got one in development too.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:23.000
But it's kind of like when MOBAs all came out fast and furious, and I guess they still are.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:28.000
I hope we don't have stories like the EA game that closed this week happening too frequently in the

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Team Fortress 2 universe.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000
But one way or another, Blizzard will end up fine.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
But before I let you go, I want to ask you about Overwatch.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
What did you think of the characters?

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Because I felt that was the strongest point of the whole thing was that, wow, these characters are

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
super interesting.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Yeah, that's something that Blizzard I think knows how to do really well, that it's characterization.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000
And the characters look like real characters.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Even though Team Fortress has some characterization, it doesn't look as in-depth like in Overwatch,

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:07.000
at least from what we see in the trailer and the cinematic and the gameplay trailer.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:16.000
And even, like I said in chat earlier, that Overwatch could very well be a series or a movie even.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:20.000
SSG100Matt has a theory in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:25.000
He says, Gabe probably sat back in his deluxe leather chair watching the trailer saying,

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:29.000
oh, that's cute, while watching the Valve staff make Half-Life 3.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Yeah.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:31.000
All right.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Well, active, and we'll let you go to see if we can get some more calls.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
But thank you for your thoughts on Overwatch.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Anytime.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Take care, buddy.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I feel like you need to have a spinoff gaming law podcast.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Oh.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Well, God, somebody's suing someone every week in this damn industry.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.000
It's crazy.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:51.000
I feel like every week, this is like the first week in a month we haven't had some type of lawsuit story.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Speaking of last minute stories, speaking of Blizzard, you know, and Marisa, you can back up this statement,

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:00.000
you can't have a good character without a good voice actor.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:01.000
That's right.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:02.000
That's right.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Voice.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Exactly.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000
So, you know, and Blizzard knows how to find great voices.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:13.000
And this just goes to show the Voice Arts Award, as announced by Voice Over Times,

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:21.000
the winner of the Outstanding Video Game Character Voice Arts Award went to Michael Gao for Diablo 3.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:26.000
And if you don't know who he is, he voiced Deckard Cain in that game.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Oh, Deckard Cain, who was younger in Diablo 2, but in Diablo 3, he's really old.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
And that's from the Voice Over Convention.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:42.000
That's going on tonight and for the next few days in New York.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Nice. Well, congrats to him. Congrats to Blizzard.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:50.000
I guess he probably wasn't at BlizzCon if that was the case, but there you go.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.000
That's interesting, though, because Diablo 3 has been out a while.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.000
It's a relatively new organization that got together to give these awards.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.000
I was going to say, there was an expansion, although I don't remember how much Deckard Cain was in the expansion.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.000
I don't think he was really in it, but I don't know. Anyway.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Okay. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
The phones are still open. I'll leave it open for a few more minutes to see if anyone else gets in,

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.000
even though we are well after 9 o'clock here on the West Coast and we usually like to calm things down.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.000
But I'll try to fit in one more call. Jamie's tired. She's yawning.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
She might need another cookie to perk her up. All right.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
I have to go to bed eventually.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
All right. Loki, anything else for the last minute stuff?

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Thanks to hacking, there is a guide now how to play GameCube games on your Wii U.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Oh, wow.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Because of the GameCube controller support that they're going to be having.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Uh-huh.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000
They're saying, hey, it's a good time to play GameCube games.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Of course, it's up through the homebrew channel, and I'm pretty sure you have to rip ISOs in order to do it,

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.000
but it can be done on a Wii U.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Wow.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
We should just add support for GameCube games.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Hack, hack, hack your Wii, hack it for Wii U.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.000
So we know that's kind of irritating, so it's like we know it can do it,

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.000
but Nintendo won't unlock it because you know they're going to start selling them as virtual console.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.000
It can do it. They're putting out GameCube controllers.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.000
But fuck you, we're not going to connect those dots.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
I want my F0GX.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:21.000
We're going to put an F0 track in Mario Kart 8.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:24.000
We're going to put an F0 level in fucking Nintendo Land,

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
but fuck you, you don't get an F0 game.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I want to play Eternal Darkness again.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Alright, I want to see some cool DLC characters for Smash Bros.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Maybe instead of FU of the Week, next time we should just have Wine of the Week.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Like the Wine of the Week.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.000
And Excitebot, or, you know, Geno.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Alright, well, sadly the phones are not lighting up.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.000
I'm going to go ahead and close it so we can wrap up, because we are well after 9 o'clock,

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000
and I've had a pretty long day today, I'm ready to call it.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.000
We weren't even supposed to be here today, to quote a popular movie.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Alright, anyhow, so we are here at the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000
and, you know, before we wrap up shop here, I just want to say Marissa,

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:08.000
it is so lovely to have you here in studio.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Just your presence is always fun to have.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.000
I know you don't play as many games as the rest of us, but you know what?

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000
At least you still have a respect and an adoration for it,

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
especially with the whole voice acting connections,

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:23.000
and I think it's always interesting to hear your perspective of the industry side of things.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
I love it. I actually do play a little more than I care to admit,

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000
but I don't want to be held to being incorrect when I speak up.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.000
If they come for you, I will fight them.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
If they come for you, I will fight them.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000
I love being here. It's such a pleasure.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Alright, you're welcome any time that you can get yourself up here.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Alright, or, one of these days, we're going to come invade LA. I'm just saying.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.000
Oh, you guys so should.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I know, I know. It would be my dream to do a live from E3 show,

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.000
but we have to let Loki's wife leave for a couple days to do that.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Alright, but Marissa, thank you again so much for being here.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Best of luck to you in your journey as you continue to find more and more voice acting engagements and so forth.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Please, please plug it one more time.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Seriously, guys, if you need a voice actress, Marissa.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
You get to hear me doing some really silly stuff.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:13.000
It's MarissaMizell.com and that's my official website and then you can link to there.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Or it's Marissa Mizell at SoundCloud and I have some silly stuff there too as well.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
It's just good fun and I appreciate any listens and feedback anyway.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
It doesn't matter who you are. It's always interesting.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Yeah, that's great.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Thank you.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Thank you. Alright, let's...

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I listened to that Marissa girl. She sounds like a good young lady.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
That's right. She's nice.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Alright, she's so wholesome.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Next on the Disney Channel.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
That means she's such a good actress.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
That's when you know you've really got them fooled.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Oh, she sounds like a good Christian girl. Alright.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Shalom.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Alright. Anyhow, as I say at the end of every show.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:57.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.000
If you like what you heard here at the show, we've said this for the past 574 weeks.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Help spread the word because Orange Launch Radio is the place where every gamer has a voice.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000
And we want to have your friends at the table as long as they promise to behave.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:17.000
No whipping it out and putting it on the table. That's disrespectful.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Unless you're Nintendo or something. Then you get to do that.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I'll start with my official final thought.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:30.000
My final thought is I want to give a big congratulations.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Speaking of 500 weeks, I want to give a big congratulations to Critical Myth.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Who is having episode 500 of their show air on the network Monday.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:45.000
Now to be fair, that's not 500 weeks because they do three shows a week.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:52.000
But still, how many shows get to 500 one-hour episodes?

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Not a lot. Not a lot. A fantastic accomplishment.

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:01.000
And if you like television, who doesn't like TV? There's got to be some nerdy show.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Even you will watch Doctor Who or there's some shows you watch once in a while.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:11.000
And chances are if it's a nerdy show, Critical Myth is talking about it.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:12.000
So check out their reviews.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:17.000
TV.vognetwork.com and you can actually participate and write your own reviews.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000
And check out their shows Monday, Wednesday, Friday at VOG Network.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
A big congrats to Critical Myth and the whole crew over there.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:28.000
All those guys that met for the first time at this year's Dragon Con for 500 episodes.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Woo!

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Okay. Loki, your final thought.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:37.000
My final thought is I'll create an auto in a week.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:43.000
I guess I'll work on my game during this time so that I have some productivity.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:46.000
It's going to have to write itself once that game comes out.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Well, I'll get bored of it eventually.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000
But it'll be fun to go back in there and play it again.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Alright. And last but not least, StarkSoccer, your final thought tonight.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:59.000
If someone knows of an HTML5 GUI editor, because I'm looking for some...

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.000
No, seriously.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:07.000
I'm looking for something that I can do to do dating sim-esque dialogue for an idea I have.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:13.000
If anyone knows of a good one that will run in HTML5, please let me know.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Thank you.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Well, you know Unity exports HTML5.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
I know and I don't know if...

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:23.000
There is a content thing on the Asset Store for dating sim dialogue.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:26.000
I don't think it's free.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
I wanted to do my webcomic in that format.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Okay. Alright.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:34.000
Well, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Have a great week everybody and we will see you in seven days with episode 575 of our show

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:46.000
and everything that might break in gaming over the next week that we have to fix here live on air.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Thanks again for tuning in and supporting the show guys.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:49.000
We'll see you next week. Bye.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
They were all still true.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
See you next week.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Thanks for watching.
