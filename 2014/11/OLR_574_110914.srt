Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Tonight, November 9th, 2014, we're fresh back from BlizzCon and ready to talk about their first big new IP in over a decade. Also, games start to disappear, including one EA MOBA and Ubisoft games from Steam. We didn't disappear, and we'll talk about all this next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November 9th, 2014, with the 574th episode of our program.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and yep, I made it back. We're good to go. If you've been following the show recently, I literally just got off a plane an hour and a half ago, and here we are doing the show with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We drifted a few times and took some curves, and I had to cut off some guy.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jamie actually gave me a ride from the airport. Thank you so much. Deeply appreciated. But as the kickoff song tonight for OLR, I played an old Bamani favorite that seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If any of you have ever played Initial D or anything like that, it's all Eurobeat music, so it seemed very appropriate for Jamie driving down the freeway, except her music in the car is Let's Have a Kiki.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Actually, right when you got in the car, it was an Apollo Throwdown, and then it was Let's Have a Kiki, and eventually ended into a remix of Calista.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was a very Jamie ride, Mass Effect remixes and so forth. And then it ended.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Although that version was from a racing game. It was from Midnight Club, I think.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And then it ended with a burrito.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
With a burrito. Tacos for you, tacos. Rolled tacos.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tacitos, a little snack told me over till the real dinner.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rob put something long and cylindrical in his mouth.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, hey. Watch it.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, also joining us in the studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Doing okay.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I heard your PlayStation 4 is already back.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes. That was surprisingly fast.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But it's not your PlayStation 4.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, it's just a reverb, but whatever. It's mine now.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You see this? It's mine now. So they sent you a better one, basically.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, it was less scratched.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Nice.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And didn't have a weird smell to it.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, I know we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that in a little bit.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But let me ask, just overall, how has your experience been now that you're playing PlayStation 4 games?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Good. I wish they had some better control over when you're downloading stuff.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because I was downloading my digital version of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I wanted to download other things first.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I paused stuff. And then even when it said it was done downloading, it went into the game.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm like, cool. I'm going to play some of the campaign.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because I told it to download the single player first.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Even though I played the campaign like six times now.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I played the campaign and got through the first level.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it's like, please wait for the rest of the content to download.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm like, what? It's got like seven minutes left. What the hell?

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I thought this was done already.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That was like Destiny, playing that for the first time.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because you put the disc in and it spins up and a little bar fills up.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're like, all right, it's installing.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right, we're good to go.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And you go into the game and it's like, downloading game updates.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Download, download, download.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't even touched Destiny yet.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just warning you, you're going to have a similar experience.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So be ready.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But we did play more of, or I should say Josh was very excited to be able to play more Ninja Bots again.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh good. Something for everybody in the household.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, well joining us in studio tonight, we have a very extra special guest here for Orange Lawns Radio.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Those of you who have been listening to the show for a long time will recognize this voice.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Somebody who is only able to grace us with her presence once in a blue moon.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But we're so happy she's here tonight in studio.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Say hello everybody to Marissa.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hello.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hi, welcome back.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hi, it's great to be back.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And Marissa, if you have not been following the saga of Marissa.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How many parts is there?

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think there's 27.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a sonnet in 27 movements.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, but you say you're not a gamer, but you totally are.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like, you know more about the Thief franchise than anyone I know.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We're not going to talk about the new one.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Marissa's very irritated.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What went wrong? What went wrong with New Thief?

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Everything.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How about one example?

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They really wanted to, they tried to cater to too many people at once instead of taking advantage of what made it lovable in the first place.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So it created a really scattered vision and they got rid of the lead voice actor, who is a motherfucking genius.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, let's talk about voice acting for a little bit.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because I know that in the earlier days of OLR, because the show's been around a while, so people's lives have changed over the past 12 years.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For a while you were really into folk music, and you still are.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean, I know that's not something you've really abandoned.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But somewhere along the way you got the itch to get into voice acting, right?

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's actually what I had wanted to do ever since I was about eight or nine.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Really?

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had even studied it. I studied acting intently and I was an actor for many years.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And this is actually, back in my day, this is when it wasn't cool.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When all my theater friends would tease me, that's not real acting.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Now they're like, can you help me get an agent?

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I had done all these other things, honestly, because it takes a lot of courage, as anybody knows, when they are the sole proprietor or an independent contractor, to represent yourself.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a lot easier to hustle for other things.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And a lot of my friends came together and they gave me, I guess, a talent intervention or something.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They're like, we can't have you crying anymore because you're coming home working at a law office.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We think you're good at this thing and you should do it.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Which also meant a lot to me because I know if I went to them and I was like, I would like to be a ballerina, they'd be like, really?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No. That's how I knew they weren't BSing me.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I love that. A talent intervention. That's amazing.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you are doing voice acting now.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sadly, I can't say, oh, Marissa's been in this game you've all played, but it'll be a road to get there at some point, right?

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, I don't know how time, because I know that the show's starting right now, but we can talk about how people start that later.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because it's a little bit lengthy to talk about that process.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We'll get into that part B, I guess, a little bit.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just remind me.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My mind's going 100 miles an hour right now since I literally was in Anaheim earlier today and now I'm here.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's also one of those jobs where you're like, hey, what do you do?

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I go, oh, I do this and they go, oh, how can I get into it?

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know what? A lot of people want to know that.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But a lot of people want to hear video game talk, too, so we'll get to that a little later in the show.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We'll ask all about how you got into that.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, usually I would say let's talk about people, because you know a lot of voice actor people, but I want to keep it really positive.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I want to talk bad about anybody.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So who are some awesome voice actors?

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If we aren't following their stuff, we really should be.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Who is doing the video games that are just awesome people?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't have anyone that I've ever even heard anything negatively about, because everyone I've ever met has honestly been wonderful.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know that people are people and we don't necessarily get along, but it's a community where it's very small.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You think about video games and who is voicing stuff. It's like Jennifer Hale is in every game and Troy Baker is in every game.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This weekend was the Troy Baker game weekend.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's not a bad thing. They are both gods.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It makes the game that much better.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You hear that Jennifer Hale is going to be in a game and it's like, yes please.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There are so many facets to that too, because they know that they are amazingly talented, but they are going to show up and they are good to work with.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Although, now that we've gotten to the age where we are digitally scanning actors, a lot of the characters in the games I'm playing are starting to look like Troy Baker.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You must have been playing Infamous this week, I believe.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We'll get to that in a little bit though.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the voice of Geeks Network.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to do my best voices tonight with Marissa President.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm in the presence of voice acting soon to be royalty. I need to do my best.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Alan Alchemy is asking a question saying, Marissa, have you worked on anything with Chris Hardwick?

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I know that voice acting work is rarely done in a group studio setting anymore.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, I haven't. Although, yes, that's true.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Specifically with American animation, that's when it's done in a room.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Actually, it is amazing. You have to give serious credit to people who do video games and anime.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They give them the least amount of anything and as little as possible, they just go, make your magic, do something.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Taliesin Jaffe, I'm pronouncing his name wrong because I put the emphasis on the wrong syllable.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's an amazing actor who came into our class and talked about one time they just threw this thing at him at the last second.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It turned out in the game that he was kind of playing this butch woman.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They didn't tell him that at the time, but they just threw this at him.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It ended up being hilarious and funny, but they gave him so little to go on.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
To start to transition into what I'm going to talk about next,

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
there was a voice acting stage at BlizzCon where all weekend they had voice acting talent up there on the stage.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was joking with you before the show, I thought of you and I really did.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Just seeing some of that talent on display, there were some panels,

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and I'll admit I didn't stay to watch anything start to finish,

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
but there were some demos that were near there so I kind of absorbed what was going on.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I heard some Q&A, but I also heard one panel, talking about a little bit to go on,

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
where they were doing monster voices as requested by the audience.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It was like design a monster voice over panel or something like that.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some guy got up there and was like, zombie, turkey, thanksgiving, rat.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know what the heck it was, but it was crazy.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This man made the most hideous noise I've ever heard in my life,

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
but he pulled it out of thin air, like I imagine you have to do sometimes.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You had to be able to do that at the last second.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Video games are one of the most grueling things you can do to your voice because of those efforts.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Getting stabbed lightly, deeply, getting stabbed and the knife pulling downwards to the side.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And also, if you have something like this, you have to be able to have range within that.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you audition and you get the job like that, you can't move within an emotional range within there.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're screwed and you're actually going to be sounding like that at the end of the day.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, wow, wow. Oh my gosh, wow.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Any other games you've been dabbling in lately, Marissa?

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know if your voice acting lends any time to games.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've actually really just been studying what other actors have been doing more.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's really been a lot of my time.

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I just completed a move and then all my grief over the thief game.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Fair enough, fair enough. I like that.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You might be looking for influence in some of the art that's out there with voice acting.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's really cool.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Absolutely.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, we'll talk to Marissa more throughout the show and please feel free to chime in at any point.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If you guys have questions for her in chat, we can do that as well.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But let's move on to our kickoff topic tonight, BlizzCon.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm back from BlizzCon and I literally just walked off the plane about 90 minutes ago and here we are at OLR.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I spent...

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Rob, that's figuratively just walked off the plane.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Whatever.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you literally did it, we would be filming a recording of the airport.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really? Because that would be kind of fun, I think, if we could all get past security.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'd like to point out that my positive spin on your coming out from Anaheim,

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
yeah, he's like, Anaheim sucks, doesn't it?

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was really positive about that.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Not the city block I was on because I was within one mile of Disneyland at all times.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That is awesome, yes.

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So you did the BlizzCon?

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No, I didn't go to Disney this time. There was no time.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I arrived on Thursday and the first thing I went to was this event called World of Podcasts.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was a kick-started event for the community and this was their second year that they'd done the event.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was a lot of World of Warcraft podcasters and fan communities that came together to do this.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was a really awesome event, I've got to say.

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They did a fantastic job.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They really outperformed last year.

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And not to knock last year, but everything starts somewhere and then gets better, right?

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, I mean, it was like five times the size of what they had last year.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They had a room dedicated to panels and I was fortunate enough to be on a panel where I was talking about podcasting,

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
which, you know, I can talk a lot about, right?

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They had a room where you could take your pictures in front of a green screen.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So, myself and Dr. Ken from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and our friend Talrix all got a photo with Sylvanas,

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
thanks to the green screen magic, so that was fun.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And there was an art gallery in one of the rooms and this fan website, AskMrRobot,

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
those of you that listen to Hoard House probably remember when we had V on the show from AskMrRobot.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But AskMrRobot is a site that really aims to make players better through data that is submitted to them from logs

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and through analysis and lots of big complicated math basically.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But AskMrRobot actually sponsored this art gallery where they had a bunch of photos from the fan community.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They were up on the walls and everywhere and I got to tell you this.

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
At the con, I got a tweet from V and she said, hey, come find me, I'm over by the Illidan statue.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So, I went over, she said, I got something for you.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, I went over to the statue and she gave a gift on behalf of AskMrRobot to Hoard House

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and believe it or not, what she gave us, one of the prints that was on the wall on display at World of Podcasts.

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And each print was specifically picked to match the podcast.

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So, we got a picture of an orc baby with a handwritten card from V that said,

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
so you can hang it in your studio and have a picture of grandpa.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It is fantastic and I'll give you more information.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There's not enough vodka.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll give you more information about that on the next episode of Hoard House.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But if you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is it supposed to look like a troll doll?

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's supposed to have a distinct look to it.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, it does look like an orc as a baby.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And my favorite is that he has that confunk coming off of him with all those little flies there.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, that's what that is.

220
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I love his hair.

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you are a Warcraft player, check out AskMrRobot.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I know we talk about ethics and game journalism and all this stuff.

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I'm really not supposed to let bribes win me over.

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But that one kind of won.

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm just full disclosure.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Like, you give me something like that and yeah.

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to say AskMrRobot.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But you're not selling the product.

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And we are commentators here at Orange Lounge Radio.

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There's a big difference.

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
All right. Anyway.

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We aren't above selling out here at Orange Lounge Radio.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's the highest bidder. We're not going to lie about it either.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I just sold out for a painting.

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We don't have any ethics, so we can't sell them.

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Now hold on. We have some ethics.

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't.

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We have some ethics. All right.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Anyway, so that was awesome.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And let's see.

243
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So the con itself, I'm sure a lot of you guys have been following the news.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They didn't say a lot about World of Warcraft because their big expansion is coming out.

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They announced Starcraft 2, Legacy of the Void, which we all knew that was coming.

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So it wasn't really a big surprise.

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Got to play that a little bit on the show floor.

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm not very good at Starcraft, but lots of intricate cutscenes and things you'd expect was pretty cool.

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Diablo 3, my favorite Blizz title right now, sadly.

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
All they could really talk about was the next mini patch.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But we did get to play that on the show floor.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They're going to have one new map that has these really cool spike traps on it.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And they're going to have different types of treasure gnomes, like treasure gnomes that drop only gems, drop only blood shards, and things like that.

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So just a little bit to get into there with Diablo.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And then some bigger news with Hearthstone.

256
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They announced the Goblin vs Gnomes expansion, where the cards have a lot to do with the mechanical things that these two races make.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A lot of unpredictability with that.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I got to play a match against Dr. Ken, and I made the biggest stupid noob mistake I could.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because I haven't played Hearthstone in like a year, okay?

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I'm playing this, and Ken gets up from his computer and he's like, you win.

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And I'm like, what do you mean I win? I haven't killed you yet.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And he's like, you have all these monsters out, you can attack me for two damage and I'm dead.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I was like, oh, I thought I had to clear all your minions first, like in Magic the Gathering, before I could attack you.

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And he's like, no.

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I was like, I ended my turn on accident.

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And so we went back to playing, and he beat me.

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I made the biggest dumb noob mistake.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But the expansion was a lot of fun.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It motivated me to give Hearthstone another look.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I haven't played it in far too long.

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Got to play Heroes of the Storm, which they're bringing some new heroes to.

272
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Jaina, Thrall, you know, some of those people you know from World of Warcraft.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think Tyrael was new, I can't remember if he was already in the game or not, I apologize.

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Sometimes with the hero rotation, I forget who is and isn't there.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So they announced some new heroes, which was cool.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sylvanas was one that they announced for Heroes of the Storm, that was awesome.

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
She looks like a lot of fun.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And got to play that, and again, had a lot of fun playing that, so I need to give that another look.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then, of course, the big one that everybody's talking about.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Blizzard announced a new IP franchise.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I mean, they say it's their first in 17 years.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You have Heroes of the Storm, though, in Hearthstone, so it's not really their first new thing.

283
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But heroes based off existing characters.

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hearthstone based off existing lore and characters.

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So this is their first, like, from scratch thing.

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And as that trailer is playing, which I'm sure you've all seen by now,

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
if you haven't, check it out on YouTube, Overwatch trailer, BlizzCon.

288
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It looks like Pixar did it, like it was a really good trailer.

289
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Did any of you, the rest of you, see the Overwatch trailer by chance?

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You really should check it out when you get a chance.

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I didn't.

292
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It was really cool. It looks like a Pixar movie, like you're watching The Incredibles or something.

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And my jaw hit the floor as I was watching this because I realized this was Project Titan we were looking at.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because there was no way, no way that this was pulled out of somebody's butt in a year.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Now, maybe Titan had started as one thing and became this other thing that's now Overwatch.

296
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know. We'll never know.

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Blizzard will probably never peel back the onion on that so we can really see what's in the middle there.

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But whatever this was was the product of many, many years worth of work, clearly.

299
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And Overwatch, which is a lot of people are comparing to Team Fortress 2.

300
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I played it twice. I'm comparing it to Team Fortress 2.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It is a lot like Team Fortress 2. At least the component we played was very similar to a match in Team Fortress 2 where you control one checkpoint.

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And then once you take over that checkpoint, you move to the next one and the next one.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So it was very much like that.

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But the characters in Overwatch, very, very good.

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I mean, just to, you know, Blizzard took some heat last year because there wasn't enough women in World of Warcraft and a lot of strong female characters.

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which, you know, you look at Overwatch and they've got men, women, robots, big, small.

307
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I mean, just a great diverse roster there in Overwatch.

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But it's not just the diversity. It's not just that.

309
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But it's the fact that all of these characters were so strong and so fleshed out.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It wasn't like a reskin of another character. I mean, this was really a new cast of characters.

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sometimes I feel with a female thing, though, that strong female character just means not being a prostitute being murdered in a bikini.

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Anything above that is nice to know.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, and you know, there was one character I played named Symmetra that definitely had that side cut dress that was a little bit revealing.

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And she had kind of an Egyptian look to her.

315
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And she was kind of, you know, like sexy.

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But then there was another one, Tracer, that looked like she was like a throwback to one of those Amelia Earhart aviators.

317
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What they would look like in the next century.

318
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The orange goggles and things like that.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And she was really cool and she is the lead mascot for the game. At least that's the sense I get.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, you know, it's around the board.

321
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's going to be a little bit of sexy there.

322
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But there were some sexy men, too.

323
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, a little bit of everything.

324
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But the characterization at the end of the day was really, really strong.

325
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And yeah, man, there's a lot to devour there.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The first time I played it, I wasn't really feeling it because I played Symmetra and I didn't get her at all.

327
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I guess her thing is you want to set up as many turrets as you possibly can, fast, figure out where people...

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And I didn't get that. I thought, oh, I can only have one turret up at a time.

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Here I am with the lowest score.

330
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So, I don't know, it wasn't a lot of fun when you feel like you don't know what the hell you're doing.

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I went back, I said, you know what, I'm going to try it again.

332
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I went back through the second day and I tried it again.

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I played a character named Mercy, which is almost exactly like the medic in Team Fortress 2, like with the heal ray.

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But you can heal or you can buff.

335
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's left click, heal, right click, buff.

336
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So you have something to do when somebody's health is full, besides the invulnerability thing that Team Fortress has.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But the other cool thing is that when you hit the shift button, medic will fly to whatever person you have targeted.

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Because she's like an angel type character, so she flies right to somebody.

339
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So that was really fun to like zip around.

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And so once I played her, I was like, all right, that was a lot of fun, even though we lost.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That was really cool.

342
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So Overwatch won me over by the second day.

343
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They haven't said if it's free to play or if it's going to be a $60 game, we don't know.

344
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I would think because Team Fortress 2 is free and that's going to be the big comparison, I would think Overwatch will be as well.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I don't know, they could also get away with it for $60.

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I would not be surprised at all if Overwatch makes it to consoles, but they didn't announce that.

347
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
PC is really the only thing we have.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
One other thing I wanted to say, I got to say kudos to Blizzard by the way they started their opening ceremony.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And not to get into that whole controversy thing again, but the bottom line is,

350
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and this is what Mike Morhaime said at the beginning.

351
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Like, you know what, there's been a lot of harassment and bullying in the past couple months.

352
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I think it's important for all of us to take a stand against harassment and bullying.

353
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And he didn't call anyone out specifically or whatever.

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But you have to remember, harassment and bullying unfortunately in gaming go way back.

355
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They go back years and years.

356
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And unfortunately, games like WoW, games like Heroes, people get trolled and yelled at and nerd raged at all the time.

357
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So despite all the other drama and hysteria going on in gaming community right now,

358
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I thought it was just really cool for the president of a company who sometimes is associated with games that lend themselves to cyberbullying and so forth,

359
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to come out and say, hey remember, there's somebody else on the other side of the monitor.

360
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And we here at BlizzCon want to kind of start today with creating that environment.

361
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like, I was one over. I was clapping at that point. I was clapping. Marissa?

362
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, I'm doing my church wave.

363
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, you're doing your church wave. Yes! Yes, mama, yes!

364
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So, anyway, I just thought that was like a super classy thing to do.

365
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So, anyway, there you go.

366
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ActDeaf reminding me that the medic does have a similar metagun called the Kritzkrieg, which buffs the player you're healing.

368
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, interesting. I wonder if it's like an all-in-one thing, though. I haven't played enough Team Fortress 2. Sorry about that.

369
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Kaijuta says, as far as Hearthstone, me and a few people spammed Blizzard about putting Hearthstone on the Android and they closed the thread.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Well, they did announce Android tablets are getting it in December, so you won't have to wait too long.

371
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But no phones yet. It's not on iOS phones. It's not on Android phones, as far as I know.

372
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So, yeah, that was BlizzCon.

373
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And, you know, now that I've attended both BlizzCon and FanFest, Final Fantasy FanFest, you know, the two big MMOs.

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean, obviously WoW is behemoth, but Final Fantasy is kind of like up and coming with a very different kind of cultural background, right?

375
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Being Japanese-based as opposed to American-based.

376
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It was really kind of cool to see how similar the events really were.

377
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I mean, BlizzCon was really well organized.

378
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
A lot of the line issues that I bitched about with Final Fantasy weren't really present at BlizzCon.

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like, the lines moved really briskly.

380
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Remember when I had that seeding issue at Final Fantasy I bitched about here on the air?

381
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, Warcraft had very clearly marked, this section between this time and this time is for VIPs only.

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You will be asked to look. It was very clearly marked and I thought, okay, that's fair.

383
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You know, they have it very marked and that's what they do.

384
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And they were just very efficient at getting people to do all the things they wanted to do.

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But, in Final Fantasy's corner, I kind of thought, like, I didn't need to play WoW at BlizzCon because the expansion is coming out in a week.

386
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't need to just play.

387
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So, why not, you know, what Final Fantasy did is, oh, here's a new boss you can play.

388
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Or, here's a special event we made just for the fan fest, like a roulette mode where you have to do a boss with these certain restrictions, you know.

389
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's kind of like putting little spins on the game that make it more interesting.

390
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And I think BlizzCon could have had a little more of that for the games that weren't really popular.

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Like, people weren't really lined up to play Diablo 3 because it was just a mini patch.

392
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But, what if they had had, like, a greater rifts contest where if you could get to, like, level 15 on a rift at the show, you'd get a special little pin or something that you could use to train on the board.

393
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think that is something maybe they could have gotten from the fan fest side of things.

394
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But, at the end of the day, both cons were good and the reason why, one word, community.

395
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The communities for both games, excellent. And, just, I met so many great people at both BlizzCon this past weekend and at fan fest a few weeks ago.

396
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The communities for the games are really spectacular and you all behaved yourselves.

397
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And, I did not smell butt the entire weekend. Like, everybody was well bathed and using cologne.

398
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That or the ventilation in the Anaheim Convention Center is primo.

399
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Very well done. So, I did not smell butt the entire time I was there.

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So, Marissa, why are you giggling?

401
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just laughing at the low bar we have.

402
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Alright. One other thing I'll quickly talk about because a lot of people talk about this out of BlizzCon.

403
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
On the third floor, they showed footage from the Warcraft movie.

404
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're not going to see it on the internet because it was very much under lock and key.

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They were demonstrating a new Dolby surround type system where the speakers are actually on tracks.

406
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And, I'm sorry, I forgot the name of this. Maybe somebody in the chat remembers this.

407
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The speakers actually move on the tracks so that if you hear something move, the speaker might actually move the sound from left to right.

408
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They're on a 360 rail. It was kind of a trip.

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But, they played the teaser and some of the Blizzard trailers on this sound system.

410
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And, it was a teaser, essentially, for the Warcraft movie.

411
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They said it was extended BlizzCon footage, excuse me, extended Comic Con footage.

412
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But, I'm sorry. They had the Dead Can Dance music in the background, which I instantly recognized.

413
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm like, that's host of Seraphim. I love this song. Perfect movie trailer song, right? Especially for somebody at Warcraft.

414
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And, then they had all these shots.

415
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And, I'm sorry guys. I can't remember every little detail about the trailer because there was a lot of rapid cuts.

416
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Rapid, rapid, rapid, rapid.

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But, there was definitely an orc baby coming in that movie because there was a very pregnant orc out to give birth.

418
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And, my jaw hit the floor when I saw the night elves. Not going to lie.

419
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When I saw the night elves, I was like, oh my. Like, I gay gassed. I did.

420
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's all you can do. Like, the visual effects in that movie look stunning.

421
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And, I think that's going to really capture a lot of people that maybe aren't even Warcraft fans are just going to check it out for the visuals.

422
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
After they showed the teaser, they said, by the way, the visual effects in that aren't complete.

423
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And, I was like, what? I'm like, that looked great.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And, then they showed us a completed visual effects.

425
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Literally, just 15 seconds of an orc up close showing emotion.

426
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And, it looked to be Durotan during the birth of Thrall.

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's what we speculated that scene was that we were seeing.

428
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, you could see, like, the emotion in his face.

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And, I was just like, it definitely has human elements.

430
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But, it didn't look stupid like Shrek would be.

431
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Like, Shrek's supposed to be stupid. I'm not knocking Shrek. It's a kids movie.

432
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But, it looked like the box art of where it looked like.

433
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a kids movie with half the dialogue written for the grown-ups.

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But, yeah.

435
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But, you get what I mean, right? Like, it just, wow.

436
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It looked like the Warcraft art in motion.

437
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And, I was like, this is a really good sign.

438
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I really hope the story doesn't screw this up.

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But, I think they're doing the smart thing by not jumping right into the MMO.

440
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They're going to do the backstory.

441
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Original OG Warcraft.

442
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And, I think that's the smart way to do it.

443
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Because, most people playing WoW forgot the story of the original Warcraft.

444
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Which is a great way to retell it.

445
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
See, I love the original Warcraft story.

446
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I hated playing the games.

447
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So, this is actually going to be good for me.

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Even though I still want Sylvanas fuck shit up the movie.

449
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That would be great.

450
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And, thank you chatters.

451
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Tigerclaw says, Dolby Atmos was the name of it.

452
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That was the system that we saw there.

453
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And, Alan Android in chat says,

454
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Do the night elves look like Avatar people?

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Um, no.

456
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Here's the thing though.

457
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I gasped because I thought they were blood elves at first.

458
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I was like, blood elves are in the movie?

459
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They're very similar in look.

460
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And, then I realized, oh wait, no.

461
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's the night elf city that they're in.

462
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's the night elves I just saw.

463
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But, they looked really good.

464
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Like, the glowing eyes and everything.

465
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, but also keep in mind that the blood elves before they were blood elves.

466
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's true. So, maybe I did see that.

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know.

468
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Who knows?

469
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Because, they went to...

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, you're right.

471
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
More? No, I'm kidding.

472
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Well, you know me.

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
When I play World of Warcraft, I'm like, click, click, click, click, click.

474
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Give me loot. Click, click, click.

475
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't read.

476
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I actually have to agree with your experience you're talking about with Blitzcon.

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because, you know, it's convention central down there.

478
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Everyone I know looks forward to Blitzcon.

479
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Everyone has a great time.

480
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And, I hear the least amount of complaints about it too.

481
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Which is, you know, everybody and all has a good time with that one.

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And, there's, you know, so many conventions going on down there all the time.

483
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was a huge party.

484
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I mean, every night something was going on at the Hilton.

485
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just in the lobby.

486
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Just people drinking and being merry.

487
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
They had a big street party Friday night for Warcraft's 10th anniversary.

488
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Or, sorry, World of Warcraft's 10th anniversary.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Warcraft's 20th anniversary.

490
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They had food trucks out there the whole time.

491
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Gourmet trucks out there.

492
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It was just well done.

493
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Very well organized con.

494
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Loved it.

495
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says,

496
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Skye, even though it takes place before WoW, don't be surprised if they planted Easter eggs throughout the film.

497
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I mean, you could just have a scene of the characters going into a cantina.

498
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And, there you'll see all the races.

499
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You never know what's going to be after the credits, right?

500
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Unless it's a Christopher Nolan movie.

501
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You never know what's going to be after those of you that were paying attention to the news this week.

502
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Alright.

503
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Let's see. What else is said here?

504
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Act F says,

505
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Hey, what if after the Warcraft movie we get an Overwatch movie or maybe a TV cartoon series?

506
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I think they've said, I want to say they said in some media panel,

507
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
they are open to that type of expansion of the Overwatch universe.

508
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I mean, this is Blizzard.

509
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There is everything for World of Warcraft.

510
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Toys, comics, movies, you name it.

511
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And now, you know, the big, big movie.

512
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Diablo comics and all this.

513
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Starcraft, I mean, is huge.

514
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Overwatch, Blizzard completely plans to be next in line.

515
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And that's the thing that they can't really do with Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone as much.

516
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
As much as those games are good, they're borrowing on things that already have been existing and selling in these other franchises.

517
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So, Overwatch is their chance to, you know, monetize all the things over again.

518
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I think they will. I think they will.

519
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The characters were very, very strong.

520
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That's something that Blizzard does very, very well.

521
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Anyway, I've rambled on enough about BlizzCon, but if you want to know something else, just ask.

522
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll get to it at some point in the show.

523
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But before we get to the news, let's catch up with all of our hosts in how was your gaming week?

524
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

525
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I played Final Fantasy XIV.

526
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And, uh, some Final Fantasy XIV.

527
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And, um, I played with Kat.

528
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, that's about it.

529
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I played with Kat.

530
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay.

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She was pretty fun.

532
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Sounds good. Well, lots of MMOs.

533
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I did play Mass Effect 3 for N7 Day.

534
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And ordered my new hoodie.

535
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Did they do anything special online for N7 Day?

536
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yes. 25% off hoodies, actually, through...

537
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What's today's date?

538
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Um, the 9th.

539
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I think it's through the 11th that they're doing it, so...

540
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Nice. Maybe I'll check that out. I saw the faux leather jacket.

541
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It looked really hot. I wanted that.

542
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But, um, they also did the pre-order for the Italian Garris statues.

543
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I want the Garris one, but I don't have the money for it, so...

544
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I will say, I was at, uh, I was at BlizzCon, obviously, on N7 Day.

545
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I was wearing my Final Fantasy XIV shirt just to see if anybody would get the joke.

546
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And, spoiler, nobody said anything. Or if they did, it was behind my back.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But I did notice that there were at least three people that were wearing N7 gear to BlizzCon on N7 Day.

548
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And I felt really stupid.

549
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I felt really stupid not having worn my hat to the con that day.

550
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Geez, Rob.

551
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Even after I went to all the effort to say, you can keep it.

552
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I wore it the next day. Leave me alone.

553
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I wore it to World of Podcasts the night before.

554
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So I just forgot that it was the 7th of November.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm allowed to give you a hard time.

556
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Alright, uh, Loki. How was your gaming week?

558
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Um, I actually played a few things. I played more Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare, did some multiplayer.

559
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Um, had a little trouble getting the game, um, to preload on, uh, PlayStation 3.

560
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because, um, because I had originally preordered it on PlayStation 4 and it was cross-buy.

561
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So, um, they didn't tell you that you had to, I guess, what was it, you had to download the pl-

562
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Even though I already had, like, it on one system, I had to rebuy it again on the Sony, uh, network.

563
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And then, because it said free, so I had to rebuy it and then it would unlock everything.

564
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But it was just a pain in the ass trying to get it to unlock.

565
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Even, because it's a Day Zero edition, it should be unlocked on Monday.

566
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But it was being stupid, so.

567
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You were a very angry Twitter user that day, I noticed.

568
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
You were, you were, uh, definitely letting your feelings be known.

569
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So, um, so I finally got it to work and I played some multiplayer and that was fun.

570
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Really, really fast, um, so I enjoyed that a bit.

571
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I got up to level 18, I think.

572
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then, um, you know, I had sent off my, um, my PlayStation 4, actually, I think it was on that Monday.

573
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And I got it back on Saturday, um, all fixed.

574
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I got to, uh, actually play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, which is, it's okay.

575
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know, I wasn't a huge fan of, like, Infamous.

576
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I, I got it free when they did the whole PlayStation Network outage thing.

577
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Um, it just looked like a kind of a fun game based off of the trailers I saw.

578
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And, it's okay. I don't know, like, it's open world.

579
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's very similar to me, like, like a Crackdown type of game, although Crackdown's a lot more fun.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Um, maybe even a little bit like, um, you know, was it Saints Row IV, I guess, where you have, like, the superpowers and stuff.

581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And you kind of do different things to collect power-ups to level your character and thing.

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't know, it's okay. The storyline so far is not really hooking me.

583
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's just kind of bland, but I'll play it a little bit more and see, I guess.

584
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Uh, but Call of Duty is pretty awesome.

585
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I've already played through the first half of the campaign about four or five times, because I did it on about three different systems now.

586
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And, uh, yeah.

587
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Can you, can you explain to me a meme I've been seeing on the internet?

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And, um, uh, granted, this is because I've been kind of out of it.

589
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was busy with BlizzCon and stuff before that.

590
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
What is the push F to pay respects thing? Can you explain that for me?

591
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Okay, so there's a, I guess, an interactive cutscene or part of the game where you're, it's spoiled already.

592
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And, uh, you know, the, the E3 footage I think they had where it showed the dude.

593
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Basically your partner in crime in the, um, the Marines happens to be the son of the guy that runs Atlas or Kevin Spacey.

594
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And so in the very first mission of the game, he gets his arm stuck in this, uh, mobile, like, um, anti-aircraft, uh, launcher thing.

595
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And, you know, with a bomb on it. And so it explodes and he dies.

596
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And so your pain or your respects to him at funeral in the very beginning, that's when, uh, the Kevin Spacey's character invites you to Atlas and gives you the prosthetic arm because your arm gets chopped off in the first level.

597
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Um,

598
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh yeah, that was in the E3 thing. I remember that.

599
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, that's the E3 thing.

600
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's not really a spoiler.

601
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So that's not really a spoiler. So yeah, anybody, anybody who cares has already played through that part of the game.

602
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, it's really what it is, is it's just, it's an interactive cut scene and you don't really have to push a, I mean, you shouldn't really have to push a button, but I think they do it on purpose so that, because when your pain or respects, it also shows that, look, your arm is amputated.

603
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know, like in case you didn't catch that by dragging it away and your arm's staying there, you know, it's not super stretchy arm now, it's your arm is gone. So, um,

604
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Go, go gadget arm.

605
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah. So they give you a prosthetic one later on, but, uh, it's just kind of doing that. It, they have a lot of weird, like, you know, cut scene things that are in the game where they have you interact with it that really aren't necessary, but they have them there.

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So I guess they thought, Oh, it's jumping the shark and whatever. It's just like, you know, I didn't really need to have a cut scene where I'm taking off the straps that are holding me into my harness or something in the drop ship and stuff.

607
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It wasn't really necessary. That could have been done just as a cut scene, but they had you interact with it.

608
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
All right. I get it now. I just, I've seen all these like pictures on Twitter, like somebody photoshopped the scene from final fantasy seven where cloud is holding Aerith after Sephiroth did the thing.

609
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I'm cheering in the background.

610
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And it says, push F to pay respects. And I was like, okay, there's a joke here about the new call of duty somewhere.

611
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And then I also played a ninja bots, which is the AR it's a DLC for play room that they had.

612
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And it's kind of like a, like a runner type game. And it's a great kids game.

613
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
My son loves playing. He can actually play it by himself without me needing to help him and stuff.

614
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The only thing is it's only one level and they programmed it so terribly that like once you're finished with level and it's kind of cool as you earn coins throughout the thing.

615
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And when you're done, all the coins pop out and they're in your room and you can kind of interact with that stuff.

616
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But there's no way to play the game again without backing out and then going back into it. And it's only one level.

617
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And that's like, you know what? I'd fucking buy more levels for this shit if you would just put them out.

618
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I mean, it can't be that difficult or, and even just program it so that I can go back into it when I'm done playing.

619
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Like, Hey, would you like to play again instead of having to go out to the main menu and go back into ninja bots again and fucking have them do that shit again.

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Um, but it's fun. He likes it. So, um, I just wish more DLC. I would totally buy it.

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
All right. More DLC. Do it. Um, Marissa, I know you said you haven't had a whole lot of time to game, but I'm going to check in with you anyway.

622
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
My gaming week has consisted of playing Waze driving up to Sacramento.

623
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Hey, you know what? Geolocation games. Waze is kind of the game.

624
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Warning, police ahead.

625
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, but you run over candy and you get points.

626
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That is true actually.

627
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I've also been playing don't break your phone and I've been playing, uh, studio one and pro tools.

628
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Fantastic. That's all right.

629
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Although, although you know what the call of duty game, the most disappointing part is that you don't get to play as Kevin Spacey.

630
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I would like to play Kevin Spacey the game.

631
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Maybe that's an Easter egg at the end. Maybe like something you get in the end. You know what? DLC.

632
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Kevin Spacey the game.

633
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's Kevin Spacey DLC. That's what they do now. That's the thing you really want is DLC.

634
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No, what you're going to want is probably new.

635
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Push F to spend $9.99.

636
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
New player skins for multiplayer. That's probably the only way to build.

637
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Boy. Oh boy. All right. I talked a lot already, so I'm not going to ramble on my gaming week.

638
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I already talked about everything I checked out at Blizzcon.

639
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Uh, before that more Diablo three, more Final Fantasy 14, um, was playing Binding of Isaac a little bit this week on PlayStation four.

640
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Um, but I also, I pushed A and B on the plane ride home today.

641
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I pushed A and B to pay respects to Metroid, which I had on my 3DS.

642
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I was like, what do I want to play on my 3DS?

643
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Cause Theatrhythm doesn't really work well on an airplane because you know, you're just hearing the rrrrrrgh of the engine or whatever.

644
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So you can't really like hear Theatrhythm.

645
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But I played Metroid. I was like, what the heck? Let's, let's play an old 8-bit game.

646
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So I played some Metroid and I was having fun and I was like, I need to do more like classic game live streaming.

647
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Invite friends over and, and just have fun with these classic games and, and see how much I can remember.

648
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Because like my, my Metroid muscle memory will take me like, okay, I remember to go get the, the thing that lets you morph into the ball.

649
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Uh, I remember you go get the missile after that and then you go get the bomb and then you go get the ice.

650
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And then I was like, wait, what's after the ice?

651
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm like, is this where I go and get the jump boots or, shit, I don't remember.

652
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Do I go with the Varia suit now? Damn it.

653
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I kind of hit like a wall, like a mental wall. I was like, I don't remember where I go at this point.

654
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So it's like your muscle memory only takes you so far and it's kind of sad.

655
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then I, I realized after I shut it down, that's the part where you backtrack all the way to the beginning, freeze the bird and get the extra energy tank.

656
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Or do you need the, you know, you need the high shot, the long shotgun for that, huh?

657
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Dang it. Damn this memory loss.

658
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Oh well, that's why there's game facts, right?

659
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
All right. So that was my gaming week, getting irritated at how much I'm forgetting in my advanced stage.

660
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So let's, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.

661
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Hey, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

662
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We are also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

663
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And as far as I know, no shows off in the near future, maybe December 7th.

664
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll pencil that in for right now, but I'll find out about that for sure in the coming, coming weeks.

665
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But, uh, at least for the next few weeks, we will be here and, uh, we hope you, if you're available Sunday night, you'll come check us out live sometime.

666
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Uh, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vog network.com.

667
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Let's get into some gaming news, producer Loki tonight of tonight's episode since I was in the air.

668
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's get to it. Start us off.

669
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So Ubisoft, um, I guess briefly, cause, uh, Bobby had said that these have come back now silently,

670
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
but they had, uh, pulled off their upcoming PC titles from steam.

671
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And that includes, you know, far cry for, um, assassin's creed unity and the crew have been, uh, they disappeared off steam.

672
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And, you know, I guess the statement that, um, they gave was we've been in discussions about valve, about assassin's creed unity,

673
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
but for the time being, the game is not widely available and, uh, via steam in the UK.

674
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
In the meantime, UK customers wishing to purchase a digital copy of the game can do so by visiting the Uplay store.

675
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I don't think anyone wants to visit the Uplay store to be honest, or our retail partners or other digital distributors.

676
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Um, and they were also saying that was, it was also gone from the store in North America.

677
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And I haven't gotten checked to check and see if it's back yet.

678
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And also, um, you know, still on other sites other than steam, like green man gaming and that kind of stuff.

679
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No, I, I heard they came back today.

680
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So whatever, whatever disagreement or whatever, whatever, uh, issue, I guess quickly got resolved fairly quickly, I guess.

682
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah. I was going to say, um, yeah, it's, it's back on the store.

683
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It looks like I see assassin's creed unity right here, uh, for sale,

684
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
but they never really got into like the real reason why they disappeared.

685
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Just who knows? Interesting.

686
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I hope this doesn't go down a road. Like, um, uh, we, we worry about with Netflix.

687
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And I actually was thinking of this today because I saw a commercial on the,

688
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the inflight TV for Disney anywhere or something is what it's called where Disney is basically taking all their movies and doing their own type of Netflix type service.

689
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And we all know there's HBO go yet. Everybody's doing their own type of service.

690
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And we're all kind of sitting here going, uh, this is like, there needs to be one hub with multiple things.

691
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
That's the thing is that unfortunately everybody was like wishing, geez, I wish I could get everything out of cart.

692
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You know, I wish I could have all my, you know, I don't want to watch, you know, Fox or this, I want, you know, I only want to watch Disney.

693
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Well, here you go. Here's our Disney stuff. But yeah, at the same time though,

694
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
stuff like Netflix is going to get gutted with all these shows being taken off there.

695
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Although they kind of cycle stuff through like they have the old 19 was it 1990s Ninja turtle movie there now.

696
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah. It seems like Netflix is at least thinking ahead a little bit and they're trying to get their own series and they've done, you know, obviously like I'm a huge fan of orange is the new black.

697
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And you know, I know they have a lot of other, uh, critical shows on there. People really dig.

698
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So at least they at least kind of seem to be preparing for this possible future where maybe Netflix has to have its own shows worth subscribing for.

699
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Um, but, uh, yeah, I just, I don't want to see things get fragmented like that and just, you know, again, I'm making stuff up.

700
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I don't know why Ubisoft really ended up doing the game pull. Um, but I just hope it isn't something like probably a whole lot of stuff.

701
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We just don't see like, you know, the inside stuff. Maybe, maybe it's something that you play.

702
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Maybe it's just something that they want to implement that valves not okay with, or I don't know. Who knows?

703
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Um, ACT F says, I want to say they removed them and added them again because of region pricing and locks.

704
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's a thing there. Uh, ACT F says it seems like new games added to steam can be cross region gift locked. Interesting.

705
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
A power in our chat says everyone wants a piece of the pie, but they don't realize the dividing the market is the worst thing they can do.

706
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And dungeon buster says capitalism running wild and Y Y R says unlimited Disney movies.

707
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Sounds great for kids and their parents. Yeah. I mean, I, I was looking at, I think they were given away wreck it Ralph for free.

708
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And I was kind of looking at it. They go, well, maybe I should, maybe we should get that. I like record Ralph. So there you go.

709
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,000
All right. Well, uh, moving on to another story. Uh, this is, you know, what's funny is that this link to the story actually like wasn't working before the show.

710
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, now it's working. There it is. I thought it was like, because the website went down.

711
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Well, I thought maybe the website went down during the week. Uh, but, uh, well, what happened is that the game went down and, uh, I thought maybe they were cleaning, cleaning house.

712
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I've never heard of this game. I had heard of it, but it was in a very diluted market. And the game we're talking about is Dawn gate.

713
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It was electronic arts or EA's answer to the MOBA genre. You know, where league of legend, Dota 2, smite, heroes of the storm, all of these games already exist.

714
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So unfortunately it's a, it's a pretty fragmented market and Dawn gate tried to get into that market.

715
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And unfortunately in a letter written at, uh, Don gate.com from group general manager, Matt Bromberg, he said, today I have the unenviable task of announcing that we've decided to stop development of Dawn gate.

716
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Um, so, uh, you know, they basically talked about, you know, we were trying to do this and it's all, he said, we knew going in, it was extremely competitive.

717
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But as being a EA, just because we stopped development doesn't mean we're not going to release it. We're going to put it out there. But, uh, we've just stopped development. If anything's buggy, we're just going to leave it in.

718
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You gotta want, you know, they could, they could repurpose it a little bit and just like put it out. There's like a $20 game where you could just go, you know, all the characters there and you can just go ahead, head of your friends or something like they could do that.

719
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I don't know if they will. I mean, they've got origin set up as the storefront. Why not make a little money off of everything you invested, but, uh, we'll see.

720
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But they are saying as part of the process of closing down, gone, Dawn gate will continue to operate the game for the next 90 days.

721
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
All players will be entitled to a full refund of any money spent during the beta. Uh, so there you go.

722
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
If you did spend money on Dawn gate and you were a big Dawn gate fan, at least you're getting the money back, even though this news probably sucks for you.

723
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Why are they charging people during a beta? To be fair, Blizzard does this too. It's to quote unquote test the store. Oh yeah. Test the store.

724
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's working. We're making money. To be fair, whatever you buy in the beta, you will have when the game goes live.

725
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And these are free to play games where the transactions are based off of these characters or these mounts or these skins or the, I mean, that is what all of these mobas do.

726
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Oh, they have an in-game store at, uh, for EverQuest online or not EverQuest. Uh, I'm sorry. The, uh, elder scrolls online for the elder scrolls online.

727
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't think they do, but, uh, final fantasy 14 rolled one out just a couple of weeks ago, the two, four patch mounts and minions.

728
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:37,000
They were very clear at fan fest to say, and he even said in English, you know, they don't, they all speak Japanese and not a lot of English, but he said in English, no pay to win.

729
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So he wanted to make that very clear, uh, but, uh, just like mounts and minions and things like that only, but that's still pissed off some of the fan base.

730
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I get it. I don't, I don't, I never bought that crap and wow. The only time I did it was when it was a charity minion and, uh, you know, props to Blizzard.

731
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
One thing they did announce a BlizzCon, they'll be doing another charity minion for American Red Cross Ebola relief.

732
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They're going to do a 100% charity minion there. So.

733
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Which all of five people have.

734
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Well, but to be fair, I believe the American Red Cross is also helping the people in Africa. So, you know.

735
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Well, that's better.

736
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, that's better. So.

737
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Hey, do you want to hear a joke about Ebola? You probably won't get it.

738
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, it was going around Facebook. It's the pun dog.

739
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Wow.

740
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
All right. Pun dog. Why don't you give us the next story?

741
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Did you just call me a bitch?

742
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It, you make it sound like it'd be the first time I've ever said that, but to be fair, you've called me a bitch more than I've called you a bitch.

743
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Because I usually know better than to do that.

744
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Hey.

745
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You know what? That's okay.

746
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the art of shade.

747
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:58,000
You better watch out because I just watched a Real Housewives of Atlanta marathon on the right home.

748
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Why do I come here anymore? I could have just made you walk.

749
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Probably be lifting up that pant leg.

750
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I just get on, I just get on Lyft and then I'd write a nasty tweet about you. I'm just kidding.

751
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm just kidding. If you couldn't, you couldn't.

752
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Bitch, please.

753
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Ah, see? See? Who called who that word?

754
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
At least I didn't call you late for dinner.

755
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So anyway, does anyone remember Direct to Drive?

756
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Was that the one that GameStop bought?

757
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It was the one that IGN bought.

758
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Oh, okay. I knew somebody bought them.

759
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well, basically, yeah, they were bought by IGN.

760
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Point for Loki.

761
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It was basically the AtGames Digital Media said that it got the GameFly digital distribution platform,

762
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
which had been bought by IGN before and called Direct to Drive.

763
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So now Direct to Drive is going back to what it used to be.

764
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
AtGames is going to be relaunching it under the original name and not GameFly anything.

765
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So basically, it's going to give people a way to buy and play and rent, I believe, games.

766
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Pretty cool, though, that it's coming back. I mean, I guess that they're like,

767
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
we miss it. We're going to bring it back.

768
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So a quote on here says that the vision for new Direct to Drive is to create the best destination

769
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
both for gamers to find their favorite titles and for publishers to showcase their lineups.

770
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We will bring a retail quality experience to the digital world with the best incentives

771
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and events that gamers both expect and deserve.

772
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So it's a steam competitor, essentially.

773
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah. But anyway, they're offering gamers a chance to win 12 legendary gems of The Chosen One

774
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
or a flashback console, whichever one they want.

775
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Nice.

776
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I guess the 12 legendary gems are basically 10 randomly drawn people

777
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
will get one game every month for the 2015 calendar year.

778
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Nice.

779
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And the flashback consoles available are the Atari Flashback 5, Sega Genesis,

780
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Sega Genesis Portable, ColecoVision, or Intellivision.

781
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
My Intellivision flashback should be getting here this week, by the way.

782
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
If you remember the show a couple of weeks ago, I went on Groupon and bought that boy.

783
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But anyway.

784
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You know what? I have an Intellivision.

785
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I know, but I don't.

786
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You gonna buy mine?

787
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
No, because I just got a flashback console.

788
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But anyway, what I wanted to say is that even though I just talked about,

789
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I don't want to see the marketplace diluted, I'm okay with this.

790
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Steam needs some competition.

791
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And they do have, you know, there's Desura, there's Humble Store.

792
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
There are still other competitors out there.

793
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But the difference here and why I say this is okay is because a company like this

794
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
relies on distribution agreements.

795
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's not publisher-owned, so it's not going to be just one silo of games.

796
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I mean, it is competing on the same level.

797
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Although, well, okay, to be fair, Steam is publisher-owned.

798
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But I suppose, you know, because Steam also has a lot more than just Valve stuff,

799
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
we let it slip by a little bit.

800
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So, anyway.

801
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Let's move on.

802
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Loki.

803
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
All right.

804
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So, let's see.

805
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Let's talk a little bit about other companies like Activision,

806
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
which they're not really my friends right now,

807
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
despite the fact that I'm playing a ton of Call of Duty.

808
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
They've raked in, apparently, for a quarter of three, $753 million.

809
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Of course, a lot of that is Destiny.

810
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And, of course, they also, I guess, released Diablo III, the Ultimate Evil Edition,

811
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
back in August.

812
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So, a lot of it's that stuff.

813
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And, of course, you know, the Blizzard side of things.

814
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Of course, that brings now their revenue for 2014.

815
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
They're expecting to earn $4.325 billion in that revenue.

816
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And I guess another $1.492 billion, which is expected, I guess, this next quarter.

817
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Probably, hey, that's probably Call of Duty.

818
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're going to probably rake in a ton of money from that

819
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and, hell, even the World of Warcraft expansion.

820
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
The thing that I'm a little peeved about, though,

821
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
is you may remember we talked a little bit about SharePlay,

822
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
which was part of the brand-new PlayStation 4 2.0 patch,

823
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
that it's that wonderful feature that you can take a game that you own

824
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and share it with your friends.

825
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
In other words, like, say, Rob wants to play some Call of Duty.

826
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I could say, hey, you know what, I'm going to SharePlay that

827
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
so we can either play, you know, split-screen deathmatch or something like that

828
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
or he can play the single-player version.

829
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, wait, no, he can't because Activision decided to be unique about it and say,

830
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
hey, we're going to disable SharePlay functionality on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

831
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That's right.

832
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Is this something where maybe they're only going to do it for a little while?

833
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Like, maybe like 30 days you can't do it or something?

834
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
They didn't say. Their excuse, though, according to it right now is...

835
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Well, I can't wait to hear this.

836
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yes, and this is totally not PR speak.

837
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
This is, I'm sure, a completely honest reason why it would work.

838
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
From the heart.

839
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Delivering a great gaming experience for our fans is our top priority.

840
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
We're focused on launching Advanced Warfare and ensuring that people

841
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
have a great time playing it, which our fans seem to be.

842
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SharePlay is a new feature that was introduced as part of the recent PS4 firmware 2.0 update.

843
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Our engineers didn't have access to it before it launched,

844
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
so we haven't had a chance to evaluate and see how it will impact the experience across all modes of play.

845
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Of course, we wouldn't include a feature in our game without having the chance to test it.

846
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Once we fully analyze its performance, we'll determine how to support it going forward.

847
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's too new.

848
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Really, that's kind of strange because all the other games out there that were before Advanced Warfare

849
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that definitely didn't know about it seem to be working just fine, so...

850
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Okay, I'm going to humor this train of thought for a minute

851
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
because I believe an argument could be made that SharePlay will help people demo games.

852
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I mean, you're going to be able to play your friend's game and get an impression of,

853
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
do I like this game? Do I want to buy this game?

854
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And if the streaming technology lags or has too much frame skip

855
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
or too much artifacting or something like that, you might decide as you're testing this game,

856
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
ah, this is kind of crappy, I don't really want to buy this, this doesn't look very good,

857
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and it doesn't respond very well, it doesn't play, it's not fun.

858
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I could see, you know, I'm trying to give Activision the bit of the doubt,

859
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I could see an argument made there where they don't want people's impression of the game to only be through SharePlay.

860
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Okay, then put out a demo.

861
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And I think that's a fair exchange, then put out the demo you want people to see, right?

862
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Because, you know, put out the first level or something like that, or put out whatever.

863
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I mean, put out something then if that's what your excuse is going to be.

864
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But, I don't know, I just, all these other games that are out there now,

865
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I don't see them using this as an excuse.

866
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I could see Activision as, we want to sell more copies of this game,

867
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and god damn it, you're not going to share your copy, you're going to buy a new copy.

868
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
If you really want to play Call of Duty, you're going to buy another copy.

869
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I would actually totally understand if companies wanted to,

870
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
as much as I think SharePlay is really great and everything,

871
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I understand if companies want to be like, you know what, for 30 days we're going to lock it out.

872
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like, I would kind of get that.

873
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay, well then that's fine, but be honest about it.

874
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I mean, I don't know, it's just, we haven't had a chance to test it out yet.

875
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I mean, come on, I don't think they're leaving developers in the dark about this stuff.

876
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And let's be honest here, SharePlay, this is a feature that they were talking about

877
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
when they first talked about the PlayStation 4.

878
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
We've known about SharePlay that it was coming since E3, if not E3 of last year.

879
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I kind of have a hard time believing Activision didn't have some access to a preview 2.0 PlayStation build.

880
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You know, I mean, you have to suspend a little disbelief to believe that, I think.

881
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Well then I guess you better not put any of those Call of Duty games on PlayStation Now

882
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
because they're just not going to play as well over the internet, right?

883
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You know, streaming, it's just not going to work.

884
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
YYR in chat says, but who hasn't played Call of Duty, which actually I haven't.

885
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Hand raised.

886
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We all know how it works, but I've watched other people play it, I will say that.

887
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I actually haven't even watched other people play it.

888
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
To be honest though, the new game is a little bit different.

889
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I mean, the Exosuit stuff makes the game a lot faster than the standard Call of Duty game.

890
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
There's a lot more verticality to it.

891
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It does feel different.

892
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It is, I would think, worthy of a demo or some sort of way to get people to check it out

893
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
because I think it's going to be one of those games that it actually may appeal to people that didn't like Call of Duty in the past.

894
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, to tell the truth, I can't see how share play benefits the game makers.

895
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
To which YYR responds, Fifth Dream, quote, hey, this is pretty cool.

896
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Maybe I'll buy it to play with my other friends.

897
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah, to be fair, I just told you I've never really played Call of Duty, but if Loki could share play it with me,

898
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I would try giving it a go.

899
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What do I have to lose? Time.

900
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'd say time you can't get back.

901
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
That's true.

902
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,000
My understanding of this game is that it's the one where my boyfriend gets called crude expletives by 8-year-olds.

903
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm sorry, that's Xbox Live.

904
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
That's a lot of video games, actually, Marissa.

905
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, it's not so bad on the PlayStation.

906
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Which is why I talked about earlier, it's a good thing that the CEO of one of the biggest companies came out and said,

907
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
you know, there are people at the other side of the monitor, stop it.

908
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'll just be at the kitchen making dinner and I hear all sorts of the crudest of expletives from young children.

909
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm like, oh, Call of Duty today, huh?

910
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You'd be surprised that actually on all the games that I've played on Advanced Warfare, I haven't really heard any of that.

911
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And even like Modern Warfare 2, I haven't really heard a lot.

912
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean, there's a few times you run into a hacker, but that's Modern Warfare 2. It's a fucking old ass game.

913
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Halo is always the worst for me.

914
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Do you think that's more associated with Xbox? People always insist on that.

915
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That there's like people, like more college kids or something.

916
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I think maybe the 360.

917
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Maybe because it was the PlayStation 4 version I'm playing,

918
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
maybe a lot of little kids don't have PlayStation 4s that they're playing Call of Duty on right now.

919
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I don't know.

920
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Marissa, I think the thing you were saying, I think that was a little more unique to 360 versus PlayStation 3.

921
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Maybe so much as the one versus PlayStation 4.

922
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And I would say it was because the 360 came out sooner and it was more affordable.

923
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And at that time, you know, PlayStation 3 took a long time to catch up.

924
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Like it didn't really make headway in that console race until a few years into it.

925
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So I think the Xbox One really was kind of like that predominant system.

926
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But now I don't necessarily know that the stereotype belongs to Microsoft in that regard.

927
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And then also on top of it is now they've added a lot of things since the 360 came out.

928
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And even on PlayStation's side I think where you can rate people.

929
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So if you run across a really annoying little prick that, you know, is just shouting expletives.

930
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
First you can mute him and second you can rate him down.

931
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And I think, I don't know, I haven't played a lot on 360 recently.

932
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But I know there's definitely people out there like that.

933
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And unfortunately it's little kids.

934
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Because little kids that think they can get away with all sorts of shit because they're anonymous.

935
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And singing. What's with the singing?

936
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Some people just love to sing. I mean, I don't know.

937
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I have heard some of the worst things. Like kids yelling at parents.

938
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Like, oh my god, if I were there I would be spanking you right now.

939
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like for real. Like you little brat.

940
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And props to Sony, I was almost going to buy a new headset.

941
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But then I read up on the patch, or whatever, 1.6 for the PlayStation 4.

942
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It now supports my old headset I have for the PS3, the Sony stereo one.

943
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm like, oh yes, surround sound wireless. Woo!

944
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Alright, well let's move on to talking about some classics here for a minute.

945
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
No, not the classic game of the week yet. We'll get there in a little bit.

946
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
But let's talk about what the EFF, or Electronic Frontier Foundation, did.

947
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
They actually filed a petition with the Library of Congress and the United States Copyright Office this past week.

948
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Over modifying abandoned games, especially those that you need an online connection to prevent piracy.

949
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
You know how this was a trend we started to see in games.

950
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Probably about 10 years ago it started to pop up here and there in some games.

951
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So what the EFF wants is they want the laws to be modified.

952
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So mods that strip out these authentication checks will be fair.

953
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Because if the developers take the servers offline and are done, then people still want to play these games.

954
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So people should be able to mod them to take this out, and that should be legal.

955
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Civilization V and Mario Kart Wii cited as examples in the petition.

956
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Though there's many, many, many games.

957
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I know Mario Kart Wii, but I thought Civ V you could still play online.

958
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But maybe that'll be something down the road.

959
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Why would Mario Kart Wii need online to play?

960
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You'd, well you'd, but, I guess that's true, huh?

961
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That doesn't make any sense.

962
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Maybe in that case it was a modification to be able to play online on a private server?

963
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm thinking that's what, when I read it I thought that's what it was.

964
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
That you'd be able to basically run your own servers, I guess.

965
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
To play those Nintendo Network stuff.

966
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I could see maybe also, maybe it's both.

967
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That it's multiplayer servers and it's authentication servers.

968
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I wish more developers would realize that there are people there that still really want to play classic games and do this themselves.

969
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Like if they're going to turn off these servers, allow people to do custom servers themselves.

970
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
We've seen some games do this.

971
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Like I remember when Phantasy Star Online was sunsetted on PC.

972
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They were really good about being able to export your data to set up custom servers and so forth.

973
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Like they kind of embraced that, and I always thought that should have been like a model for others.

974
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But speaking of MMOs, like Phantasy Star.

975
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
The petition did note that MMOs and persistent world games would be exempt from the change.

976
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Since the audio visual content is primarily stored on the developer server and not in the client.

977
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Speaking of old games and the ever controversial quote unquote abandonware.

978
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
This link circulating Facebook.

979
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I thought we might have mentioned this last week, but last week was a week ago.

980
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So forgive me if I'm mentioning this again, but with good reason because this is really cool.

981
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The Internet Archive has put out the Internet Arcade.

982
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Over 900 classic arcade games you can play for free inside your browser.

983
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's basically MAME that's endorsed by the Internet Archive.

984
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That's essentially what it is.

985
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah, but who's the Internet Archive?

986
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's a company in San Francisco, I believe, whose sole mission is to archive everything that's on the Internet.

987
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The Wayback Machine.

988
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's archive.org.

989
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It's where you find your old GeoCities page.

990
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Yes, and I have.

991
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Hey, I still haven't seen my old AOL Ranma page.

992
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I should go check and see if my GeoCities page is there.

993
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I know, right?

994
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You might be able to go see the old Orange Launch Radio website, the old site we had for that.

995
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
But here's my thing.

996
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's like, yeah, I understand it's MAME and stuff and these are ROMs, but is this legal?

997
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I mean, because if it is legal that I can just play these for free.

998
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Then what's to stop me from like...

999
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Doesn't copyright expire on hardware after 25 years?

1000
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Hence why we have systems like the Retron 5?

1001
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I don't know what the thing is, but this isn't hardware, though.

1002
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
This is software.

1003
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There are arcade machines.

1004
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
There are arcade machines, but it's emulating the arcade machine.

1005
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's data stored on chips.

1006
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's emulating the hardware.

1007
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
This is the legal gray area that we live in.

1008
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This would be the same argument they'd be making in court.

1009
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm just surprised that, especially with Bionic Commando being in there,

1010
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I'm surprised Capcom hasn't said, ah, we're going to sue you.

1011
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I am kind of surprised they're able to do this, especially because it really wasn't that long ago

1012
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
where on Nintendo Wii, Virtual Console had arcade games in it.

1013
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I want to say that Mappy and some of the Namco classics were a part of that.

1014
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Don't you remember that?

1015
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1016
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And every now and then we get those retro arcade collections,

1017
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
like the infamous OLR Cameo in the Namco collection.

1018
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Yeah, Namco, yeah.

1019
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, Dig Dug.

1020
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It seems like there's all sorts of cools and ghosts.

1021
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There's another Capcom game there.

1022
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Frogger from Atari.

1023
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
They put Nintendo games in there.

1024
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Is Donkey Kong in there?

1025
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I was just looking for that.

1026
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I don't believe Donkey Kong is in there.

1027
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Maybe that would be the one where I'd be like, you know,

1028
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
if they put a Nintendo game in there, they're the ones that really go after their old IP.

1029
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Mario Brothers original would be another one to look at?

1030
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
No Mario Brothers.

1031
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Marvel Madness though is in there.

1032
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Interesting.

1033
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But see, that's what I'm kind of wondering.

1034
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's like, okay, so if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?

1035
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Like Street Fighter II?

1036
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I mean, that's pretty well known.

1037
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So if these are all on here, is that like completely legit?

1038
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Like say, you know, if I had an...

1039
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Granted, I'm going to put whatever the fuck I want on my own MAME machine,

1040
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
but like let's say, you know, I put these 900 ROMs on there,

1041
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
so that's completely legit, right?

1042
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It says it's on here for free.

1043
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I'm assuming that that's free for me to use as well on my machine.

1044
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's a good question.

1045
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And let's, you know, take it a step further.

1046
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
You know, people, when they make MAME machines and stuff like that,

1047
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
when you sell them on eBay, you're not allowed to sell ROMs with them

1048
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
because they're copyrighted.

1049
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
But if these are all free of copyright,

1050
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
because now that they're available on the internet for free...

1051
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Oh, and Tron's on there, by the way.

1052
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Fifth Dream Notes in our chat room.

1053
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
They have Pac-Man Plus, but no other Pac-Mans,

1054
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
so there must be some rhyme and reason to it.

1055
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So...

1056
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Namco.

1057
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah.

1058
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So I'm wondering, like, you know, if that would be legit or something.

1059
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I don't know.

1060
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
There's a lot of Konami games on there because the first game I played,

1061
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
because, you know, it's an alphabetical list, and I was like,

1062
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Amidar, I like that game. That's a Konami game.

1063
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Space Harrier.

1064
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Ooh, there you go.

1065
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
All right, well, anyway, I'm sure many of you have already checked that out,

1066
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
but just in case you haven't, check that out.

1067
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Archive.org, I believe.

1068
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
The full link was...

1069
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Archive.org slash details slash internet arcade.

1070
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Perfect. Thank you.

1071
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
One more story before release date.

1072
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Dark Sakura.

1073
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Mass Effect.

1074
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
What? You have my attention.

1075
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Mass Effect All the Things.

1076
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yes.

1077
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
All the Things.

1078
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Yes.

1079
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Well, there is a sort of poll out there.

1080
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Kind of a poll.

1081
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Do you like Mass Effect? Yes or sure.

1082
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yes or no.

1083
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The fuck you mean do I like Mass Effect?

1084
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Basically, the current Bioware boss, Aaron Flynn,

1085
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
was on a post on NeoGaf, basically,

1086
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:16,000
listing what the most requested features you'd ever heard for a Mass Effect trilogy re-release.

1087
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And the ideas were basically 1080p, 60 frames per second support,

1088
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
high-res textures, especially for Mass Effect 1, and seamless DLC.

1089
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And basically, that's one thing that he said that would definitely be included if it were done,

1090
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
where the DLC would be as if it were already parts of the game.

1091
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
At places in the game, it would make sense.

1092
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Maybe some new multiplayer maps just for fun.

1093
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Just as the icing on the cake.

1094
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
A little more multiplayer.

1095
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, here's a quote too.

1096
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
ME3 combat mechanics in ME1 comes up relatively often,

1097
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
but it's not on my radar against speaking personally.

1098
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
First, it would be a hell of a lot of work.

1099
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Secondly, I hate the idea of us being accused of retconning ME1.

1100
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Basically, the big thing is that there really are addresses that people have asked for.

1101
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
He said, there's no plans right now, but the quote says,

1102
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
when we do, we'll share ASAP.

1103
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, soon needs to happen sooner.

1104
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Soon needs to be like now.

1105
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Right.

1106
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
How soon is now, to quote.

1107
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
BioWare, you shut your mouth.

1108
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
How can you say, we're going about things the wrong way?

1109
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I am human, and I need Garrus' love.

1110
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I need to love Garrus.

1111
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Just like anybody else does.

1112
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Marisa just gave a toast.

1113
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Alright.

1114
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Do you know Garrus?

1115
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Of Garrus, Marisa, have you seen the character?

1116
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I know, yes.

1117
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I'm sure Jamie's told you a lot.

1118
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Absolutely.

1119
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
That voice.

1120
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Guy's goofy looking, by the way.

1121
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Utterly goofy looking, and he's got the hottest voice.

1122
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
This tells you a lot about the people in real life.

1123
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And he was in a really bad episode of Buffy.

1124
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
He does say a radio phrase for nothing.

1125
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Now, Marisa, you're a very lovely lady.

1126
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Thank you.

1127
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But he was also in a really bad episode of Buffy, which I don't hold against him.

1128
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Alright.

1129
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Well, let's talk about some things coming out a whole lot sooner than a Mass Effect remake.

1130
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Loki, release dates.

1131
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
This week we have lots of stuff coming out.

1132
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Starting off with Pro Evolution Soccer 2015.

1133
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

1134
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
The Halo, the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One this week.

1135
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Minecraft, the PlayStation Vita edition on, obviously, the Vita.

1136
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Assassin's Creed Unity on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1137
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Assassin's Creed Rogue on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1138
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Hello Kitty Racing on 3DS.

1139
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yay! Except that series actually isn't that good.

1140
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
You're the guy who has Kitty the Cool.

1141
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't think I bought that for myself.

1142
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You bought that when I got Vibribin.

1143
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, that's right.

1144
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1145
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The Wii U, the 3DS, and I believe the Vita as well.

1146
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Oh, and probably PC to go along with that.

1147
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric on the Wii U, as well as Sonic Boom Shattered Crystal.

1148
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
That's the new Sonic game that he has longer legs.

1149
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Tropico 5 on Xbox 360.

1150
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Digimon All-Stars Rumble on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1151
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Danger of the Ooze on 3DS.

1152
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
As opposed to the Secret of the Ooze, now it's the Danger of the Ooze.

1153
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's the Danger of the Ooze.

1154
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Will Vanilla Ice be there to tell us, go Ninja, go Ninja, go?

1155
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
No, but he'll be there to build him a house.

1156
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Let's see what you did there.

1157
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Let's see, Payday 2, the Safe Cracker edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1158
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Shape Up on Xbox One.

1159
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor on PC.

1160
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
What else? Am I missing something?

1161
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If you really want to shop at GameStop, Tales of Heart R is an exclusive for the Vita at GameStop.

1162
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
For the record, by the way, in my defense about goofy looking guys, I did marry Dan.

1163
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Well, he's the goofiest of them all.

1164
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I mean that with love.

1165
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
He is kind of goofy looking.

1166
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But that Tales of Heart R is not on the online store.

1167
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I don't know.

1168
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Interesting. I would be surprised if it was.

1169
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Lisa, it may be online, but they may have the physical version exclusive to GameStop.

1170
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Interesting. Let's look at Japan.

1171
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Last week was a slow week in Japan and this week makes up for it.

1172
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
There's a lot more coming out in Japan this week.

1173
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
On the PlayStation 4, Battlefield 4 Premium Edition.

1174
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, their edition that's subtitled is out this week.

1175
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
There is a new camouflage DualShock 4, I believe, to match that.

1176
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And World Soccer winning 11 2015.

1177
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That's Konami's big soccer series.

1178
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It's huge.

1179
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
That is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

1180
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Xbox One also gets the Call of Duty release and winning soccer, or sorry, excuse me, World Soccer winning 11 2015.

1181
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
There's also some new Xbox console collector sets for Xbox One out there in Japan this week to try and motivate some sales, I suppose.

1182
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
PlayStation 3 gets Call of Duty.

1183
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
World Soccer winning 11 and Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.

1184
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I do not believe this is the popular dice game that my mom used to play.

1185
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It just happens to have Bunko in the title.

1186
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
This is actually, looks like it's based off like an anime.

1187
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
There's a lot of anime characters fighting each other.

1188
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
There's a girl on a motorbike and people with swords and epic anime cutscenes and all the things you expect in an anime fighting game.

1189
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That is on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1190
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, yes, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare also on the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

1191
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
On the Wii U this week, there is a new Wii U Mario Kart 8 set.

1192
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
32 gig black and white additions coming out.

1193
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,000
There's also a game called Susume Kinopio Taiko comes out this week, which is, oh, it's Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1194
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I did not realize that.

1195
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That's out in Japan this week.

1196
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Wow, they get that way earlier than we do.

1197
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
We have to wait until December for that.

1198
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So that is out in Japan this week.

1199
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And on the Vita, that Dengeki Bunko fighting game is out there as well, including Marginal No. 4, Idol of Supernova is out.

1200
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And there is a new PlayStation Vita Mercury Duo, light pink white version that's out this week.

1201
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Disc Wars Avengers Ultimate Heroes, One Piece Super Grand Battle X,

1202
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and Osawari Tante Ozawa Rina Nameko Rime comes out this week in Japan.

1203
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
There's your Japanese release date.

1204
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So there's actually quite a bit this week.

1205
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Busy week in Japan.

1206
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Dark Sakura.

1207
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You're still getting better every week, Rob.

1208
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Thank you. I'm trying.

1209
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
All right.

1210
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Well, in UK releases on the 12th, we have Retro City Rampage DX.

1211
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And I'm waiting for it to reload once again because, yuck.

1212
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I don't know why it does this.

1213
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I'll have it loaded and it'll be like, no, we're going to reload.

1214
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Okay, so as I was saying, Retro City Rampage DX.

1215
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And we have Toy Box Turbos for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

1216
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
On the 13th, we have Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed Unity.

1217
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:03,000
There's also PES 2015, World of Warcraft, Warlords of Draenor, also known as Warlords of Draeno.

1218
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Warlords of Draeno.

1219
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
As I heard said.

1220
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
We'll unclog that lack of content from the past year.

1221
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And then on the 14th, we have Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham on Fuck Near Everything.

1222
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And that's it.

1223
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Some folks in chat letting us know that that is Toad's name in Japan.

1224
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I didn't pick up on that.

1225
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I actually didn't know that.

1226
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Like, I've probably heard that before, but, you know, I don't play a lot of Japanese Nintendo games.

1227
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So, Kino Game Guru, specifically in chat.

1228
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Kino Pio is what Toad is called in Japan.

1229
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I never realized that.

1230
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So, there you go.

1231
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Alright.

1232
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Just a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1233
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But first.

1234
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Alright.

1235
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
So, apparently, the first DLC for Mario Kart is right around the corner.

1236
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Did not even realize it was that close.

1237
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Probably because I don't have Mario Kart 8.

1238
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
But, Mario Kart 8, the first piece of DLC will come out.

1239
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And, including with that, I guess they've confirmed that when you use your amiibo in Mario Kart 8, you get a character-themed costume for your in-game Mii character.

1240
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And, also, they're gonna have new characters and new courses.

1241
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I believe, if I remember correctly, the first piece of DLC is the Hyrule Cup.

1242
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Or, Triforce Cup, I'm sorry.

1243
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
The Triforce Cup.

1244
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And they've already kind of gone over, I guess, according to the Nintendo Minute video.

1245
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Which courses are going to be in there.

1246
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
So, including with that, Wario's Gold Mine from Mario Kart Wii.

1247
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Rainbow Road from the original Mario Kart.

1248
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Ice Ice Outpost, which is a brand new track.

1249
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And, Hyrule Castle, which I guess has rupees instead of coins.

1250
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And, there's even shortcuts that trigger the secret fountain chime from The Legend of Zelda.

1251
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1252
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That Excitebike track looks really cool, I gotta say.

1253
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
But, that F-Zero track really pisses me off.

1254
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And, then, the Yoshi Cup, which I believe is also part of that.

1255
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yoshi Circuit from Mario Kart Double Dash.

1256
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
The Excitebike Arena, which is a brand new track.

1257
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Dragon Driftway, which is also new.

1258
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And, Mute City, which apparently they said there's no coins on the course except when you drive over the recharge strips.

1259
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And, the entire track is racing her mode.

1260
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Interesting.

1261
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I don't know how I feel.

1262
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
On one hand, it makes me really sad because this means we're never gonna get an F-Zero game again.

1263
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Like, can't Nintendo just announce one for 2016 or something?

1264
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Like, get me a little bit excited, please?

1265
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I love F-Zero.

1266
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
We'll get more details about new games that they're working on.

1267
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And, I'm sure you'll be excited.

1268
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We'll see. We'll see. Alright.

1269
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Well, one of those games that we got some details on is the fact that they're remaking Majora's Mask.

1270
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It was announced that the Majora's Mask remake is going to be coming out for the 3DS in Spring of 2015.

1271
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You know what? There's a lot of fans that really wanted this.

1272
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I wasn't huge on Majora's Mask, but there are some people that this is their favorite Zelda in the whole series.

1273
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So, you know what? I'm glad they're getting this remake.

1274
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Because the remake of Ocarina of Time, again, I hold the unpopular opinion that the Nintendo 64 Zeldas really never match the Super Nintendo Zelda for me.

1275
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But, that's my opinion.

1276
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I share that with you.

1277
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I know. But, other people think we're totally wrong.

1278
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And, you're entitled to be wrong.

1279
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That's right. So, some people love this Majora's Mask.

1280
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And, they do look really good in 3D. At least the Ocarina of Time did.

1281
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So, the fact that Majora's Mask is getting that same treatment is pretty cool.

1282
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So, you'll be able to experience that in Spring of 2015.

1283
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And, they did a whole little announcement trailer during their Nintendo Direct.

1284
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Now, speaking of Zelda games, Amiibo figures will work with Hyrule Warriors.

1285
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So, if you do happen to get an Amiibo character, you can use that on Hyrule Warriors.

1286
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
If you use the Link Amiibo, for example, you'll get the Spinner.

1287
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
This is a weapon that was originally in Zelda Twilight Princess.

1288
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Other figures are just going to give you random weapons, materials, or rupees.

1289
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So, it's basically, hey, if you spent money on this stuff in real life, we'll give you something in the game.

1290
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So, I mean, it's not like you're going to be playing as Princess Peach in Hyrule Warriors.

1291
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And, if you thought that was ever going to be the case, you were...

1292
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Can we get Mushroom Kingdom Warriors? Because that would be pretty sweet.

1293
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Actually, that would be fucking rad.

1294
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I'd like to see something like that, Dynasty Warriors cross Mario. That would be amazing.

1295
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But, sadly, probably not going to happen.

1296
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Alright, DarkStalker, you have another story for us.

1297
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I do, and it's also about Amiibos.

1298
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Although, I really feel like extending the Mii because it's two eyes.

1299
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Amiibo!

1300
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But, apparently, there is going to be some talk, because third parties have shown interest in using the Amiibo technology.

1301
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And, they might be allowed to use them, to have them of their own.

1302
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Or, to be able to use them in their own franchises.

1303
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
What third party game? Sorry, somebody had to say it. Somebody had to say it.

1304
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
No, Sega would be the likely candidate, right?

1305
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Probably Sega. Maybe some Capcom?

1306
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I mean, I know that this doesn't mean that the third parties get to make Amiibos, but I could totally see where Nintendo would produce a Sonic Amiibo for Sega.

1307
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I mean, it's still a hugely popular character. Just none of his friends.

1308
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,000
If Mario was able to go into, say, Sonic Boom, Rise of Lyric, or something like that, would he have extra long legs, too?

1309
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Would they give him all lanky legs?

1310
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Except, I guess, Waluigi would be perfectly fine there.

1311
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, the quote from Damon Baker, who is the Nintendo of America licensing manager, says that they've been getting some creative ideas coming from third parties, and they're working on opportunities for next year.

1312
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Sorry, I can't hear you over my machine printing all that money.

1313
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when, you know, gaming was a little bit simple. You didn't need all this other stuff to attach to your game to get stuff.

1314
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You just put in the game, insert cartridge, and play game. Hurray. It's the classic game of the week.

1315
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And, again, I find myself without the music, so I suddenly have made this the new song.

1316
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It's for the classic game of the week. Oops. Hey, I got off a plane three hours ago. Give me a break.

1317
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
But not literally.

1318
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Figuratively got off a plane three hours ago. Although, that wasn't a lot. Yes.

1319
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Uh, I left the- I got you around 4-4. It's not quite 7-40 yet.

1320
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I literally am sick of this conversation. Alright. The classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

1321
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Misuse of literally makes me figuratively insane. How about- I'm gonna come over there and bop you with this mic, and it'll hurt.

1322
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'll throw up on you.

1323
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
These things are foam coated, it might not. What's the classic game of the week?

1324
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Star Wars trilogy arcade.

1325
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Cause I'm still going with the Sega model 3 theme.

1326
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You would pick a game that has the, uh, you know, March of Darth Vader in it, or what do they call it? The Death March?

1327
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
We just have to start with the very beginning, and then we can skip forward a little bit. But the 26 minute mark?

1328
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So yeah, you would pick this.

1329
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I remember this in the arcades when we were playing DDR.

1330
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oh yeah, this game was awesome.

1331
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I wonder if James Earl Jones ever messes with people on the phone that call him.

1332
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I would.

1333
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't know, I'm just now imagining him saying, hello, this is Mufasa.

1334
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Tell us about the game!

1335
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Fuck! Star Wars, shit!

1336
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Um, okay. It came out in 1998. It's a 3D rail shooter that was based off of Star Wars.

1337
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And it had, uh, also, uh, it actually came out at the same time that these special editions did.

1338
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Um, it also came out with the Star Wars trilogy pinball game, so it was sort of like this big batch of Star Wars all at the same time.

1339
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And it was the second in Sega's Star Wars arcade series preceded by Star Wars arcade.

1340
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And, uh, followed by Star Wars Racer arcade that came out in 2000.

1341
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So it basically has two, uh, big themes which are reenactments from the first, uh, three star, from the actual three Star Wars movies instead of the shit ones that didn't exist at the time.

1342
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Um, they have two missions each and a bonus battle, uh, against either Darth Vader or Boba Fett.

1343
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Um, the normal gameplay has you moving across here around and shooting shit.

1344
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And you have a special event button at certain points that will, uh, highlight and trigger different events on screen.

1345
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Uh, your first, uh, basically your, uh, first mission is, uh, the battle that you have in the X-Wing, uh, against the TIE Fighters.

1346
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And then, um, the second part is, uh, flying around the Death Star shooting, you know, Darth Vader's TIE Fighter.

1347
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And the third part is basically the trench run.

1348
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So the Empire Strikes Back has the Hoth battle.

1349
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Um, the second part has, uh, the escape from Hoth and, uh, you know, shooting, you know, going around in the Millennium Falcon.

1350
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And the third part is in the hangar shooting, uh, snowtroopers and a wampa.

1351
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Poor wampas. They never asked for that.

1352
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And Return of the Jedi has you doing the speeder bike reenactment.

1353
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Then you, uh, move toward the base on Endor and the last one you have to, uh, basically just shoot down a walker.

1354
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
The game's very final mission has you as an X-Wing pilot to destroy the second Death Star.

1355
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It also has the bonus stages, like I said. One of them you use a lightsaber to def, uh, deflect Boba Fett's blaster shots.

1356
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
And then the last one is versus Darth Vader on the second Death Star.

1357
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Really freaking good game, um, especially for its time.

1358
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It was really, I'd say, it threw back to having the old original Star Wars arcade, but it was just really fun.

1359
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And I still think that, you know, graphically and playwise it still holds up today.

1360
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So, that's the classic game.

1361
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Let's hear it for the Sega Model 3.

1362
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
It was also specifically on the Step 2.1 hardware.

1363
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Give us some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1364
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Dungeon Buster says, you could kill the wampas on Hoth, but you had the button mash like crazy, which with the joystick could look a little embarrassing.

1365
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
A friend of mine was really good at the game.

1366
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
YYR says, I have to say, Star Wars trilogy arcade bordered on really unfun when the difficulty was set to maximum.

1367
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
The game basically bends you over and takes your wallet. Other than that, awesome.

1368
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Well, yeah, if you have it on normal difficulty, though, it was super fun.

1369
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And yes, there was a lot of money spent on this machine by me.

1370
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You don't say.

1371
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Like, I'm tired of playing DDR. I'm gonna go shoot some TIE Fighters.

1372
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Fair enough, fair enough. It was a fun game. It was really cool for the time, too.

1373
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It just reminded me of something. Remember how we've been trying to get people to, you know, submit us, you know, stuff in the mailbag or, you know, the participate email?

1374
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Sure.

1375
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And how we were punishing them with music from the, uh, what was it?

1376
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

1377
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I think...

1378
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Paris' eyes just lit up like, please don't.

1379
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh my god.

1380
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I think that instead we should be punishing them with music from the Star Wars dance section of the game.

1381
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Oh, the Kinect Star Wars.

1382
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
The Kinect Star Wars music?

1383
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I don't remember the popular music, but we changed them to have Star Wars lyrics. Would be quite appropriate, I think, for punishments.

1384
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Uh, let's consider that maybe for a future week. I think that will be, we'll put that challenge out, uh, soon.

1385
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I'll be absent that day.

1386
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Alright.

1387
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
These aren't the droids you're looking for. Oh my god.

1388
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Alright, um, we're gonna take a break. Actually, remember the chatroom didn't really, like, hate the Kim Kardashian music.

1389
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
We were playing it on air, and we were like, it's actually not that bad.

1390
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Like, the Kim Kardashian game music is, it's kinda like, you know, it loops an awful lot, but it's not awful.

1391
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Masochist level low.

1392
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Alright, uh, we're gonna take a break, guys. When we come back, there's plenty more of Orange Dance Radio.

1393
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Rapid Fire News, the Fugu question of the week, which sadly was only the Facebook question of the week this week, that was my bad.

1394
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I'll explain why when we come back. Uh, and your emails that you may or may not have sent, and plenty more.

1395
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
We're gonna talk to Marissa about voice acting as well, let her expand a little bit on, so you want to be a voice actor.

1396
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Uh, so we'll talk a little bit about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1397
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 9th of 2014, with episode number 574 of our program.

1398
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:32,000
If you're just joining us here live at the Voice of the Geese Network at voggetnetwork.com, I am just back from BlizzCon, and I had the hilariously timed, uh, vacation where I was going to BlizzCon and going to be in LA, the same time that our dear friend of the show, Marissa, would be up here in Sacramento.

1399
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But we're fortunate that it didn't totally crisscross, so she's able to join us here tonight. So, hello again, Marissa.

1400
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Hello.

1401
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Now, earlier in the show we were talking about, um, that you, you were gonna tell a longer story, but I wanted to get right into the game news for some of our, you know, podcast people that, you know, I want my, I want my commentary, I want my Loki rant as soon as possible tonight, let's get to it.

1402
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But now that we're a little deeper into the show, I thought, you know, I think there are a lot of people that might be curious, like, what do you go through to become a voice actor? How did you get down this path?

1403
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
So, Marissa, how do I become a voice actor?

1404
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
As I said earlier, now we're gonna transition the show just completely off topic into Rob Marissa's giggle time.

1405
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
That's A-OK. I think some of our listeners would be A-OK with that.

1406
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Well, it's just one of those things that you can't even just talk about yourself, you know, like, hey, I do this because everybody has to know, you know, how do I do it?

1407
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And then it also explains, you know, what I've been doing, but, um, excuse me, that's a great moment to voice over right now.

1408
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
That's all right. I always tell people hiccups are like the internet radio guy's, like, biggest enemy, so, you know, it happens.

1409
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Oh, yes, my allergies came up here.

1410
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh, yes. Welcome to Sacramento.

1411
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I was like, I don't have these down south. I got them up here, though.

1412
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
That's okay. You're breathing in cancer living down there, so.

1413
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That's true. Watch out for those sentient yellow clouds that follow you around.

1414
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Hey, I don't live in, um, that foggy place that we go up to on the five. That's different.

1415
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Anyway, anyway.

1416
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Um, uh, it's just something that I always want to do, and I was inspired.

1417
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I was actually studying to be an animator as a child, and then I watched behind the scenes, and they were showing the voice acting, and I've always been in love with the human voice.

1418
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It's just, it's such a versatile instrument, and, you know, animation combined with that, and then, you know, games.

1419
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I'm going to have to send you the bit from Mass Effect 3 where Trainer talks about wanting to lick Edie's voice.

1420
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You ever had somebody tell you, I want to lick your voice.

1421
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I wish it was voice.

1422
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
If your voice had a body, I would lick it from head to toe.

1423
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Anyway, stop interrupting her. Stop interrupting her.

1424
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Sorry, sorry.

1425
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Uh, I guess, though, um, uh, it's interesting, like, thinking about it, because I know there are people most, every time, again, when you say this is what you're doing, people ask what to do to get ready to get into it.

1426
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It's funny, because the industry has changed so much with the internet, as so many industries have.

1427
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But the one thing that stays consistent is that you still have to be the best.

1428
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I came back from a major convention that I was blessed to attend, and I'm lucky to live in a major hub.

1429
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But there's just so many opportunities, it's really easy to get caught up.

1430
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Not a lot of people know that the first, you know, the thing that most people make the bulk of their income on is commercial.

1431
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Because there's going to be, you know, thousands of commercials per one video game, per, you know, one piece of animation.

1432
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And there's a website, actually, called voicebank.net, and you can look up all of your favorite actors, their demos will be posted there.

1433
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Huh. David Hayters is pretty fun.

1434
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And if you want to talk about talent, I mean, it's always amazing to listen to, you know, all the different, like, you know, those types of leaps and bounds.

1435
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But when you listen to somebody within a constrained space, you know, like when they have to do, like, you know, Rob Paulson, he's your friendly Honda dealer.

1436
01:33:47,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You know, in addition to, you know, Pinky, when you listen to someone's commercial demo, and then you start to recognize them, it's fascinating to realize how much versatility they can demonstrate in a constrained space of, you know, being a regular guy.

1437
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Wait, so me being a regular guy, could I just upload what I think are good Rob Roberts voices to this voicebank.net, or?

1438
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Believe it or not though, what you said though, as being a regular guy, that is the style of advertising that you hear right now.

1439
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Well, we talk about this right now. Like, when we talk about the class, like, people don't want to hear that anymore. Our generation is too simple.

1440
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
You know what happened to the wacky morning DJs? They all got replaced.

1441
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah, no more morning zoo. You want some free t-shirt.

1442
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:38,000
So, yeah, though, they are obsessive about that when you, you know, take classes, listen to what you like to hear on television and radio.

1443
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Like, as a good friend of mine says, you know, find styles that you like, because it starts with emulating for a lot of people, but you have to learn to go out of that, because you listen to all your favorite, when you're talking about games and animation.

1444
01:34:49,000 --> 01:35:02,000
When you listen to your favorite people, they will constantly tell you it is not about the voice, which confuses people, because these people, you know, like, Greg Berger and Rob Paulson and Tress McMeel, like, they can do such beautiful, beautiful and wildly, you know, versatile voices.

1445
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It's because if you can't act, it doesn't matter. You know, you still have to be underneath all of that. You have to be able to act first.

1446
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I remember seeing this guy come to our group. He had this beautiful, you know, like, Don LaFontaine type voice, but he didn't know how to connect with what he was reading, and that's what you have to learn to do.

1447
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:36,000
But now, thanks to the internet, I mean, you can, you know, with a microphone at home, you can, you're capable of pursuing a career at home. They make that sound way, you know, much easier than it actually is.

1448
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,000
It's not like that is, hey, kids, just get a computer and plug in and you could be a voiceover star. No, but it's given a lot more opportunities.

1449
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And you just, you know, like in any entertainment field, you have to be careful and focused because at the end of the day, the most competitive thing you have is to be the best.

1450
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:02,000
It's interesting because there's a lot of parallels there to podcasting and some things that are like completely opposite because, you know, any idiot with a microphone can podcast. Hey, how you doing?

1451
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Many of them shouldn't.

1452
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Well, no, you know.

1453
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Okay, okay. There are people who should, I think, think their ideas through a little more.

1454
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Yes, yes, that's exactly it.

1455
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:31,000
But a lot of this stuff about driven and really like striving to be the best and I think just kind of having that drive is so crucial because if you, like, if we didn't sound like we wanted to be here at Orange Lawn Radio, would we have people listening to us?

1456
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Well, that's why it's called acting.

1457
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Well, not that I'm going to play any of this garbage coming out this week, but we have these fucking games coming out and this whole industry is a joke.

1458
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Which is true.

1459
01:36:49,000 --> 01:37:05,000
On the other hand, though, it's really easy to replace, though, drive for the drive to be the best, you know, because, you know, you can go to all of the podcast conventions and you can obsess about your Facebook page, but, you know, you could completely lose track of being good at your podcasting.

1460
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
You know, that's what you have at the end of the day and, of course, the first step to that is, you know, honing your talent.

1461
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You can do that privately and here's the thing I always tell people, too, is that, you know, record at home and you can do that and it's pretty easy, you know, to do it nowadays or even on your phone.

1462
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And then, like, you know, continue to practice, but like a month later or two, you know, listen back on what you did.

1463
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And if you think you were fantastic, you're a bad actor.

1464
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
You're right. We are our own worst critics.

1465
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I always listen to O.L.R. and it's not that, like, I like the sound, I like to hear my own voice.

1466
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
In fact, that's actually, I'm not like, who is that nasally gay guy on that show?

1467
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
But, like, you know, it's a, I am my own worst critic, you know, and I will fix the problems.

1468
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Of course, but, you know, we're artists. We're all broken on the inside.

1469
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:56,000
But the thing being, though, if you're like, oh, I can do this crazy, I'm so great because I can do these voices.

1470
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Like, if you, if you listen to that a month later and you think that you're great, then you haven't grown.

1471
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Because right now I'm up here and I have a friend of mine who's a recording engineer and Lord knows that there's plenty of those in L.A.

1472
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
But he's a good friend of mine and I love working with him and I'm working on another demo.

1473
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And it'd be really easy to go, you know that thing I did? Shit, I'm good.

1474
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
But if you look back and you think that, it means you haven't grown.

1475
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Like, my friends go, aren't you beating yourself? I go, no, I know what to do now. I can do it better.

1476
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Act F in our chat room says, actually, it's about acting in games journalism. Anyway.

1477
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Slow clap for you, Act F. Slow clap for you. All right, look.

1478
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So when you say practice, what does that mean? Should I, should I invent a character? Should I try to emulate something I've already seen?

1479
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Like, can I practice doing my Grover? Near, far, near, far.

1480
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Should I practice my own Grover for a while or should I come up with my own thing?

1481
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Well, you, like, if you were to just specifically do that, you would take your, like, a lot of funny and good character voices and characters have come from a bad impression of somebody else.

1482
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But it's true, though, like, not that that was bad. But no, like, some, like, they weren't able to do it correctly and it turned into another character.

1483
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,000
But if you, let's just say you don't have an acting background, like, you would write down a little sheet and, you know, like, you know, it's like a, you would write it down like, like you would a gaming character, though.

1484
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Like, if you're doing RPG, you would write down your character and that's the way you remember it, too, because it's not a voice.

1485
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Everything that you love and the people that, that do what you love, it's, it's because they're all indistinct characters, not just funny voices, you know.

1486
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Although, I do have a funny story about Jim Cummings and I told this to him and it's so cute because I did a show with one of his, one of his kids and this girl kept saying, oh, you know, she was so sweet.

1487
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I just got a kick out of her, but she's like, my dad keeps embarrassing me. And I go, why? And she goes, he does voices.

1488
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And I was a 12-year-old, 14-year-old, like, voiceover geek and I don't know why this didn't occur to me, but all of a sudden her dad comes to pick her up at the cast party and it's Jim Cummings.

1489
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I'm like, oh, yeah. Like, her last name, I just, you know, and I told him the story and he laughed because it's true, he's talking about how, you know, your kids, you know, you're never cool to your kids.

1490
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
L.A. can be hilarious like that though.

1491
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But their friends are like, come on, please do it. She's like, dad, don't, please. So he's delightful and wonderful as well.

1492
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So I know that voice is a great documentary. It's on Netflix right now.

1493
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Yes.

1494
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Yeah.

1495
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Jeff just talked about.

1496
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:35,000
It's also on, oh, the premiere that was so much fun. You're on the people that you love in the bathroom. And June Ferre, she's like this big and amazing.

1497
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Amazing, flawless goddess of the universe. I, oh my God, June Ferre.

1498
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I also recommend, of course.

1499
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Magic of the Spell, right? You've all played the DuckTales game, Magic of the Spell, June Ferre.

1500
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That's true.

1501
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
No, no, don't even, you have to go further than that. Rocket Jay Squirrel.

1502
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Fair enough.

1503
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yeah, Natasha. Also, you know, Rob Paulson's podcast is amazing talking tunes and on Netflix.

1504
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
It is still weird hearing him as Donatello, just saying.

1505
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And on Netflix, it's funny because for me and a lot of people get a kick out of seeing it, you know, in a fictional like narrative form in a world.

1506
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And I still need, I still want to watch that.

1507
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
The trailer for that was.

1508
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Yeah.

1509
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah, that's the movie where the idea is that people are volleying to be the next Don LaFontaine.

1510
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Let me ask you before we get back into gaming news, because I do have to get back to that channel.

1511
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Let me ask you one more question here, and that would be specifically about, you know, practicing.

1512
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And here's one common practice. You know that Twitch TV is a thing, right?

1513
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You know Twitch TV and the people who are playing the video games on it.

1514
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
This is something I see on Twitch TV all the time.

1515
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And that is people are playing role playing games and they decide they're going to act out the dialogue text that's on the screen.

1516
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And they like to read it, you know, you spoonie bard. And they just, they do all these like weird voices that don't even sound.

1517
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Would you encourage that sort of behavior or like, stop, stop, enough, enough.

1518
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Depends on whether you're in public or not.

1519
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Well, Twitch, Twitch is pretty public.

1520
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It just, you know what, you can be as silly as you want, as long as it's not, as long as you believe what they're saying, you know.

1521
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:24,000
And that's a lot of people's method of practice. Of course, you still have to be able to, again, deal with the natural voices.

1522
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
You know, like the commercials. I can't stand it right now, especially as a woman.

1523
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You'll turn on the TV and it's like, hey, come on down to Guitar Center, like you can or you won't, like whatever.

1524
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Like, advertising is fantasy. Like, you'd think you'd want to hear beautiful voices.

1525
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But, you know what, I was wondering too, I was like, why did they use this voice so often?

1526
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Because I've gotten into the world too, but I'm like...

1527
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Hey, you know, sometimes you get that not so fresh feeling.

1528
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Yeah.

1529
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So, that's why there's like, you know, Kotex.

1530
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Get some fucking Tampax.

1531
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Just like, find it at the grocery store, okay?

1532
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
You know what though, maybe the reason they use that ad is because like, especially that Guitar Center ad is like, she doesn't sound like she knows anything about guitar.

1533
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
She doesn't sound enthusiastic about the store, but she kind of sounds like...

1534
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
She's the bored girlfriend.

1535
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
No, the groupie that, you know, you might want to get with.

1536
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And she kind of sounds like that bass player.

1537
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
The vocal fry.

1538
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
YYR says, shit, I need to go to Guitar Center right now.

1539
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
She sounds like the one character on Saturday Night Live that kept one-upping everybody.

1540
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Oh, the Kristen Wiig character. You know that one, the one that would always, she'd one-up everybody with their story.

1541
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Like, you know, yeah, what Alan perked up, what is it? You know this.

1542
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You know that character though.

1543
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
It's like, I gave birth to five baby cows.

1544
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Yeah, you know, I did that one thing.

1545
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Baby arm thing.

1546
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Like, you know, I'm Prince of Tom Cruise, we're really close, yeah.

1547
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yeah, just be as silly as you want, as long as though you do have to make sure that you are acting and in the moment.

1548
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
And there's lots of different theories about that.

1549
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Like, a lot of people don't have any acting background, but they understand music.

1550
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
But either way, you have to, you know, understand a character, understand how having to get in a character and things like that.

1551
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I think if Rob and Marissa ever do a Giggle show, I think we should consider doing a Twitch stream where we act out role-playing games.

1552
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Completely inappropriate voices, I think would be, you know, yeah, you spoonie bard.

1553
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Just play games with dialogue in them, but turn the voice volume down and just make up the voices for them.

1554
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Some people though, like, they've got publicity for themselves.

1555
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I mean, a lot of people that, and through successful YouTube videos, but I mean, you know the same thing.

1556
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
They'll be like, all you need is a microphone.

1557
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
All you need is a camera, get yourself on YouTube and you'll be famous.

1558
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
No, but you know, you know what I mean.

1559
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Like, Melger Solid 5.

1560
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Well, I just can't wait for the show because now I'm imagining we might be playing Mass Effect and it's like, you know,

1561
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Hey you guys, my name's Garrus and I got to go do some calibrations.

1562
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Oh my, who wants a free bubble sticker?

1563
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
All right.

1564
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I'd watch that.

1565
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
All right. Marissa, it's always so lovely to talk to you and I wish you lived up here.

1566
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I do, but I understand you get it. You got to be where your industry is and best of luck with all that.

1567
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And I hope that next time we have you back on the show, you, you are having this huge list of games and anime to promote.

1568
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Cause I know you, I know you could do it.

1569
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
You can go to my site, listen to my demo. You can feel the embarrassment.

1570
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You know, we do, we, believe it or not, we have industry people listen to this show.

1571
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
So you never know where, where's your demo, where people can hear it.

1572
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Marissa Meisel.com. It's M E I Z E L.

1573
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Okay.

1574
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I'll answer to Meisel, but this smells like crack.

1575
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Oh yeah. We have pumpkin pie. Uh, we're distracted now.

1576
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Thank you so much.

1577
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I'll let you ladies get to your pie and we'll get to rapid fire news. Loki.

1578
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
All right. I'll just talk about pie.

1579
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Sorry. SSG 100 Matt in chat says, Oh, it's Wolfman Jack. And this is my favorite spot on the Citadel.

1580
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
All right. Anyway.

1581
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com use the passphrase crowd.

1582
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Loki. Uh, all right. Uh, well, they talked a little bit about, um, the instant game collection for PlayStation network.

1583
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Um, these are going to be the brand new games.

1584
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:17,000
You're going to be able to check out, um, if you're a member of PlayStation plus and because, because, uh, drive club PlayStation plus edition has been kind of delayed for a while now.

1585
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Our first retail game coming to the, um, instant game collection for PlayStation forest in justice, gods among us, the ultimate edition, which is cool because I've not played that game.

1586
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Yeah. I already own it cause I bought it in a mega sale, but I cool that we're taking this step. I can't really be that mad.

1587
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Um, they're also going to have, I guess the standalone infamous, uh, second son expansion, infamous first light.

1588
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Um, so if that's free, that'd be pretty cool because yeah, that's, that'll be interesting. Yeah. And I'm also a secret ponchos and the swapper.

1589
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I'm sorry. First light and the swapper are going to be for January. Whereas the other two work for December.

1590
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I forgot that they put in both months there. Um, see, I didn't see what they had on. Oh, that's only PlayStation four.

1591
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So I don't know what they're going to have for PlayStation three yet, but, um, maybe injustice for PlayStation three.

1592
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It makes sense. So that'd be kind of cool. Um, all right. And then, uh, see here, this is kind of cool.

1593
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Grand theft auto five and you know, they are going to be having the HD remake coming out here in just over a week.

1594
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Not that you're counting down or anything. I don't do the counting down the, my, uh, pre-order does the counting down for me.

1595
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Uh, anyways, so they're going to be having that come out and, um, to go along with that, they're actually going to be putting out the, um, soundtrack for the game on vinyl as well as the CD.

1596
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Um, that's pretty amazing. That's going to be on vinyl now only listen to vinyl and hipsters were a part of the game.

1597
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So, um, it, I guess it's going to include 59 tracks from the game. Um, it's too bad though that they're not actually going to be having, uh, the full soundtrack, which they're going to be including.

1598
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Cause they're adding like 150 some songs, I think into, um, the HD five version of the game.

1599
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:32,000
So I don't know. I'm very interested to play that. Can't wait. Um, but yeah, three CD soundtrack or six, six record vinyl, uh, collection they're going to have there.

1600
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Wow. And uh, how much is that going to cost me? No idea. Probably not going to buy the vinyl cause I obviously don't have any record.

1601
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Wait, I do still have a record player. Yeah. You know what, if hipsters really wanted to do it right, they'd bring back the eight track.

1602
01:48:47,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I mean like a million eight tracks. So just to, you know, true, true. Um, and then last but not least, um, you know, this must be exciting news if you're a fan of Pikmin, but guess what?

1603
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You know, instead of working on say something like, I don't know, a new F zero game, they're going to take, you know, Pikmin three, which was kind of okay, but they're going to make a Pikmin four.

1604
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Um, you know, they're working on games. This is continually launching campaigns after release of software will lay the groundwork for the next iteration of Pikmin in the future.

1605
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And needless to say, uh, we want it to be one of those motivations for potential consumers to purchase a Wii U. We are making a very, or making very, a variety of different efforts.

1606
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I don't think the Wii U, I don't think Pikmin's ever going to be a reason why people purchase the Wii U. I mean, it's, I mean, I think it's, it's more one of those things where it's like it helps bolster it up.

1607
01:49:50,000 --> 01:50:06,000
It's a nice, it's a nice thing to have in the pocket. There are definitely a lot of Pikmin fans out there. Maybe we don't have any hardcore Pikmin people, but I know people that really enjoy the series and so forth, but it doesn't seem like the type of like system seller that Mario or Zelda or even Bayonetta is, you know?

1608
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Um, and to go along with that, Pikmin 3 is also getting a demo, which I'm surprised they didn't have a demo for that yet, but now that's a great idea. Gonna put one out.

1609
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Um, but seriously though, focusing on Pikmin 4 and you haven't even brought F-Zero out yet. I mean, I would think F-Zero would be more of a system seller than say Pikmin.

1610
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Depending on what the whole like, you know, how many resources they're having to pour into it, what they're having to pull from other projects, like it's kind of like one of those, you know, I realize there's enough Pikmin fans out there.

1611
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I'm cool if they want to go down that road and explore Pikmin 4 as long as like it's not coming at the cost of, you know, my dream F-Zero game or hell Animal Crossing Wii U, which I think we all anticipate will be the next big thing they announce at E3 or, you know, whatever.

1612
01:50:49,000 --> 01:51:09,000
So, well, they haven't really announced anything beyond, I mean, they've announced a few things for like 2015, but maybe that could be something that takes place in the second quarter because they haven't really said, you know, I know they have for the first part of the year they've got, what was it, um, Splatoon, but, and I assume Zelda's fourth quarter, so beyond that.

1613
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I know what you're saying, but I keep hearing Splatoon and thinking of my old uncle Roy.

1614
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Very different, very different.

1615
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I know.

1616
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Alright, I got a few stories for you guys. First off, Duke Nukem 3D, the Megaton edition, it is coming to the Vita and the PlayStation 3. I actually didn't know that this was being planned, but if you somehow still haven't experienced Duke Nukem 3D, you know, the good one, then come and get some on the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

1617
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Devolver Digital did announce that on Twitter, January 13th, 2015, and in Europe the next day. I guess this was announced way back in August of 2013, I just somehow forgot, because, you know, I've been happy with my Steam version.

1618
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So, uh...

1619
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
You know, I still haven't played the Steam version even though I bought it. What's...

1620
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Shocking that I bought something on Steam that I have not played.

1621
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I think you should make a note. I think we should, I think we should battle each other this week and stream it or something. That would be fun.

1622
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Come on, Loki, an old school battle.

1623
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I wouldn't be willing to do that.

1624
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Well, God, it's been so long. I used to play the exclusively just keyboard, so I would use like the arrow keys or whatever it was to look around. I would never use the mouse.

1625
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Well, if you are interested in buying somebody's garbage, you can do so. The ET game cartridges that were in the New Mexico desert are now available on eBay.

1626
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:35,000
And I think, I remember we talked about this, like they were going to be going to eBay or something. We just brought this up like the last week, so that's why we're putting this in rapid fire news tonight.

1627
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,000
But they are out there on eBay, and if you want to know how much these are getting, there's one up on eBay for $500.

1628
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I could just take a crap on one of mine and put it on eBay.

1629
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
These cartridges are not guaranteed to work, just so you know.

1630
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Oh, well, then it sounds like a DT.

1631
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:58,000
They have been in a dump for 25 years or so, so yeah. There are other games available, by the way.

1632
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
When I see a game like Sword Quest is available, I'm kind of like, well, that's kind of cool.

1633
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I don't know, there's a part of me that's like, oh god, the big video game fan that I am should own a piece of gaming history like that.

1634
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
But then I'm like, that is fucking garbage. What would I do with a piece of garbage? Can you even hang it on the wall?

1635
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Like, look at this garbage I have up on the wall.

1636
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Shadow boxes.

1637
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:27,000
You could have the arcade, you could have the Atari shit pile shadow box.

1638
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
You could just buy a copy of ET, hit it with a hammer, and put it in a shadow box. It would be just the same.

1639
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I don't know, so, you know what, there's people that are into this and collecting this, and don't let our little cynicism get you down.

1640
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
If this is a piece of gaming history you want to own, then more power to you.

1641
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Where's my HD remake?

1642
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Of ET?

1643
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Yeah.

1644
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Maybe when they release ET2, Electric Boogaloo.

1645
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Anyhow, Luigi's Mansion. Remember that series? Luigi's Mansion is going to be getting an arcade game.

1646
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Here's the funny thing, it's made by Capcom, developed by Capcom.

1647
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,000
The arcade version was being actually tested about a week ago, October 30th to November 3rd.

1648
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But now the arcade game will be coming out.

1649
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
The arcade game is based on Luigi's Mansion 2 that was on the Nintendo 3DS.

1650
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It's only playable in a first person perspective, but Luigi does appear in cut scenes, so it's not like you're never going to get to see him.

1651
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1652
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Summer 2015 is when the game is set to be released in Japan.

1653
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Is it like a shooter? Is it like an on-rails shooter or something like that?

1654
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
No, it's Luigi's Mansion.

1655
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Sounds like it's along the lines of the, maybe like the gun survivor games.

1656
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
You think?

1657
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Perhaps. I'm trying to see if it says anything here.

1658
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Gloomy Mansion is a stage that's in the game.

1659
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
You get an in-game tutorial from Elvin Gadd.

1660
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And there's a Poltergust shaped controller which sucks in ghosts if you shake it.

1661
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And then there's a start button and a bomb button.

1662
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
It sounds very similar to how the game on 3DS controls.

1663
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Well, I know something better than that.

1664
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:06,000
There's going to be the Golden Age of Arcade Gaming on the Nintendo 3DS by Sega.

1665
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Basically we're getting a new batch of Sega 3D classics that are going to be the best of them.

1666
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:21,000
There will be the 3D Fantasy Zone 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.

1667
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Oh, and also After Burner 2 is going to be in early 2015.

1668
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But I don't care about any of the rest of them because Fantasy Zone.

1669
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And I'm sure Dan's going to be happy about having Outrun.

1670
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
But Fantasy Zone is really the best Sega game in the universe.

1671
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And that and Space Harrier.

1672
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:46,000
When I read that earlier this week, I was like, oh, Jamie is going to have some heavy breathing on OLR this week.

1673
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm screaming internally.

1674
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You know that cat picture with heavy breathing?

1675
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I know. I might need new pants.

1676
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
YYR in chat says, OMG, really? Is this happening?

1677
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
This is happening. This shit's going down.

1678
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Jamie's going to be a happy, happy bunny.

1679
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Also, we can finally kill our Sims in the pool.

1680
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yay, Sims 4 has pools.

1681
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
You can drown your Sims, which is the best thing ever.

1682
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I want to make the best ghost house ever once I get Sims 4.

1683
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
There need to be more mods for it.

1684
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Can I make a family and call them the sorrows so I can drown my sorrows?

1685
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I'm going to just have two characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and they're going to be dead.

1686
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Like the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

1687
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
You all got problems.

1688
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
You know what? I only have one problem. It's named Rob.

1689
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It's a problem.

1690
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
You had 99 problems, but a Rob ate one.

1691
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
No, Rob's actually included in problem.

1692
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
You can't have a problem without Rob.

1693
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I would love to see a psychological study on your mental health compared to what you do to your Sims.

1694
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:01,000
You know, when you start writing that paper, I will give you something to write about.

1695
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I was always disappointed in the Sims that you couldn't put a diving board on the second floor of a house

1696
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
so they would be able to dive into the pool that way.

1697
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
You can, but it has to have the pool as an interactive thing.

1698
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But you can actually, there's a code to make items clip and put them anywhere.

1699
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
So you can put a diving board on the second story and have someone jump off of it.

1700
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,000
ActDeft is referencing a years old meme in our chatroom by putting in all caps, pools opened.

1701
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I'm having flashbacks to those theme park games and doing sadistic things in those games.

1702
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Like half finished roller coasters.

1703
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
You mean the hell coaster?

1704
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Like Final Destination 3 reenactments.

1705
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
What was that one ride? Was it like there was the one that was really long? Mr. Bones something?

1706
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
It's been so long since those games.

1707
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I think it was Mr. Bones Wild Riders.

1708
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I just remember the one where then you could ride the ride yourself.

1709
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
In like the first, remember when like virtual reality.

1710
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Oh yeah.

1711
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
They had this roller coaster. They had like a one where you could build the roller coaster and ride it.

1712
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
That was the Disney one because I remember getting that one.

1713
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Because I always, you know, they wanted me to use the chain drive to go up and I was just like,

1714
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I'm just going to have it go in a corkscrew and I'm just going to have accelerators the entire way up.

1715
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
And kill people with G-forces that way.

1716
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, have a family called the Gatsby's and have the game end without them all dead in the pool.

1717
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Alright. Anything else Star Saga?

1718
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Spoilers for an old book.

1719
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Look, Nintendo has confirmed that Splatoon will have a single player mode.

1720
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
They have a trailer out for it now.

1721
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
But yeah, you can be single player.

1722
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So if you only like playing with yourself, you can play with yourself all night.

1723
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I love playing with myself.

1724
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I don't have any friends.

1725
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Single player mode is going to be great for me.

1726
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
At least it's single player and not single handed.

1727
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,000
People are not always available to play Splatoon at my beck and call.

1728
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Marissa, do you plan on playing Splatoon by yourself?

1729
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
What did you ask me about?

1730
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
The Splatoon was the end result.

1731
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I'm asking you about your love.

1732
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
You're not supposed to have an interest in these activities. I'm a female.

1733
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Am I what by myself?

1734
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Even females can love the Wii U.

1735
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Everyone eventually goes Splatoon.

1736
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
What about you? What's the name of the game?

1737
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Myself.

1738
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I've had too much soda. I'm sorry.

1739
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1740
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Where we ask our listeners...

1741
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Well then what are we going to do?

1742
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Giggle time!

1743
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
No, we're definitely doing the foogle question of the week.

1744
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
So here's the thing.

1745
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I might have screwed up.

1746
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
So you all know Loki produced tonight's show.

1747
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Which, by the way, Loki has done a fine job with tonight's show.

1748
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Yeah, it was very last minute.

1749
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Well that's okay. All the shows usually are.

1750
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Wink.

1751
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
But here's the thing.

1752
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So Loki did tonight's show, but Loki actually didn't have admin access on the Google Plus community.

1753
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Because I had no idea that Loki was actually on Google Plus.

1754
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
So I never gave it to him.

1755
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
So he did have admin access to the Facebook community.

1756
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So I apologize to our Google Plus people.

1757
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
The foogle question only went to Facebook.

1758
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:27,000
But usually the foogle question of the week is where our Facebook and Google Plus communities come together to answer a question that we ask of our listeners.

1759
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And asking this week...

1760
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:37,000
With so many releases coming out this holiday season, what is a game you think people might overlook and really should be playing?

1761
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
This is a good question. Good job, Loki.

1762
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
What are people going to forget about?

1763
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
There's a lot of things you can forget about.

1764
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
There's like 50,000 games coming out over the next month or so.

1765
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
What's the one that's going to get swept away that people need to not forget about?

1766
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I think that's a great question.

1767
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So Alan starts us off. Alan Alchemy is saying,

1768
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I keep hearing about this little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition that might be a sleeper hit if enough people gave it word of mouth.

1769
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,000
In all seriousness, I keep hearing about fantasy life on Tumblr from everywhere.

1770
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
It's like a cross of Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, I guess.

1771
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And a ton of people don't really know about it.

1772
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I've heard of this from some of my fellow podcasters that are really into the Nintendo games.

1773
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
But I haven't checked this out myself.

1774
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But that's a great example of one that might be getting lost right now.

1775
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
A little indie effort called Dragon Age Inquisition.

1776
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I doubt anybody's going to be playing that.

1777
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Oh, shut up. Everyone's going to be playing it and shipping everybody with everybody.

1778
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Because that's what we do in BioWare games.

1779
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
We ship.

1780
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
HypnoToad replies and says,

1781
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Final Fantasy VI. Play it. Live it. Love it. So says HypnoToad.

1782
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
See, here's the thing though. Its release is coming out this holiday season.

1783
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Not holiday season 20 years ago.

1784
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
It could be the mobile release because that just came out not that long ago.

1785
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
It could be that.

1786
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
But it is a classic. Why not?

1787
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Didn't they just put, was VI one of the ones they added on Steam?

1788
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Not on Steam yet.

1789
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
But I don't see why it wouldn't happen.

1790
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
But V has to happen first.

1791
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So we'll see.

1792
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Oh, I guess it doesn't have to. They can do whatever the hell they want, really.

1793
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I would say HypnoToad's answer really amounts to,

1794
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Screw the new stuff. Go play a classic.

1795
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I think that's kind of what I'm hearing in that answer.

1796
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
ActDeaf replied and said,

1797
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1798
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,000
The levels on Super Mario 3D World are really fun and get really challenging towards the end.

1799
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Though I expect many to just dismiss this title because it's more of the same in the price.

1800
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But I'm looking forward to it and playing it this holiday season.

1801
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
You know, I gotta say that Nintendo Direct thing that they showed for Captain Toad's Treasure Tractor.

1802
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Say it four times fast.

1803
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Treasure Tractor.

1804
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
That would be awesome.

1805
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
It's just a Mario version of, like, Farming Simulator.

1806
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

1807
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
God, you know what? I would totally play that if it was Farming Simulator.

1808
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Right? Mario Goes Farming? That'd be great. Yeehaw.

1809
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Anyway, seeing the Nintendo Direct and seeing really how varied a lot of it looks,

1810
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I was like, alright, maybe I'm one of those people that's writing this game off and not really giving it a fair shot.

1811
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
So, good example.

1812
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Of course, if you're a Wii U owner only, you know, that's one of the three games you have to buy this holiday.

1813
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Serpingslurpy says, I don't have enough time to play the games I already have, let alone those that are coming out.

1814
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
But one game that hasn't been receiving a lot of attention is The Forest.

1815
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Think survival horror meets Minecraft.

1816
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I think I've heard of that once, but I haven't seen much on it.

1817
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I came super close to buying it, but then I was like, no.

1818
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
AZHP says, with the PlayStation TV out, it's a great time to play games you might have missed with a low investment PSTV at $99.

1819
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:48,000
It's $100 less than Evita, and you can play great games like Persona 4 Golden and Super Danganronpa 1 and 2.

1820
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
PS, shoutouts to Jonas for taking second place at the US Pump Festival yesterday.

1821
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Freestyle is dead, long live Freestyle.

1822
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I heard actually that Jonas, I don't mind you derailing that, because thank you for the reminder.

1823
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I had read a tweet from Jonas that he did very well in that Pump It Up competition.

1824
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
He won second place. National.

1825
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It's amazing.

1826
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
So, where's my video? Pics or it didn't happen.

1827
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I want one of whatever Alan made.

1828
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Yeah, they're cooling right now. He made some cookies is what he made.

1829
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
They're chocolate peppermint cookies.

1830
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
So anyway, less cookies, more video games.

1831
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Crylo responded and said, I agree with Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1832
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Super excited and it looks like so much fun.

1833
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
How about here in studio? I'll just open Mike, whoever wants to answer.

1834
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Any games coming out this holiday that you're afraid people might miss?

1835
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
No.

1836
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
That's tough, because...

1837
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Go outside and play.

1838
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Um...

1839
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Gosh, I don't know. I mean, there's...

1840
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,000
It would probably have to be an indie title, because I'm kind of familiar with a lot of the stuff.

1841
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Yeah, that's where I'm kind of like, I'm like, I feel like there's that indie title I haven't played yet.

1842
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
You know, ironically, I think The Crew.

1843
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I think a lot of people aren't going to be really paying attention to that, because...

1844
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But it looks like an interesting driving game.

1845
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Um...

1846
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Gosh, I don't know. Dragon Age Inquisition, I keep forgetting, is coming out.

1847
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Um, so I may look at that.

1848
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Maybe there was some truth to Alan's answer there.

1849
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Seriously, I mean, I keep forgetting that that game is coming out.

1850
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
If you're on Tumblr, you will never be allowed to forget.

1851
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Um, I've never played Dragon Age, although I have...

1852
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
What is it? Origins, I think, on...

1853
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Origin, so...

1854
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
To be fair, Jamie, if you're on Tumblr, there are a lot of things you're not allowed to forget.

1855
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Oh, I'm not on Tumblr, so...

1856
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
So I guess that's...

1857
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Probably all the better for you.

1858
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It's a scary place.

1859
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I don't know. Straight white men are not allowed on Tumblr.

1860
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Is that, like, is that one of the questions that you have to answer when you sign up for Tumblr?

1861
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Are you straight white male?

1862
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Are you, like, are you...

1863
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It's all checker privilege. Sorry, nope.

1864
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Are you a straight white cis male? Do you need a bodyguard?

1865
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Check here for privilege. No, alright.

1866
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Ah, we kid, we kid, we kid. Alright.

1867
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Uh, let's...

1868
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Let's get to some more stories. Loki.

1869
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Alright.

1870
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Um, let's see.

1871
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Let's talk a little bit about Tony Hawk.

1872
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Yes, Tony Hawk. Who's that guy? I mean...

1873
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
You mean he's relevant?

1874
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
He is, nowadays, I guess.

1875
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Or he's coming back.

1876
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
You know, because he did do a mobile game.

1877
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
You may remember. I was kind of disappointed that it wasn't a console game.

1878
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,000
But, apparently Activision is getting desperate for a Tony Hawk game.

1879
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Because they haven't had one for several years now.

1880
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
So Tony Hawk will be making a comeback.

1881
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Or at least they're going to have another game come out in 2015.

1882
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Please, please Activision.

1883
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:44,000
No games that require some sort of weird looking, you know, snowboard-like controller.

1884
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Because that was stupid. Please don't do that.

1885
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Just make a Tony Hawk game.

1886
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
And I totally played a new Tony Hawk game.

1887
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I'm sorry, cookies.

1888
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I like the pro skater games.

1889
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And Skate 3, though, I do want to try Skate 3 even though that is not a Tony Hawk game.

1890
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Because the glitches look so awesome.

1891
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
You know, it's been on a break for a little bit.

1892
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So, why not?

1893
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Like, I even think it's time to try another Guitar Hero.

1894
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Why not?

1895
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I want a new DJ Hero.

1896
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I want a new DJ Hero.

1897
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Me too.

1898
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
So, I want a new DJ Hero.

1899
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I need to play DJ Hero.

1900
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I've got the controller.

1901
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I was even looking at it the other day.

1902
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I'm like, ooh, I still have DJ Hero.

1903
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah.

1904
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Anyhow, unfortunately you can't play DJ Hero on your PlayStation 4.

1905
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Which is why we need a new DJ Hero.

1906
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
But PlayStation 4, as you know, there was some dramas with the firmware that came out.

1907
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Meaning you couldn't put your PlayStation in rest mode.

1908
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Well, here is patch 2.01 to save the day.

1909
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:43,000
2.01 addresses issues some users have encountered when powering on the system from rest mode.

1910
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Now, I didn't hear if this actually released or not.

1911
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
But I thought I'm hearing it did in Europe.

1912
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
It has.

1913
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It has here.

1914
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Because I updated when I got my system back.

1915
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
And it does work.

1916
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Yay.

1917
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Because I liked rest mode.

1918
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Because that's how you charge your controller when you're not playing.

1919
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Yep.

1920
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
So, alright.

1921
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Good to know that's back.

1922
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
And using the charge controller and using it to download Call of Duty.

1923
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Because it was like 40-some gigs.

1924
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Speaking of updates, Xbox One is getting their last update of the year.

1925
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
And it just started rolling out.

1926
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
And this is where you can now customize the background image for each account's dashboard on the console.

1927
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I guess similar-esque to PlayStation 4 themes.

1928
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:27,000
You can also have locations and bios and six game clips or achievements that you would like to share on your profile.

1929
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
These are the six most meaningful.

1930
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
This is the teabagging moment that really meant a lot to me.

1931
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
So, you can do that on.

1932
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I called some guy an asshole online and didn't get banned.

1933
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:44,000
So, also there's some marketplace tweaks to help make it, you know, more navigatable.

1934
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Also, there's a trending tab in one guide that shows the 20 shows that are most popular with the general Xbox audience.

1935
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Probably Walking Dead, Walking Dead, and Walking Dead.

1936
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Within reason.

1937
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I get a feeling Downton Abbey probably won't be making the list.

1938
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Just call it a hunch.

1939
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Call it a hunch.

1940
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Barefoot Contessa on the Food Network.

1941
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Don't think she's gonna be in the top 20.

1942
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
All my children? Probably not.

1943
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?

1944
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
What?

1945
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Why don't they like the Barefoot Contessa?

1946
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Because it's walking-

1947
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
She makes delicious food!

1948
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
How can you hate delicious food?

1949
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
You can't hate delicious food.

1950
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
You can't eat the delicious food.

1951
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I guess that's where the anger could come from.

1952
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
How dare I? How dare I?

1953
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Is that Rob you were saying something? Because there's cookies.

1954
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I'm in a cookie coma over here.

1955
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
You know what? Barefoot Alan Alchemy just made you all cookies.

1956
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Yeah.

1957
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
So enjoy it.

1958
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Bye, Alan!

1959
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Alright.

1960
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Anyhow, if you want to see more, Major Nelson did a little tour that you can look up on YouTube and get everything detailed.

1961
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
But honestly, if you're an Xbox One owner, you probably already grabbed it, and I don't blame you.

1962
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Hey, Dark Sakura is going to take a break from cookie eating and dive into the mailbag and find some emails that our listeners have sent us this week.

1963
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
These are not treated like this.

1964
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Or she'll make Marissa read them in a silly voice.

1965
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Oh, I know, man.

1966
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I'm going to put her on the spot.

1967
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I read them in a silly voice.

1968
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Alright.

1969
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
It is the mailbag.

1970
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Participate at orangelawnsready.com if you would like to participate with a future mailbag segment.

1971
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I'm going to try to be the guitar center lady.

1972
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Alright.

1973
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:23,000
It's probably been, probably a week late to ask, but I was wondering, are there any horror games that would have made good haunted house slash maze attractions?

1974
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
No, I'm going to do one in one place.

1975
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
You became a Gen-Xer.

1976
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Huh?

1977
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,000
You became a Gen-Xer.

1978
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:38,000
They do usually prefer to keep the lines moving, so I doubt one could watch monitors in a room for ten minutes or find picture fragments in a seemingly endless maze of hallways.

1979
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
This one's from Robert M.

1980
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Wait.

1981
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I'm actually going to be, um, I'm not too big on many of the haunted house ones myself.

1982
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I'm going to be playing Five Nights at Freddy's soon.

1983
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Wait, so we're talking about what game should become a haunted house?

1984
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Like the Silent Hill thing?

1985
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Like the Silent Hill thing?

1986
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Okay, okay.

1987
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I just want to make sure I understood the question.

1988
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Well, they did one just recently, I think this year, for The Evil Within.

1989
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
So they did one for that.

1990
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
It's like a promo thing.

1991
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Makes sense.

1992
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Um, they may have done one in the past for Resident Evil, I guess.

1993
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I can see that.

1994
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
That would make a really good one.

1995
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Thief, Deadly Shadows, The Cradle.

1996
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
That's my vote.

1997
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:22,000
No, seriously though, if you haven't played anything in the game, that's one of the scariest levels I've ever played in the game, ever.

1998
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
The Cradle.

1999
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And then one day I played it, and no one was at home.

2000
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
The dark was raining.

2001
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And my friend came home and was like, are you okay?

2002
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Yes.

2003
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I was playing The Cradle of the Dark.

2004
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I was like, I told you not to do that.

2005
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
You know what would be cool though, is if they took the PT.

2006
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:44,000
And then did that sort of like, a whole house like that and have monitors on the various levels.

2007
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
You have to track the ghost.

2008
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Or they just do the Silent Hills trailer and just recreate that like, fuck, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2009
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I'm gonna go with what was already said, Five Nights at Freddy's.

2010
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Come on.

2011
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
That is, somebody's got a nightmare.

2012
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
That is a movie franchise waiting to happen.

2013
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
That's all of my childhood nightmares.

2014
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
That guy's gonna make some bank.

2015
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
That guy's gonna make bank.

2016
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,000
It's not gonna be like Minecraft Bank, but it's gonna be like the next big anything.

2017
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Let me put it this way.

2018
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,000
There's so many cult horror movies out there nowadays, somebody's gonna license it.

2019
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
They've run out of ideas.

2020
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
They made a goddamn Ouija movie.

2021
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Yeah, they did one of those before it was called The Exorcist.

2022
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
They did one before that, it was called Witch Board.

2023
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
They're attorneys writing up the agreement.

2024
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Actually, The Exorcist came out before Witch Board.

2025
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
This is a great case, by the way.

2026
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Actually, you have a Ouija board case for, what is that?

2027
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
My Ouija wallet.

2028
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Oh, your Ouija wallet?

2029
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:44,000
So she can be thrifty and contact the dead.

2030
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Should I buy that bag?

2031
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Y-E-S-S-A-L-E question mark.

2032
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Maybe I can find a spirit with better credit than me.

2033
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Are you Steve Jobs?

2034
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
N-O-J-K.

2035
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
How about Yaris?

2036
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Mommy needs an ointment.

2037
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Yaris, only the remake would be scary.

2038
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I'm just kidding.

2039
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Alright, we've thrown ideas out there.

2040
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Next email.

2041
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Hello, LR.

2042
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Oh, oh, sorry.

2043
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Chat, chatter.

2044
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
What?

2045
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Alan alchemy.

2046
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Amnesia.

2047
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Nope.

2048
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Nope.

2049
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Nope.

2050
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
My favorite let's play of that game is where the guy starts the game and in 15 seconds,

2051
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
something starts coming down the hall and he goes, nope, nope, and he turns it off.

2052
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
What was that?

2053
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
That's the other one that they have, the other survival game that's on PlayStation 4

2054
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
or whatever.

2055
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Oh, with the old penis that's in it.

2056
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Yes, old penis.

2057
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Outlast?

2058
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Outlast, yeah.

2059
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I like being on the outside of this conversation.

2060
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Where Rob's just jerking off some air.

2061
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Marissa, that old penis, you know what I'm talking about?

2062
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Hello, LR.

2063
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Oh, hi.

2064
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I just wanted to say thank you for the really nice retrospective.

2065
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
And reminisce, that was episode 573.

2066
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Do you ever still go to that parking lot diner?

2067
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
No.

2068
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Not that one.

2069
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Not that one.

2070
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Not that one.

2071
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
But other ones in the franchise.

2072
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Yes.

2073
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
There's more often the one in Rancho.

2074
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Yeah.

2075
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
In the Cho.

2076
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Me too.

2077
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
In the Cho.

2078
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
That's what Dan calls it.

2079
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I'm not even from here and I know that you all call it Rancho Cambodia.

2080
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Margaret Rancho Cordova.

2081
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
No, from the days of working at the Funko Lantern GameStop turned Radio Shack, they

2082
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
called it the Cho.

2083
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Got it.

2084
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Anyway, it reminded me of many a day spent waiting in coin lines to play DDR Max 2 and

2085
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
then Extreme.

2086
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
All of us slowly working our way through DDR's content while actually forming meaningful

2087
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
relationships and groups.

2088
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I would have to say that my favorite old school DDR license was so deep from DDR Max.

2089
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
So deep.

2090
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
With my runner up being every other license from DDR Max.

2091
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Well, my favorite non-license was definitely Insertion from Fifth Mix.

2092
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
You also said insertion.

2093
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Insertion.

2094
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I'm just saying, if we're going for every possible euphemism.

2095
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
There was a song in DDR called Insertion and it even had this, if you listen very carefully,

2096
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
there's a point where it goes, ah.

2097
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Like, it's part of the song.

2098
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Herders.

2099
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
And I go, was that the insertion?

2100
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I don't know.

2101
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Anyway.

2102
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I personally still play In the Groove 2 at least one to two times a week as my only exercise

2103
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:24,000
and folks in the community are still creating new charts all over the difficulty scale.

2104
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Times definitely have changed, even on weekends.

2105
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I generally don't have to wait in line and I'm usually the only person on the machine

2106
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
at the overpriced, under-populated local stomping ground.

2107
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
But hey, at least I still have one.

2108
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Strangely enough, in a, I'm going to mispronounce this, Nanuet, New York, close to the semi-famous

2109
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
and fairly enormous Palisades Center Mall, a New Yorkade is opening on Saturday, November

2110
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
15th, called Nanuet Arcade, which will feature stepping games, among other things.

2111
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Will it have Spider Stomp?

2112
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
It's not complete without Spider Stomp.

2113
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
I hope the owner has gobs of money and isn't afraid to lose them, but I digress.

2114
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I did want to remind folks of something.

2115
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,000
For many of us lucky enough to be located in several pockets around the US, Bimani is

2116
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
still very much alive and well.

2117
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Thanks to both the ingenuity of the community and Konami's indifference, it is possible

2118
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,000
to play current or recent versions of Bimani titles, such as DDR 2014, 2DX22 Pendual,

2119
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Pop Up Music's Sunny Park, and more, plus to utilize the network features of the games

2120
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:28,000
using actual Konami EMU cards, which I have one, purchasable either online or at the same

2121
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
arcades that have the games.

2122
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I got mine at Classic Gaming Expo a couple weeks ago.

2123
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I mean, years ago.

2124
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I want to say weeks.

2125
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Some locations include Game Underground in the Boston area, a new Chinatown fair in New

2126
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,000
York City, 8 on the Break in, I'm going to mispronounce this too, Dunellen, New Jersey,

2127
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Arcade UFO in Austin, Texas, Press Start in Las Vegas in Super Arcade, as well as several

2128
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Goughland locations in California.

2129
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:56,000
The new Nanowet Arcade I mentioned earlier will also be joining this list when it opens.

2130
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Further, a few of these locations still host yearly tournaments, such as Champions of the

2131
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Coast at 8 on the Break, and Best of the West at Sunnyvale Goughland, both of which feature

2132
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
simultaneous competitions on almost every music game they have, and there are many.

2133
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I just wanted to throw out there that I believe it would be truly awesome for OLR to record

2134
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
a segment at Best of the West next year, which will likely be in August 2015.

2135
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
So yes, in closing, I just wanted to say that not all of us are done with music gaming.

2136
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I would go so far as to say I still spend about as much time playing music games as

2137
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I do everything else, and that's unlikely to change.

2138
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
We drink Ritalin.

2139
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Aaron, why YR?

2140
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
But I am still a huge fan of music games.

2141
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I mean, maybe I don't obsess about Bomani so much, but any time Konami releases a game

2142
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,000
on iOS, I check it out, even though I know I'm gonna be like, hmm, whatever.

2143
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
But I love music games still.

2144
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
All they have to do is release anything as an actual retail release, and I'd buy it.

2145
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I just bought Hatsune Miku not that long ago on PlayStation 3 because it was on sale, and

2146
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I really wanted to check it out.

2147
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
It's a great Dreamcast game for my PS3.

2148
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
There's still lots of music games today I really do enjoy, so I just want to make sure

2149
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
that's a genre I'm always gonna love.

2150
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
And I wish they would make a new rock band, dammit!

2151
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Even Marisa's nodding her head over there.

2152
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I have all my instruments in my garage.

2153
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I'm for that too, and I liked the latest Rocksmith.

2154
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I mean, that's with an instrument, but I love Oasis.

2155
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
My friends are teasing me like, you know how to play the songs for real?

2156
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I'm like, yeah!

2157
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Maybe I should go to Guitar Center and pick up a guitar.

2158
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Guitar, yeah.

2159
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I was like, but I can play it in a game!

2160
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
This next email I sort of thought about whether or not to read it.

2161
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Rob, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

2162
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
No, because I thought those were the only two emails we had.

2163
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Oh, that's right. We had two more.

2164
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
One of them is, I will go ahead and just put this out.

2165
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Sure.

2166
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:23,000
We have a listener who, just to rephrase this,

2167
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,000
has a Wii U that is having trouble reading disc and he created a GoFundMe.

2168
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And asks the community for assistance.

2169
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Yeah, I'm of two minds about it because there are some of us who are,

2170
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
you know, we go out and buy our own things when they're broken.

2171
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Right.

2172
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
But some people may not be able to afford it.

2173
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Yeah.

2174
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I don't know if you're in that situation.

2175
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Buy a replacement disc drive.

2176
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:56,000
You know what, I'm going to say, because we haven't had this situation before,

2177
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I'm going to read this one, but let's not open the floodgates to more of these.

2178
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Absolutely not.

2179
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
But since this guy thought of it first, go ahead and read it

2180
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
and I'll let everybody make their own decision,

2181
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
because he'll have the pitch on the GoFundMe page.

2182
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Okay.

2183
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Go ahead.

2184
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Basically saying, over the next few months,

2185
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
my Wii U has occasionally had trouble reading discs.

2186
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Now I won't read them at all.

2187
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I tried Nintendo's lens cleaning kit as well as several home remedies,

2188
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
but nothing worked.

2189
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
When I called customer service, they told me the disc drive would have to be replaced,

2190
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,000
which would cost about $150 including shipping, which I can't afford.

2191
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
So with several other upcoming non-gaming expenses,

2192
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I thought I would have a go without a Wii U for the foreseeable future,

2193
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
but a friend suggested I try crowdfunding.

2194
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
What better place to start, I thought, than the OLR community.

2195
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:43,000
So I will go ahead and give you a plug on this one.

2196
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
You will probably be the one and only that we do this for.

2197
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Mm-hmm.

2198
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:53,000
But it's GoFundMe.com slash H1065K.

2199
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
And then ended saying, thank you in advance for your time and kindness,

2200
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and thanks especially to you, Dark Soccer Sky and Loki,

2201
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
for informing and entertaining me for most of the past decade.

2202
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Sincerely, Justin Masterclaw.

2203
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,000
P.S. If my goal is met within the week, I might be able to give back to the community somehow.

2204
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
At least I've heard this name before, so it's somebody that, you know,

2205
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I know has posted on Facebook a lot and so forth.

2206
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
And I just want to say, I don't want, like, I don't want this guy to think,

2207
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
like, God, what jerks they're being, like, I'm trying to do, like, a thing.

2208
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
You know, it's just like, unfortunately, we've been around a very long time,

2209
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:29,000
and we've seen a lot of, like, dark things, so we have to question everything.

2210
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
That's just part of, sadly, what we have to do.

2211
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Like, I'm going to tell you guys, I don't want to get into all the details yet,

2212
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
because I don't, I haven't been able to put it all together,

2213
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,000
but something happened with Hoard House this week that we didn't really talk about on air,

2214
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
and I'm not going to get into it so much,

2215
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
but, like, it really was something where I was, like,

2216
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I kind of got an email that was a little bit of a mindfuck in a way,

2217
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
and I'm worried it might have been a catfish thing,

2218
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and I feel really bad, like, going to that negative place,

2219
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
but something didn't connect in my head, and so I had to do a little research,

2220
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
and there was some things that didn't line up.

2221
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Yeah.

2222
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,000
But it was a very, like, serious kind of email, and I was just like, yeah.

2223
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah, so anyway, I just want to say, like, unfortunately, yes,

2224
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
even little old podcasts that very few people listen to like us,

2225
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,000
sometimes, you know, we've had some not-so-great things happen,

2226
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
so anyway, sorry, I don't want to-

2227
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
It's a universal rainbow of trolling, huh?

2228
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Yeah, well, yeah, but again, I don't want to make this guy,

2229
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
like, I'm sure this guy is well-intentioned, I hate to-

2230
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Oh, yeah, I didn't mean that about him.

2231
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
See, I'm more inclined, since I remember the name,

2232
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
and he's been around since 2004, listening to us blab about shit all week.

2233
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Right.

2234
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I was inclined to give him benefit of a doubt.

2235
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
That's fair, that's fair.

2236
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
And, you know, it's up to our listeners whether or not they want to be kind.

2237
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Just keep in mind, and that's always going to be a thing when it comes to money,

2238
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
and we here at OLR, we haven't asked for your money, like, besides charity things,

2239
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
you know, we might have said donate to the MS Foundation or, you know,

2240
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
things that we've done charity drives for in the past,

2241
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
but, you know, we don't usually ask for money, so we,

2242
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
when other people ask for money, we have to really question that.

2243
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
And if we support a charity, we are going to research the fuck out of them.

2244
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Yeah.

2245
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Because we're not going to have, like, a Komen walk.

2246
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Because fuck them.

2247
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
We did just have guests, we had, like, three weeks' worth of guests

2248
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
that were talking about Kickstarters.

2249
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Yeah.

2250
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
So, it's fair.

2251
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Fair is fair.

2252
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
This is last email.

2253
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Hi, OLR, and the ever-lovely Marissa.

2254
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
You got a fan.

2255
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Aww.

2256
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Watch this.

2257
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
They're all going to be like, this is the best person ever,

2258
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
the next line, something critical.

2259
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Shit.

2260
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
That'd be a great way to open, you know, a good...

2261
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
It's your friendly neighborhood rage-nator.

2262
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Aww.

2263
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I just thought I'd throw out a random topic to discuss tonight.

2264
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Arcades.

2265
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
That's random.

2266
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
At one point or another, you have professed your love of arcades

2267
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,000
and how playing music game at the arcades has led to the creation of OLR.

2268
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
That being said, I'd like to pose these questions.

2269
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Do you remember your first visit to an arcade?

2270
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
What did you play?

2271
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Please elaborate.

2272
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I can tell you.

2273
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I mean, I've been in arcades since I was probably an infant.

2274
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Yeah.

2275
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,000
I remember our Aladdin's castle.

2276
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,000
And this one had been there since, like, the 70s.

2277
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
It was the same one I went to when my brother Matthew was six

2278
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
and got hit by a car.

2279
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Oh, my gosh.

2280
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
And nearly died.

2281
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
They had carpet on the walls.

2282
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
That's how old it was.

2283
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
It was like going to the freaking roller rink.

2284
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It had carpet on the walls.

2285
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
And I remember going there and beating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade

2286
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
at that arcade.

2287
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
That was when they shut off the power right when we had beaten the game.

2288
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
You know, I remember going to play pinball when I was a kid.

2289
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I remember having to stand on a crate to play kangaroo.

2290
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
So I remember Pong.

2291
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I remember the sit-down Pong tables because you did have that weird burnout in them, remember?

2292
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:55,000
And I remember, you know, even sometimes going to the bar with relatives

2293
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:01,000
and sitting down at the table to play Pac-Man, you know, is craziness.

2294
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But, yeah, I've got very strong memories.

2295
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Okay, the first movie my mom ever took me to was Star Wars.

2296
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,000
My dad took her to see Exorcist 3 as a romantic date.

2297
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:18,000
So, yeah, I've been in arcades and fun places since I was very young.

2298
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,000
My first arcade memory that I can remember.

2299
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I mean, I'm sure I was taken to an arcade before that,

2300
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
but my first memory that I vividly remember was I was probably about four or five years old.

2301
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I think I was about five years old.

2302
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
And it was something to do with my sister's wedding.

2303
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:37,000
It wasn't the reception, obviously, but I think it was like the rehearsal celebration post-dinner or something.

2304
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
It was at Chuck E. Cheese.

2305
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:45,000
And I remember that I had to stand on a box because that's what they used to have for kids.

2306
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
They'd have like a big wooden box that you'd stand on so you could reach the controls and see the screen.

2307
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And I was playing Crystal Castles with the trackball.

2308
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Remember the little dude that goes around and gets all the gems and, you know, when you get hit by something?

2309
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Oh, no, Di.

2310
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:05,000
That was my earliest arcade memory was Crystal Castles.

2311
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:08,000
It was a little bear.

2312
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I did that for Classic Game.

2313
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Bentley Bear.

2314
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I did that for Classic Game.

2315
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
You have done that for Classic Game.

2316
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
And the 2600 version, I remember playing that a couple years later going,

2317
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
It doesn't look a damn thing like the arcade version.

2318
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Anyway, Loki, do you have an earliest arcade memory?

2319
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
God, I don't remember.

2320
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I know I played Chuck E. Cheese a bunch of times, but I don't remember the first arcade I went to.

2321
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Because this was back in the 80s.

2322
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
There was arcades everywhere.

2323
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
So, probably at Chuck E. Cheese, but I don't remember.

2324
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
It could have been at Golf Land because I did live in San Jose down there.

2325
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
So, I went to Milpenas Golf Land before they had all the cool stuff.

2326
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
That was the DDR capital.

2327
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Yeah, before all that.

2328
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And I had Sundayville Golf Land too a bunch of times because it was right near my grandparents house.

2329
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
But it is one of those.

2330
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I don't remember, which was the very first.

2331
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
But I played a lot back then.

2332
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
This is also in Alabama for me.

2333
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
So, that we had arcades actually was pretty cool.

2334
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Other than going to Godfathers or Showbiz.

2335
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I'm sad that there's not arcades in malls anymore.

2336
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Tilt. Remember Tilt?

2337
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Tilt was purchased by Namco.

2338
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Tilt.

2339
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
They have an arcade at the Roseville Galleria.

2340
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
But it is seriously nothing but ticket redemption machines.

2341
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:26,000
And I think they have that one Konami shooter game that every frickin' place has.

2342
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
They do have Derby Owners Club, don't they still?

2343
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Do you think Dave & Busters?

2344
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
That was it. Dave & Busters had Derby.

2345
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I think this place is called Fun Factory or something like that.

2346
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yeah, it's right there by the carousel.

2347
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

2348
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,000
What was the other one that I was trying to think of?

2349
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Oh, Dan, when he was out on his route to Adventures at Work, sent me a picture of a cyber station.

2350
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Nice.

2351
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000
There was still one open.

2352
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Marissa, do you have an early arcade memory that you remember?

2353
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Definitely Chuck E. Cheese.

2354
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I can't remember the game in particular.

2355
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:06,000
At a young age, with the exception of going to Chuck E. Cheese, they were always really cheap with the coins.

2356
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
But I remember spending many of my teenage years playing Crazy Taxi in the mall.

2357
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:15,000
And we had a Marvel vs. Capcom game at the college that's still there, actually.

2358
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Wow. Crazy Taxi was so much fun, though.

2359
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,000
It wasn't. Everybody knocks it. That shit is fun.

2360
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
We love Crazy Taxi when we go all out.

2361
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
We want to make some crazy money.

2362
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,000
That's a fun game. That's one of the most fun driving games to this day.

2363
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
And everyone says that's what happens.

2364
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
We used to go to...

2365
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Take me to the Pizza Hut.

2366
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,000
When I was in elementary school, or even junior high and stuff, we used to go to...

2367
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
They usually have an arcade game in a random restaurant.

2368
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:48,000
We used to go to Rico's Pizza, and they used to have a bunch of arcade games there.

2369
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Rico still has a decent supply of arcade games.

2370
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
And Rico's with the big party pizza. It's like 30-inch-long slices.

2371
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
They still make that.

2372
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I haven't been there in years. They used to have them all over, and now there's one.

2373
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
And it's the same... I think it was the original one, still. The one on North Gate.

2374
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Is that where it is? North Gate.

2375
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Yeah.

2376
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,000
The one that was in Antioch.

2377
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:17,000
We used to go to a diner-type place, and they had Captain Commando.

2378
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:23,000
We'd go play that, or go down to 7-Eleven, and they'd have one arcade machine that they'd change out.

2379
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Usually it was Street Fighter.

2380
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Lots of fun stuff.

2381
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
It'd be fun just to go to different convenience stores and be like,

2382
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Oh, they have an arcade game here! What's that?

2383
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Oh, it's Street Fighter. Or whatever other games they have.

2384
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Hey, adult men over 18, for an interesting gaming experience, go to your local Chuck E. Cheese. By yourself.

2385
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I don't think they let people in.

2386
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
No, they don't.

2387
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
You're creepy. Get out of here.

2388
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
At my local one, me and Chris could go and play Skee-Ball.

2389
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Except when I lived in Chico. Chico is a big college town, and college rules that town, right?

2390
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
We used to go to Chuck E. Cheese as a group of college kids, but I think that's different. They expect that.

2391
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I had my graduation party at Chuck E. Cheese.

2392
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Did you really?

2393
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Yeah, one of my graduation parties.

2394
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:14,000
The only plus about Chuck E. Cheese nowadays? Everything's one token. Every single game is one token. That's awesome.

2395
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Now one other arcade memory I just want to throw out there is playing, I think it was Star Wars Arcade at Shakey's Pizza.

2396
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Oh.

2397
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Remember Shakey's Pizza? I think they still have a Shakey's Pizza in Oroville or some shit.

2398
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Why on earth would I go up there, but there's a Shakey's Pizza.

2399
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,000
We still have some down south, and they're still with the old colored glass, you know, ye olde pizza parlor stuff.

2400
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:42,000
When Dan and I were newly together, we used to go to Crestview Lanes, which makes me sad every time I drive by it,

2401
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:47,000
because it's been closed and now all the homeless people live in there, which I'm glad they have a roof over their heads.

2402
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:55,000
But that was like where we would go play Air Guys on arcade and Blazing Star and just some of the coolest games that we didn't see anywhere else.

2403
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Some of our chatters joining in answering this question over at live.vognetwork.com.

2404
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
SSU100Matt says, Sport Time USA was probably the first stand-alone arcade I went to.

2405
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,000
It's actually featured in the Anamanaguchi Meow music video. That's fun.

2406
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Was that it for emails or one more?

2407
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
No, there's more to this one.

2408
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Wow, okay.

2409
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:17,000
As for me, my first arcade visit was to Showbiz Pizza Place in Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo,

2410
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:23,000
in the fall of 1983 as a reward for doing well as I did my elementary school fundraiser.

2411
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Side note, I came in second place at the school.

2412
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
When I first stepped inside and looked around, my jaw hit the floor and I thought I had died and gone to gamer heaven.

2413
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Aside from eating pizza and watching the animatronic band, I ended up playing stuff like Skee-Ball, Popeye, Gauntlet, Mario Brothers, and a whole host of other games.

2414
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:42,000
It's because of that place that I love pizza, gaming, and associate with each other.

2415
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Oh my god, Popeye. I played the shit out of that on Commodore 64. It was so good.

2416
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:51,000
You know what actually I always will associate forever with Chuck E. Cheese's?

2417
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Pole position. Sit-down pole position.

2418
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Yes.

2419
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Always a sit-down pole position.

2420
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Like early voice acting in video games.

2421
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Get ready for Link in the Road.

2422
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:11,000
And the first showbiz that I ever went to was, it was in Mobile, like the whole shopping center since gone since then.

2423
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:16,000
But they had this room that you'd walk into on the way to the bathroom that had light-up walls, and it was like the seizure room.

2424
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
And it was right by the speaker.

2425
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Yes, they had like an amazing stroby seizure room.

2426
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:25,000
And it was on the way to the bathroom so you could not, and they had the hands and feet on the wall that would clap.

2427
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:31,000
We could do this topic all fucking night because like I could talk about at Roller King out in Roseville when they had a Spy Hunter machine,

2428
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
and I used to play that with skates on, and that's probably why that pedal broke after six months.

2429
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
But my god, we'll be here all night.

2430
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I could only play frog-grown roller skates.

2431
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:42,000
We could do a whole podcast about retro arcade memories, but anyway.

2432
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Thank you, Raginator.

2433
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Alright, was that it?

2434
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Yeah.

2435
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Alright, you too can email us.

2436
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

2437
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
And Dark Soccer will consider reading them next week.

2438
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:00,000
But I'm just going to say, if we go another week and don't get a single email, we will play music from Star Wars Connect.

2439
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
So I want one damn email this week. One damn email or you get Star Wars Connect music during the break next week, I'm just saying.

2440
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:10,000
And it's not just any Star Wars Connect music. It's the dance mode Star Wars Connect.

2441
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I will play I Am Han Solo or whatever that song is. It's so awful.

2442
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Alright.

2443
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
We should do the Kim Kardashian game music with her speaking over it.

2444
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I think I'd rather have you as Kim Kardashian speaking over it.

2445
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:31,000
This is what you get, you guys. And you don't love me enough. Is that I'm just going to play this music for you.

2446
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Anyway, let's get back into some news. We're going to open up the phone lines here in a little bit.

2447
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:42,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTrader. But a few more stories for you first.

2448
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Yes. This is exciting. And I actually didn't see this right away when it came out.

2449
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
They had a brand new trailer, of course.

2450
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
We knew that they were teasing a first person mode for Grand Theft Auto 5, which is, you know,

2451
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Grand Theft Auto's been traditionally third person action game.

2452
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:08,000
But now they have a brand new first person mode that's completely customizable that will be in the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game.

2453
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:14,000
And what's kind of cool about it is, you know, literally everything has been tweaked for first person.

2454
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:20,000
So it plays, you know, like a Call of Duty or something like that. You can limit it to, you know, I only want first person in driving.

2455
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:25,000
And you can do that. Or I only want first person in, you know, the non-driving stuff.

2456
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I want it, you know, in third person in driving. Or I want to tweak whatever, depth of field, whatever you want to do.

2457
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:40,000
It's completely customizable. And they're even going to have, I believe, for Grand Theft Auto Online, modes where it's only players that are playing in first person.

2458
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:52,000
And I believe, if I remember correctly, it's toggleable, like, while you're playing the game. I think it's just tapping the L stick or something like that to go between the modes.

2459
02:34:52,000 --> 02:35:00,000
So that's pretty cool because actually first person, for me, usually would be beneficial, especially when you're chasing people down in cars.

2460
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
It's kind of hard sometimes to shoot people out of the front of the car, you know, in third person.

2461
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:13,000
But I think first person, you'd be a little bit more accurate, get headshots and stuff like that, you know, in the car.

2462
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I can't wait for the first person shooter footage to be splashed all over CNN the next time there's a violent act that's blamed on video games.

2463
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Because you know what's going to happen.

2464
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:27,000
The first person, you know, stripper mode or strip club, you know, all that fun stuff.

2465
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:35,000
But yeah, it looks pretty cool. So that'll be on the 18th. Not too far away.

2466
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
How ready are you for this, Loki?

2467
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
I am extremely ready. I wish I could take time off, but unfortunately starting a new job can't do that.

2468
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But I will have the game preloaded and I'll be playing it that night.

2469
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,000
That, you know, probably on the-

2470
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
You're training for a few weeks, right?

2471
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
You have a red bull. You can get a red bull to keep you awake for a little bit. I'm just kidding.

2472
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Oh, I can stay up just fine. Yeah.

2473
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I know a lot of you are looking forward to the Oculus Rift.

2474
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
If you haven't tried this, you know, we've talked about the Oculus on the show before.

2475
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It's one of those things where like when you hear about it, you're like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But then when you actually try it, you're like, okay, I'm a believer.

2477
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Like, you know, virtual reality has come a long way from the days of the virtual boy

2478
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,000
and hard driving in the speaking of old arcade games.

2479
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Virtual reality has come a long way. The Oculus is pretty awesome.

2480
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Try it at a convention near you sometime.

2481
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Or, soon, the first consumer Oculus headset.

2482
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
They are saying this is months away.

2483
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:42,000
This was a comment that Oculus VR CEO Brendan Eribe said at a web summit in Dublin 2014.

2484
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,000
We're all hungry for it to happen. We're getting very close.

2485
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
It's months, not years away, but many months.

2486
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,000
So, like, probably- I would say that makes me think summer, fall next year.

2487
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,000
That was my thought.

2488
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:00,000
They're saying that the biggest issue right now is that an input system, a proper input system is tough.

2489
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Standard keyboards, mice, and game pads really aren't working.

2490
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Gesture control is still a little bit primitive.

2491
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I don't know. I've played games under all those things and it's worked fine.

2492
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
But I see why they need to establish their standard or whatever.

2493
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
So, there you go.

2494
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Oculus Rift coming sooner rather than later.

2495
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,000
And I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will be picking one up if nothing else.

2496
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
And hopefully bringing his to the next DragonCon.

2497
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Honestly, now that I have a PlayStation 4, I'm pretty excited about when Project Morpheus comes out.

2498
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Because for the Oculus Rift right now, I'm not positive that my laptop would be able to run it well.

2499
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Whereas Project Morpheus, you know, that's its own box.

2500
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I really think- I don't necessarily think we'll get a full game announcement for Morpheus.

2501
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,000
But I really think with this PlayStation event really coming out of nowhere that they're doing in December in Vegas,

2502
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I really think they're going to let more people experience Morpheus.

2503
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:59,000
And I think that's going to cut- you know, because nobody's really talked about it since E3.

2504
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:04,000
But I think it's going to kind of be back on everybody's- on the tip of everybody's tongue come this December event.

2505
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
And I don't know if they'll announce- maybe they will announce a game. Who knows?

2506
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
I think it's too soon maybe to announce when it's coming out.

2507
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
But that maybe is the next E3.

2508
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:17,000
But it'll be interesting to see how Morpheus has kind of evolved in the past six months.

2509
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Definitely.

2510
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
We haven't really seen it since E3.

2511
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:25,000
So. But again, I was fortunate enough and very lucky to get to try it at E3.

2512
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
And I was really impressed. Really impressed.

2513
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
And yeah. So.

2514
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
DarkSakura.

2515
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:36,000
It'd be nice if it loaded.

2516
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Okay. So there is a new trademark in Japan and Europe by Square Enix.

2517
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Called Brave Exvius.

2518
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

2519
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,000
The application was submitted on November 7th and on September 26th in Japan.

2520
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
There is not a lot of information about it.

2521
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:03,000
It just says- just the information that came from Kabushiki Kaisha Square Enix.

2522
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
So that's about it.

2523
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:15,000
However, there is- it may possibly be related to Mavius Final Fantasy trademark that was filed last month.

2524
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
So. Could be.

2525
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I wonder if it isn't some iOS game, though.

2526
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Because they have a few of those free-to-play games.

2527
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Square Enix has a whole little branch of the company that's kind of doing that stuff.

2528
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:32,000
And a lot- some of them are kind of rooted in Final Fantasy-esque sort of universes.

2529
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,000
So. Be curious.

2530
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,000
It'd be cool if it was a new Brave Fencer Musashi.

2531
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
That might be a stretch. But we'll see. We'll see.

2532
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Alright, well, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.

2533
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Because here at Orange Launch Radio, sometimes, you know, believe it or not, we get upset.

2534
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Like, we get really upset.

2535
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:56,000
And so we vent to you, the listener, as we have every week since the very beginning in a segment we call

2536
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
The Caffeine of the Week.

2537
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:14,000
F you to having a sore throat off and on.

2538
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Given that I work a ten hour shift at Locat.

2539
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
You know.

2540
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I come home unable to talk.

2541
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,000
And I mean, I love what I do. I love where I work.

2542
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
I love everything about my job.

2543
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Except the sore throat.

2544
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
And it's just- it feels like a-

2545
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Okay, this is really gross. It just feels like a constant pile of mucus in the back of my neck.

2546
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
But my ear's feeling better. So that's good.

2547
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I think it's just something you'll get conditioned to after time.

2548
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Well, I've been there almost a year. I would hope I'd have been conditioned now, except that-

2549
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Yeah?

2550
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Wow, time flies.

2551
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Let's see, Loki, you have an F you of the week?

2552
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Yes, F you to the local teriyaki joint that's opposite of the devil named Nippon Teriyaki Bowl.

2553
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I love that place!

2554
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I do too!

2555
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
What I don't love is their non-posted hours and their fucking odd-ass open times.

2556
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Because they used to be open from sometime in the morning that I wasn't there to 8 PM during the week.

2557
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:22,000
And, you know, open to 3 on Saturday and closed Sunday, which I'm still mad that they're closed Sunday, but whatever.

2558
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Now, so I'm like, okay, well I don't know what their fucking hours are.

2559
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
I looked it up on the internet, it says 5.30 is when they close it.

2560
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
My sweet, cool, I'm gonna go pick up dinner.

2561
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,000
They're fucking closed.

2562
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
So, I don't know when the fuck they're open anymore.

2563
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
And I look on the door, there's no fucking hours.

2564
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,000
So it's like whenever the hell they feel like being open is when they're open.

2565
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:43,000
And so, it kinda pisses me off because they're so good.

2566
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
And I want it not just for lunch.

2567
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I want to go there for lunch and maybe dinner too.

2568
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Bring some of that home. But I can't because you're fucking closed.

2569
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:59,000
You would think I'd give an F.U. that's related to the trip I just took, but everything really went rather well.

2570
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I can't really complain about a whole lot.

2571
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Like, I'm really trying to think of something to complain about.

2572
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
I would say F.U. to P.F. Chang's, because it made me a little bit sick.

2573
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Like, what was I thinking eating there?

2574
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
What was I thinking?

2575
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I want Chinese food that doesn't taste like Chinese food.

2576
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I want really whitewashed Chinese food.

2577
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Like, I want, like, what if...

2578
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
They do have decent dim sum.

2579
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:25,000
No, here's the thing. I was going out and meeting Dr. Ken from Starboard Power Coupling and his friend.

2580
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Their guildies all decided to go there.

2581
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Because, you know, there's only so many eating places in that safe spot.

2582
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
It's all chains over there, yeah.

2583
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
But I will say this. To P.F. Chang's credit, great drinks.

2584
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I had a great drink there.

2585
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,000
By the way, I do have to clarify for the chat room.

2586
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
This has only been happening within the last three weeks, the issue with my throat.

2587
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Oh, so it's not something, okay.

2588
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,000
No, no, no. Keep in mind, I worked on the phones for seven years before that.

2589
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
So, I'm conditioned. Trust me.

2590
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
And if you want to give some You're Not A Doctor advice to DarkSakura,

2591
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,000
live.vognetwork.com is where you can join our live chat.

2592
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Marissa, do you have an F.U.?

2593
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:06,000
F.U. to my lack of prosperity.

2594
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:13,000
To my inability to, I cannot eat as many cookies as I want and stay svelte.

2595
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
These are delicious.

2596
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:20,000
And F.U. to everything between L.A. and Sacramento.

2597
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
The exception of the coast.

2598
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
F.U. to the smell of cow poop.

2599
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
It just really, really ruins that drive.

2600
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Yeah, that was a hoot.

2601
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
That's why I'm glad I flew this time.

2602
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
I don't get to fly to L.A. very often, but this time I got to fly.

2603
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:36,000
It's an interesting flight, too, because you never reach altitude.

2604
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,000
It's like you are now free to get back in your seat.

2605
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
It really is.

2606
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
We're now beginning our descent into Sacramento.

2607
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It's like 25 minutes away.

2608
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah.

2609
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Anyhow.

2610
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
All right. Let's get back in. Just a couple more stories.

2611
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2612
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype.

2613
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to participate with tonight's show.

2614
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Loki.

2615
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
All right. So this is kind of cool.

2616
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,000
It's a brand new game that's on Steam and Greenlight.

2617
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I guess they're trying to get approval right now.

2618
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
It's called Scrap Mechanic.

2619
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:14,000
And you build machines out of all sorts of parts and stuff.

2620
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,000
I guess it's sort of like that Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

2621
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
But it's its own thing.

2622
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:25,000
And so they've got some footage right now on Steam and Greenlight.

2623
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
So go check that out.

2624
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
There's another one I saw too that someone was working on Unity actually.

2625
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
That was kind of like that.

2626
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:39,000
But it was a racing game where you had a certain amount of time to build your machine.

2627
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Like 30 seconds or something like that.

2628
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
And then you had to race it with whatever parts you had.

2629
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
And it was really silly.

2630
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
So I'd be curious to check that out too.

2631
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
But Scrap Mechanic.

2632
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Sounds like your kind of game.

2633
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Yeah. It's supposed to come out sometime in 2015 it says.

2634
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
All righty.

2635
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
One more story for you guys.

2636
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:58,000
And it's about a classic franchise called Bomberman.

2637
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Do you guys know Bomberman?

2638
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,000
That's a fun series except that Xbox 360.

2639
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Bomberman Zero.

2640
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Oh my god. Oh my god.

2641
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
So bad.

2642
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
But they did a download digital title later on.

2643
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
It was like Bomberman Returns or something like that.

2644
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
It was cute.

2645
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
It was good.

2646
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
It was fun.

2647
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Well anyway, Bomberman 3DS was supposed to be a thing.

2648
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
But it got cancelled.

2649
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,000
There really hasn't been a proper Bomberman game in our lives for quite some time.

2650
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,000
However, Bomberman is coming to smartphones.

2651
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
There's not going to be a story mode in the smartphone game.

2652
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
But it will be going back to the classics with competitive versus modes.

2653
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
You can go against the CPU.

2654
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Or you can go into a competitive multiplayer mode.

2655
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Up to four players via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

2656
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Well that might be kind of fun.

2657
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
I guess Bomberman was pretty simple controls.

2658
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
So maybe it won't be so terrible on a smartphone.

2659
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
But again, there's no tangible buttons on a smartphone.

2660
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Anyway.

2661
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Bomberman Colosseum will be another mode in this.

2662
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
It's like a time attack mode.

2663
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
You take on various CPUs.

2664
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
And you can unlock boss characters by defeating them in the Bomberman Colosseum.

2665
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,000
It is in Japan right now for Android and iOS.

2666
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
And I would imagine it's a matter of time.

2667
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:09,000
It's not out already.

2668
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,000
I didn't have time to check before tonight's show.

2669
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
But it's probably imminent in the US.

2670
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Unless they're doing a lot of translation.

2671
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
I don't know.

2672
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Because the screenshots are very, very Japanese.

2673
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Anyhow, that does it for our news tonight.

2674
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
But what do you guys think?

2675
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Do you have an opinion on tonight's news?

2676
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Or something we haven't yet discussed?

2677
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Or you just want to say hi to Marissa.

2678
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Give us a call.

2679
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2680
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Or our username on Skype.

2681
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2682
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
If you'd like to give us a call.

2683
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And while we wait for some calls to come in.

2684
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Do we have any last minute stories from Loki?

2685
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
There was one thing I saw.

2686
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
And of course I closed the damn page.

2687
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Oh there we go.

2688
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I guess another one of these games that's out there

2689
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:58,000
that's trying to hide negative reviews through DMCA takedowns.

2690
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And of course it being on Steam was at the slaughtering grounds.

2691
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
So kind of look out for that.

2692
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Because it looks like a really terribly put together game.

2693
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:15,000
And they're putting DMCA takedowns for any negative reviews that they have.

2694
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I heard about that.

2695
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,000
That is so sketchy.

2696
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Like seriously.

2697
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
You think the internet's not going to figure that out?

2698
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Have they not learned?

2699
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Are they brand new to the internet?

2700
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Because it hasn't worked for everybody else that's tried that.

2701
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
So I don't know.

2702
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
The internet.

2703
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
On Wednesdays we wear pink.

2704
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Hey!

2705
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
We got a phone call coming in.

2706
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2707
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Who's this?

2708
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Hey this is Akdeft.

2709
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Hey Akdeft.

2710
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
How you doing?

2711
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:40,000
So when are we starting our Overwatch clan or guild?

2712
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Right now.

2713
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Right now?

2714
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Well when the game comes out I suppose.

2715
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
We have to wait for the game to come out.

2716
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Yeah.

2717
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I was trying pretty much all evening trying to retrieve my password from battle.net because

2718
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I didn't remember it.

2719
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:01,000
And yeah I got locked out even.

2720
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
I eventually got it so yeah.

2721
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Are you trying to sign up for the beta?

2722
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Yeah.

2723
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
I wouldn't blame you at all.

2724
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Yeah I'm pretty excited about the game.

2725
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Even though the comparison to TF2, Team Fortress 2, is pretty much uncanny.

2726
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Uncanny.

2727
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Sorry.

2728
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:24,000
But still it looks like a fun game to play.

2729
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Tell us, because you are such a fan of Team Fortress 2.

2730
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
You probably play it more than any other listener that I'm super familiar with that calls in

2731
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
to OLR.

2732
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:37,000
What was your reaction to hearing that Blizzard's going to kind of take on this genre?

2733
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Were you like, oh god how dare they touch such a franchise that really Valve has kind

2734
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
of owned.

2735
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Or were you kind of like, wow this looks like awesome.

2736
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:51,000
At first I was reading about it and people were talking, oh it's a TF2.

2737
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:54,000
It's TF2 with mobile elements and that.

2738
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
And I was a little confused about it because I hadn't watched the video until later that

2739
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
day.

2740
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:08,000
And I had only watched the cinematic trailer and that looked pretty awesome.

2741
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
I got pretty interested because of that.

2742
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Until that day later, or even I think the day after, I watched the gameplay trailer.

2743
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I pretty much thought it's pretty much the same as Team Fortress 2.

2744
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:31,000
It's even the same modes, it has the same character types and all that.

2745
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:40,000
But I don't know, even though the gameplay looks similar, the components and everything

2746
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:46,000
in the game looks different from TF2.

2747
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Something to add to your question is that a lot of people I know that I started playing

2748
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:56,000
TF2 with are not playing TF2.

2749
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:04,000
So I was saying to you on Twitter that if Overwatch is free to play, I know a lot of

2750
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:12,000
people that may get interested in it because a lot of people, like I said, I know they

2751
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:19,000
left TF2 because they thought the game got stale or the game didn't evolve that much

2752
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
from what it was.

2753
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
So it got boring.

2754
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
So possibly Overwatch will fix that.

2755
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I'm very curious to see if Valve might have a response to this because it's interesting

2756
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
how Valve and Blizzard are becoming more and more competitors.

2757
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,000
The Battle.net launcher could very well become a storefront.

2758
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
It is in many ways.

2759
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:44,000
It only sells Blizzard stuff, but in some ways it is a storefront.

2760
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,000
It kind of goes on that whole fragmented thing I talked about earlier.

2761
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:51,000
So I kind of have to say, look at them for that.

2762
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:55,000
It's interesting how they are competing with Valve, not just necessarily in that space,

2763
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:00,000
but the fact that they also did a MOBA where Valve had Dota 2.

2764
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:04,000
We remember there was even that lawsuit where they were going to call the game Blizzard

2765
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Dota, is what Blizzard was going to call their game, but they got into a little tiff with

2766
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Valve and ended up settling.

2767
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
But it is kind of interesting.

2768
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Now they've got a game that's very similar to Team Fortress 2.

2769
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:19,000
I wonder if Valve might be pressured to announce some sort of Team Fortress 3.

2770
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Although, I don't know, Valve kind of does what Valve wants to do.

2771
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Valve has had many competitors against Team Fortress 2.

2772
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
True, true.

2773
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Like Monday Night Combat and some other games.

2774
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Bethesda had one.

2775
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:40,000
The only one that comes to mind is that one because that one at least got some, I don't know,

2776
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:43,000
War of Mouth out, but it didn't grow that big.

2777
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:46,000
But there are other games like Team Fortress 2.

2778
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,000
There's another game free-to-play on Steam that's called Road Out.

2779
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:54,000
They're really similar too, but not that popular as Team Fortress 2.

2780
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Even though those games are free-to-play, Team Fortress 2 is still the game to play if you want to play

2781
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
team first-person shooters.

2782
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Bethesda had one that they showed at E3 because I remember that was the only other thing they were

2783
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:10,000
showing besides the Evil Within.

2784
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,000
And so that's one.

2785
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,000
I remember playing that and going, oh, this is Team Fortress.

2786
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
So they've got one in development too.

2787
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:23,000
But it's kind of like when MOBAs all came out fast and furious, and I guess they still are.

2788
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:28,000
I hope we don't have stories like the EA game that closed this week happening too frequently in the

2789
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Team Fortress 2 universe.

2790
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:32,000
But one way or another, Blizzard will end up fine.

2791
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
But before I let you go, I want to ask you about Overwatch.

2792
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
What did you think of the characters?

2793
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Because I felt that was the strongest point of the whole thing was that, wow, these characters are

2794
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
super interesting.

2795
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Yeah, that's something that Blizzard I think knows how to do really well, that it's characterization.

2796
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:50,000
And the characters look like real characters.

2797
02:52:50,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Even though Team Fortress has some characterization, it doesn't look as in-depth like in Overwatch,

2798
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:07,000
at least from what we see in the trailer and the cinematic and the gameplay trailer.

2799
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

2800
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:16,000
And even, like I said in chat earlier, that Overwatch could very well be a series or a movie even.

2801
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,000
SSG100Matt has a theory in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2802
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
He says, Gabe probably sat back in his deluxe leather chair watching the trailer saying,

2803
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,000
oh, that's cute, while watching the Valve staff make Half-Life 3.

2804
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Yeah.

2805
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,000
All right.

2806
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Well, active, and we'll let you go to see if we can get some more calls.

2807
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But thank you for your thoughts on Overwatch.

2808
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2809
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Anytime.

2810
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Take care, buddy.

2811
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I feel like you need to have a spinoff gaming law podcast.

2812
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Oh.

2813
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Well, God, somebody's suing someone every week in this damn industry.

2814
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,000
It's crazy.

2815
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:51,000
I feel like every week, this is like the first week in a month we haven't had some type of lawsuit story.

2816
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Speaking of last minute stories, speaking of Blizzard, you know, and Marisa, you can back up this statement,

2817
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:00,000
you can't have a good character without a good voice actor.

2818
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
That's right.

2819
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,000
That's right.

2820
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Voice.

2821
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Exactly.

2822
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:07,000
So, you know, and Blizzard knows how to find great voices.

2823
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:13,000
And this just goes to show the Voice Arts Award, as announced by Voice Over Times,

2824
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:21,000
the winner of the Outstanding Video Game Character Voice Arts Award went to Michael Gao for Diablo 3.

2825
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:26,000
And if you don't know who he is, he voiced Deckard Cain in that game.

2826
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Oh, Deckard Cain, who was younger in Diablo 2, but in Diablo 3, he's really old.

2827
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
And that's from the Voice Over Convention.

2828
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:42,000
That's going on tonight and for the next few days in New York.

2829
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Nice. Well, congrats to him. Congrats to Blizzard.

2830
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I guess he probably wasn't at BlizzCon if that was the case, but there you go.

2831
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
That's interesting, though, because Diablo 3 has been out a while.

2832
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:59,000
It's a relatively new organization that got together to give these awards.

2833
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:03,000
I was going to say, there was an expansion, although I don't remember how much Deckard Cain was in the expansion.

2834
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I don't think he was really in it, but I don't know. Anyway.

2835
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Okay. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2836
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
The phones are still open. I'll leave it open for a few more minutes to see if anyone else gets in,

2837
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:19,000
even though we are well after 9 o'clock here on the West Coast and we usually like to calm things down.

2838
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:22,000
But I'll try to fit in one more call. Jamie's tired. She's yawning.

2839
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
She might need another cookie to perk her up. All right.

2840
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I have to go to bed eventually.

2841
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
All right. Loki, anything else for the last minute stuff?

2842
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Thanks to hacking, there is a guide now how to play GameCube games on your Wii U.

2843
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Oh, wow.

2844
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Because of the GameCube controller support that they're going to be having.

2845
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Uh-huh.

2846
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,000
They're saying, hey, it's a good time to play GameCube games.

2847
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Of course, it's up through the homebrew channel, and I'm pretty sure you have to rip ISOs in order to do it,

2848
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
but it can be done on a Wii U.

2849
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Wow.

2850
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
We should just add support for GameCube games.

2851
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Hack, hack, hack your Wii, hack it for Wii U.

2852
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:02,000
So we know that's kind of irritating, so it's like we know it can do it,

2853
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:07,000
but Nintendo won't unlock it because you know they're going to start selling them as virtual console.

2854
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:11,000
It can do it. They're putting out GameCube controllers.

2855
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:15,000
But fuck you, we're not going to connect those dots.

2856
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
I want my F0GX.

2857
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,000
We're going to put an F0 track in Mario Kart 8.

2858
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:24,000
We're going to put an F0 level in fucking Nintendo Land,

2859
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
but fuck you, you don't get an F0 game.

2860
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I want to play Eternal Darkness again.

2861
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Alright, I want to see some cool DLC characters for Smash Bros.

2862
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Maybe instead of FU of the Week, next time we should just have Wine of the Week.

2863
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Like the Wine of the Week.

2864
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:42,000
And Excitebot, or, you know, Geno.

2865
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Alright, well, sadly the phones are not lighting up.

2866
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I'm going to go ahead and close it so we can wrap up, because we are well after 9 o'clock,

2867
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
and I've had a pretty long day today, I'm ready to call it.

2868
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:57,000
We weren't even supposed to be here today, to quote a popular movie.

2869
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Alright, anyhow, so we are here at the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

2870
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
and, you know, before we wrap up shop here, I just want to say Marissa,

2871
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:08,000
it is so lovely to have you here in studio.

2872
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Just your presence is always fun to have.

2873
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:13,000
I know you don't play as many games as the rest of us, but you know what?

2874
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:17,000
At least you still have a respect and an adoration for it,

2875
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
especially with the whole voice acting connections,

2876
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:23,000
and I think it's always interesting to hear your perspective of the industry side of things.

2877
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I love it. I actually do play a little more than I care to admit,

2878
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:28,000
but I don't want to be held to being incorrect when I speak up.

2879
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:31,000
If they come for you, I will fight them.

2880
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
If they come for you, I will fight them.

2881
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I love being here. It's such a pleasure.

2882
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Alright, you're welcome any time that you can get yourself up here.

2883
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Alright, or, one of these days, we're going to come invade LA. I'm just saying.

2884
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Oh, you guys so should.

2885
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I know, I know. It would be my dream to do a live from E3 show,

2886
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:50,000
but we have to let Loki's wife leave for a couple days to do that.

2887
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Alright, but Marissa, thank you again so much for being here.

2888
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Best of luck to you in your journey as you continue to find more and more voice acting engagements and so forth.

2889
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Please, please plug it one more time.

2890
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Seriously, guys, if you need a voice actress, Marissa.

2891
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
You get to hear me doing some really silly stuff.

2892
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:13,000
It's MarissaMizell.com and that's my official website and then you can link to there.

2893
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Or it's Marissa Mizell at SoundCloud and I have some silly stuff there too as well.

2894
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:20,000
It's just good fun and I appreciate any listens and feedback anyway.

2895
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
It doesn't matter who you are. It's always interesting.

2896
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Yeah, that's great.

2897
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Thank you.

2898
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Thank you. Alright, let's...

2899
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I listened to that Marissa girl. She sounds like a good young lady.

2900
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
That's right. She's nice.

2901
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Alright, she's so wholesome.

2902
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Next on the Disney Channel.

2903
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
That means she's such a good actress.

2904
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
That's when you know you've really got them fooled.

2905
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Oh, she sounds like a good Christian girl. Alright.

2906
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Shalom.

2907
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Alright. Anyhow, as I say at the end of every show.

2908
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

2909
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
If you like what you heard here at the show, we've said this for the past 574 weeks.

2910
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2911
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Help spread the word because Orange Launch Radio is the place where every gamer has a voice.

2912
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,000
And we want to have your friends at the table as long as they promise to behave.

2913
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:17,000
No whipping it out and putting it on the table. That's disrespectful.

2914
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Unless you're Nintendo or something. Then you get to do that.

2915
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.

2916
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I'll start with my official final thought.

2917
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:30,000
My final thought is I want to give a big congratulations.

2918
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Speaking of 500 weeks, I want to give a big congratulations to Critical Myth.

2919
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Who is having episode 500 of their show air on the network Monday.

2920
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Now to be fair, that's not 500 weeks because they do three shows a week.

2921
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:52,000
But still, how many shows get to 500 one-hour episodes?

2922
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Not a lot. Not a lot. A fantastic accomplishment.

2923
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:01,000
And if you like television, who doesn't like TV? There's got to be some nerdy show.

2924
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Even you will watch Doctor Who or there's some shows you watch once in a while.

2925
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:11,000
And chances are if it's a nerdy show, Critical Myth is talking about it.

2926
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
So check out their reviews.

2927
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:17,000
TV.vognetwork.com and you can actually participate and write your own reviews.

2928
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:20,000
And check out their shows Monday, Wednesday, Friday at VOG Network.

2929
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:23,000
A big congrats to Critical Myth and the whole crew over there.

2930
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:28,000
All those guys that met for the first time at this year's Dragon Con for 500 episodes.

2931
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Woo!

2932
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Okay. Loki, your final thought.

2933
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:37,000
My final thought is I'll create an auto in a week.

2934
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I guess I'll work on my game during this time so that I have some productivity.

2935
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:46,000
It's going to have to write itself once that game comes out.

2936
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Well, I'll get bored of it eventually.

2937
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,000
But it'll be fun to go back in there and play it again.

2938
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Alright. And last but not least, StarkSoccer, your final thought tonight.

2939
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:59,000
If someone knows of an HTML5 GUI editor, because I'm looking for some...

2940
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
No, seriously.

2941
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:07,000
I'm looking for something that I can do to do dating sim-esque dialogue for an idea I have.

2942
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:13,000
If anyone knows of a good one that will run in HTML5, please let me know.

2943
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Thank you.

2944
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Well, you know Unity exports HTML5.

2945
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
I know and I don't know if...

2946
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:23,000
There is a content thing on the Asset Store for dating sim dialogue.

2947
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,000
I don't think it's free.

2948
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
I wanted to do my webcomic in that format.

2949
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Okay. Alright.

2950
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Well, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2951
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Have a great week everybody and we will see you in seven days with episode 575 of our show

2952
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:46,000
and everything that might break in gaming over the next week that we have to fix here live on air.

2953
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Thanks again for tuning in and supporting the show guys.

2954
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
We'll see you next week. Bye.

2955
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
They were all still true.

2956
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
See you next week.

2957
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Thanks for watching.
