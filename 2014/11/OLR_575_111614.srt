1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
A new AAA release, a new series of issues, Assassin's Creed Unity release and gamers

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,960
are both amused and annoyed at player trapping bugs, multiplayer issues, and an array of

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,960
visual glitches.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,020
We'll have much more as well as your comments and calls, so keep your face on and stay tuned

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,900
for the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,740
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,660
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:42,140
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 575 for this

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,700
November the 16th of 2014.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,460
Joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,100
gamer lifestyle with me, my name's Rob Robertson.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,460
Joining me as always are my co-hosts, say hello over there to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,460
Nom nom.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,460
How are you doing?

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm satisfied.

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,340
Yes, we went on a lunch date earlier.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
With the lady Victoria.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,460
Yes, for those of you that know Horde House, there's one of my co-hosts over there, we

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,380
call him Grandpa because he's been playing, or was playing Warcraft since Vanilla, a very

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,060
long time, so we call him Grandpa.

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,820
So his quote unquote wife, which, he's actually a gay man, so it's, you know, his fruit fly,

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,700
flame dame, I don't know, what are the terms, I know a lot of women that hang out with gay

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,780
men do not like the blank hag, they don't like that one anymore, so whatever that is,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,900
that's what she is to Grandpa, so we call her Grandma.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,460
Although that's not really, I mean, I don't know, I feel like in that situation she's

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,420
more like, when Anna Nicole Smith married the rich tycoon guy, she's more like that,

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,420
so I think that's what it is.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,420
So she's Anna.

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,420
Yes, she's Anna.

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,820
So we went to, we went to,

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Genghis Kitchen.

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,500
Yes, Mongolian barbecue with Anna Banana.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Yeah.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
So.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,780
It was yummy.

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Good times.

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,340
And then you brought leftovers to make my whole house smell like Mongolian.

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,140
I have, I have a lot of leftovers, and I've actually, I must say, I've finally given up

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,180
on the whatever low carb crap thing I was doing before, and I've just said, fuck it.

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,940
And I'm eating whatever I want to.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,620
And I dropped three pounds.

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,620
You're on the fuck it diet.

43
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm on the fuck it.

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm on the fuck it.

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm gonna eat it.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,540
I'm just, I don't care anymore.

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,340
It's a happy way of living.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,740
I have a lot less stress.

49
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,660
And apparently I'm happy with everything else going on, so fuck it, I'm gonna play DDR.

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
Awesome.

51
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
All right.

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,540
Nothing wrong with incorporating a little exercise into the fuck it diet.

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,980
Clearly over on the fuck it diet, chomping down on his McDonald's fries over there.

54
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,700
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

55
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,860
It was just, they're the only people that could give me food.

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,580
I was late today because I had to put away laundry because the stupid dryer took too

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,580
long.

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,700
Are you saying that laundry is more important than OLR?

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,540
No, I don't, I don't agree that it is, but you know.

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,900
The wife might feel differently.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,420
She might disagree that, you know, her clothes are wrinkled and stuff, so I had to hang everything

62
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,780
up and then I was like, crap, you know, I'm not that hungry, so I'll just go to McDonald's.

63
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,220
And thankfully they're busy, so that means that the fries are pretty good.

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,620
So that was good.

65
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,540
And then, um, yeah, I'm kind of on the fuck it diet too because, uh, with the cafes at

66
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,700
work now, it's like, yeah, I'll bring in stuff, but I'm like, no, they make such delicious

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
food.

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
What, you make your own Barbies?

69
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,380
Oh my God, it's so good.

70
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,500
So you, you started the new job now, so you don't, you don't work in gaming distribution

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
anymore, unfortunately.

72
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,700
That doesn't mean you don't have friends, you know, can hook you up.

73
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Yeah.

74
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,060
It's, uh, so I'm glad to see you got settled pretty quick.

75
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
All things considered.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yeah.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Good for you.

78
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,740
Um, you were mentioning before the show to me that, uh, you've been playing a lot of

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,940
games this week and we'll get into the details and we get into how was your gaming week,

80
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,220
but, uh, you found that now that your PlayStation four is back and working, you catching up

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,220
on everything or what happened?

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,940
Yeah, I'm sort of, I mean, I, I've been playing lots of stuff.

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,020
I even went through and just kind of checking out some of the, um, PlayStation plus games

84
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
and that kind of thing.

85
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,780
And as I was mentioning too, though, I've been noticing that I've been buying a lot

86
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,820
more things digitally, which is kind of weird.

87
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,700
I never thought they would be doing that, but like, it's, it's just, for me, it seems

88
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,460
to be pretty like by the time I go and take something back, like say if I'm going to,

89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,060
I'm not going to really sell it on eBay anymore because it's kind of absolutely easy.

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,100
You want to have like a mailroom at work and I could just, you know, put it together and

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,620
just give it to the mail person and, you know, send it off, you know, whereas now I would

92
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,740
have to go to the post office or I'd have to go drop it off in a UPS box or something

93
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
like that.

94
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,740
It's a pain in the ass.

95
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,060
So I just, I'm not really selling stuff on eBay and, you know, to take something back

96
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,660
to like GameStop or something like that, it's not, you don't really get a ton of money.

97
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,580
So I've been doing a lot of, no, I don't know.

98
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Not a lot.

99
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,980
I bought like call of duty and grand theft auto digitally, mainly those two will call

100
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
of duty.

101
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,460
I want it digitally because I wanted the PlayStation three version as well.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,840
So I can play with my friends that don't have a PlayStation four yet.

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,400
And then grand theft auto, uh, just because it didn't really matter, wasn't going to sell

104
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
that game back anyways.

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,200
And it was, you know, I got a little bit more stuff with it.

106
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,440
Plus since I spent over a hundred dollars on PlayStation network, they kicked me back

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,840
$15.

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,360
You know, that was a thing that they had during the month of October.

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Yeah.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah.

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,460
I, I, I'm not still super into the buying things digitally.

112
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,980
You know, I like to have the physical copy of things because I can sell it back and it

113
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,760
does have that value.

114
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,720
But I do find that I, I will, it's not to say, Oh, I never buy games digitally.

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,340
No, I found that I will get sucked into it usually when there's like a really good deal

116
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,960
or something, which of course, steam sales or, you know, any digital distribution channel

117
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,240
really sales and they've been doing be very, even like, yeah, the games of gold stuff.

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,580
They are not games of gold, but like, um, the PlayStation network stuff where they'll

119
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
have stuff on sale.

120
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Yeah.

121
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Sometimes that's actually really good.

122
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Like I bought Hatsune Miku that way.

123
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Yeah.

124
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,360
I was going to buy a wool Lego Marvel superheroes.

125
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I had saw that I was like, eh, I don't really play like Lego games, but maybe that's something

126
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
my son would like.

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,520
And I kind of hesitated and I didn't buy it.

128
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
It was like $20.

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
I hate to say it.

130
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Sorry.

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Lego fans was probably for the best.

132
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
You didn't.

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
I didn't really care for it.

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I did buy it.

135
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I really care for it.

136
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Julian is addicted to those Lego games.

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
I played way more injustice.

138
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Uh, I did buy it though.

139
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I did.

140
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I did end up picking it up.

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,720
I bought it digitally because, um, I looked at with the $15 I had on there, um, which

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,520
expires in December.

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,080
Um, honestly it would have been cheaper than buying it used.

144
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,480
So I just went ahead and picked up digitally, uh, running the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

145
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,600
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network of vognetwork.com

146
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,720
at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,360
And if you do happen to be participating with our show live, you can comment and we read

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,080
them and read some of our favorite comments here on air to start a discussion in the room

149
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
sometimes.

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,200
Uh, and just dungeon buster says, speaking of digital inquisition was a decent 24 gig

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,000
download was a nice rest respite from the 47 gigabyte monster that unity is.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Uh, so yeah, a lot of people getting ready for dragon age with the digital, uh, Alan,

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
my partner, Alan did that.

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,040
Uh, he's already got his deluxe, whatever through origin, ready to go.

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm thinking about it.

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I was looking at today.

157
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
The problem.

158
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah.

159
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,000
I haven't played any of the dragon age games, but I mean, um, like they've been getting

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
really good reviews for it.

161
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,440
So I was like, maybe I tried really hard to get into the other games.

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
They just didn't click for me, but I'm going to give it another go with something.

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
That's been my question is like, is this game going to be something where if I haven't played

164
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,960
origins or two that I'm going to be kind of like, who are these people?

165
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm being told no, it's, it's basically you get new batches of characters for each game,

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,000
but they do have characters that continue.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Like Zevram in the first one showed up into for a little bit and I think he's got appearance

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,200
in three, but I'm being told that like, yes, there is fan service for fans of the first

169
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,960
two games, but you're not going to be like lost as hell if you didn't buy them.

170
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,840
And they have that standalone catch up thing.

171
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,600
I forget somebody in chat might have to help me or if Shane was in the room, he'd yell

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
it out.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,040
But there's that, uh, that dragon age keep, is that what it was called?

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,160
The keep something where you can actually play through the first two, uh, like stories.

175
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,360
It's kind of like the Mass Effect comics, I guess you played through the stories, make

176
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,320
the key decisions and then your, your save goes to origin, which what, wherever you get

177
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
dragon age will pull from origin.

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
I have origin.

179
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Yeah.

180
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,000
Cause I have origins on origin because of, you know, they were given out free, but I

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
don't know.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,360
And then, and then far cry four cause far cry four looks amazing too.

183
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,160
And as like all these games, it's so, I know I was just, I was just talking about it with

184
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,960
Bobby on his show, uh, before we were on arrows, like I, I'm dropping $200 on games next week.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,080
Like it's just, it's disgusting, but it's, I mean this next week is the biggest week

186
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,240
because we're on the heels of black Friday.

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,280
I ordered my game, uh, right when I got hired at low cat officially.

188
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,800
So I'm glad I paid for it.

189
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
All right.

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
It's one of those times I was glad that I ordered it already.

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,460
Um, but there actually is another thing that popped up that's probably going to be getting

192
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,600
me to spend some money and that's that, uh, this, uh, origin has out the Sims four create

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
a SIM for free.

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,200
So I was going to play with that cause now you can drown your Sims on dungeon buster,

195
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,080
by the way, is confirming that it is the keep and you can check that out at dragon age.

196
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Keep.com.

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,980
Uh, is that I am going to probably wait on, I do want far cry four and maybe dragon ages

198
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,120
because you know, everybody's going to be playing it and stuff, but I'm, I don't know.

199
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,720
I, I'm going to wait just to see if there's some black Friday sales.

200
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Here's my problem.

201
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,380
I have dragon age inquisition, which even though I didn't even really super play the

202
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
first one.

203
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,860
My, my roommate and my partner are super into dragon age and they're both, you know, especially

204
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
shame.

205
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
How many players can do co-op?

206
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Huh?

207
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
How many players can do co-op?

208
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,220
I don't know, but it's not cross platform.

209
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
So think carefully about which platform you're gonna buy it on.

210
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,540
I'm getting them PlayStation four if I get it.

211
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
Yeah, I probably will too.

212
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,980
And that's where Shane has it too.

213
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,020
But then Alan and Jamie are going to be on PC.

214
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,840
So it's going to depend on, yeah, well, but I figure Alan and I can always switch.

215
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,540
I can always play on his account if I really want to play with PC people.

216
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,340
He can play on my PS four if there's somebody who wants to play with there.

217
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,780
So anyway, uh, where was I not just trying to, okay, so next week we also have little

218
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,420
big planet three, which I don't want to get lost in the shuffle.

219
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,340
I realized that may not be getting the fanfare of the other little, honestly, I'm going

220
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,660
to hold off on that one just because I dug it at E3 and I love those games.

221
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,180
I've been playing that stupid iPhone runner of all things, the little big planet one.

222
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,420
I've been playing that a lot more than I would care to admit actually.

223
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,480
So I'm actually really excited about little big planet three, which I realized is kind

224
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,940
of, it's, it's strangely enough, somehow not really the triple a title next week.

225
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,420
I mean, I realize it is Sony's big, big title, but it is getting, you know, a lot of the

226
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,340
attention is focused on dragon age and super smash brothers, will you, which is that other

227
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
game I have to pick up.

228
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,460
And of course I can't pick that up and not get at least one or two or three of those

229
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
amiibos.

230
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
So which ones are you getting?

231
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:12,740
I decided to get Samus because Samus and I decided to get peach because peach and, uh,

232
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,020
for the third one, I did something that you might not expect.

233
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,940
I got Mario, which I know it seems like, well, that's kind of vanilla, but that was actually

234
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,420
the reason why I picked it up is because I said, you know what?

235
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,660
Like a lot of games are going to support Mario going forward.

236
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,820
Like that's the one you're going to want to have.

237
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,740
Like I realized, you know, they're talking about only the link one works and, but we'll

238
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,700
see how I like the three that I get and if I want to get more, I'll get more.

239
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,940
It doesn't seem like they're hard to get right now.

240
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,660
I don't think those first few are going to be very hard to get because it's cool.

241
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,660
They're fun to collect and stuff, but right now it's, it's not like it's integral to playing

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,900
a certain game like smash brothers or something.

243
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,740
You don't need them to play the game.

244
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,260
It's not like, you know, say Skylanders or Disney infinity or something like that where

245
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,260
you actually play as those characters in the game.

246
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,340
Um, so I think that they're just not going to, I don't think they're going to fly off

247
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
shells.

248
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,860
I mean people pick them up for sure.

249
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Yeah.

250
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,000
But, um, Kai's, you don't, our chat says only new game that's doing it for me this month

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
is Pokemon.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's about it.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
That's a, I kind of had to bump that.

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,820
Like I'm, I'm out of money now.

256
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,500
I can't, I can't get Pokemon right now.

257
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,220
I'll wait and see how it's being received.

258
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm sure I'll hear all about it from Shane.

259
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
Yeah.

260
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Shane will pick it up.

261
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Of course.

262
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Uh, let's see what else is there?

263
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,740
Um, there's grand theft auto five, which you were telling me I have to get, but then you're

264
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,820
like, Oh, we could share play it.

265
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,360
So I'll probably do that.

266
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
So Oh my gosh.

267
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
Oh yeah.

268
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
I can't wait.

269
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,540
I'm going to totally stream that game once I get it, get a chance to play it.

270
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
So it'll be fun.

271
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Uh, yeah.

272
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,260
Lots and lots of stuff to look forward to next week.

273
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,620
Let's um, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic though.

274
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,140
I want to talk about this week and there's a story from this week that literally everyone

275
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
is talking about.

276
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,820
So let's throw our hat under the ring and let's see what you guys in chat think about

277
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
this.

278
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,660
Um, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on?

279
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Okay.

280
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,580
So Ubisoft released a game, um, the latest game in their assassin's creed franchise.

281
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,060
And of course this time they released a little, you know, two games, they had one on PlayStation

282
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,420
three and Xbox three 60 and then one on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.

283
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,700
That one being assassin's creed unity has some problems.

284
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,060
Uh, there was all sorts of glitches.

285
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,620
There were seriously some, I don't know, texture draw issues where it would not really draw

286
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
the face of people.

287
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,820
It would just kind of have the mouth and eyes and kind of make them look like, was it, um,

288
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,140
is that from like, um, the body snatchers or some of those characters look like super

289
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,420
meat boy rendered in 3d honestly, it was, it was, it was all messed up.

290
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,900
And of course now that joke is ever, I'm sure you've heard this joke 500 times.

291
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
So here's 501.

292
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,300
Well, it looks like Ubisoft really couldn't render women, poor men.

293
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,300
Um, apparently even having issues, um, I remember reading issues with it running on high end

294
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,300
PCs, even if it was AMD chips or something, ATI, um, cards and stuff, it just wouldn't

295
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
be able to run very well.

296
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,620
Um, I guess it's not ATI anymore.

297
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,300
It's AMD, but, um, yeah, uh, pretty bad.

298
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,700
And they've released, I think already a couple, um, a couple updates, but still hasn't fixed

299
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
everything.

300
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,860
This is really tricky because you know, uh, some of the things I'm hearing from the, and

301
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,580
just disclosure, I haven't played the game and I don't think my co-hosts have either.

302
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,580
So, you know, yes, we're talking at our butt a little bit on something that everybody online

303
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,780
is talking about, but it's, it's a very interesting lesson in a way of maybe you should watch

304
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,660
what you're spending your money on before you actually spend the money.

305
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,900
Cause there's even, even some fans of Assassin's Creed that I know on Facebook are like, this

306
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
game's a mess.

307
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,180
This game is an absolute mess, but I'm also hearing that like this, it's sorry.

308
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,940
I'm also hearing that it kind of sucks when you're a fan of the series because deep down

309
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,620
in there somewhere, there's a good story.

310
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,460
Like the backbone and the skeleton of the Assassin's Creed.

311
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,880
There's a good Assassin's Creed game in here.

312
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,180
Someone took it out of the oven before it was done.

313
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,260
Sounds like it was, it was just badly managed badly badly.

314
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
I liked how it was.

315
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,460
They said, uh, was it, they had art, um, you know, falling to the ground, crashing when

316
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,700
you're enjoying a co-op session, getting stuck in hay carts, that's kind of funny.

317
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Um, frame rate issues, graphical inclusion issues, matchmaking co-op issues, um, helix

318
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,460
credit issues, which I don't know the fuck that is.

319
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,540
I hope that's not like in app purchases or some shit like that.

320
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,460
Um, cause I thought I heard that this game had that or it was one of these games that

321
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,860
just came out where they can, you can speed up progression by buying stuff.

322
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,340
I don't know if that's the helix credits or what that is, but it was in the whole

323
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,700
thing where like there's chests in the game that you can't open unless you have the smart

324
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
phone app.

325
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Like, Oh yes, yes.

326
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I did see that.

327
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,340
How can you possibly justify that to, that's a good thing for gamers cause you know, there's

328
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,300
going to be that fricking press release that comes out like, well, this is what gamers

329
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:11,180
want based on their website or something like that or the open, like some other chest and

330
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,940
it's, it's, this is really getting to the point where it's, it's really ridiculous.

331
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,740
Um, and you know, again, I know there's fans of Assassin's Creed out there, uh, somewhere

332
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,020
that are probably pissed that this is happening to their franchise, but this is, I mean, this

333
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:35,100
is kind of a tough lesson learned in regards to, uh, management and where the people up

334
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,620
here are getting involved with a game that maybe they have no business getting involved

335
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,860
with sadly.

336
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,620
And they're just, it's, they're going, they're out of EA kind of, and just really, and remember

337
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,220
that we had problems even with, um, the last, you know, Ubisoft game that was a big release.

338
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,900
Um, watch songs had issues on PC.

339
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,700
There's a whole controversy about, Oh, Hey, there, you know, is being shown and you know,

340
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,580
better fidelity for the E3 demos and this wasn't the case and now all that stuff was

341
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,660
hidden in there or disabled or something like that.

342
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,020
And just a whole bunch of, um, you know, seeing them as glitchy and stuff and they,

343
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,780
this isn't the first game they have coming out this month.

344
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
I mean, they've got the crew next week as well, so that's an online focus game.

345
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,340
So hopefully that doesn't get all fucked up.

346
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,300
Um, cause you know, in chat says, I don't think we should blame people for buying it

347
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
day one.

348
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,860
You buying, you should expect it to work.

349
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,620
Um, well, I, I agree.

350
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,620
Let's talk about this part a little bit because you know, um, Twitter this week for the first

351
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,340
time in several months, uh, we are, we are actually having a chat about ethics and game

352
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,060
journalism all over this week because of the infamous embargo that was on this game and

353
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,580
the fact that, uh, many sites were embargoed on their reviews of Assassin's Creed unity

354
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,780
until noon the day the game was out and Ubisoft's perspective was, well, we need to make sure

355
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,060
people actually are exposed to the online component because online is such an important

356
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,420
part of the game.

357
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,540
But in reality with as glitchy as, as some of the stuff was showing to be, a lot of people

358
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,760
kind of already had their reviews done.

359
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,060
And I know a lot of outlets out there now kind of do like they kind of do living breathing

360
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,700
reviews where, you know, if they can't review the online component right away, they'll amend

361
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,820
or an issue, an addendum to their review later on or whatever to, to incorporate that in.

362
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,020
But the bottom line is once all these issues kind of came to light, this started to feel

363
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,020
like maybe this is a really shady way for Ubisoft to not get the word out there for

364
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,820
the day one buyers that the game might be broken.

365
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,460
Yeah, I think so.

366
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,760
And there's been some outlets that have straight out come out and said, never again, like,

367
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,140
you know, and I know we've razzed this site in the past sometimes, but Kotaku, I have

368
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,340
to applaud them this week because they came out and they put their foot down and they

369
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,260
said, we will no longer agree to post release embargoes.

370
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,860
And I, I have to applaud that.

371
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,500
It's their right to do that.

372
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,500
And I think it's going to take a lot of these big websites coming out and pushing back against

373
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,020
the publishers.

374
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,300
If only all of these big websites had a way to communicate with each other behind the

375
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
scenes, like a mailing list or something anyway.

376
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,540
So all these big websites are going to have to start pushing back and basically saying,

377
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,540
we're not going to play by these rules because these rules are anti-consumer and that's what's

378
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,300
going to have to happen for things to change.

379
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,780
See then what's going to happen is if they do play by their rules or whatever, then they

380
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,060
get the exclusive preview or whatever they can do that drives in more traffic to their

381
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
website.

382
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Which is also bull.

383
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,940
And that's where we as the users have to stop buying into that shit where, you know, ethics.

384
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,020
Yeah, exactly.

385
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,900
If you want to, you know, and to go back to the big question about ethics and game journalism

386
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,560
that has to come on both sides.

387
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,660
You have to support ethical websites as well as the websites have to, you know, do things

388
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
ethically anyway.

389
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Let's see.

390
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,180
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

391
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,540
Pow in chat says, same with Sonic.

392
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,740
Journalists didn't get review copies because Sega didn't want that.

393
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Yeah, let's not neglect that.

394
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
They know this stuff.

395
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,580
It's not like they don't know the state their game is going out in.

396
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,980
They play test this shit.

397
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,700
They know there's no way that, oh, we never had any of these glitches when we're testing

398
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
it.

399
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
That's a bunch of shit.

400
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,300
Here's where the Wii U kind of bubbling under the other, the PS4 and the Xbox one.

401
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,900
Here's where the Wii U being in that position kind of did a favor this week because not

402
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,580
as many people talking about Sonic, although it is to be fit.

403
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,660
Sonic Boom is in a very similar situation where a lot of people that have been playing

404
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,620
it are saying it's, it's grant granted that Sonic Boom, the bar wasn't exactly as high

405
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,620
as a century.

406
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
Exactly.

407
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
It's quite low.

408
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
That's true.

409
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
That's true.

410
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,820
A lot of people kind of go into Sonic games these days with tempered expectations.

411
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,620
But still, the last Assassin's Creed was so good, people pre-ordered this new one on

412
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,820
the back, on the heels of the last Assassin's Creed.

413
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,500
But still though, Sonic Boom still managed a limbo underneath that bar of quality that

414
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
they have there.

415
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't know, it, poor Sonic.

416
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,300
Tiger Claw on chat says, I think the only risk is the sites getting blacklisted, but

417
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,900
I read Ubisoft is changing their policies behind it.

418
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,580
Well, Ubisoft's under a lot of pressure right now.

419
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,060
Ubisoft had to come out.

420
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,780
Didn't they start like a blog about here is how we're fixing the game, basically?

421
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,100
Like, they're wearing a lot of egg right now.

422
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,620
They're really having to kind of make amends to their fan base.

423
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,540
They let a lot of the Assassin's Creed fans down.

424
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,260
And you know, maybe there's some Assassin's Creed fans out there who feel differently

425
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,100
that might email us and say, Rob, the game's not as bad as Twitter's making it out to be.

426
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,260
And if you do feel that way, please, I want to hear from you guys.

427
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,660
But right now, everything I'm hearing is it's a technical glitchy nightmare.

428
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,020
And Ubisoft does have to respond to how they've let people down who trusted them with money,

429
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
with a pre-order.

430
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
See, that's the only thing.

431
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,900
It's like, that's where I would say, that's hard to say because, you know, digital pre-orders

432
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,700
you can't cancel.

433
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Once you pre-order digitally.

434
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Yes, you can.

435
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Well, it's not easy to cancel.

436
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Let's put it that way.

437
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Yes, it was.

438
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Well, how'd you do it?

439
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,860
Did you have to call Sony and do that whole thing or whoever it is?

440
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Origin made it really easy.

441
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, yeah.

442
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:10,500
Because I ordered my Dragon Age and messed up on it because I used the wrong card.

443
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,700
It took me maybe three minutes to cancel the order.

444
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,620
Get my refund and then order it the proper way.

445
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,060
Origin even has the money back thing, though, with, you know, even if you did download it,

446
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,220
let's say this game was an EA game and came out and it was all fucked up.

447
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,460
Why did they have to do that?

448
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Because of SimCity.

449
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,500
Because of SimCity.

450
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,800
So now it's going to be interesting to see how is Ubisoft going to make it right for

451
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
some of their games.

452
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Oh, I don't know.

453
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:42,260
Let's put more Uplay features in there because, um, are there really any Uplay features that

454
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,220
I mean, I've I haven't played enough, I guess, Ubisoft games, but I haven't noticed any sort

455
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,740
of reason the need you play Dungeon Buster in chat says I've always accepted that some

456
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,980
minor glitches and patches were needed because of my PC history.

457
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,540
But the whole day one patching thing feels as if it's conditioning people to accept that

458
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,700
the product they're getting will already be broken in some way.

459
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
No, no.

460
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Hold on.

461
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
I got to stop.

462
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Stop the day one patch thing.

463
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,540
Day one patching is good because, you know, day one patching means day one patching means

464
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,280
that after the game has been pressed and is gold, that they're actually still bug fixing

465
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,740
after the fact.

466
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,740
And that's what that is, is that there is a time between when the game is gold and is

467
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,580
being pressed to when it comes out a few weeks.

468
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,700
So day one patches, I have no problem.

469
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,780
OK, but devil's advocate, I have to ask this.

470
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,300
Then why is the game going gold when it still has bugs in it?

471
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,700
Why is that acceptable?

472
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,420
Well, it's usually beyond Wednesday.

473
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,420
Assassin's Creed exactly is a good example of that.

474
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,260
I'm talking about like additional bugs that maybe are not so overt.

475
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,700
OK, maybe Dragon Age Inquisition might be an example, because Dragon Age did get bumped

476
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,220
back a month for mysterious reasons.

477
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,300
And now the game is out, the embargo is already up for it.

478
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Nine point five, a 10 out of 10.

479
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Yes, exactly.

480
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,800
And this is what needs to happen is, you know, delaying games so that EA kind of figured

481
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,420
it out with, well, they stumbled through it a few times, but they figured it out with

482
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Battlefield 4.

483
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,900
We can't let something like that happen again, hopefully, as you know, giving them benefit

484
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
of that right now.

485
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,780
And so, you know, that's why they delayed Battlefield, you know, Hardline and they delayed

486
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,220
Dragon Age Inquisition.

487
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,460
I think NBA Live was OK this year.

488
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
I don't know.

489
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,940
I don't play basketball games, so but I haven't heard any super, you know, tons of complaints

490
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
about it.

491
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,860
EA's been having a pretty good year, all things considered.

492
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,340
So I mean, I think hopefully they've learned their lesson in judging by the reviews of

493
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,500
Dragon Age Inquisition.

494
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
It sounds like it.

495
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Hardline hopefully will get good reviews.

496
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,060
Well, BioWare does a lot of quality stuff.

497
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
Yes, yes.

498
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,300
I might be a little biased, but BioWare does a lot of quality stuff, so of course it was

499
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
gonna...

500
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,860
Let's wait until Battlefield Hardline comes out.

501
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,260
Hopefully that'll be better than, you know, Battlefield 4 was.

502
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,580
Let's see, going to chat, Warrior Bob says, I don't mind day one patches if they're genuinely

503
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,020
finding or fixing new issues, but I have to admit, I really like not having to worry about

504
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,620
that, which is why I buy like 90% of my games from GOG, good old games, or flea markets.

505
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,100
And YYR is saying, you know, the reason why this stuff happens, because it has to come

506
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,700
out next week.

507
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,060
Dude, management and some of the ways these games have become so bloated in the way that

508
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,460
they're developed, it's really starting to wreck things, and I think unfortunately what

509
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,420
you're seeing here with Assassin's Creed and Sonic Boom and Battlefield and, you know,

510
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,980
this is starting to come to a climax here, where things in the gaming industry have already

511
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:39,100
been a little volatile for other shenanigans for the past couple months, and now this happens

512
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,500
and it's just like, oh my god, this has to fucking change.

513
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,860
So, joining us here in studio tonight, he's been in and out over the past few months,

514
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,020
we always appreciate him stopping by and saying hello.

515
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,420
From the big anime game room, say hello to Jonas.

516
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Hello guys.

517
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
Hey, how you doing?

518
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
I'm doing fine.

519
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,780
So you've been listening to us debate a little bit about the Assassin's Creed Unity fiasco,

520
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,420
surely you've been following what's going on, what do you think about the whole mess?

521
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,980
So far, right now it's really a tough situation on YouTube, so I can't really answer the questions,

522
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,020
since I have actually worked in the game industry before, and actually work at a company like

523
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,220
Intel, that does like all this validation stuff.

524
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:29,660
So from, this is just from a general point of perspective, sometimes marketing, again,

525
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,220
back to marketing, has to push the game out at a specific time based on investments.

526
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,420
Because at the end of the day, it's about making the investors happy.

527
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Correct.

528
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,180
Well, Ubisoft investors are not happy right now.

529
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,220
So yeah, that's one thing.

530
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:49,980
So this is why, day one patches, it's totally acceptable because they're trying to fix something

531
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,340
that might be considered critical before the consumer sees it.

532
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,500
Let's say I play something that has a critical bug, that for some reason didn't get catched,

533
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,340
or for some reason passed validation during development.

534
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,180
Like if I play and I see a huge glitch, and they say they're fixing it, okay, I'm gonna

535
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,220
be happy as a customer that day one actually happened with the fix.

536
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,300
Maybe like version 1.1, version 1.2, who knows?

537
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:23,260
But yeah, Ubisoft, the situation with Ubisoft is a really gray line situation, which I need

538
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,180
to know more details of what goes behind the scenes.

539
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,740
Well, we're gonna feel the effects of this week over the next few years.

540
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,660
I mean, it's not just Assassin's Creed, it's Sonic, it's also World of Warcraft.

541
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,500
You know, we're gonna get into that a little later in the show, but World of Warcraft launched

542
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,340
an expansion, and they had a lot of technical glitches that harken back to when the original

543
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
game came out.

544
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,860
And not even that, Halo the Master Chief collection, multiplayer server issues.

545
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,540
So I think there's a lot of gamers out there that are just fucking fed up with a lot of

546
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
this.

547
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:08,780
In addition to Assassin's Creed, this is probably one of Ubisoft's biggest challenges

548
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,020
to pretty much make amends for the customers and their fanbase.

549
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,540
For Sonic Boom, this isn't the first time this has happened.

550
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,660
I think everyone remembers what happened with Sonic 06.

551
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,380
Yeah, let's not talk about Sonic 06.

552
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,660
But it's just an example, like, if it happens once, okay, maybe the people may forgive.

553
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,980
But if it happens, like, constantly, then okay, then that's where the customers...

554
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,180
You're right, because what's happened with Assassin's Creed, and you can argue, I mean,

555
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,420
there might be an Assassin's Creed fan out there listening that's like, Rob, you're wrong,

556
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,300
it's not that bad, the internet's blowing it up, but this is gonna be a hard point to

557
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
dispute.

558
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
What is that?

559
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,940
Perception is everything out there right now, right?

560
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,620
And so the headlines, I mean, the BBC ran a story about the bugs in Assassin's Creed.

561
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,740
So at the end of the day, the perception out there is, Assassin's Creed is a buggy game.

562
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,460
So what is the ultimate impact of this gonna be?

563
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,500
If there's an Assassin's Creed 2015, the pre-orders are gonna be impacted next year, because people

564
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,300
are gonna stop and go, maybe I wanna wait for the reviews before I pre-order the game

565
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
this time.

566
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
After what happened.

567
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,380
And I wouldn't even say it's as far as that goes.

568
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,420
I mean, look at the kind of stuff that Ubisoft is pushing as quality products.

569
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,100
I mean, Watch Dogs had issues, and that was a big tentpole title for them.

570
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,940
You know, Assassin's Creed's having issues now.

571
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,620
The crew's gonna be coming out very shortly, so let's see if that has issues, and then

572
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,180
there's the Division that's supposed to be coming out, I think next year at some point.

573
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,820
If all of these, especially these online focus games that are gonna have server issues, like

574
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,380
the crew, I'm worried about that.

575
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,220
I mean, the servers are all fucked up and you can't play the game.

576
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,300
Assassin's Creed, I don't know if it's such a big deal.

577
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,940
Another interesting perspective here, Alan Alchemy in chat says, Bioware pushing Dragon

578
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,020
Age Inquisition by five weeks in July probably wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for

579
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,780
the Mass Effect 3 mess, and them knowing that far ahead that they'd need more time.

580
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,880
If it was August, September, Activision probably wouldn't let them bump it.

581
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,380
Bioware has a lot of social capital to spend regarding, do you want another Mass Effect

582
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,580
3 on your hands?

583
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,060
Now Ubisoft gets to say, do you want another Unity on your hands going forward?

584
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,880
Interesting that that's what it takes, but again, I really feel like what's happened

585
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,340
this week, this month essentially, with not just one game, but the one game that's become

586
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,100
a symbol for several games, this impact's gonna be felt a year from now.

587
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,180
We're gonna be, like next E3, we will see things because of what happened this week.

588
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,420
I had a question though, because I'm not playing Assassin's Creed, so I don't really know,

589
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,460
and I was also looking up something else here real quick, but were these issues mainly on

590
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,900
PC or was this on console?

591
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
All of them.

592
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Okay.

593
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,300
And speaking of, I was kind of curious, I'm like, well Assassin's Creed Unity didn't do

594
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,180
that great, I wonder what Rogue-

595
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,740
Well, and interesting you bring that up, because I want to make sure that did get brought up

596
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,940
at some point, is because a lot of people don't even know, there was a second Assassin's

597
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,840
Creed game that came out last week, and one reason people don't know that is because they

598
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,560
didn't give the early copies to anybody.

599
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,860
It was not, there wasn't an embargo or anything, they just flat out didn't send it out until

600
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,500
the day it came out, because Rogue is the quote unquote last gen release, it's the Xbox

601
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,220
360 and Playstation 3 release, but what I'm hearing, again, haven't played it, I can only

602
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,100
go off of everything that I try to absorb during the week, just like many of you, I'm

603
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,620
hearing it's not a bad game at all.

604
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,500
That's the experience people expected, you know what I mean?

605
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Reviews aren't that great.

606
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Oh really?

607
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Yeah.

608
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,460
Well, keep in mind, I don't, I'm going off of gamers on Twitter, but generally it's better

609
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,820
than Unity right now, that's for sure.

610
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,300
It's probably not as buggy, because it's running in the same engine as the game last year,

611
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,020
but I'm going to say, I don't know, I'm trying to see real quick, let's see what-

612
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,820
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Rogue is really fun if you loved Black Flag.

613
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,340
Cow in chat says, I love Assassin's Creed, that's why I'm frustrated.

614
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Yeah, it looks like they're getting about, you know, along the average, about the same

615
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,020
sort of reviews.

616
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,900
Black Wolf is talking about the crew, saying, one thing I noticed in the crew beta is that

617
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,300
the single player was still playable if you couldn't connect fully to their servers.

618
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Oh good, see, because I was worried that that was more of an MMO type thing, where you know,

619
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
you have to play that.

620
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,780
I'm cool with it, hey, as long as they have single player not hindered by the fact that

621
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,820
you can't connect to the server, fine by me.

622
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,940
It's an inconvenience, yes, but it's not like, I'm not going to be as mad as like, say if

623
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,680
it was Destiny or something, where they're going to be, you know, like, for example,

624
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,860
they're going to be shutting down the servers, I think, for a few hours, and you know, you

625
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,400
can't play it during that time, it's fucking useless.

626
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,180
So I'm glad that it's not impacted totally by server outage problems.

627
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,620
Alright, well, again, I think we'll be talking about the events this week for a long time,

628
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,060
and we welcome your feedback, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or many of you have

629
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,060
been participating in chat.

630
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,000
We do have a lot of other news to get to in our gaming weeks, so I do want to move on

631
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,300
with the show, but before we get into our gaming weeks, since Jonas is here, let me

632
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,900
catch up with you a little bit.

633
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,900
How was Reno?

634
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,340
You did your teabagger, you took your show on the road to Reno, right, and you did a

635
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
convention up there, how'd that go?

636
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
That actually turned out pretty well.

637
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Yeah.

638
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Surprisingly, this is actually unusual, there was actually, I think it was Mario Kart and

639
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,420
Smash Brothers had the same amount of people and participants, it was like, wait, Mario

640
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,740
Kart 8 is really starting to get popular.

641
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
Yeah.

642
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,180
Well, the new Smash Brothers also isn't out yet, but, you know, I'm sure that'll level

643
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,140
set some things when that comes out, but, well, now you have the Mario Kart DLC, and

644
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,780
that's gonna, you know, that's gonna make Mario Kart kind of last even longer.

645
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,620
I think a lot of people turned on Mario Kart 8 this week who hadn't touched it in a couple

646
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,140
months, I'm one of them.

647
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,740
I hadn't played in a couple months, but I was like, oh, I gotta check out those new

648
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
tracks.

649
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,740
Oh, wait for the game of the year edition.

650
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Oh, Anna Wii U.

651
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,380
The inevitable game of the year edition next year that has it all bundled together.

652
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,500
I'm sure that'll be a thing, we laugh, but it will.

653
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,900
So everything went well for you guys in Reno?

654
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,300
Yeah, SnafuCon was actually pretty fun, it's a 24-7 game room and stuff, so it was like,

655
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
ooh.

656
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Is that hard to do 24 hours?

657
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,300
I think his mic's off, I might check that.

658
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Oh, oops.

659
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Oh, no.

660
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Oops.

661
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,660
Anyways, SnafuCon's 24-7 gaming, it's actually not bad because, yeah, I think it's like 1,000

662
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,820
plus people, but not as much as big as FanimeCon or those other cons.

663
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,820
But nevertheless, the community was really nice and it was manageable, meeting up with

664
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,860
Greenlight Gaming and other communities like the Reno Smash community and stuff.

665
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Gotcha.

666
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,940
Let's see, what else do I want to ask you about?

667
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,820
Recently, this has nothing to do with the anime game room, but it's something I want

668
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,220
to ask you about, there was a large Pump It Up competition that you participated in, and

669
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,800
my understanding is you did pretty fucking awesome.

670
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
What happened?

671
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
I got second place of the US Championships.

672
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
So where were the US Championships at?

673
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,100
It was in Los Angeles.

674
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,900
So you went all the way to Los Angeles to participate in Pump It Up Freestyle?

675
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Yep.

676
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
And you got second place?

677
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Yep.

678
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Get the fuck out, that's amazing.

679
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Good job!

680
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
I'm surprised myself, I'm like, holy shit.

681
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,620
Can we see the video online somewhere?

682
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:18,320
I'm uploading the videos online, again, everybody, I know it's gonna take a while to upload it

683
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,800
on YouTube at 60 frames a second at 1080p, because YouTube actually allows you to do

684
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
60 frames a second videos now.

685
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Like the super high-def stuff?

686
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Mm-hmm.

687
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Well, congrats to you.

688
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
What song did you do?

689
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,040
Actually, I'll just stay tuned for YouTube to find out.

690
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Oh, you.

691
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Oh, you.

692
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
All right.

693
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Sorry.

694
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
So what did you get?

695
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,880
Did you win something for second place, or was it like a winner-takes-all sort of thing?

696
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,400
I got some prizes supported by Andamir, like shirts and all that other stuff.

697
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,440
But if it was a World Pump Festival, on the other hand, if the World Pump Festival occurred,

698
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,560
this last specific year, I would have been guaranteed a world championship offer.

699
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,800
Yeah, I was gonna say, do you get to, because you're at least like top three, do you get

700
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,680
to go to what, Korea or something and participate in the world there?

701
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,760
There has not been an announcement of a World Pump Festival championships yet.

702
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Oh, okay.

703
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,680
But if it's announced, top two of any division, whether it's Women's Speed, Men's Speed, or

704
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,040
Freestyle, are eligible to go to wherever the country that they hold the World Pump

705
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,120
Festival for free, which includes like paid flights, paid food, paid hotels and stuff.

706
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Well, look at you.

707
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,160
We're in the presence of pump royalty right now.

708
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
That's amazing.

709
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,960
And good on the CM Punk thing.

710
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,680
Oh, thank you.

711
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
The pose.

712
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Yeah.

713
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Oh, yeah.

714
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Stay tuned for the videos.

715
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
All right.

716
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,400
I'm sorry we're not getting the videos up on time, but.

717
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
All right.

718
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,160
Well, you can't come here on this program and not have something to promote.

719
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,680
So now you've got to get it up because the podcasters are going to go looking for it,

720
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
wanting to see it.

721
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
So.

722
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
All right.

723
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Again, I'll post it up soon.

724
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
All right.

725
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Sounds good.

726
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Sounds good.

727
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
I hope you do get to participate in a world finals.

728
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
That's crazy.

729
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Good.

730
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,640
How much prep did it take you to do something like that?

731
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,680
This one took me a while because I'll be honest.

732
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,400
Last year I actually competed really tired and sleepy and stuff and unprepared.

733
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,320
This time I actually came in more prepared and with more sleep.

734
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Good.

735
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
Sleep is important.

736
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
And with new ideas.

737
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Yes.

738
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,760
New freestyle ideas I don't think I've ever seen before.

739
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Oh, well, look at you.

740
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,680
Chatters want to know where's your YouTube channel so we can find the thing when it's

741
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
posted.

742
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,120
You can go if you go to YouTube, just research on TBAGR space gaming or TBAGR space media

743
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,240
because it's the same name, which is.

744
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,920
You mean an underscore?

745
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
You can go YouTube just type in teabagger.

746
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,440
Hopefully they've all liked the teabagger page on Facebook by now and they will be able

747
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,680
to see it on there.

748
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
So that's the best way to do it right with 404 likes.

749
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,200
So hopefully that's good.

750
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Sounds good.

751
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,360
Well, congrats.

752
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,440
That's so awesome that you have second place in the United States for Pump It Up.

753
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
That's amazing.

754
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Thank you.

755
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Congrats.

756
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
How much?

757
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
How much do you still play?

758
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Do you play that game like every week?

759
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,080
And surprisingly, I came back at like last year's because I'll try one more time since

760
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,040
before I get too old for competitions to actually compete in the finals for you as

761
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
a lifetime.

762
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,120
Do they have an H cap or is it just like, there's no H cap.

763
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Okay.

764
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
So I could compete if I wanted to.

765
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Yes.

766
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Fuck yeah.

767
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:24,520
I mean, like for example, this one Mexican male speeder who was actually 35 and got second

768
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
place last year.

769
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Oh nice.

770
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Yeah.

771
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
35 years old.

772
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Way to wrap the 30 somethings.

773
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Awesome.

774
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,560
I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be the first 40 year old to win a freestyle

775
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
competition.

776
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Awesome.

777
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Live on stage.

778
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Watch.

779
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
All right.

780
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
That's awesome.

781
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Actually that doesn't remind me.

782
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,680
Wasn't there like a DDR routine way back in the day where some dude was on crutches and

783
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,440
got up on the DDR machine on crutches and he like threw him to the side.

784
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,040
Like he wasn't really injured the whole time.

785
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,400
I swear to God that was the thing.

786
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,480
I saw a video a long time ago of someone doing pero with crutches, but they didn't throw

787
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
them away.

788
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
They actually, Oh, maybe that might be confusing.

789
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
That might be the one.

790
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
It's been a long time.

791
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,460
Y'all been a long time.

792
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,500
Everybody in chat will know what I'm talking about.

793
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
All right.

794
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Well, congrats.

795
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,140
Uh, of course Jonas will be just staying with us throughout the show to comment on the news

796
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,940
as we get to things, but let's talk about our gaming weeks and what types of video games

797
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,580
you have been playing this week.

798
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
Dark Sakura.

799
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,960
Uh, I've been playing Hatoful Boyfriend because I'm still live streaming it, which, uh, after

800
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,180
the week of Thanksgiving, my schedule will change.

801
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,740
So my streaming day will change, but for right now I'm still streaming on Tuesdays roughly

802
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,180
between four 30 and six, you know, is when I'll start and then it's about an hour.

803
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,620
Uh, I have three endings left to do of the regular game and then I have the hurtful boyfriend

804
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,620
path.

805
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:51,660
Um, uh, other than that, I'm also playing final fantasy 14 and uh, I don't know, thinking

806
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,660
about going to play some other stuff, I just haven't decided, but I've got dragon age on

807
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
Mondays.

808
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,260
You'll never hear from me again.

809
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,260
Yay.

810
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Dragon age and lots of, uh, bust a move cause there's a new version on iOS.

811
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Okay.

812
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
All right.

813
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,860
Um, let's see.

814
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,220
This week actually played some stuff.

815
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,020
I played more Call of Duty and um, I think I'm up to level 19 now on multiplayer.

816
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,460
And then I played, what else, um, a little bit more, uh, infamous second son.

817
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,980
It's still kind of okay with it.

818
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
I don't know.

819
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,940
I'm starting to like it a little bit more, um, as playing through the game.

820
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,460
Um, some of the mini game or like not mini games with little missions and they're kind

821
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
of dumb.

822
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,700
Um, I don't like how you can kind of do collateral damage to pedestrians and it counts against

823
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,700
you.

824
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,060
Cause I'm not, it's like, listen, you had me do that move and it's supposed to destroy

825
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
all this stuff.

826
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,260
I can't help it if I kill a few innocent people along the way.

827
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,380
It's not like I'm trying to do that, but uh, I don't know.

828
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,380
It's pretty fun.

829
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:05,420
And then, uh, I played a little bit of, um, Lego Marvel superheroes, play the demo kiosks

830
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,060
for the Xbox one that had that on there.

831
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,260
And so I played that with my son a little bit and he's kind of interested in it.

832
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,780
Um, it's pretty cool looking.

833
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,920
Uh, the, the song that they have though, they have a song that's on, I'm assuming it's both

834
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,540
the digital version and um, the disc version when you pop in the game.

835
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,060
You know how like if you're navigating through stuff on PlayStation, um, little cross media

836
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,360
bar thing that it'll play kind of music sometimes.

837
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,860
It's got like some, I don't even know what it is.

838
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,940
It sounds like an old song about like Marvel, but it's just like so weird.

839
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,500
It like, it fits, but it's just kind of silly.

840
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,460
I didn't even know what it was, but um, so that's kind of cool.

841
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
And um, what else they play?

842
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,060
I played a binding of Isaac rebirth a little bit, so I'm didn't make it very far.

843
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:58,860
I only played it for like maybe like 20 minutes, but I got down to the second basement and

844
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,300
um, kind of played through that.

845
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
It was kind of fun.

846
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,980
Uh, it's kind of a silly game.

847
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,620
And then I tried a little bit of picks the cat and didn't really get into that too much.

848
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
Boogs.

849
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
That game is awesome.

850
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,460
Yeah, but I couldn't really get into binding of Isaac rebirth.

851
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,620
I don't, I played it a little bit on PC when it was first out and I tried to play it again

852
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,100
on PS4 and I'm not, I'm not feeling it.

853
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm sorry to say.

854
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Yeah, it's okay.

855
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
I don't know.

856
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,940
I don't like indie titles like that, but I just, you know, some people like extroverts

857
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
obsessed with it.

858
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
So, you know, that's cool.

859
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
Yeah.

860
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Um, and then what else?

861
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,700
Oh, I'm more ninja bots and we've got two controllers now.

862
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,660
So we've been, I was playing a little bit of that, uh, with Josh and so that's pretty

863
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,660
cool.

864
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,100
And then what else did they do?

865
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,220
Um, I think that's it.

866
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,860
I think that's all I've played.

867
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,140
Uh, but grand theft auto next week.

868
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
That's right.

869
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,140
It's already downloaded and ready.

870
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
Get ready.

871
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Can't wait.

872
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,180
Next week.

873
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,740
Uh, I played more Final Fantasy 14, of course, because you know, MMOs, um, I've been really

874
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,020
tempted to go back to wow, but so far I've resisted and that's because people are seeming

875
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,860
to really love this new expansion when they can get into the game, which you know, a lot

876
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,220
of that settled down over the weekend, but they're seeming to really love the expansion.

877
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,220
So I don't know.

878
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,020
I'm teetering on the fence, but right now I'm like, all right, look, I got like three

879
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,220
console games to buy next week.

880
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,660
One MMO is more than enough right now.

881
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,140
If I try to get into a second MMO, none of these console games are gonna get played and

882
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
I can't have that.

883
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,140
So, uh, we'll see.

884
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,020
But anyway, I am still continuing on with Final Fantasy 14.

885
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,940
There are other online games I'm continuing to play.

886
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,820
I still am playing Diablo three.

887
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,020
Uh, I was playing my seasonal hardcore character.

888
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,060
I'm up to about Paragon 20 now on that character.

889
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,480
And then I was also playing my regular character, my non hardcore, non seasonal character, just

890
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,300
because I was like, I need to do some greater rifts because I hadn't really done a lot of

891
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,300
that since it came out.

892
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,980
So I wanted to try that feature a little more.

893
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,860
So I was playing that Diablo three also been playing heroes of the storm.

894
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,100
You might remember last week when I came back from Blizzcon, I was like, you know, I wasn't

895
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,980
really feeling super energized on wow coming out of Blizzcon, but I'm like, I've been missing

896
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,980
out on heroes of the storm.

897
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,140
I got to play more of this.

898
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,980
So sure enough, I've been, I've been playing quite a bit more heroes of the storm.

899
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,580
I really enjoy playing Lele, uh, Valla, the demon hunter.

900
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,020
I even found that I really liked playing Mirrodin, which I didn't think I would enjoy, but I

901
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
do.

902
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,580
Uh, so yeah, I'm, I'm shocked at some of the characters I'm finding.

903
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:15,440
I really enjoy playing in this game and, uh, just that I am having fun with this MOBA game.

904
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,780
When if you go back a year on the show and I talked about, I really tried to get into

905
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
Dota to you guys.

906
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,020
I really tried to get into League of Legends, you guys, but I'm really, I'm just so bad

907
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,020
at the game.

908
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,140
I don't know what I'm doing, but I feel like heroes.

909
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,900
I can kind of understand it a little differently and I think it's probably because it's toned

910
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
down a little bit.

911
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,300
It is an entry level MOBA and for somebody like me, that's great.

912
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Not to knock the other games.

913
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,540
I understand why they're big, but just as an entry level game, heroes is really, really

914
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,540
good.

915
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:46,060
Um, so besides those, I've also been playing Mario Kart eight because the new DLC came

916
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,060
out this week.

917
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,220
I was talking earlier, uh, that, you know, if you haven't jumped into a game or if you

918
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,360
haven't played Mario Kart eight in a couple of months, you probably put it in and checked

919
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,660
it out this week because of the new DLC.

920
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,060
And uh, yeah, it's a, it's a strong DLC pack.

921
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,740
Uh, I kind of think that there's really only one new character.

922
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:09,020
I think Tanooki Mario and cat peach or whatever, kind of a stretch for new characters, but

923
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,080
all right, whatever.

924
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,820
But having link is awesome.

925
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,420
Having the new cars is pretty cool.

926
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,040
Uh, and the new tracks, it's really about the tracks and the, the tracks are, are, are

927
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,920
are pretty good for the most part.

928
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,960
Um, like I love the Zelda track.

929
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
The Zelda tracks are great.

930
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,760
Uh, I especially love the fact that instead of collecting coins, you get rupees, they

931
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,920
change it to rupees.

932
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,640
And when you run over the question mark blocks, instead of the usual roulette noise, it makes,

933
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,880
it goes, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

934
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
and then your item comes up.

935
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,720
Like it's those little changes like that that make that course really a lot, a lot of fun

936
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
to play.

937
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,760
Um, now you're probably wondering what I think about the F zero course.

938
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
And my answer honestly is, eh, eh.

939
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,960
It's not an F zero game.

940
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,160
And honestly it just feels like an F zero skin on what is otherwise a very Mario Kart

941
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,440
course.

942
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,820
And I was not really a fan of the Mute City remix because they, it's kind of super jazz,

943
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,600
like saxophone, like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

944
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,760
Like it's like, ugh, no, they, did Kenny G perform in this?

945
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,960
I don't know how to feel, I don't know.

946
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,760
But I mean, I get that it fits in with the other Mario Kart stages, but it just, I didn't

947
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
like that.

948
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,960
I was not my, I rejected that remix, I didn't care for it.

949
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,160
But whatever.

950
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,340
The Excitebike remix was really good though.

951
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,120
That was, that was a really awesome song.

952
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,000
The stage was a little boring because it's a big oval with just a bunch of ramps that

953
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,960
are straight out of what you used to see in the Excitebike games.

954
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,540
So like that stage for what it is, is pretty cool, you know, but it's not like the most

955
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,100
exciting thing in the world.

956
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,700
So yeah, played some Mario Kart 8 as well.

957
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,740
So and then, randomly the other night, I played a couple stages of Kid Icarus on Virtual Console.

958
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,860
That's right, 8-bit, hard as hell, Kid Icarus.

959
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,860
Why?

960
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,500
Because I realized I didn't have Metroid on the Wii U for some reason.

961
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,860
I was gonna play Metroid, and for some reason I don't have that on Wii U Virtual Console,

962
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,940
and I was like, yeah, I don't want to spend any more money.

963
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,780
I'll play what I have, and I have Kid Icarus, so I played a little bit of that.

964
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,780
That's where that ended up.

965
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
Alright.

966
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,780
Let's see.

967
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:14,020
I saw someone in chat telling me that, Cat Peach purrs, it's disgustingly adorable.

968
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:20,700
Let's see, Akuma JP says, I am sick, I heard Sky say, instead of coins, you get rabies.

969
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,660
No, no, no, no, no, Cat Peach does not get rabies, Akuma JP, that would be, that would

970
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:32,060
be a whole other game, that would be Zombie U2, featuring Peach, no, no, rupees, rupees,

971
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,660
the official currency of Hyrule, rupees.

972
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,420
Do they call, do they call them something else in Japan?

973
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,580
Do they have a different name over there?

974
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
It's rupees in Japan as well?

975
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
Okay, there we go.

976
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:47,940
Alright, sadly absent, sadly absent from the Zelda DLC, I will say, this is a perfect opportunity,

977
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,060
it's not there.

978
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:54,220
You could have had Tingle as the flag waver on the Zelda course.

979
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,460
Where was my Tingle on that course?

980
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,460
Come on.

981
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
Loki?

982
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,040
Come on, you gotta be disappointed at that too.

983
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,540
No Tingle in the Zelda DLC?

984
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,540
No.

985
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,540
It's travesty.

986
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,660
What are they doing?

987
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,420
Could be an easter egg, who knows.

988
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,860
Maybe, maybe I gotta like, up, up, down, down, left, right, maybe that's how they get Tingle

989
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
to show up.

990
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,860
It's kinda like flappy-vog.

991
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,260
Alright, anyway, alright, let's move on.

992
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,300
Jonas, how about you, what kind of games have you been playing this week besides, you know,

993
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,180
like, you know, winning competitions and shit?

994
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:32,900
Okay, now that I came back, I did play a bit of Mario Kart 8, decided to try a couple

995
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,900
of tracks.

996
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
What'd you think of the new tracks?

997
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,540
The new ice levels were actually pretty nifty.

998
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,660
The shortcuts were a little bit more difficult than most other shortcuts in the game, it's

999
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,300
like, oh, this is gonna be an interesting challenge, let's try it.

1000
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,660
The excite bike, I mean, that's actually pretty fun, despite the fact that it is, quote, boring.

1001
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,860
Well, at least it gives people an excuse that Baby Park is not coming back.

1002
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,820
Fuck that course.

1003
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,620
No Baby Park.

1004
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,140
Yeah, we need Waluigi Pinball, though, if Waluigi Pinball doesn't show up in the Animal

1005
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,540
Kart, or Animal Kart, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, why don't I just throw it together as

1006
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,700
Animal Kart, if Waluigi Pinball is not one of the retro courses coming, I'm gonna be

1007
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,700
pissed.

1008
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,700
I'm gonna be pissed.

1009
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
That course is so fun.

1010
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,700
I thought that was already one of the courses.

1011
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,380
No, it's in the 3DS, but it's not, it's no.

1012
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,700
And I believe Waluigi Pinball was originally in the Wii version, right?

1013
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,580
I thought the regular DS.

1014
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,860
Maybe, no, you're right, it was the regular DS.

1015
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,860
Anyway, so yeah, that's the one retro course I haven't seen yet that I wanna see is Waluigi

1016
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,860
Pinball.

1017
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:47,980
Let's see, the dragon course is actually pretty interesting for its design as well.

1018
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,020
F-Zero is like one of the only courses where coins do not show up, you have to actually

1019
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,900
recharge your coins, which is actually an interesting feature for those who have been

1020
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:03,500
waiting for F-Zero but can't get an F-Zero game for the Wii U as of yet, who knows, given

1021
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,340
how popular Mario Kart 8 is.

1022
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,660
What other games are you playing this week, anything else besides Mario Kart 8?

1023
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,540
Unfortunately, no, because right now I've been busy with other stuff at the moment and

1024
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:23,420
hopefully catch up with Pokemon or us and of course Smash Brothers next week.

1025
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,420
I'm very excited about Smash Brothers next week because I can't get into it on the 3DS

1026
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:33,500
the way I can on a console, so I'm very excited to be able to sit on the couch and really

1027
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,940
get into the Smash Brothers game, it's gonna be fun, if I can put down Dragon Age and Little

1028
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,940
Big Planet 3, which I'm also getting next week.

1029
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,460
Ooh, I forgot about Little Big Planet 3.

1030
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Right?

1031
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,860
I was just saying that before you got here, I was like, Little Big Planet 3, when that

1032
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,300
is the release that's kind of bubbling under compared to other things, you know you have

1033
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,300
a big week.

1034
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,300
You have a big, big week.

1035
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,100
Yeah, I mean I played in E3 and oh my god that's amazing.

1036
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,100
Alright.

1037
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,420
Anyway, let's see, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, we have a little bit of housekeeping

1038
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,740
then we'll get into some gaming news.

1039
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,500
For housekeeping tonight, a couple big things to talk to you about.

1040
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,020
First off, YYR is gonna be here on the show tonight, a little later in the show, we're

1041
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,500
gonna talk to him, probably at the top of part B is when we're gonna talk to him.

1042
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,780
The reason why he's coming on the show tonight, he is here to unveil a new OLR inspired game

1043
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,140
that is releasing tonight.

1044
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,460
A new OLR inspired game releasing tonight, YYR is here to talk about that, so we're gonna

1045
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,860
get that later in the show.

1046
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,720
If you haven't checked that, if you're newer to the show and you didn't know about this,

1047
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,980
if your 360 is still hooked up, you've got like, spend the dollar, you probably have

1048
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:37,980
the fucking points and change them out, spend the dollar on Bungie Ferret Tossing, which

1049
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,660
is in the XNA Arcade, the, what do they call it?

1050
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Indie games.

1051
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,700
Indie games, the indie games section of 360.

1052
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,580
Look for Bungie Ferret Tossing, that was the first YYR OLR inspired game.

1053
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,340
And to be fair, to give YYR some of the plugs, he's done some other really good games.

1054
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,340
Snake 360.

1055
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:59,820
Snake 360 was a lot of falling, was totally underrated, I think he told me he didn't sell

1056
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,300
a lot of copies of that, which really sucks, because that really kind of is a throwback

1057
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,020
to like old 80s arcade games.

1058
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,620
He needs to port that stuff, that'd be a green iOS game, I bet.

1059
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,620
Yeah, I bet.

1060
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,460
So anyway, so just a big plug for YYR Games and what he's doing, and hey, people that

1061
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,380
are gonna take the dumb shit that comes out of our mouths and actually turn it into games,

1062
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,700
we gotta applaud that, we've got to applaud that, so.

1063
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,900
I have to keep being clever.

1064
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,660
Yeah, I hear this game, this game was you, it was something that came out of your mouth,

1065
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,340
that's what I know, it's something you said, Dark Sakura, became this game, that's all

1066
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
I know.

1067
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,820
Because I'm such a lovely and polite young lady.

1068
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,420
Oh lord, here we go, now we're not, can we get an OLR dream game that's like, keep Jamie's

1069
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:50,420
ego in check, fit Jamie's ego through the door, fit Jamie, your ego and Gemet's ego

1070
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,500
could do battle, it would be like a.

1071
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,460
How about this, ego buffer.

1072
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,300
Or I have to wax your ego.

1073
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,900
And then you have to buffer the size of it, so that it will filter properly.

1074
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,820
Alright, YYR is saying, by the way, tonight's game, not a 360 game, tonight's game is a

1075
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,300
browser game for free.

1076
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,780
So that's right, I like free as well, so get ready, y'all ready for this, cause he's gonna

1077
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,660
be on the show later to talk about this.

1078
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,780
So I have an excite, I know I'm excited too, good times, are you enjoying?

1079
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
I am.

1080
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,120
Alright, also of note, mark your calendars folks, December 7th, we're gonna be doing

1081
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,660
something a little special here at OLR, I get asked, we all get asked, several times

1082
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:38,620
throughout the year, you know, I love your show, but you're on way too late for me, you're

1083
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,380
on too late in the day for me, I live in the UK, and you guys are on at like 3 in the

1084
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,420
morning, I wanna participate with your show, but I can't, cause you're overseas, well mark

1085
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:53,340
your calendars for December 7th, cause OLR on December 7th will be at noon pacific time,

1086
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:58,940
OLR will be broadcasting at noon pacific time on December 7th, so for those of you guys

1087
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,940
overseas.

1088
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,220
This will be 8 o'clock in the UK.

1089
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:08,300
8pm in the UK, and a distinct time zone shift for many of you folks, so look out for that.

1090
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,940
Now don't worry, if you are the person that is here religiously every week at 6 o'clock

1091
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,860
pacific time, as we usually tape at, the show will rebroadcast in its entirety whatever

1092
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:25,380
is done at noon, we'll rebroadcast unedited at 6pm, right, or whenever Bobby finishes

1093
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,700
his show that night.

1094
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,260
The reason why we're doing this, Dark Soccer and I are going to a holiday event in the

1095
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,100
Bay Area with a mutual friend of ours, we're gonna eat a lot of food and drink, yes, so

1096
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,300
we thought, you know what, this is a great, we want to tape the show in advance, a lot

1097
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,080
of our overseas folks say, when are you gonna do a show earlier in the day, this is a way

1098
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,980
we can kind of kill two birds with one stone, Dark Soccer and I can do our dinner, and those

1099
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,180
that want to participate that live in a different time zone will have their opportunity.

1100
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,620
Of course, I'm not saying, if you happen to be west coast or east coast, and you want

1101
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:00,700
to be here at noon, or 3pm or whatever, no you're not allowed, you can still come, it's

1102
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,860
not like UK only or whatever, but this will be your chance, so mark your calendar for

1103
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,640
December 7th.

1104
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,640
So there you go.

1105
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,640
Alright.

1106
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,420
And you have some folks in chat asking, so what time is that, and Jamie's saying, well

1107
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,140
what time is it now, cause that's the time it's gonna be at, well it's 7pm now, so it'll

1108
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,140
be...

1109
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,860
Well no, I'm trying to figure time difference for what time noon would be, so like for right

1110
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
now...

1111
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,180
7 hours behind now, wherever you're at, anyway.

1112
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,940
So, like where Ekuma is, it's already tomorrow I think?

1113
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,100
Yeah, sadly I think Ekuma will get stuck in one of those time zones where noon is overnight

1114
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,660
unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, but you know, it's one show, it's one show, and it will

1115
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:47,660
rebroadcast at 6 o'clock, so I'm just, you know, this way Dark Soccer and I can be festive,

1116
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,660
dammit.

1117
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,900
I think it'd be like 3am for you, sorry.

1118
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:56,420
Yeah, sorry to say, I think Japan's gonna get the overnight on that, but again...

1119
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,420
Right now it's noon.

1120
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,740
Yeah, and it will rebroadcast at 6pm, so just saying.

1121
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,580
It's one show, guys, it's one show, Dark Soccer and I have to go eat a lot of turkey.

1122
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,140
Nom nom nom.

1123
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,380
Alright, so that's December 7th.

1124
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,580
Alright, that's it for housekeeping that I can think of, let's get into some gaming news.

1125
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,660
There's been a lot more than Assassin's Creed stuff and Sonic stuff going on this week,

1126
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,660
so let's get into it.

1127
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,660
Loki.

1128
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,500
So, Sony announced this week that they're gonna be bringing a cloud-based TV service

1129
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:28,100
to consoles called PlayStation Vue, and what it's gonna...

1130
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,420
I guess it's gonna debut on PlayStation 4 and PS3, and they're even saying it's gonna

1131
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:38,940
come to non-Sony devices, I guess, tablets and that kind of stuff.

1132
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,260
What exactly is it gonna contain?

1133
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:48,380
I have no fucking clue, and they said, you know, it is gonna be competitively priced.

1134
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,620
And I don't know, based on the screenshots I've seen, it looks kind of like, you know,

1135
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,460
you're like a Netflix or something, but one of the things that they did say is besides

1136
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,740
like on-demand stuff, I think they're also gonna have actual streaming stuff, like it's

1137
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:08,940
gonna be like TV, where you're gonna have stuff being broadcast and that kind of thing.

1138
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:17,060
So I don't know, I'm kind of excited because I don't pay for TV, and to be fair, I know

1139
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,340
Microsoft had originally talked about doing some cloud-based stuff, and that kind of fell

1140
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:26,220
through, I guess, and I know Sony probably is in a little bit better position to do that

1141
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,860
since they also are a media company that produces content.

1142
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,700
And Microsoft scrapped theirs, unfortunately, yeah.

1143
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,300
So it would be nice if that was a part of PlayStation Plus, but...

1144
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,300
Yeah, well, don't hold your breath.

1145
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,700
Here's the thing that I don't get, well, you know how they're talking about that PlayStation

1146
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,660
Now is likely to have a subscription service in the future?

1147
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,580
What do you want to bet it's tied to this?

1148
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,060
You know, it'd be like a PlayStation Super Plus or something, I don't know, who knows

1149
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
what they'll call it.

1150
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,240
Whatever it is, if it makes sense.

1151
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,700
Maybe details to come at that experience event in December, who knows?

1152
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,700
Could be.

1153
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,700
Could be.

1154
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,700
This could be something they're going to talk about.

1155
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:10,560
But anyway, my question is, how is Sony expecting to get away with launching a cable competitor

1156
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,680
on cable internet?

1157
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:20,960
Like surely Comcast and Time Warner are looking at this going, wait a damn minute.

1158
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
Or can they?

1159
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,000
Would that be antitrust if they tried to block it?

1160
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
I think it would be.

1161
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,640
I don't think they really have a say, I mean, I don't know.

1162
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,640
Like for example, they're saying right now, the partners that they have...

1163
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,280
This is why net neutrality is important, because if we don't get net neutrality, then these

1164
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,400
companies can block this because they don't want the competition.

1165
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
But if we have net neutrality, they will do that.

1166
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,560
Well, they're not going to block it.

1167
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
They're not going to block it.

1168
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,200
What they're going to do is they're just not going to partner with them to provide stuff.

1169
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,400
But it's kind of twofold.

1170
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,560
It's one, they want to have their product in as many places as possible to get revenue

1171
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,320
from that streaming stuff.

1172
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,480
That's ideally how it should be, is where let's get our content on as many things as

1173
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,480
possible.

1174
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,860
But then sometimes they get greedy and they want that revenue to be just strictly coming

1175
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,860
to them.

1176
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,560
They don't want to have partial revenue coming from other things.

1177
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:21,720
So right now they've got some of the partners, CBS, Fox, Viacom, so your MTV, Comedy Central,

1178
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
that's kind of stuff.

1179
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,680
Well, that's all an extension of CBS anyway.

1180
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,720
Discovery Communications, NBC Universal, Scripps Network Interactive, which I have no fucking

1181
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,720
clue with that.

1182
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,240
Okay, interesting the NBC's on there though, because NBC is Comcast now.

1183
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:44,520
So yeah, and of course they also said that Disney and Time Warner are in active discussions.

1184
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,560
So nothing firmed out yet on that.

1185
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,840
So Disney's a holdout, which is kind of a big deal because that's ABC.

1186
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,280
Well Disney I thought was supposed to be doing their own thing, like they want their own

1187
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,280
service.

1188
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I heard.

1189
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Yeah, they do.

1190
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,400
But that's more of a Netflix competitor.

1191
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,280
But still, Disney, they're very picky choosy on what they do with that.

1192
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,000
But Disney does include ABC.

1193
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,400
Disney owns ABC, which is a whole big broadcast network.

1194
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,760
What are the big shows on ABC right now?

1195
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,280
I keep thinking Lost, but that's been off the air for Lord knows how long.

1196
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,280
Oh, Scandal.

1197
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,440
I like that show.

1198
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,400
Olivia Pope will not be on the, uh, the last season.

1199
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
I love Scandal.

1200
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Shut up.

1201
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Yeah.

1202
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
But that's already, that's on Netflix.

1203
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
You just wait a year.

1204
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
That's true.

1205
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
I don't know.

1206
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
It's not a big deal.

1207
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
All right.

1208
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
Fair enough.

1209
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Happy endings.

1210
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
I love that show.

1211
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,600
They scrapped that too.

1212
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,800
Maybe ABC kind of sucks.

1213
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
They keep getting rid of the shows.

1214
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
I like, I don't know.

1215
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
All right.

1216
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
Anyhow.

1217
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,680
Um, well, I, I'm looking forward to more details on this.

1218
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,200
I'm hoping we'll see some of it at the PlayStation event in Vegas in a few weeks.

1219
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,300
Meanwhile, I mentioned there's a lot of drama going on, uh, this week and some of it is

1220
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,920
around World of Warcraft.

1221
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,160
The new expansion for World's Warcraft Warlords of Draenor came out this week and, uh, lots

1222
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,000
of technical issues going on.

1223
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,200
Lots and lots of technical issues happening with the game's launch.

1224
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,400
Um, part of what's to blame for these issues is that Blizzard is saying that they are getting

1225
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,000
a DDOS attacked, uh, right at the same time that they're trying to launch the game.

1226
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,200
I can't imagine that the comments that were made at BlizzCon have anything to do with

1227
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:28,160
why they suddenly became a DDOS target, but I'm sure Blizzard's always a DDOS target as

1228
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
well.

1229
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
That plays into it.

1230
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
Yeah.

1231
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
I don't know if I'd necessarily blame that.

1232
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
It's just, you know.

1233
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,040
The, I'm sorry, but there's that part of me that goes, you know, the internet sucks sometimes

1234
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,600
and I wonder if that didn't make them a target.

1235
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,640
But I kind of think World of Warcraft is always a target.

1236
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,000
I sort of think that's always a target for, you know, uh, script kiddies and wannabe hackers

1237
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,480
to want to attack, uh, to get a little attention to whatever thing they're pissed off about.

1238
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,080
Um, so anyway, Blizzard blaming the DDOS attacks for a lot of their server issues and to combat

1239
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,320
it, they had to severely limit the amount of people that could log into the game.

1240
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,520
So players were looking at queues of thousands of people ahead of them.

1241
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,720
One of my friends on Twitter waited 10 hours to get into our server yesterday and it was

1242
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,480
one of those log in to get in the queue, go out, do something with the day and then come

1243
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,500
back and maybe you'll be able to play later at night.

1244
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,840
Now I'm hearing the expansions really good.

1245
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,600
They're saying it is the best expansion since Burning Crusade.

1246
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,600
Again, I'm hearing this from work, from, from fans on my Twitter that are kind of slant

1247
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,800
that I met through Horde House that are already kind of slanted pro wow.

1248
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,000
But I mean, that's a pretty strong endorsement that in spite of all those technical issues,

1249
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,480
people are still really enjoying the game once they get in there.

1250
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,480
Not everybody having such a happy experience though.

1251
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,040
One of the folks that really took a stand against what's going on is the administrator

1252
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,220
of the large Reddit community r slash wow.

1253
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:01,440
The administrator of that community chose to shut down r slash wow until he could log

1254
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,040
into the game.

1255
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:10,080
Basically, there was a lot of crap going up onto the main Reddit Warcraft Reddit about

1256
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,400
like screenshots of queue times, just like the same types of crappy posts over and over

1257
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
again.

1258
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,920
And the administrator was getting sick of it.

1259
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,900
But a lot of folks also seeing this as the administrator just lashing out that because

1260
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,640
they can't log into the game, that they're going to take it out on the entire 200,000

1261
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,920
almost user base that is on Reddit for World of Warcraft.

1262
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,120
In fact, earlier this evening, this is unfolding live as we're on air earlier this evening,

1263
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,480
the wow Reddit was shut down once again, it opened up finally, I guess the guy could log

1264
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,480
in.

1265
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,640
But by then a lot of people were just basically like fuck you and your power trip, we're going

1266
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,020
to a new Reddit.

1267
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:53,880
And it is down again with a message from the moderators of r slash wow, the World of Warcraft

1268
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,280
subreddit has been shut down due to doxing.

1269
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,920
That message changed early about an hour ago, it said, there's a bunch of other World of

1270
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,520
Warcraft Reddits out there, you can go check one of them out.

1271
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:10,200
So this, this guy who's an administrator is having a fit, and basically shut down the

1272
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Reddit over it.

1273
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,940
And a lot of people are saying, can't you take the Reddit away from him?

1274
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,800
Can you petition the admins of Reddit to take it away from him?

1275
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,800
But the answer a lot of people are getting is, that's not how Reddit works.

1276
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,640
You make a subreddit, you can do anything you want with it, essentially, you're the

1277
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
moderator of that.

1278
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,400
So why don't they just make another one?

1279
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,200
That's what a lot of people are doing.

1280
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,600
But what's happening now, guess, guess what's happening as a result of that, Darsagra?

1281
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,520
It's getting diluted, because everybody wants to make the new, everybody wants to make the

1282
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,000
new World of Warcraft subreddit.

1283
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,800
So you have r slash real wow, you have some people that are taking it to r slash Warcraft,

1284
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,000
although those people are like, wait a minute, this is for lore discussion.

1285
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,880
There's another one I just saw on Twitter, world underscore of underscore Warcraft.

1286
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,480
What were some of the other ones?

1287
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,480
I don't know.

1288
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,120
Now what's happening is like five different people are launching World of Warcraft ones,

1289
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,240
and no, you know, where's everybody gonna end up?

1290
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
Who knows?

1291
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:10,080
r slash wow was a pretty catchy, easy World of Warcraft sub, so, yeesh.

1292
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,400
Dungeon Buster in chat says, did someone call the Wambulance for him?

1293
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,720
Tiger Claw says, people take wow so seriously, good thing I'm not a part of it.

1294
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:26,560
It should be noted that Blizzard's community management team endorsed Reddit's wow community

1295
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:32,360
as an official fan community of sorts, and you can bet that a lot of that is in question

1296
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,240
over the past couple days and what's unfolded there.

1297
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:40,080
One of the CMs basically called the guy out on Twitter and said, this probably isn't the

1298
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,600
best way to handle the situation.

1299
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,240
It was professional, it wasn't like, fuck you asshole, which is probably what a lot

1300
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,160
of people are saying to this guy, but, you know, it was a little more professional than

1301
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,160
that.

1302
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Let's see.

1303
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:58,680
Seattle in chat saying, usually you can't take over a Reddit unless all the staff haven't

1304
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,000
logged in for X amount of time.

1305
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,200
Apparently all the other moderators of the wow subreddit were demoted, so it's only gonna

1306
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,480
be the one guy, so maybe that'll happen, who knows?

1307
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,480
I don't know.

1308
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,760
But obviously that is drama that is still literally unfolding live.

1309
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,480
So apparently the admin got doxxed at some point, because maybe that's why he shut it

1310
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,480
down again.

1311
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,680
This is all unfolding.

1312
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,320
But my understanding is people are logging into wow now, the queues aren't as bad, the

1313
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,800
caps are back up to where they normally are.

1314
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,280
If you play on a high pop server, you're gonna have some queues, but like, I know my buddies

1315
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,040
over on gamebuoy.org, they play on a low mid-pop server, so they're not facing queues.

1316
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,000
The Horde House Guild, though, was on a high pop server, so they're getting some minor

1317
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,200
queuing, but no more than like 30 minutes.

1318
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,200
So.

1319
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Alright.

1320
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,720
So that's the drama unfolding in the World of Warcraft this week.

1321
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,700
Is it because of DDoSing?

1322
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,360
Is it because this expansion is so damn popular?

1323
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,640
A lot of people are coming back to wow that apparently didn't do the same thing when it

1324
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,600
was Pandaria or Cataclysm, like this seems to be attracting gamers in a different way.

1325
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,680
Very interesting.

1326
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,680
Let's move on.

1327
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,680
DarkSakura.

1328
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,280
Well, you know how there are those studies out there that say, oh, gaming rots your brain

1329
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,800
and it makes you violent or stupid or all of that.

1330
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:25,480
Well, there's actually a much better research study that indicates quite the opposite.

1331
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,060
It's a study that's actually put out by Princeton University and the University of Rochester

1332
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:38,380
to see exactly how gaming, especially certain types of gaming, affect your skill level and

1333
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,700
your ability to learn.

1334
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:46,420
And what they did is they found that people who are gamers are actually much better learners.

1335
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,860
They learn faster.

1336
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:55,780
But those who play the more like fast paced strategy games, something like Call of Duty

1337
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:03,260
or Mass Effect or something, they're going to have better speed and cognition than someone

1338
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,860
who plays a much slower strategy game.

1339
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,300
But that's just because it's pretty much brain conditioning.

1340
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,580
It's conditioning the brain to think quickly and, you know, basically be able to make a

1341
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,800
quick decision like that and have it be a quick and educated decision.

1342
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,960
So it's pretty cool.

1343
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,780
So you learn how to think on your feet.

1344
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,780
Yeah.

1345
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,660
But the other thing, too, is that this actually, while they put out this, it's still just an

1346
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,540
initial release.

1347
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,700
They're running this as an ongoing study, you know, testing different.

1348
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,620
This one right here is basically, this part was just the ability to strategize and learn

1349
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,660
in situations.

1350
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,040
They're checking a long term cognition and improvements on that.

1351
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,300
You know what else will help you learn how to think on your feet?

1352
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:52,500
Doing a live radio show.

1353
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,060
But no, it's kind of, you know, what's funny is that I always, when I hear a story like

1354
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,220
this, I kind of think back to what we used to tell our parents growing up.

1355
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:08,100
But mom, video games are good for you because it's your hand-eye coordination.

1356
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:14,280
I remember hearing that study before, like, I think 2003, like with the same results talking

1357
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,260
about dexterity, like brain dexterity.

1358
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:23,740
Well, think about how the Nintendo Wii really caught on in a lot of senior citizen homes

1359
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:29,180
because the whole, like, you know, again, that, you know, the motion and the motion

1360
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:35,060
and the interactiveness was really a good workout for the brain for things that are

1361
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,060
fun.

1362
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,140
Like bowling, like who doesn't know bowling?

1363
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,620
Like a lot of senior citizens know what bowling is, okay, and golf.

1364
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:45,660
So and you could do that, you know, very easily with this system and that's what really helped

1365
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,660
the Wii catch on.

1366
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:53,660
Well, the biggest items that they were focusing on were things like multitasking, perception,

1367
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,220
attention, task switching, and decision making.

1368
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:02,260
So basically things that would require quick decision making.

1369
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:07,220
And I have to say that it's actually, I found this not on any video gaming website either.

1370
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:16,140
I found it on I Fucking Love Science, which is very, very, a very good site for, you know,

1371
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,740
cool science, which all science is cool, but this is really cool.

1372
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:24,760
YYR in chat says, I bet you all five bucks that Rob is sitting down right now.

1373
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,100
So much for thinking on your feet.

1374
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,140
Nope, he's standing.

1375
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,820
Well sir, you just lost five bucks because I'm standing right now and my co-host can

1376
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:31,820
vouch for that.

1377
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,260
Cause I get, if I sit during, I do sit for a lot of the show, but when I sit during the

1378
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,540
whole show, like my butt gets sore.

1379
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,900
I got to stand up once in a while.

1380
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,900
Does your butt fall asleep?

1381
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,900
Long show.

1382
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,900
What?

1383
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,900
Does your butt fall asleep?

1384
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,580
I wouldn't say it falls asleep, but I just have to get up and move.

1385
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,580
Get up and move.

1386
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,580
Once in a while.

1387
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,020
Do you get twitchy cheek syndrome?

1388
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,020
Do do do do do.

1389
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Fine.

1390
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,020
Get up and move.

1391
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,020
Come on.

1392
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,020
I figured YYR would appreciate that.

1393
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,020
Rob's just trying to avoid swamp ass.

1394
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,940
Yes.

1395
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,900
I'm trying to avoid swamp ass or whatever I've got going on my, basically J-Lo ass back

1396
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,900
here.

1397
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,900
I'm trying to prevent a little bit of that.

1398
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,900
All right.

1399
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,900
You should do what I'm doing, Rob.

1400
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:06,900
What?

1401
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Fuck it.

1402
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,900
That's right.

1403
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,900
Fuck it.

1404
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,900
All right.

1405
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,900
Loki, what do you got?

1406
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,900
Um, so there's been some issues with share play and um, you know, it's been known that

1407
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,580
I guess call of duty is blocking share play cause they say that they haven't tested it

1408
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,260
with their game yet.

1409
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,680
Um, I don't know, whatever.

1410
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,280
But um, apparently also people are having trouble with FIFA 15.

1411
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:36,280
Um, now it's not known yet if this isn't necessarily where EA saying, Hey, we're just not going

1412
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,280
to share this.

1413
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,960
Um, we're not gonna allow you to share game play on this, but apparently there's issues

1414
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,400
with it right now where if you try to do it, sometimes it gives you a problem where it

1415
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,520
says you can't, um, do that.

1416
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,080
And I guess it's not necessarily just FIFA, but also they're having trouble with like

1417
01:11:53,080 --> 01:12:00,680
a FIFA 15, WW2K 15, Guacamelee, uh, middle earth, shadow of Mordor, um, stuff like that.

1418
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,040
So apparently it worked at one time, but now it's not.

1419
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,840
So they're saying, you know, kind of your mileage may vary.

1420
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,840
Um, is this related to some of the, like, cause a PlayStation was tweeting out the share

1421
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,800
play was broken earlier this week.

1422
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Yeah.

1423
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,240
There was like a, you know, they're saying, no, some PlayStation four owners are currently

1424
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,540
unable to access share play.

1425
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:26,580
We are investigating the error message displayed on PS4 is inaccurate and that's in regards

1426
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:31,420
to, you know, it being disabled because you know, the error message is popping up right

1427
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,420
now.

1428
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,460
If you try to do that, um, you know, viewing the game screen that the host is currently

1429
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:41,300
playing is not allowed due to content restrictions in your country or region.

1430
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:47,060
If the host starts a game that you can view a game string, a game screen will be displayed.

1431
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:53,980
Um, so it's almost sounds like a ESRB or like a Peggy lockout type thing, but you know,

1432
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,300
it's a rated E game.

1433
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:59,740
Well, at least, you know, I'm not sure what the Peggy equivalent is, but yeah, it's for

1434
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,740
everyone.

1435
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,620
So I don't know why that would be the case, but I wonder, can these games be streamed

1436
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:09,180
on Twitch because I mean, I know you can lock out certain scenes of your game when you're

1437
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,220
live streaming on Twitch, but can you lock the whole game out of Twitch?

1438
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:17,700
I mean, surely people would just use an outside capture card to get around that if they wanted

1439
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,700
to.

1440
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:24,060
True, but, um, they apparently were saying, I guess it was, um, what was it, it's, it's

1441
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:30,620
a feature that's, you know, basically in every single, um, every single game that's out there,

1442
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:36,060
but it's just, you know, the up to developers, they can lock the, you know, basically here's

1443
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,060
what it says.

1444
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,900
The share play is a system level feature available for all PlayStation four titles.

1445
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,840
However option, the option is available to developers to disable the feature according

1446
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:51,520
to what they feel is best, uh, will be the best benefit to the consumer experience.

1447
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,820
So it's possible that they can disable it, but I don't know if that's what's going on

1448
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,820
here.

1449
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,820
Hmm.

1450
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,820
All right.

1451
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:07,660
Well, whatever the case may be though, um, it's, um, not just FIFA 15, there's, you know,

1452
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:12,500
a few other games that are out there and it's just kind of, I don't know, maybe, maybe

1453
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,100
it's going to be fixed soon, but it's not just FIFA 15.

1454
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,100
Hmm.

1455
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,540
Um, you know, yeah, here's some other games.

1456
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:26,660
They said the 14 games known to block share play, um, include, and this is kind of stupid.

1457
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:31,060
I don't know why all these are like this, but, uh, another world call of duty, advanced

1458
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:38,220
warfare called duty ghosts, child of light, hotline, Miami, Metro redux, Minecraft, pixel

1459
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:43,780
junk shooter, ultimate Rayman legends, steamworld dig thief, tomb Raider and Wolfenstein.

1460
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:48,620
The new order steamworld dig is a PS plus game.

1461
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,700
Almost everybody has that.

1462
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,100
It's weird that they'd lock that out.

1463
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,020
If that's, if that's intentional, it's up to the developer that maybe if it doesn't

1464
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:00,520
run well with it right in there, I don't know weird.

1465
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,360
To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at volknetwork.com

1466
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,960
use the passphrase copy.

1467
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,800
All right, well, uh, hopefully this game runs well cause it sounds like a pretty cool concept.

1468
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,920
You know, uh, you know, Tyto, a big classic game developer and they were responsible for

1469
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,240
a couple of classic arcade games back in the day, Arkanoid, you ever played Arkanoid the

1470
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,240
whole like breakout, right?

1471
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,200
And then of course space invaders, right?

1472
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:32,560
So how about a mobile game for iOS and Android that combines the two?

1473
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,560
That's right.

1474
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,440
Arkanoid versus space invaders.

1475
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,880
That is a real thing that's out there, uh, where you will absorb incoming attacks until

1476
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:47,280
your meter is full and then you fire the energy back in ball form to wipe out the invaders.

1477
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,640
You wipe them out with your balls.

1478
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,640
All right.

1479
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,380
Anyhow, uh, it's not out yet, but it will be on its way out in Japan in the winter.

1480
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:58,580
No word if it is coming out worldwide, but I can't see how it doesn't come out worldwide.

1481
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:02,820
Like I know we got things like groove coaster and some of the other, um, uh, Tyto stuff

1482
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:03,820
here.

1483
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,820
So there you go.

1484
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:10,140
Um, and maybe, maybe could a 3ds or PlayStation Vita, could, could that be in the works as

1485
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,140
well?

1486
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,140
Oh, I don't know.

1487
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,140
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1488
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,140
All we know now for sure.

1489
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:18,180
iOS and Android, but looking at some of these screenshots, it does look kind of fun and

1490
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,840
I like space invaders and I like Arkanoid if the price is right, if it's like a 99 cent

1491
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,160
game or even like a dollar 99 and if it has an excellent soundtrack, cause I'll tell you

1492
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:31,600
what a lot of those Tyto like space invader games have a fricking awesome soundtrack.

1493
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,160
So yeah, that's a good soundtrack that'll, that'll be make it worth it right there.

1494
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:39,040
Arkanoid versus space invaders, Jamie, you're a fan of classic games.

1495
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
How does that make you feel?

1496
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,040
Hearing about that?

1497
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,040
Tingly.

1498
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,040
Tingly.

1499
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,480
Uh, SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, wow, feels like this should have happened ages ago, right?

1500
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,920
Fifth dream says best fucking game ever.

1501
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,920
OMG.

1502
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,080
Well now let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1503
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,080
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1504
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,880
I, especially after some of the things we've learned this week, let the reviewers have

1505
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,240
a crack at it first.

1506
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,240
Then we'll make our decisions.

1507
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,240
All right.

1508
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,240
Uh, let's move on.

1509
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,120
Dark soccer release dates after this.

1510
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,720
Well, we have some other stuff going on.

1511
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:17,000
Um, you know that, that a dumb ass who on Twitter decided to threaten, uh, Gabe Newell,

1512
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
you know?

1513
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yes.

1514
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Yep.

1515
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,720
Pretty, pretty stupid.

1516
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:29,920
Um, well anyway, uh, Mike Malbeck, his, uh, basically he was, uh, uh, with, uh, the, the,

1517
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,320
the, I'm all tongue tied.

1518
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:35,080
Um, he developed, he was, uh, the developer on Paranautical Activity.

1519
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,600
Well, um, he left the company he was with and now he's back.

1520
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,840
And Code Avarice is doing a new game.

1521
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,620
So he, uh, he decided to leave.

1522
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,620
He came back.

1523
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:52,380
He's just sort of still a douche.

1524
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,380
I don't know.

1525
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,380
What do you think?

1526
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,620
Uh, I think this guy kind of ruined his reputation already some time ago and it's going to take

1527
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,060
a very, very, very, very, very long time to get that back.

1528
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:05,300
Cause unfortunately you have people like us and the websites that were also running these

1529
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:11,140
stories kind of already, uh, you know, commenting based on his behavior, which is, um, you know,

1530
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,140
too bad.

1531
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,140
But he said it.

1532
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,140
So.

1533
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:20,980
The new, the new game is called Spinal Destination, which is a mix of Lush for Dead, TimeSplitters

1534
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,980
and Painkiller.

1535
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,980
Oh, wow.

1536
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:23,980
That's kind of funny.

1537
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:24,980
That's a funny name.

1538
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,980
Yeah.

1539
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:26,980
I don't know.

1540
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,860
I don't want to judge the games based off of one douchebag.

1541
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,860
That's true.

1542
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:31,860
That's a good point.

1543
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,500
Cause there might be other hardworking people on it.

1544
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:41,820
But we, I mean, as long as he's not like the, you know, owner of everything ever with it,

1545
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:45,420
then I wouldn't, I wouldn't judge the company based on just him.

1546
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,860
Now, if it was someone like say, oh, the CEO and owner of said company, like dead guy who

1547
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,260
owned that chicken chain, you know, then that's, that's a little different story.

1548
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,260
Uh, let's see.

1549
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,100
Bobby Lockwolf in our chat says he realized he couldn't get a job.

1550
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,780
So he went back to his old job.

1551
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,780
Yep.

1552
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,800
Uh, Tiger Claw in chat says, sounds like the guy is desperate.

1553
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,860
He found out leaving the company, he wouldn't be making the money he was when developing

1554
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:09,860
games.

1555
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:10,860
So.

1556
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,900
All right.

1557
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,620
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates cause uh, I believe it's

1558
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,620
a busy week.

1559
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
Right?

1560
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
Loki?

1561
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,620
Yes.

1562
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,820
It's probably one of the biggest busiest weeks in November.

1563
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:23,720
So this is going to be as busy I think as it's going to get meaning the busiest week

1564
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,720
of the whole year.

1565
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,720
Yes.

1566
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,720
The busiest week of the whole year.

1567
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:32,980
So, um, let's see this week we have Hatsune Miku Project Diva F second for Vita because

1568
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:38,060
it's already come out on PlayStation three, uh, Dragon Age Inquisition on PlayStation

1569
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:45,340
three, Xbox 360, PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC, the PlayStation four and Xbox one

1570
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,860
versions of WWE two K 15 come out this week.

1571
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:52,460
Escape Dead Island, a game I completely forgot was coming out.

1572
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:58,340
PlayStation three and Xbox 360, a little big planet three on PlayStation four and PlayStation

1573
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,340
three.

1574
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:08,020
Uh, MX versus, uh, was it MXGP 14 on that's on Xbox three 60 and I believe PlayStation

1575
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,580
four as well.

1576
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,580
Yeah.

1577
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,580
PlayStation four and maybe PlayStation three.

1578
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,900
Uh, let's see what else here we've got.

1579
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:21,260
Oh, I guess Hatsune Miku Project Diva F um, second is coming out this week as well in

1580
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,260
PlayStation three.

1581
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,220
I thought that came out already.

1582
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,220
Not the second.

1583
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,220
That's, that's the difference.

1584
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,220
Ah, yes.

1585
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,220
Okay.

1586
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,220
This is a new one.

1587
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:38,260
David's invasion on, um, Xbox three 60 PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1588
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,300
That's the interactive TV show thing.

1589
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,740
Watchdogs finally coming out on Wii U this week.

1590
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,100
Um, so I guess you can pick that up now.

1591
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:54,380
Uh, let's see my favorite game of the week, grand theft auto five on PlayStation four

1592
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,340
and Xbox one.

1593
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:02,580
Uh, far cry for coming on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60 PlayStation four and Xbox one

1594
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:08,740
and PC, a middle earth shadow of Mordor on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 cause

1595
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,100
those versions were delayed.

1596
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,340
Uh, Minecraft, the Xbox one edition gets a disc release this week.

1597
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:23,100
A monopoly, the family fun pack on Xbox one and PlayStation four.

1598
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:31,060
Um, smash brothers for the Wii U it's going to be coming out on Friday.

1599
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:36,740
Also along with that Pokemon alpha Sapphire and Pokemon omega Ruby on three DS.

1600
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,380
And I think there's a whole host of accessories and amiibos and shit.

1601
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:42,540
They're going to be coming out this week as well.

1602
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,820
All right.

1603
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,820
Busy busy.

1604
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,820
You want to name all the amiibos coming out?

1605
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,820
I'm just kidding.

1606
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,820
Fuck if I care.

1607
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,820
Don't do that.

1608
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,820
All right.

1609
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:51,820
Nintendo characters.

1610
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,820
All right.

1611
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,180
Japan's, uh, got some stuff this week as well.

1612
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:58,900
Um, Assassin's Creed unity gets its Japanese release on November 20th.

1613
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:03,700
If you are daring and wanting to check that out, Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires comes

1614
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,860
out in a regular and premium box edition.

1615
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,900
By the way, these are both on PlayStation four.

1616
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,460
That is also out in Japan this week.

1617
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:13,500
EA sports UFC getting its Japanese release as well this week.

1618
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,500
That all is on the PlayStation four, uh, on the Xbox one.

1619
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:21,100
A lot of that same stuff I just named over on the Xbox one as well, because remember

1620
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,100
that is out in Japan now.

1621
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:28,540
Uh, so Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires also in Japan this week on the PlayStation three,

1622
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:33,460
you can also pick up once again, Shin Sangoku Musou seven empires there as well.

1623
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:40,020
Um, as far as Japanese stuff on the PlayStation three though, not a lot else this week.

1624
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,820
Uh, let's see the Vita and the 3DS.

1625
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:51,340
The Vita has Senju no Enbu Kyoku comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita and on the

1626
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:57,340
Nintendo 3DS this week, if I can get to my list, uh, I think it's a little busier there

1627
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:05,180
on the 3DS because we have Doriego Nobita Tohyusei no Fushigi collection comes out as

1628
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:10,260
well as Mahokore Maho Aidoru collection.

1629
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,860
Magical idol collection.

1630
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,980
It's probably a collection of idol games.

1631
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,980
Let me look.

1632
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,980
Well, let's look.

1633
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:16,980
Magical something.

1634
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:21,300
The title's not going to be any, yeah, this looks like a, like an idol game mixed with

1635
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,940
uh, like kind of like a farm-esque type of thing.

1636
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,940
Looks like.

1637
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,940
Yeah.

1638
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:28,940
Farmer Idol.

1639
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,940
I don't know.

1640
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:30,940
It's interesting.

1641
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:42,060
Uh, Sumiko Gurashi Koko Ga Ochisukundesu comes out as well this week and that is adorable.

1642
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,460
It looks, it looks like Pusheen the cat, but they're different characters, like a penguin

1643
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:46,980
and a dog.

1644
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,260
And I don't know what the hell they're doing, but it's cute.

1645
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,660
They're eating sushi in this picture.

1646
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,060
Doesn't that game look cute?

1647
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,060
They look like little things with singular eyeballs.

1648
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,060
They do.

1649
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,860
They look like those Pusheen stickers on Facebook.

1650
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:57,860
Pusheen's amazing.

1651
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,580
I know, but they, they look like Pusheen's cousins.

1652
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:01,580
That's what I'm going to call that game.

1653
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,040
Pusheen's cousins comes out.

1654
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,620
By the way, uh, there is, uh, some releases as well.

1655
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,740
Um, oh, nevermind.

1656
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,560
That's Australia I'm looking at there.

1657
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,460
Some 3DS's XL, the new 3DS XL is out in Australia this week.

1658
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,740
I guess it's worth mentioning that there.

1659
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:20,580
Pokemon Alpha Sapphire also this week in Japan and Omega Ruby, of course.

1660
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:24,820
So a busy, busy week and a lot of peripherals coming out to support that.

1661
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,820
Dr. Sakura.

1662
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,020
Uh, there's some stuff coming out in the UK, but who cares?

1663
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,020
And I'm kidding.

1664
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,020
I love you guys.

1665
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,140
Um, on the 17th we have Company of Heroes 2, our Den's Assault.

1666
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:43,660
Uh, on 18th we have Grand Theft Auto 5 on Xbox, on the Xbone and PlayStation 4.

1667
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:50,820
21st of November we have Adventure Time, The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom and Dragon

1668
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,940
Age Inquisition on Damn Near Everything.

1669
01:24:53,940 --> 01:25:01,620
We also have Escape Dead Island, Far Cry 4, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, Sonic Boom

1670
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:05,220
and WWE 2K15.

1671
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:10,140
So uh, save thine pence.

1672
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,140
All right.

1673
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,140
Any other stories for you guys?

1674
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,980
And then the classic game of the week.

1675
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:14,980
Loki.

1676
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:15,980
All right.

1677
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,980
This is kind of cool.

1678
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:21,020
Um, there, you know, you're not the way a little bit for the actual Oculus Rift to be

1679
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:28,860
coming out, but remember that whole Samsung Galaxy Note 4 attachment that's, it was the

1680
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,140
Samsung Gear VR?

1681
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,580
Well, it's coming out next month.

1682
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:38,980
Um, they in fact have a price point of $200 for the attachment.

1683
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:43,180
Now granted, you're gonna have to actually buy the, you know, Galaxy Note 4 to plug in

1684
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:48,300
there and that's probably a little bit more expensive than that, um, but yes, you can

1685
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,300
own that next month.

1686
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,060
Um, to go along with that, of course, they've released, uh, Oculus released their mobile

1687
01:25:53,060 --> 01:26:00,420
software development kit and um, you know, I guess it should be interesting to check

1688
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,420
out.

1689
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:05,980
I guess the VR headset though, the Oculus Rift, not expected to be hitting until mid

1690
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:12,100
2015, but I don't know, I do need a new phone.

1691
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:17,580
Note 4 is kind of expensive to buy out of a plan, so, I don't know.

1692
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,580
Are you thinking about it though, Loki?

1693
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,460
Thinking about it, but I probably wouldn't.

1694
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,740
It's not a lot of money to jump for that and honestly, you don't necessarily have to get

1695
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,780
the first one either.

1696
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:30,540
You know, next year is going to be a huge year for this stuff, so yeah, and honestly

1697
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:35,380
I'd be more interested in picking up probably, uh, Project Morpheus whenever, whatever the

1698
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,940
hell they decided to actually call that.

1699
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,540
I'm sure it's not Project Morpheus.

1700
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,660
Call it something Matrix-y though.

1701
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,700
I wonder if, uh, the name will be unveiled.

1702
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,820
Ooh, like the Sony Matrix would be pretty sweet.

1703
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,820
The Sony Matrix.

1704
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,820
Hey, why not?

1705
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,820
Project Morpheus.

1706
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,820
I mean, hey, I'm down with that.

1707
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,820
Or the Sony Neo.

1708
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,540
The Sony Neo.

1709
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:52,540
The Sony Blue Pill.

1710
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,540
No.

1711
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:54,540
The Sony Trinity.

1712
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,540
The Sony-o.

1713
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,540
Ah, hey, that's a...

1714
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,540
I'm smart.

1715
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:00,540
I'm the one that came up with O.L. Army, I mean, hello.

1716
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,540
I thought that was puppy.

1717
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,540
I thought that was puppy.

1718
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,540
I thought that was puppy.

1719
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,540
I thought that was puppy.

1720
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,700
I kinda like that name.

1721
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,700
That would work.

1722
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,700
No.

1723
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,700
It was a combination, I think.

1724
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,540
But I did one of the tank with O.L. Army on the side.

1725
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,540
Ten years ago.

1726
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,540
Anyway.

1727
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,540
Uh, well, you know what?

1728
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:18,540
Speaking of coming up with new names, uh, the VGAs, the Video Game Awards, they're gonna

1729
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,620
have a new name because, you know, game tactics is not really a thing anymore.

1730
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:31,620
Uh, so, now, uh, the VGAs will become the Game Awards 2014, uh, speaking, uh, to Jeff

1731
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:36,820
Keeley, the producer, saying, quote, the Game Awards 2014 will celebrate our collective

1732
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:41,100
love of games and the passion we all hold in our hearts for this incredible entertainment

1733
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,100
medium.

1734
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,020
Gaming has never been stronger, and this year we will recognize the fastest selling launch

1735
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:49,060
year in history for new game consoles, the rise of esports, and mobile gaming around

1736
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:54,060
the globe, and preview the games that will make 2015 the biggest year yet.

1737
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:59,020
Uh, this is gonna take place in the AXIS Theater, uh, in Vegas, and, uh, you will be able to

1738
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:01,500
see it pretty much online, uh, anywhere.

1739
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:07,060
I believe it's gonna be on Xbox, it's gonna be on Sony, it's gonna be on Twitch for sure.

1740
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:10,820
It will not, however, be on television, uh, it's no longer tied to Spike TV.

1741
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:16,560
That might not be a bad thing, though, because, uh, as this thing's getting more independent,

1742
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,020
so a lot of that crap stunt stuff you have to do for TV, like celebrities who don't actually

1743
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:24,860
play video games, they won't necessarily have to do, so it could be interesting.

1744
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,780
It wasn't, was it last year that it was all fucked up?

1745
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:31,220
There was something really, um, embarrassing with Jeff Keeley.

1746
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,580
Was it the E3 stuff last year?

1747
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,620
Was that, like, um, the awards last year?

1748
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,620
Well, where do we begin?

1749
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,900
Was that the Doritos and the Mountain Dew, or is that the, uh, you're probably thinking

1750
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:44,340
that the awards last year was online only, I think, and it was, it was, it was weird.

1751
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:48,580
It was, yeah, it was, like, it was awkward, yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't that good.

1752
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:55,860
It wasn't Conan O'Brien doing it as well, no, it was, um, it was Jeff Keeley and, um,

1753
01:28:55,860 --> 01:29:06,380
what's his name, from The Soup, um, why can't I remember his name, uh, Joel, uh, who's the

1754
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,380
guy from The Soup?

1755
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,380
Joel McHale.

1756
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,380
Yeah.

1757
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:16,580
Uh, let's see, and they're telling me in chat I misspoke, uh, it's Game Trailers was the

1758
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,580
site, right?

1759
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,580
Yeah, Game Trailers.

1760
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:19,580
Game Trailers.

1761
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:25,580
Yeah, Joel McHale last year, remember, I, I like the guy, but I think he was kind of

1762
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:33,060
annoying last year, and, um, I don't know, it'll be interesting to see, you know, obviously

1763
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:38,500
Keeley loves games, and I think he'll do a good job with it, it's just, I don't know,

1764
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,500
I'm interested to see it.

1765
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,900
Well, this is the other interesting thing about it, you know, and, I don't know, I'm

1766
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:47,820
skeptical about the whole thing, but this, this does make me go, well, shit, he ain't

1767
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:48,820
fucking around.

1768
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:53,940
Uh, Jeff Keeley is laying down the money himself to make this work, uh, and there's also a

1769
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:58,260
part of me that goes, must be nice to have that kind of money to risk on the investments,

1770
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,380
but you know what?

1771
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:03,780
He works hard, he's shown up on freaking everything that has to do with video games, he was at

1772
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:09,020
BlizzCon on their thing, so, seems like he's, he's a lot of times the face of game journalism,

1773
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:13,060
for better or worse, um, so he's putting the money down, the investment is my own, I'm

1774
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:17,420
bankrolling it and we're trying to sell some sponsorships, but there's no submission fees,

1775
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:21,140
I didn't even realize that they had been charging submission fees, but, uh, there's a fair amount

1776
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:25,940
of risk involved, uh, uh, but he will not say how much of his money he's putting up.

1777
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:31,100
He did say, I thought about doing a kickstarter, but I would feel awkward doing that, I think

1778
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,420
I need to take this on myself to prove that I can do it, I need to prove to everyone this

1779
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,460
is going to be great, if I were to kickstart it, there would have been a fair amount of

1780
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,300
skepticism, you know what?

1781
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:47,420
That statement alone raises my hopes a significant amount, that he kind of realizes that, he's

1782
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:48,420
like, you know what?

1783
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:53,260
I could do that, but I'm going to just, I believe in this enough or I'm just going to

1784
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:54,260
take the risk.

1785
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,260
I mean, good luck.

1786
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:59,420
I, the thing that worries me about it is this seems to be happening kind of quick, like

1787
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:05,100
this was just announced and isn't this ceremony happening like the week, the PlayStation thing?

1788
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,140
It's like, it's not a lot of time.

1789
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:10,060
Yeah, usually it's in the early part of December.

1790
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:11,060
Yeah.

1791
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:15,840
So I don't know, but maybe, if he gets some good exclusives, it'll have a lot of people

1792
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,000
talking, you know, especially if he's able to, and I don't know what he will, won't be

1793
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:28,000
able to say, but if he's able to say like, the world reveal of the new XYZ game will

1794
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,160
be during the game awards, that alone will get a lot of eyes on it.

1795
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:35,080
If he can, they have a lot of world exclusive trailers and stuff that, you know, they like,

1796
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,200
they had a new, I think that was one of the, that's where they announced Skyrim years and

1797
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,200
years ago.

1798
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,200
I remember that Skyrim.

1799
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,200
Yeah.

1800
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,800
And then, um, I think they had a new trailer for No Man's, it was either the first time

1801
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,160
they showed off No Man's Sky or that was the second time.

1802
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,760
That was their big thing last year, the No Man's Sky footage.

1803
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,760
Yeah.

1804
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,760
That was, that was last year.

1805
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,760
I was like, yeah.

1806
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,720
That was like the one thing everybody was happy they tuned in for.

1807
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,720
So yeah.

1808
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:02,720
And that was ironic part of that is that was the game that got the most hype out of everything

1809
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,720
that they showed.

1810
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,120
It was like, yeah.

1811
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,480
So I, I'm, I don't know.

1812
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,480
We'll see.

1813
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,480
It's kind of one of those.

1814
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,120
We'll see what I'm doing on that day when it's area, which from around I'll, I'll maybe

1815
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,120
tune in.

1816
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,120
Speaking of which, I want to play No Man's Sky.

1817
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,120
Don't play No Man's Sky.

1818
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,120
I want No Man's Sky.

1819
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,800
Can I come out soon, please?

1820
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,800
We'll see.

1821
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,800
We'll see.

1822
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,800
All right.

1823
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,680
Um, let's see.

1824
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,680
Let's move on.

1825
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:31,360
We're going to get to the classic game of the week because, uh, every week dark soccer

1826
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,840
likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys should

1827
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,000
be checking this game out.

1828
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,640
You know, screw, screw all this new fangled stuff.

1829
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,120
I'm going to walk into the vault.

1830
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,600
I'm going to find a classic game for you all to worship this week.

1831
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,600
I'm a school y'all.

1832
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,600
So you know what?

1833
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,720
There's a screw Dragon Age Inquisition to hell with Pokemon.

1834
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,720
Okay.

1835
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,720
To hell with Pokemon.

1836
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:59,120
Fuck little big planet and go eat a bag of Dick Smash Brothers because classic games

1837
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,120
is where it's at.

1838
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,080
So dark soccer, just take all that other new shit to the dumpster.

1839
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,620
And what classic games should people be playing this week instead?

1840
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:11,020
I have gone for the edge of the 10 year rule and gone for Capcom fighting evolution or

1841
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:15,080
as it came out in Japan and Europe, Capcom fighting jam.

1842
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,100
It came out in 2004.

1843
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,220
It was a fighting game from Capcom that originally came out in the arcades, um, for the Namco

1844
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:27,760
system two 46 hardware and came out on the Xbox, uh, Xbox and PS two.

1845
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,740
It has, uh, basically characters from three different, uh, incarnations of the street

1846
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:37,540
fighter series as characters from red earth and characters from dark stalkers.

1847
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,860
And they use the same fighting system for each character does.

1848
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,780
And it almost seems like they pulled exact sprite rips from it too.

1849
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,780
So this game actually had some issues around it.

1850
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:53,440
Um, so basically, uh, the only original character in this one was Ingrid, as we've seen her

1851
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,620
show up in other games before.

1852
01:33:55,620 --> 01:34:03,460
And then you had the bosses, Pyron and, uh, Shin Akuma, um, or a Shingoki as, uh, he was

1853
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:04,460
in Japan.

1854
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:10,740
Um, you also had, uh, two on two and you had the two on two endurance style matches like

1855
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,820
you saw in rival schools.

1856
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:18,300
And, um, you could choose, uh, different, uh, you know, a series of characters together

1857
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:22,540
and the Japanese version, if the current character is defeated for one round, the next round

1858
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:26,780
begins with the other version, although in the North American one, you can keep the same

1859
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,780
character.

1860
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:34,380
So we have the street fighter, two turbo edition versions of, uh, Ryu, Kyle, uh, Vega, well,

1861
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,620
bison over here, Vega in Japan and Zangief.

1862
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:41,340
And in Dark Stalkers, we had, um, Anakaras, Dimitri, Felicia and Jetta.

1863
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,140
I love freaking Jetta in all the games ever.

1864
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:48,220
Um, and Street Fighter Alpha, I know a lot of people that would want to play this just

1865
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,500
so then when they knock out Felicia, they can go, bye Felicia.

1866
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,060
Just saying.

1867
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,060
Okay.

1868
01:34:54,060 --> 01:35:01,060
Street Fighter Alpha version, we had Guy, we had, uh, Karin, uh, Rose and Sakura.

1869
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:08,460
And then, um, from Red Earth, which is a game that only came out in arcades, um, was, uh,

1870
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:14,960
you had, uh, Leo Houser, Hydron, who was called Newell in Japan and Kenji, who was, uh, Mukuro

1871
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,960
in Japan.

1872
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:22,660
And then we had Street Fighter 3 editions of Alex, Chun-Li, uh, Urien and Yun.

1873
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:26,880
The original character was Ingrid, who also came back in Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max on

1874
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,160
PSP, um, as a time traveler.

1875
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:36,780
And of course you had your bosses, which was, uh, Pyron and Shingoki.

1876
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:39,860
So it had a really, really good soundtrack too.

1877
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:45,100
It had just music from all the various different games and different versions thereof and its

1878
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,400
own original pieces.

1879
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:53,240
But the sad thing is that the game was very well received because of how it seemed like

1880
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,800
the animation had been cut down.

1881
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,220
Um, the only really well received character was Ingrid because she actually really did

1882
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,800
have the most work done for her.

1883
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:10,320
And then it was admitted from, um, Yoshinori Ono that, uh, the game was a salvaged version

1884
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,320
of Capcom fighting all-stars.

1885
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:20,300
And, um, by trying to incorporate the various different styles of all these games that it

1886
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,580
was causing a balance issue.

1887
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:24,500
And so basically it wouldn't work.

1888
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:28,700
So really this game is, like, Capcom-Lugen style.

1889
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,700
So.

1890
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:35,820
But it is worth mentioning because it brought us a character who's shown up in other Capcom

1891
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,820
games.

1892
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:37,820
It's...

1893
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:42,300
It was a very, I think, unique take on Capcom's own fighting games.

1894
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,640
And so it's definitely worth a mention today.

1895
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:50,080
So we have Capcom Fighting Evolution, AKA Capcom Fighting Jam.

1896
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,840
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1897
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,100
Capcom Fighting Evolution or Jam.

1898
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,480
Whatever you prefer there.

1899
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:02,280
Not to be confused with Kurota Berry Jam because that was from a different game.

1900
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,920
Uh, available on the Xbox, Playstation 2, and Arcade.

1901
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,920
Yerp.

1902
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,920
Here it is.

1903
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,160
All right, uh, now, uh, we've got plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come.

1904
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,420
We are gonna take a break, but when we come back, YYR's gonna be here to pull the curtain

1905
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:19,260
back on his newest OLR dream game creation.

1906
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,420
I'm so freaking excited, I can't stand it.

1907
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:26,020
Uh, we're also gonna get into rapid fire news, the Fugu question of the week, um, and more

1908
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:31,260
news and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1909
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,740
All when we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.

1910
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:48,260
Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio, live on this Sunday evening with the 575th

1911
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:52,580
episode of our show already in progress, and I gotta tell you, it's been a very busy night

1912
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:53,580
so far.

1913
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:57,140
We've, uh, talked a lot about some of the controversies going on in gaming this week,

1914
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:01,780
but you know what, now we've got some good news coming in because, uh, this is always

1915
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:07,540
a hoot and a pleasure to announce when somebody out there takes one of our OLR dream games.

1916
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:11,400
If you're newer to the show, sometimes we get these crazy fucking ideas for games, and

1917
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,240
we'll just be like, someone needs to make that game.

1918
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:17,560
Like, I think, I think one of the first ones I ever remember was puzzle sluts.

1919
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:22,560
Somebody said, you know, there needs to be a puzzle game that's just, just, you know,

1920
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,560
all these sluts.

1921
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,560
Puzzle sluts would be the best.

1922
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,560
Exactly.

1923
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,560
Like, inspired by the 8-bit games.

1924
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,320
I'm not, I don't mean that all the sluts have to be women.

1925
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,720
Women, men, everything, cats, dogs, sweaty cats.

1926
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,720
Pantsless rage.

1927
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,720
Exactly.

1928
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,720
All that could be included.

1929
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:41,060
Over the years, the list of, uh, dream games has grown and grown and grown, and, um, not

1930
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:46,980
that long ago, uh, probably about two years ago, a listener by the name of Aaron or YYR

1931
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:53,780
actually took one of the games from the OLR, uh, dream game list called Bungee Ferret Tossing

1932
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:58,140
and made it a reality, and it's available on the Xbox Live Indie Arcade.

1933
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,500
And it is addicting.

1934
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,500
It is.

1935
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:07,760
And, uh, tonight, he is back to unveil the second, the appropriately number two project,

1936
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:13,520
uh, for, uh, his OLR dream game, uh, it is Aaron or YYR, and he's there on the line with

1937
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,520
us tonight.

1938
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,520
You there?

1939
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,520
You there, Aaron?

1940
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,520
Hello?

1941
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,520
Aaron, can you hear me?

1942
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,520
Uh, yeah.

1943
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,520
Yeah, I am.

1944
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,520
There you are.

1945
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,520
Hey, how you doing?

1946
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,520
Can you hear me?

1947
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,520
Hello?

1948
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,520
Hi, we can hear you.

1949
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,520
Can you hear us?

1950
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:27,520
I hope so.

1951
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,520
Uh, yeah.

1952
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,520
Yeah, I can hear you.

1953
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,540
How you doing?

1954
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,740
Uh, not, not so bad, actually.

1955
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:39,220
It's, uh, it's been a really busy couple of weeks, and, uh, well, uh, this has, uh, not

1956
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,880
helped, but actually, it didn't take very long to put this game together.

1957
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:49,100
It's, uh, obviously very Atari 2600 inspired, um, but it was the first thing I thought of

1958
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,880
when Jamie said Pixel Shits.

1959
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,880
That's right.

1960
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,880
Somehow.

1961
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,120
You just pulled back the curtain before we went to break here live on your newest game

1962
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:02,500
Pixel Shits, which, I don't know, Jamie, when did this ever come, I don't, it's, that's

1963
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:05,780
the thing, is, like, sometimes YYR will be like, hey, I made this game based off something

1964
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,780
you said.

1965
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,780
I honestly don't remember-

1966
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,780
When did we fucking say that?

1967
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:15,680
But I remembered saying something about, like, if I remember right, I said something about,

1968
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:21,340
I think I tried to say Pixel something else and said Pixel Shit instead, so then we started

1969
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,340
talking about-

1970
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:23,340
Something like that.

1971
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:28,060
Taco Bell, and then I don't remember.

1972
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,420
It was during the Rod Caliber, the same episode where you mentioned Rod Caliber.

1973
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:36,380
Oh, yeah, Rod Caliber, because that was Sega Bass Fishing for Classic Game.

1974
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,380
Yeah.

1975
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,380
Fish!

1976
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,160
So if folks want to check this out, we will link it in the show notes, so if people are

1977
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,620
looking at this on VOG or whatever, they can check it out, but if they don't, uh, you know,

1978
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:50,540
they don't have the show notes in front of them, you can head on over to yyrgames.com,

1979
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:58,100
and it's slash PS, so, uh, for Pixel Shits, so yyrgames.com slash PS, and this is an

1980
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:03,220
Atari 2600, I've been watching Loki play, by the way, he's been playing All Break, is

1981
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,220
he still going?

1982
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,220
Oh, no, he went back into chat.

1983
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,220
I had 101.

1984
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,220
You had 101?

1985
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:11,860
Okay, so, so to explain what you do in this game, well, let me, I'll let you do it.

1986
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:15,540
What is, what is the object of Pixel Shits?

1987
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:23,620
The object is to shit everywhere, so as to prevent, no, it is, so as to prevent the joggers

1988
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:30,760
from getting to, from one side of the park, I guess, to the other, and, uh, they just

1989
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,780
randomly spawn from, you know, a random side of the screen and run towards the other side,

1990
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:42,060
and your only method of attempting to stop them is by shitting, and, um, by hitting the

1991
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:47,340
space bar, you can shit, and by the way, I apologize to anyone who's offended by the

1992
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:55,020
use of the word shit, but it, I, I don't know, it, but at any rate, yeah, I, I was given

1993
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,060
Pixel Shits to work with, so I went with it.

1994
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:03,260
I can already see the box art now, like, you need some, like, you know the 2600 box arts

1995
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:07,740
were all, like, these epic paintings and things, and this could be, total 80s jogger with the

1996
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:12,620
sweatband and everything, exactly, and it'd be, like, up to the neck and poop, the first

1997
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:18,100
video game that encourages you to shit on it, like, it should come with a free packet

1998
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,100
of Metamucil.

1999
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,100
Oh, man.

2000
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:24,940
Now, Tigerclaw's asking, probably, you know, a Jim Boy's coupon, who is doing the Pixel

2001
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:25,940
Shits, birds?

2002
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:30,780
But no, it's you, it's the hero, it's human shit, this is human fecal matter, it is, it

2003
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:37,260
is the player, yes, all right, um, when you start the poop meter is at max, by the way,

2004
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:44,780
the internal unity object is actually called poop meter, and, you know, as you poop all

2005
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:51,620
over the place, it depletes, however, there's a conveniently located Taco Bell in the upper

2006
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:57,140
right corner of the screen, pixely Taco Bell, and if you line up alongside it and then just

2007
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:03,300
continue mashing the space bar, you will recharge your poop meter by presumably eating, and

2008
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,540
then you are ready to shit again.

2009
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:11,300
This game is also called Break Your Space Bar The Game.

2010
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:20,580
I love that it has a very authentic 2600 feel to it, I mean, you might, if you go check

2011
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:24,620
out Pixel Shits right now, your first reaction is gonna be, it's probably gonna be one of

2012
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:29,340
two things, probably gonna be like, what the fuck, and then it's gonna be like, this game

2013
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:35,900
is kinda ugly and stupidly simple, but that's the point, like, a lot of 2600 games were

2014
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:40,460
like that, like, one of my favorite 2600 games, I don't know if you've ever played this one,

2015
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:46,020
there's a game that Activision did, it was called Frostbite, have you ever played it?

2016
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:50,900
That I was hoping you'd mention Kaboom, I do love Kaboom, Frostbite I have not played,

2017
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,980
okay, that's all right, I love Kaboom, and that's a stupid simple one too, that's just

2018
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:59,340
collect bombs with the paddle, that's it, these little ugly ass bombs fall and you pick

2019
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:03,620
them up with the paddle, it's stupidly addicting, but then Frostbite, all you did, you would,

2020
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:08,200
you go down the screen by jumping on ice bricks, then you go up the screen, you go down the

2021
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:14,300
screen, you go up the screen, it's kinda like Frogger over and over, near, far, near, far,

2022
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:19,380
and you don't want to fall on the ice, is the whole thing, so, a lot of the 2600 games

2023
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:24,660
are stupid simple, so I love that it's kinda like an homage to that, in fact, I strongly

2024
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:30,540
believe that Pixel Schitz should be on the Flashback 5, whenever Atari puts out the Flashback

2025
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:37,820
5, I think Pixel Schitz should be there, it's just me, it's just me, so, and if anyone cares,

2026
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:44,300
all the sound effects were created on the Korg DS10 synthesizer software for Nintendo

2027
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,300
DS.

2028
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:51,620
Oh wow, so what, okay, Korg things make me happy, okay, I have to ask though, let's take

2029
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:58,020
a step back for a minute here, okay, how did we get from Dark Sakura saying Pixel Schitz

2030
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:03,580
to where we're at tonight, walk us through what happened in your mind getting from idea

2031
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,540
to product.

2032
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:12,820
Well, I was listening to the podcast in my car while I was driving back from a random

2033
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:20,020
trip to Jersey, and, you know, I hear this, and all I can, and she mentions, you know,

2034
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:23,780
Pixel Schitz and Dream Game, so of course I start thinking, what else am I gonna do,

2035
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:30,060
I'm just driving, and I pretty much had the game concept within the minute that I thought

2036
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,340
that.

2037
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:36,380
I mean, it just popped into my head basically.

2038
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:39,580
I'm glad I was inspiring.

2039
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:45,100
The thing is, like, I've been wanting to learn how to use Unity, and I mean, I went through

2040
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:49,580
like, you know, a simple demo of roll a ball, okay, you can roll a ball around and pick

2041
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:59,460
up cubes, but I had yet to actually use Unity to create anything of actual substance.

2042
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:05,100
So this was a great excuse to get started with Unity 2D, and so I threw this together,

2043
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:08,780
you know, an hour here, an hour there, over the course of about two weeks, and that's

2044
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,780
it.

2045
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,780
And I finished it early today.

2046
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:15,340
That's kind of funny, because the story behind when Bobby created Flappy Vog a few months

2047
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:18,900
ago was very similar, it was kind of like, I need a project to learn Unity, so here you

2048
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:25,300
go, Flappy Vog, and now we've got this, so we helped you learn all about Unity.

2049
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,300
You did.

2050
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,260
You guys did me a favor.

2051
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,260
That's awesome.

2052
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:36,060
So now you can make a game that maybe won't have an offensive title for some people, right?

2053
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:38,180
Warrior Bob is now the best shitter in chat.

2054
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:40,780
Warrior Bob just got three seventy three shits.

2055
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:45,580
Now Bobby's number two.

2056
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,580
Holy shit.

2057
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,060
That should be the sequel.

2058
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,060
Holy shit.

2059
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:52,820
I'm going to be back in chat after this, but I need to know, is the game too easy?

2060
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:59,620
Because if it is, I can certainly change that, or make a hard version.

2061
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:03,180
We're beta testing this a little bit here, and Pow again asking the site for the game,

2062
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:09,660
that's yyrgames.com slash p s, and you guys have to check this out, it's too damn funny.

2063
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:15,300
Maybe we need power-ups, and we'll make the game harder and have power-ups for explosive

2064
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,300
diarrhea.

2065
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,300
Don't get crazy.

2066
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,300
Don't get crazy.

2067
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,340
And don't forget about the slippery piles of pee.

2068
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,500
You guys are nasty, nasty people.

2069
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:25,100
Alright, but let me ask this on a serious note.

2070
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,620
They should have other things other than joggers, like little squirrels or dogs or something

2071
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,620
like that.

2072
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:32,620
Maybe the dogs eat the shit.

2073
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:35,620
Will you knock it off with that shit?

2074
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:36,620
Alright.

2075
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:40,700
I like the idea of the shit-eating dog.

2076
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,700
You guys are so stupid.

2077
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,700
Alright, but what else-

2078
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,140
You hang with us, what's that say about you?

2079
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,140
What else are you working on these days, YYRE?

2080
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:50,820
Because pixel shits, you're not going to make any money off this.

2081
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,820
What-

2082
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:52,820
I don't know, man.

2083
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:56,500
You put this on iOS, I think you can make some money.

2084
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:01,660
The thing is though, on iOS, how would you control this with the twitch precise precision

2085
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,980
that you would need?

2086
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:09,380
I mean, I guess I could be like, tap the upper part of the screen to move up, tap the lower

2087
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:11,380
part of the screen to move down.

2088
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:12,380
Use the-

2089
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,380
I don't know, I guess it might work.

2090
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,380
Accelerometer.

2091
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:17,020
But would it pass Apple's certification?

2092
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:18,020
Yes.

2093
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:23,420
You might have to go Android.

2094
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:24,420
No comment.

2095
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:25,420
Alright.

2096
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:31,060
As far as what else I'm working on, really the main thing I'm working on these days is,

2097
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:33,540
has nothing to do with game development at all.

2098
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:40,060
It's preparing my apartment because, although I know I mentioned to you guys that I was

2099
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:46,180
looking for a job out there in San Francisco, it turns out my fiance felt that she had been

2100
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:49,220
waiting too long, so she started looking for a job out here.

2101
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:55,180
I applied to 15 or so places, and within two months of her starting to look, the New York

2102
01:48:55,180 --> 01:49:00,420
Public Library offered her a position, so she's actually moving here on Friday.

2103
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,420
Wow!

2104
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:02,420
Well, congrats.

2105
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,420
Look at that!

2106
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:04,420
That's amazing.

2107
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:09,340
I mean, I'm bummed out to see you're not gonna end up on this coast after all, but I'm happy

2108
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,340
for you at the end result.

2109
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:11,340
That'll be great.

2110
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:15,820
Well, I know we will be back to visit, so we may yet be able to play that game of Bishi

2111
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,820
Bashi.

2112
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:17,820
Awesome.

2113
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:21,300
Bochi Kawa has an idea, by the way, for iOS controls.

2114
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:24,420
Tap the screen to move, but yell at it to shit.

2115
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:28,940
Oh my god, your voice would go dead within minutes.

2116
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:34,260
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT

2117
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,260
SHIT!

2118
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,460
Oh god, alright.

2119
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:41,100
Maybe it's one of those things in there that's, like, intended to be a novelty where you can

2120
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:44,060
use it, but it's probably not the best idea.

2121
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:48,500
Alright, so why are there any easter eggs in the game we should know of?

2122
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:53,380
Actually, there are absolutely none, but I will say this much.

2123
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:59,980
One thing that will definitely improve your performance, if you will, if you leave a lot

2124
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:05,500
of the medium-sized shits around, you know, enough for the jogger to get stuck in it for

2125
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:11,060
a couple of seconds, but not enough to stop them, you can go and basically crap on the

2126
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:15,500
jogger while they're stuck in the medium shit and make it big.

2127
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:19,820
So you can actually, like, cover the jogger and shit in a way?

2128
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:25,420
Well, I mean, the effect is the same, as if they had just run into a big one, but basically

2129
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:32,060
you can cover more places with medium shits than large shits in the same amount of time,

2130
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:36,420
so you could just kind of leave medium shits in places, and then as long as you can get

2131
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:41,340
to it before the jogger gets free, you can add to it and then trap them.

2132
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:46,140
And then you can imagine the joggers are your enemies and take a shit on them.

2133
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,060
When somebody asks me, what have you accomplished?

2134
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,780
And by the way, I have nothing against joggers.

2135
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:56,420
When somebody asked me, when somebody asked me, Rob, what have you accomplished in 12

2136
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,820
and a half years of Orange Lounge Radio?

2137
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:02,060
I'm just going to send him this little snippet of us talking about Pixel Shits.

2138
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:03,060
That's uh...

2139
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,060
I endorse this activity.

2140
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,060
That's right.

2141
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:08,860
Well, YYR, I do have to let you go so we can move on with the show, but I do encourage

2142
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,380
people to check out Pixel Shits.

2143
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:13,580
It was, it was, it was clearly a project you did out of love.

2144
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:17,300
You are truly doing the Lord's work, my friend.

2145
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:18,780
Well, thank you.

2146
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,940
I don't know which Lord exactly, but uh...

2147
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:21,940
Dark Sakura.

2148
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:22,940
Clearly.

2149
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,300
Bless you, my child.

2150
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,460
But as long as you keep mentioning ideas for dream games, I'm going to keep listening.

2151
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:32,100
So uh, just be careful about what you say.

2152
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,100
That's amazing.

2153
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,100
All right.

2154
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,100
We will try it.

2155
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,300
Now, we also, we've got to be careful because we don't want to be like every week, be like,

2156
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,300
oh, that's a dream game.

2157
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,300
Oh, that's a dream game.

2158
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,300
Because then that's going to jump the shark.

2159
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:44,540
We, we have to make sure that our dream game ideas are carefully selected.

2160
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,540
That's so key.

2161
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,540
Like Pixel Shits.

2162
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,540
All right.

2163
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,540
Well, uh, best of luck.

2164
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:54,340
By the way, I would encourage anyone else who wants to, you know, get us started programming

2165
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:59,540
to also go ahead and listen to Orange Lounge Radio for dream game ideas.

2166
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,540
Go ahead and...

2167
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,540
Games.

2168
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:04,540
You don't, oh no, we're losing you a little bit.

2169
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,540
You don't, you don't have to clone games that are already out there.

2170
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:08,540
Make our shit.

2171
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,540
Yeah.

2172
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,540
All right.

2173
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,540
We can think of some real shit.

2174
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:12,540
All right.

2175
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,540
YYR, I'm going to let you go so we can get back into some news, but you are so amazing,

2176
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:16,540
my friend.

2177
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,540
Thank you so much.

2178
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:22,540
Hey, I have to live up to your standards of being amazing.

2179
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,540
I love you guys.

2180
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:24,540
Oh, stop, stop.

2181
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:25,540
We love you too.

2182
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:26,540
All right.

2183
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:27,540
Take care, buddy.

2184
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:28,540
All right.

2185
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,540
Later.

2186
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:30,540
Take it easy, guys.

2187
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,540
Bye.

2188
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:32,540
Bye.

2189
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,540
Unfortunately, Skype wasn't cooperating there at the end of the call, but that's all right.

2190
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,540
Uh, still a pleasure to hear from YYR.

2191
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:40,540
That's so adorable that, uh, he's going to be moving with a fiance Friday.

2192
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,540
That's no pressure whatsoever.

2193
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,540
That's great.

2194
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:49,540
Uh, please, uh, if you, if you do believe that we do, that Aaron is doing the Lord's

2195
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:53,540
work, uh, please consider supporting his other projects that do make him money because he's

2196
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:55,540
not going to make shit off of Pixel Shits.

2197
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:59,540
Uh, but he will make some money off of, uh, um, just a little bit, just a little bit of

2198
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:03,540
money off of like Bungee Ferret tossing and falling and Snake 360 and some of his other

2199
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:04,540
projects that are available.

2200
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:08,540
You can read all about all of those games at YYRgames.com.

2201
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:12,540
Uh, meanwhile, have fun shitting everybody.

2202
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:15,540
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

2203
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,540
Uh, Loki.

2204
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,540
Okay.

2205
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:25,540
It's hard to, hard to come off of that, but let's, it's just, it's so easy to make this

2206
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,540
transition, but okay, we're going to do it.

2207
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:28,540
Okay.

2208
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:33,540
Speaking of shit, uh, Nintendo's got some more amigos going to be coming out here.

2209
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,540
Not nice.

2210
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,540
Yellow flag, Loki.

2211
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,540
No.

2212
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:44,540
Um, yeah, they're going to be, they're showing off the second kind of wave of amigos they're

2213
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:46,540
supposed to hit around February of next year.

2214
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:50,540
Um, includes, uh, let's see here.

2215
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:54,540
Lucario, Rosalina, and Luma.

2216
01:53:54,540 --> 01:54:01,540
Um, Bowser, Toon Link, Sheik, Ike, Meta Knight, and King Dedede.

2217
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:08,540
And of course, uh, also, they're going to have, uh, was it Shulk, Sonic, and Mega Man

2218
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,540
as well.

2219
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:15,540
Um, those I think are supposed to, was it, they don't really have firm dates yet for

2220
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:22,540
North America, but to give you an example, in Europe, um, I guess, um, everything up

2221
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:26,540
to Meta Knight, Sonic, and King Dedede is supposed to be out January 23rd, and the rest

2222
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:29,540
are coming out February 20th.

2223
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:35,540
Um, Toon Link is, I guess, compatible with Mario Kart 8 and Hyrule Warriors, as well

2224
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:41,540
as, um, Sheik is also supposed to be compatible Hyrule Warriors, and then, um, I'm not really

2225
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,540
sure about the rest yet.

2226
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:45,540
I'm assuming those will be Smash.

2227
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:50,540
The only thing is, North America, you're kind of getting screwed a little bit, because if

2228
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:55,540
you want to get Shulk, then you're going to have to do business with GameStop, because

2229
01:54:55,540 --> 01:55:02,540
once again, Nintendo's thought, hey, it's going to be a great idea, let's go ahead and

2230
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:05,540
make them exclusive to GameStop.

2231
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:07,540
So, thanks.

2232
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:09,540
That's fantastic.

2233
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,540
Um, let's see.

2234
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:18,540
And I guess, um, what else?

2235
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,540
I guess that's it.

2236
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:25,540
Um, and of course, each of those is going to be $12.99, so, not bad.

2237
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:29,540
I think it was funny that just last week, we were talking about, like, third-party amiibos.

2238
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:32,540
Like, I remember this coming up, like, um, what if third parties would start making their

2239
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:36,540
own amiibos, and sure enough, like, within the week, Sonic and Mega Man.

2240
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,540
Yeah, but those are just Smash Bros. still.

2241
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,540
It's not really a third-party thing.

2242
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:43,540
Still, though, the fact that they're figurines and Smash Bros., I mean, the figurines is

2243
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:46,540
another thing that had to be licensed and talked about and acquired.

2244
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:49,540
I mean, it's not just like, oh, because you're in Smash Bros., we get to do all this shit

2245
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:52,540
with your character.

2246
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,540
I don't know.

2247
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:56,540
Um, I was going to mention, though, I don't think we were talking about tonight, because

2248
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:00,540
it wasn't really that big of a deal, but they were saying, there was, like, a little tease

2249
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:06,540
I saw saying that, uh, the next, was it Zelda, uh, Majora's Mask is going to play differently

2250
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:10,540
on, you know, the new 3DS, but we're not telling you how.

2251
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,540
It's fucking amiibo support.

2252
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,540
I'm telling you right now, that's what it is.

2253
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:18,540
It's fucking amiibo support, because that shit supports near-field communication.

2254
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,540
That's what it is.

2255
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,540
It's not anything fantastic.

2256
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,540
So, whatever.

2257
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,540
Um, okay.

2258
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,540
This is kind of cool.

2259
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,540
I saw this, and I was like, fuck yes!

2260
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:33,540
Um, Just Cause 3 announced to be coming out next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and

2261
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:38,540
PC, and it's going to be on the cover of Game Informer, um, next month.

2262
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:40,540
That is awesome.

2263
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:45,540
I've been waiting a long time for Just Cause 3, and, uh, you know, Just Cause 2 is fantastic.

2264
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:49,540
Hopefully we get some multiplayer in there, and hopefully it's as awesome as Just Cause,

2265
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:55,540
um, I forget what they called it, um, the multiplayer mod on PC, where you can play

2266
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,540
it to a thousand people at a time.

2267
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:58,540
Sounds fucking awesome.

2268
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:06,540
Um, but yeah, next year, so I'm assuming we'll see something about that during E3, and they're

2269
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:12,540
telling us it's coming, but I'm still skeptical until I actually see it out, but Rockstar

2270
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,540
are saying that Grand Theft Auto Online will be getting heists shortly after the launch

2271
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:20,540
of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.

2272
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:25,540
Uh, quoted, you know, we know you're all excited for more updates to come, and we've got some

2273
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:29,540
really exciting stuff in the works, and continue adding and expanding and involving the world

2274
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:33,540
of Grand Theft Auto Online, including the highly anticipated launch of Online Heist,

2275
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:39,540
which will be available on all four consoles, as of the first, um, as the first Grand Theft

2276
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:44,540
Auto Online update to happen after the game launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2277
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:49,540
I hope that's true, because it's been delayed several, several, several, several times.

2278
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:51,540
So, yeah.

2279
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,540
Alright, you need this Online Heist to happen.

2280
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:59,540
Yeah, after all, it was promised for, you know, before the game even came out, so...

2281
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,540
True.

2282
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:01,540
Yeah.

2283
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:05,540
Alright, well, um, speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, um, some Black Friday deals are starting

2284
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:11,540
to show up, because, you know, the crazy shopping hysteria day in America is next Friday, right?

2285
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:14,540
No, not this coming Friday, but the Friday after, but it's like two weeks away, right?

2286
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:15,540
Okay, so we're getting close.

2287
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:21,540
Um, and, uh, yeah, if you are, uh, if you're the type that's gonna go out and wait in the

2288
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:25,540
line all frickin' night and get your little redemption slip and, I don't know, pull out

2289
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:29,540
weaves trying to get to, you know, the best deals in the store, then good luck.

2290
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,540
Me?

2291
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,540
I'm more of a Cyber Monday person.

2292
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:37,540
I'll sit in my pajama bottoms with my cup of coffee and try to order stuff online.

2293
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,540
Isn't...

2294
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:39,540
Huh?

2295
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,540
Isn't this around the time when we expect another Steam sale?

2296
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:43,540
Oh, of course.

2297
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:44,540
Of course.

2298
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,540
Not ready.

2299
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:46,540
Thanksgiving.

2300
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,540
I know.

2301
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:48,540
It's not...

2302
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:49,540
Well, here's the good news.

2303
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,540
It won't be the huge one.

2304
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,540
That'll be winter.

2305
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:53,540
That'll be the winter sale that takes place across, but they'll do, like, a Black Friday

2306
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,540
sale at Cyber Monday.

2307
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:55,540
They'll do something...

2308
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,540
Cyber Monday!

2309
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,540
Absolutely.

2310
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,540
Black Friday deals.

2311
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:06,540
PlayStation Blog revealed that there are some $399.99 bundles for PlayStation 4 that will

2312
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,540
have some different included games.

2313
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:14,540
One will have a disc-based copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 and a download voucher for The Last

2314
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:15,540
of Us Remastered.

2315
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:20,540
The second will have a physical copy of Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham and a voucher for Little

2316
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:21,540
Big Planet 3.

2317
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:24,540
So those are gonna be available especially for Black Friday.

2318
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:28,540
So, I mean, if you think about it, two games, and those are kind of newer games, you know,

2319
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,540
those aren't, like, years old.

2320
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,540
It's not like you're getting Knack or something that's kind of last year's news.

2321
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:37,540
Those are very recent games, so that's, like, $100 worth of games being thrown in there,

2322
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:41,540
so that's how they are justifying the price there.

2323
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:42,540
Pretty cool.

2324
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:48,540
Also, some Black Friday discounts unveiled on PlayStation TVs and PlayStation 3s.

2325
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:54,540
Amazon and GameStop both gonna be offering PlayStation TVs for $80 and PlayStation 3s

2326
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:56,540
for $200.

2327
01:59:56,540 --> 02:00:01,540
This will be throughout the holiday season but is temporary and first come, first served.

2328
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:06,540
So, wow, if you're in the market for a PlayStation TV, this might be the time to take the plunge

2329
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:07,540
on one of those.

2330
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:12,540
Many of you last week took the plunge on Valkyria Chronicles on Steam.

2331
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:18,540
In fact, Valkyria Chronicles was released on Steam and PC and during the first 24 hours

2332
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:24,540
apparently became number one, beating Assassin's Creed Unity for a short period of time.

2333
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:28,540
I'm not sure how things have played out in the week since then, but obviously Valkyria

2334
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:33,540
Chronicles is doing very well on PC and that's great because on PlayStation 3, I think a

2335
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:36,540
lot of people missed it, so the fact that this game is getting a second chance on PC

2336
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:40,540
is pretty cool and a lot of people are supporting it, so good job, y'all.

2337
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:43,540
You're not gonna be able to support this, but you know what, guys?

2338
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,540
It was probably crap.

2339
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:50,540
There was a Family Guy game that was in development for the Wii and the Nintendo 3DS.

2340
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:52,540
This was called Back to the Multiverse.

2341
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:55,540
It was being developed by Heavy Iron Studios.

2342
02:00:55,540 --> 02:01:01,540
It was originally on the PC, the PlayStation, and the Xbox 360, but the Wii version was

2343
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:07,540
then dropped and the 3DS version quickly after, probably just because, I mean...

2344
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:10,540
Yeah, I didn't even realize it was coming out on those platforms.

2345
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:14,540
Yeah, I didn't even know the game came out on other platforms and the Wii in 2012 is

2346
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:17,540
already kind of, you know, yeah.

2347
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:19,540
It probably was for the best.

2348
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:21,540
Sorry, guys.

2349
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,540
Dark Soccer.

2350
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:24,540
It was for the best because apparently that game sucked.

2351
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:25,540
What a surprise.

2352
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:28,540
The other thing I was gonna mention, though, I don't know if you mentioned it, the PlayStation

2353
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:30,540
TV discounts, that's effective now.

2354
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:32,540
You don't even have to wait until Black Friday.

2355
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:33,540
Oh shit, that's great.

2356
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,540
It's already at Amazon and GameStop.

2357
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,540
I think it's already at those prices.

2358
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:41,540
Well, we have some different Nintendo news.

2359
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:45,540
Actually, a little bit of a report about the Zelda Wii U version.

2360
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:51,540
Aonuma says that it's actually even better than before the previous announcement.

2361
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:56,540
It looks a lot better, a lot prettier, and they said there's gonna be a lot more coming

2362
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,540
up for the next E3.

2363
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:00,540
So that's pretty good.

2364
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:02,540
I know a lot of people have been excited about it.

2365
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:07,540
And then Captain Toad Treasure Tracker almost had Link in it.

2366
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:12,540
Actually, when they did the demo of the game, they needed to use a character that wasn't

2367
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:16,540
in the Mario franchise because it was trying to do a non-jumping character.

2368
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:25,540
So they used Link, and Miyamoto thought they were actually gonna have it as a Link game,

2369
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:27,540
so that, of course, didn't happen that way.

2370
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:33,540
And then, last but not least, we do have some news about Super Smash Bros.

2371
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:37,540
It is the Wii U's most pre-ordered game to date.

2372
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:42,540
Lots of people wants it, and I know that the handheld one was super awesome,

2373
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:46,540
so I can only imagine what the console version is like.

2374
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:48,540
So there you go.

2375
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:54,540
Actually, it's supposed to be out on November 21st in North America and the 28th in Europe.

2376
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:56,540
So, there you go.

2377
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:57,540
I'm looking forward to that.

2378
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:00,540
I think we're gonna be talking about that game a little bit on next week's show.

2379
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:01,540
Call it a hunch.

2380
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:03,540
But I think that game's gonna come up a little bit.

2381
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:05,540
All right, let's get to the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

2382
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:17,540
You take Facebook and Google+, and you throw those words in a blender, and you get FOOGLE.

2383
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:22,540
And it's where we ask our two social communities at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

2384
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:25,540
and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

2385
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:31,540
We ask them a question, and we say, hey, you should answer this so we can get your feedback on the air.

2386
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:37,540
This week, we decided to ask about Amiibo, because, you know, Amiibo was kind of a mystery for a while.

2387
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:38,540
We didn't know a whole lot about it.

2388
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:40,540
We figured it was Nintendo's ripoff of Skylanders,

2389
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:44,540
but now that we know the full picture on what Amiibo is really all about,

2390
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:48,540
we want to check in with listeners and say, you know, are you into it?

2391
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,540
Do you just want the figures?

2392
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:51,540
What's your stance on Amiibo?

2393
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,540
Have you pre-ordered, or are you saying no way?

2394
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,540
So let's check in.

2395
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:57,540
We'll go over to Google first, and ActDeft says,

2396
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:00,540
at first, I was skeptical on whether these were a good idea or not,

2397
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:03,540
but after the two latest Nintendo Directs, I got sold on them.

2398
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:04,540
I have two reserved.

2399
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:05,540
One is Yoshi.

2400
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:07,540
I'll let you guess on who's the other one.

2401
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,540
And if you don't know ActDeft,

2402
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:13,540
I'm just going to tell you his avatar is a little stuffed Kirby,

2403
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,540
so just, you know, take that for what it is.

2404
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:19,540
Redertainment says, remember our discussion from a couple weeks ago

2405
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:23,540
about buying in-game content for supposedly free games?

2406
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:28,540
I feel Amiibos are similarly unnecessary to enhance the gaming experience,

2407
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:32,540
but feel peer pressure will press on gamers to buy the Amiibos.

2408
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:36,540
Also, my iPad corrects Amiibos to Amigos.

2409
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:38,540
Well, it hasn't learned the word Amiibos yet,

2410
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:44,540
because remember, now the iOS is going to learn what you like to say.

2411
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:46,540
Let's check out on Facebook.

2412
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:50,540
Critical Myth says, I'm still not sure what the Amiibo thing is supposed to really do.

2413
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:54,540
At least Skylanders and Disney Infinity have a clear use for the figures,

2414
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,540
even if it's total cash grab.

2415
02:04:56,540 --> 02:04:58,540
This just has the cash grab feel to it.

2416
02:04:58,540 --> 02:05:01,540
Well, Critical Myth, you're probably not alone in that,

2417
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:05,540
and I think part of the problem is that, you know, Skylanders is one game.

2418
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:07,540
Well, I take that it's more than one game,

2419
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:11,540
but it's one series where essentially all those figures do the same thing in those games.

2420
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:14,540
Amiibos vary from game to game to game,

2421
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:17,540
so I think that's what's causing people to not really get it.

2422
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:20,540
Like, it is one thing in Smash Brothers, but then like in Mario Kart,

2423
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:22,540
it gives you a suit for your racer.

2424
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:24,540
Whoopee! You know what I mean?

2425
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:26,540
Stupid.

2426
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:29,540
Yeah, so I think in some games the value is much more than others.

2427
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:32,540
But here's the thing, it's like, and that's why I understand with that,

2428
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:37,540
it's like, it's almost like that shit was going to be free anyways,

2429
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:40,540
but now it's tied to this figure that they want you to buy.

2430
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,540
Right.

2431
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:44,540
Well, but at the end of the day too, they're just outfits.

2432
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:48,540
You know, my, well, I'll get to how I feel about this when we get here for some more listeners here.

2433
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,540
Cial supplies and says,

2434
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:52,540
Not sure what they're supposed to be used for and why.

2435
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:56,540
Depending on their purpose and build quality, I might be talked into getting one or two.

2436
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:01,540
Sounds like Nintendo might need to get some more info out there besides just those directs,

2437
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:06,540
or maybe, you know, not force people to watch the entire direct to understand what Amiibos are all about.

2438
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:07,540
Dark Charger says,

2439
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:12,540
As a lifelong Nintendo fan, I'm picking up some figures primarily for their looks and for collecting.

2440
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:15,540
The added functionality is pretty much just a small bonus.

2441
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:17,540
Erica M. replied and said,

2442
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:20,540
I think they're so cute. Can't wait to get some.

2443
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:21,540
Dark Tetsuya said,

2444
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:24,540
I'll likely try to pick one or two when I get Smash Brothers this week,

2445
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:27,540
even though there doesn't seem to be much to do with them outside of Smash yet.

2446
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:32,540
One idea I had was saving your character parts, cart config, and Mario Kart 8 to the figure

2447
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:36,540
so you wouldn't have to remember what exact parts you use in-game at a friend's house,

2448
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:41,540
like the Wii-motes used to do for the regular Wii.

2449
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:42,540
They still do that.

2450
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,540
They still do that. It's just very few games use it, right?

2451
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:45,540
Yeah.

2452
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:48,540
Like saving your info to the controller.

2453
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,540
Tom S. replied and said,

2454
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:56,540
I'm going to collect all the Zelda-related Amiibos because I am a junkie for anything Zelda-related.

2455
02:06:56,540 --> 02:06:57,540
Brad B. says,

2456
02:06:57,540 --> 02:07:01,540
This is a slippery slope. I'd better steer clear of them totally.

2457
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:05,540
I made the mistake of starting with the Marvel Disney Infinity figures

2458
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:07,540
and Stitch, who snuck into my cart at checkout,

2459
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:11,540
and those suckers are like crack for a completionist like me.

2460
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:15,540
It's true. If you are the type that has to have everything, be careful.

2461
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:16,540
Renji2214 says,

2462
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:19,540
I'm thinking about picking some of them up after the release

2463
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:24,540
because I think for the price the figures look pretty decent along with being able to be used in Smash.

2464
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:26,540
Winston H. replied and said,

2465
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:28,540
Personally, I don't really care for the Amiibo.

2466
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:31,540
I don't see any real reason to purchase something like this unless you're a big collector

2467
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:34,540
or you like your Skylander-like products.

2468
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:35,540
Ragenator says,

2469
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:38,540
I suppose they're neat if you're into gaming-themed paraphernalia,

2470
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:42,540
be it the Amiibos, the old-school Nintendo comics, or whatever,

2471
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:45,540
but I don't think the Amiibos are a must-have.

2472
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:47,540
Surping Slurpee replies and says,

2473
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:50,540
What the fuck is an Amiibo? They're for Nintendo? Who cares?

2474
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:54,540
I haven't played a Nintendo console since N64 was still relevant.

2475
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,540
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a hater.

2476
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:01,540
Sound the hater alarms. We've got a hater.

2477
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:02,540
I'm just teasing.

2478
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:07,540
I am very angry and I'm going to post on the internet.

2479
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,540
No, I'm making fun.

2480
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:12,540
You know what? You're not the only one, actually,

2481
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:14,540
so there's other people out there that feel similarly.

2482
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:18,540
But by not at least trying some of the GameCube stuff,

2483
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:20,540
there was some really sweet games on GameCube.

2484
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:24,540
I mean, if you've been on loop since N64, at least visit the GameCube.

2485
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:25,540
At least visit that.

2486
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:27,540
Crylo responds and says,

2487
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:30,540
Going off the pictures I've seen here and there, I think they look beautiful.

2488
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:33,540
As for collecting them, I only plan on buying the ones I like.

2489
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,540
Lastly, Hitstun says,

2490
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:37,540
Sure, I'll buy one so I can try some Amiibo stuff.

2491
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:42,540
I'll have to do the research to find which Amiibos are compatible with the most games.

2492
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:45,540
There's the answers from Facebook and Google+.

2493
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:48,540
You know what's interesting? Not a single person who said,

2494
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:49,540
I'm getting them all.

2495
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:53,540
I would have thought there was at least one Uber Nintendo fanboy who said,

2496
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:54,540
I'm getting them all.

2497
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:56,540
Got to catch them all.

2498
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:59,540
But anyway, as I was going to tell Loki a minute ago,

2499
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:02,540
I think I felt similar to the people who said,

2500
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:05,540
I want to just get them because they're cute little figures,

2501
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:09,540
and the fact that they tie into some games is like a little bonus.

2502
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:11,540
And I think that's kind of my stance on it,

2503
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:13,540
is that I want the Samus figure,

2504
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:17,540
and I'll probably have to get that Mega Man figure for sure,

2505
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:19,540
and there'll be some other figures here and there where it's like,

2506
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:21,540
I just want the figure because it looks cute.

2507
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:25,540
Pretty much the only reason I could see wanting one of those is just the figure,

2508
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:31,540
but really so far they haven't really given us a reason that we need to have these.

2509
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:34,540
It's not like Skylanders and Disney Infinity, like I said,

2510
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:36,540
where it seems to be necessary to play with those.

2511
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:39,540
But at the same time, I don't want Nintendo going down that path either.

2512
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:44,540
I actually kind of like that Nintendo kind of turns the Amiibo into,

2513
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:49,540
oh, it unlocks a skin here, a weapon here, like it's little things.

2514
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:53,540
Or it's like, okay, it's a little enhancement, but it's still something.

2515
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:58,540
But they even haven't really discussed too much about training your character in Smash Bros.

2516
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:00,540
or what exactly that does.

2517
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:03,540
I mean, it's just kind of, it's like, ooh, it's a figure,

2518
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:05,540
but it kind of does some other things too.

2519
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,540
I mean, that's really all it is.

2520
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:09,540
I would like to see more of, and what I think would be really cool is

2521
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:12,540
if the Amiibos really function between all the different games.

2522
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:15,540
I'd like to see more about how will it work between games.

2523
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:20,540
Like, if I make progression in Smash Bros., can I use my Amiibo in another game,

2524
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:23,540
and it rewards me for what I've done in Smash Bros. with that Amiibo?

2525
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,540
I think that it would be a really, okay,

2526
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:29,540
Nintendo's lacking a trophy or achievement system or thing like that right now.

2527
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:34,540
The Amiibos might be a neat way to explore that a little bit.

2528
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,540
I'd be down if they did something like that.

2529
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:38,540
I just don't think they're going to do something like that.

2530
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,540
I think they're going to talk in a big, like they did with the whole,

2531
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:45,540
oh, you can put your Miis on the Wii remote and bring them with you type thing.

2532
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,540
They're going to talk it up big, and then they're not going to do anything with it.

2533
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:52,540
Or like, you know, how they had this really cool functionality with MP3s and stuff

2534
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:56,540
being able to be played on the Wii for Excite, you know, Excite Truck,

2535
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,540
and then, oh, fuck it, we're just going to totally forget about it,

2536
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:01,540
except for, you know, the one Undersea game we had.

2537
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:03,540
You know, it's just, I don't know.

2538
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,540
They come up with these cool ideas, and then they never do anything with them.

2539
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:08,540
Pao in chat says at live.vognetware.com,

2540
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:13,540
Pao says, if Amiibo unlocked a big part of the game, gamers will rage on the internet.

2541
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:14,540
That's absolutely true.

2542
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:17,540
Fifth Dream says, like, you can't catch them all unless you buy an Amigo.

2543
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,540
Fuck that.

2544
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:20,540
That's true.

2545
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:23,540
Jonas, haven't checked in with you in a little while.

2546
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:28,540
You play a lot of the Wii U stuff, and a lot of it is very popular on the anime circuit.

2547
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:31,540
How do you think Amiibos might change things up a little bit?

2548
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:34,540
Do you see people bringing their Amiibos to anime conventions to be like,

2549
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:36,540
oh, I've got to play my villager in Animal Crossing?

2550
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:41,540
It might be possible, but again, I'm not really sure how Amiibos will work on the anime conventions.

2551
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:43,540
We'll allow it and see how it works.

2552
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:47,540
For my own personal benefit, it's more like, see, so far it's just collectors.

2553
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:51,540
I don't know what Nintendo's going to do in terms of support, like everyone's saying.

2554
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:54,540
Let's say if, or, let's say if I buy a Mario.

2555
02:11:54,540 --> 02:12:01,540
A Mario will work for every game, like Mario Kart, Mario, Mario 3D World, and all the other games and stuff.

2556
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:05,540
Or if I wanted to use it for, like, even a Zelda game, just for shits and giggles.

2557
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:12,540
It's gonna, they're gonna put out a ton of Pokemon Amiibos, and they're gonna have a fucking carrying case.

2558
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:14,540
I guarantee it.

2559
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:15,540
I don't-

2560
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:16,540
That looks like a fucking Pokeball.

2561
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:20,540
I actually, I don't see Nintendo putting out 151 Pokemon Amiibos, though.

2562
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:21,540
That seems like too much.

2563
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:22,540
That's overkill.

2564
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:26,540
They're not gonna put out, they may not put them out, all of them, but they're gonna put out a ton of them.

2565
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:33,540
And I guarantee you that's gonna be one of the things, like, look, you can train your own, it's like having your own Pokemon.

2566
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:37,540
You train them, and then you bring them to battle, boom, put it down, and just...

2567
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:39,540
Yeah, I could see it going that way, too.

2568
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:43,540
What I'm also maybe concerned with, just forgetting development's perspective.

2569
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:48,540
What if they do, like, an on-disc DLC, quote, unquote.

2570
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:54,540
Ooh, you can either pay four bucks for that thing, or just use your Amiibo to get it for free, kind of thing.

2571
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:59,540
I don't see Nintendo going down that path, because Nintendo is not the $4 DLC type of company.

2572
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:03,540
You know, we mentioned that earlier in the show, is that a lot of the DLC that Nintendo has done so far,

2573
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:09,540
I mean, anything can happen, but a lot of the DLC Nintendo has done so far has been very rich in what it's doing.

2574
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:13,540
And I'm okay that these Amiibos just do little things in the game.

2575
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:17,540
Like, you know, okay, I get a custom suit for my racer in Mario Kart.

2576
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:18,540
That's not a big deal.

2577
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:21,540
You know, that's a fine little, like, okay, little enhancement.

2578
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:24,540
I mean, is that on-disc DLC?

2579
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:29,540
Sort of. I think it was patched in, technically, but it's so minor in the big scope of things.

2580
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:33,540
And I do like that the one figure will work in several games.

2581
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:37,540
That is kind of neat. That's something that Skylanders and Disney Infinity don't necessarily have.

2582
02:13:37,540 --> 02:13:40,540
I mean, they do work in several games in the same series,

2583
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:45,540
but even Skylander finds ways to make you buy new shit for the same series every year.

2584
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,540
Like, you know, oh, this year they're going to swap.

2585
02:13:47,540 --> 02:13:49,540
The top halves and the bottom halves are switchable.

2586
02:13:49,540 --> 02:13:52,540
Or, you know, what is it this year? The trap team or something?

2587
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:56,540
You have these stupid trap crystals that you can trap enemies in and play as the enemies.

2588
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:59,540
Yeah. Little much, little much.

2589
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:02,540
All right, so there you go. Thank you guys for your feedback there.

2590
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:06,540
And be very curious in a couple weeks to check in and see how much you guys have used them.

2591
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:10,540
Or if they're just sitting on your shelf looking pretty, which I suppose is okay,

2592
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:12,540
because they are figurines. They're meant to do that.

2593
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:15,540
In the meantime, let's get back into some other gaming news.

2594
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:18,540
We will be taking your calls here in a little while at 1877 Game O-L-R

2595
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:21,540
or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. But first, Loki.

2596
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,540
So this is kind of cool. Even though the official Nintendo Magazine has shut down,

2597
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:30,540
Nintendo UK has gone ahead and put out a digital magazine called Nintendo Extra.

2598
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:38,540
And so now you can, you know, check that out to find out all the latest Nintendo information.

2599
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:44,540
It's pretty much just an advertisement piece, but it's still kind of neat, though,

2600
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:49,540
that they're doing some sort of an official magazine type thing. I don't know.

2601
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:57,540
But yeah, I guess you can check it out now. Let's see, nintendo.co.uk slash miscellaneous.

2602
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,540
That's Nintendo Extra. I'm sure they've got a link on the front page, though, for it.

2603
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:06,540
All right. Is that something I could actually look at on my Wii U tablet or something?

2604
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:07,540
That would make sense.

2605
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:15,540
Probably. It's just an HTML page. I mean, they've got some of the things that are in Nintendo Extra issue one.

2606
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:20,540
Stuff about Smash Brothers. It looks like a big ol' advertisement.

2607
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:29,540
So they have a how to play, you know, Mario Kart or, you know, Adventures in Walleye Tumble Temple, Captain Toad comic.

2608
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:35,540
You know, I don't know. It's just a big advertisement.

2609
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:40,540
All right. Well, get your tinfoil hats ready, everybody, because here's a big one.

2610
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:46,540
And I feel like this kind of comes up. Like, every year we get a rumor on this, but it is gaining steam yet again,

2611
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:54,540
as some folks have noticed that there is a trademark that you can actually view for yourself on the USPTO.gov website.

2612
02:15:54,540 --> 02:16:01,540
You can look this up. It is a trademark for Microsoft for what? Battle Toads.

2613
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:07,540
Battle Toads has been trademarked by Microsoft.

2614
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:12,540
Now, see, here's the thing, though, is I kind of feel like, well, this could just be them protecting their property

2615
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:16,540
and renewing the trademark because maybe they want to do something someday.

2616
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:21,540
It doesn't mean that they're doing something now, right this minute, but they don't want somebody else coming in

2617
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:24,540
and doing a Battle Toads game just because they let it lapse.

2618
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:29,540
By the way, if you forgot, Battle Toads was a NES game and I believe had a Game Boy version as well.

2619
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:30,540
An NES version.

2620
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:31,540
An arcade.

2621
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:32,540
An arcade.

2622
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:34,540
They had many variants, like, for the Sega Genesis.

2623
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:35,540
And Super Nintendo.

2624
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:36,540
Oh, that's right.

2625
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,540
Which is the easier version of the NES version.

2626
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:44,540
Which was all Rare that did that, but then Rare was, of course, picked up by Microsoft several years ago,

2627
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:48,540
which is why you have Killer Instinct on Xbox One and so on.

2628
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:51,540
But I don't know if they could file a trademark for something that they're not going to use

2629
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:57,540
because you have to show that you're using that trademark in order to be able to register the trademark.

2630
02:16:57,540 --> 02:17:01,540
That's hard to say because I remember this was an issue with, quote, Killer Instinct at the time.

2631
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:05,540
I just know that because I looked in the registering trademarks, so...

2632
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:13,540
So, in order... Yeah, you have to show that you're using the trademark in order to actually register said trademark.

2633
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:15,540
I don't...

2634
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:16,540
As far as I understand.

2635
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:19,540
I don't see why they wouldn't try doing something like this,

2636
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:22,540
but that doesn't mean it's going to necessarily be the game you expect either.

2637
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:26,540
I mean, this could be like a kid-friendly property for all we know.

2638
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:27,540
Fuck no.

2639
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:28,540
Well, hell no. Hell no.

2640
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:31,540
It can be kid-friendly, but it better beat the shit out of you when you play it.

2641
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,540
Because it's got to be hard.

2642
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:36,540
I don't know. Again, I am literally pulling this out of my ass.

2643
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:38,540
Nobody knows anything on this.

2644
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:42,540
This is all just fanfic based on the trademark, literally.

2645
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:43,540
So...

2646
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:48,540
But the potential, or the possibilities and the potential here is pretty exciting, if nothing else.

2647
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:52,540
As long as the game is hard as shit and you have the queen as the final boss, okay, cool.

2648
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:55,540
Yeah, that's true. A lot of people really attach to the characters.

2649
02:17:55,540 --> 02:18:00,540
You know, the original NES version had those cinematics that were, at the time, were pretty epic.

2650
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:04,540
I don't know, but it's also been a good 20 years since then.

2651
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:06,540
I like Super Battletoads. That was pretty awesome.

2652
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:08,540
Yeah, Super Battletoads is cool.

2653
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:10,540
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

2654
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:12,540
Well, we have some stuff.

2655
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:16,540
Now, this one is, I would say, a near and dear one for us anyway.

2656
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:21,540
We've been big supporters of GamerX, right?

2657
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:30,540
Right. And, well, this has been associated with GamerX, I would probably say, pretty tightly.

2658
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:32,540
So...

2659
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:34,540
Technically, it's the same company.

2660
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:41,540
Midboss puts on GamerX and this is like their first game, which is basically MatCon and Air Brainchild.

2661
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:44,540
Yeah, well, that was good too.

2662
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:47,540
And his people. It's not just him, but his people.

2663
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:51,540
Well, anyway, the playable demo of Read Only Memories is out.

2664
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:56,540
And you can get it online. It's for Windows, Linux, and OS X.

2665
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:06,540
And, basically, they want you to try it out and tweet back to atrom2064 and let them know what you think.

2666
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:12,540
There's a pre-order available on Humble Bundle and the Ouya store, because there will also be an Ouya version.

2667
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:14,540
Although, there's not a demo for the Ouya yet.

2668
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:19,540
You can get your copy at Mega Limited.

2669
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:26,540
I'm trying to get the direct address, but I don't have it there.

2670
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:31,540
But we'll have to get it for you guys and put it somewhere for you guys to play the demo.

2671
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:35,540
Or just Google it. You can find it there. Look up their Twitter.

2672
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:36,540
Do the Google thing.

2673
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:37,540
All over.

2674
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:40,540
So, yeah, pretty cool. I'm excited, because, yay.

2675
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:46,540
Yeah, it's inspired. If you didn't know, the game is inspired by Snatcher pretty heavily.

2676
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:49,540
And some of those more cinematic games from the past.

2677
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:51,540
It's a total cyberpunk game.

2678
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:56,540
Don't download this expecting next-gen graphics, because that's not what you're going to get.

2679
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:58,540
But this is more a story-driven type of game.

2680
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,540
Think Sega CD.

2681
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,540
Yeah.

2682
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:06,540
Yeah, I'll have to check that out. I didn't get a chance to do that this week, but maybe I will do that soon.

2683
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:08,540
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

2684
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:09,540
Alright.

2685
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:14,540
So this is interesting. I don't know.

2686
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:19,540
Kind of since we were talking a little bit about, you know, Microsoft maybe bringing back old properties.

2687
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:24,540
But Killer Instinct apparently was originally supposed to be for Xbox 360.

2688
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:30,540
They even had like a Killer Instinct prototype build that was being shown off.

2689
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:33,540
And they have some footage now online for it.

2690
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:38,540
I guess I'm not surprised and actually didn't look that bad.

2691
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:41,540
Although they do have some placeholder things.

2692
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:49,540
Like I guess Chief Thunder kind of looks like this weird silvery humanoid thing instead of Chief Thunder.

2693
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:51,540
But pretty cool.

2694
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:55,540
And yeah, you can check it out on YouTube. They've got some footage of it.

2695
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:58,540
Killer Instinct prototype for Xbox 360.

2696
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:02,540
Yeah, you have to wonder if maybe at one point this could have been something we saw on the 360.

2697
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:09,540
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. It makes sense that they put it on Xbox One to kind of bolster up the lineup that they had coming out at launch.

2698
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:11,540
Makes sense.

2699
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:16,540
Alright. Let's see. Moving on to this. This is a game.

2700
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:19,540
It seems like between Battletoads and Killer Instinct.

2701
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:22,540
We've got a little segment here made up of retro games that people love.

2702
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:27,540
And I know a lot of people have a lot of love in their hearts for Earthbound.

2703
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:32,540
Or Mother, if you will. That series over in Japan which we knew as Earthbound.

2704
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:34,540
Well, did you know? I didn't know this.

2705
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:39,540
The game was apparently number 10 on the Wii U eShop charts last week.

2706
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:44,540
Higher than Zelda, A Link to the Past, Shovel Knight, and Super Mario Brothers.

2707
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:49,540
So I mean Earthbound is still performing. I mean this game that's years and years old still performing well today.

2708
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:54,540
Which is funny because it didn't perform so well when it was out in the States the first time.

2709
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,540
But that's neither here nor there.

2710
02:21:56,540 --> 02:22:02,540
Apparently, Fangamer had an upcoming documentary, CD book, and E-zine project on this.

2711
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:08,540
And it's doing very well. It's collecting over $200,000 with six days of its Kickstarter campaign left.

2712
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:16,540
So with the money, Fangamer is going to throw an Earthbound or Mother convention next summer.

2713
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:18,540
That's right. An Earthbound...

2714
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:21,540
Gonna pack up the tea bag or gear and head to the Earthbound convention, Jonas?

2715
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:29,540
Well, here's the thing. It is intentionally going to be a small event. Only about 450 attendees.

2716
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:32,540
300 of the tickets will be made available to backers first.

2717
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:36,540
And the rest of the 150 they're hoping won't sell out instantly.

2718
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:38,540
But they probably will. Let's be real.

2719
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,540
Where's this location supposed to be?

2720
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:44,540
I haven't seen it. I'm actually going to look here at the Kickstarter page to see where it's at.

2721
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:48,540
The convention was their stretch goal for $200,000.

2722
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:53,540
Oh, here it is. Tucson, Arizona at the Hilton Tucson East.

2723
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:57,540
You could drive it. That's a bitch of a drive. But you could do it.

2724
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:00,540
It's about a 10-11 hour drive to get to Tucson.

2725
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:01,540
Not bad.

2726
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:05,540
Think about it. I'm volunteering Jonas' service. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

2727
02:23:05,540 --> 02:23:09,540
But that would be fun. That would be fun.

2728
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:15,540
The main event, the Earthbound Bash. Two days of playing a 20-year-old RPG for charity.

2729
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:18,540
Oh, that's cool. They're doing it all for charity. Ticket price is $50.

2730
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,540
They're also going to have retro gaming rooms.

2731
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:24,540
Somebody's doing it, Jonas.

2732
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:30,540
Live music performances, panels, and more. That's really cool.

2733
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:34,540
I mean, even though it's going to be a small to-do, that's really cool for fans of Earthbound.

2734
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:37,540
Tucson, Arizona. That is an interesting place.

2735
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:38,540
When is the date supposedly?

2736
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:44,540
When is it? July 18th and 19th, 2015. Saturday and Sunday and a possible pre-party on Friday night.

2737
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:49,540
Summer convention in Tucson, Arizona.

2738
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:55,540
You will not be going outdoors during this time. I can guarantee you that. That is for damn sure.

2739
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:56,540
That sounds like fun.

2740
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:59,540
Would you go to an Earthbound convention, Dark Sakura? Would you consider that?

2741
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,540
I might.

2742
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:01,540
That might be fun.

2743
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:09,540
Let's see. If you need some special speakers, I know some people that have an affinity for Earthbound.

2744
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:11,540
I hear Bose makes good speakers.

2745
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:18,540
Alright, well Dark Sakura's going to do some speaking right now as she dives into the email bag.

2746
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:19,540
It's all sticky.

2747
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:21,540
Every week you guys email us.

2748
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:24,540
Participate at Orangelauntrader.com.

2749
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:27,540
If you want to participate with the show again, that's participate at Orangelauntrader.com.

2750
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:30,540
Well, I just got freaking logged out again, so whatever.

2751
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:33,540
It just keeps happening over and over. I'm sick of this.

2752
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:36,540
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

2753
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:39,540
I'm going to be replacing my iPad soon.

2754
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:42,540
Weren't you thinking about getting mine?

2755
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:45,540
No, I'm actually getting a MacBook Pro in two weeks.

2756
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,540
Oh, lucky you. That'll be fun. That'll be a lot of fun.

2757
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:53,540
Alright, well Dark Sakura's getting logged in there and you can send your emails if you want.

2758
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:55,540
Participate at Orangelauntrader.com.

2759
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:59,540
Remember, if you're a podcast listener, which thank you for checking out the show.

2760
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:03,540
I know you can't be in the live chat room and participate that way, but you can always email us.

2761
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:07,540
You can also tweet us. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2762
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:11,540
And you know what? We even read random messages sent to us on Facebook. We do.

2763
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:14,540
We don't always respond to every one of them, but we read them.

2764
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:17,540
Alright, well are we ready for the first of the mails?

2765
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:19,540
Alright, we are. There's more than one email tonight?

2766
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:20,540
There are two.

2767
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:22,540
Oh, and I looked earlier. There's just one. Alright.

2768
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:26,540
Hey guys and gals. IngramAV98 here.

2769
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:31,540
Once again, I keep putting off emailing and as a podcast listener, I don't get to enjoy the musical gifts.

2770
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:34,540
But you'd be still on us when there are no emails to read.

2771
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:41,540
As I listen, you're threatening the Star Wars music, so now this is the get out of jail free card?

2772
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:45,540
I was listening to another podcast and someone mentioned the subject of growing up.

2773
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:49,540
Now the hosts of kids are married or whatever and their gaming diets and habits have changed somewhat.

2774
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:53,540
It made me think how I have changed and what I look for when gaming.

2775
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:58,540
This of course led me to think about the future as I've never thought about stopping my gaming hobby.

2776
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:04,540
When I start a family, I hope to share this with my children and currently I share it with my girlfriend as she has a casual interest.

2777
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:15,540
I like to think that even when I hit retirement, I'll still be gaming, still schooling the kids on Halo 30 Super Gold Turbo Anniversary Edition on my YBox 1080.

2778
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:23,540
Gaming for a much older generation is not something anybody really talks about, but it is something we will probably face at some point.

2779
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:31,540
Sensibilities and priorities will change, but hopefully not our desire to explore, compete, or socialize, which is essentially the basic motivations behind gaming.

2780
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:38,540
Back in the UK, I know some care homes for the elderly introduced the Wii because of the motion controls and how it encourages more physical activity.

2781
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:43,540
In Japan, the DS XL was popular among pensioners as a way to keep the mind active.

2782
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:50,540
Have any of you thought about your gaming in the future? How huge will Jamie's gaming thought get in 20-30 years?

2783
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:57,540
Will Loki have retired because his game and its sequels are raking in the cash?

2784
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:00,540
And will Rob have started even more podcasts?

2785
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:10,540
We spend a lot of time thinking about where gaming is moving to in terms of an industry, but us gamers shape that in many ways.

2786
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:20,540
We don't really look at ourselves in that future. More importantly, will we still be able to listen to the show in 30 years, or will we have sold the movie rights to an aging Michael Bay for a blockbuster origin story?

2787
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:31,540
It's always great to hear you all in the community every week, so thanks for everything. And that's IngramAV98 from Dusseldorf.

2788
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:35,540
Rob Roberts stars in Don't Fuck With Me, Ferret.

2789
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:45,540
Well, I will go ahead and speak about the vault that Dan and I have actually talked about downsizing it, and then we actually had decent room for the vault, so now we're talking about rebuilding it.

2790
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:52,540
We're actually talking about how we can get every single video game system we own hooked up at the same time on Switch boxes.

2791
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:56,540
And if they will fit on those weird cube-shaped IKEA shelves.

2792
02:27:56,540 --> 02:28:05,540
So when our emailer asks about where are you going to be with gaming in 30 years, I mean, it's kind of like gaming is in your blood at this point.

2793
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:16,540
Whereas maybe you may not have as much as the physical shit, like if life causes you to have to downsize things or whatever, that's one thing, but there's always going to be that part of you that has an appreciation for games, right?

2794
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:22,540
I mean, that's kind of like what you and Dan sometimes bond over. I know Alan and I do.

2795
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:26,540
Well, we were long-distance dating. We played World of Warcraft a lot.

2796
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:35,540
Yeah, well, you know, when Dan and I first met each other online, our big bonding point was bad fanfiction.

2797
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:44,540
And we had our mutual love of anime. It was right when anime started to go kind of mainstream.

2798
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:51,540
And we would watch episodes of Ranma together on the VCR next to the computer.

2799
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:59,540
And Dragon Ball Z fan subs were the big thing, especially the Hekto fan subs. You old-school people should know this.

2800
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:06,540
But we also would talk about video games and whatnot. And when I moved out here, the first thing I unpacked was my Super Nintendo.

2801
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:11,540
And Dan was like, I'm in love, at least as far as my translation of it went.

2802
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:18,540
So, you know, that brought us together and we've been playing, we keep playing.

2803
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:23,540
We haven't really gotten many of the new, new things, but we're probably still going to keep playing together.

2804
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:26,540
At least our old games are still going to get some love.

2805
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:30,540
I think it's pretty impressive how fast technology progresses.

2806
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:34,540
So when you talk about gaming in 20 to 30 years, there's a few factors at play.

2807
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:39,540
I mean, like, if you go back 20 years, you're what? The 1990s?

2808
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:42,540
And I imagine most of our listeners are old enough where they remember the 1990s.

2809
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:46,540
You may have been a child during the 1990s, but you probably have some memories of the 90s.

2810
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:50,540
Such as when cell phones were the size of your face.

2811
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:55,540
Or they were just car phones because they were on a big brick that was in your car.

2812
02:29:55,540 --> 02:30:03,540
And now cell phones are stronger than like 50 of the computers from 20 years ago in the palm of your hand.

2813
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:06,540
I mean, that's how much technology has progressed in 20 years.

2814
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,540
So in 20 more years, think about that.

2815
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:12,540
You're going to have 20 times the power of the desktop computers in the palm of your hand.

2816
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:16,540
You know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's going to, the technology is going to keep progressing so rapidly.

2817
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:19,540
Like, who knows? And we always kind of joke here at OLR.

2818
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:22,540
Gaming always gets one step closer to the holodeck.

2819
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:28,540
But I kind of believe that. Like, I think there's a distinct possibility in 20 to 30 years.

2820
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:34,540
I mean, it may not be the way we imagine it on like sci-fi TV and stuff on like Star Trek.

2821
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:38,540
But I sort of think gaming is moving closer and closer to those sorts of experiences.

2822
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:40,540
I mean, look at the Oculus Rift.

2823
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:43,540
Look at a Luma Room and things like that.

2824
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:46,540
I mean, think about how much that's going to progress in just like 20 years.

2825
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:51,540
SSJ 100 Matt said, gaming 30 years from now, we'll still be waiting for Half-Life 3.

2826
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:55,540
And then Fifth Dream says, I remember the 70s firsthand.

2827
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:59,540
And all I had to say in response is this, I had an 8-track player.

2828
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:03,540
I could repair said 8-track player when I was three years old.

2829
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:05,540
So I could listen to my Muppets 8-track.

2830
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:09,540
See, I was born in 78, so I can't really say that I remember the 70s.

2831
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:10,540
But I sure remember the 80s.

2832
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:11,540
Baby.

2833
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:12,540
I sure remember the 80s.

2834
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:18,540
Let's see, Bobby Blackwell says, there's more computing power in your iPhone than there was on the space shuttle.

2835
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:23,540
So, so all that aside, I really do believe that gaming is getting one step closer to the holodeck.

2836
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:27,540
Let me give you an example of that it might not be what you think it is today.

2837
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:35,540
Speaking of remembering the 80s, big cartoon that they played a lot in the 80s, and they probably played a lot in the 60s and 70s, was the Jetsons.

2838
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:39,540
And one of the big things in the Jetsons was video phone calls.

2839
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,540
And remember, that was the wave of the future.

2840
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:44,540
And I remember reading about that in computing magazines in the 1980s.

2841
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:45,540
It was video phone calls.

2842
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:49,540
Someday you're going to be able to call people and you're going to see what they look like.

2843
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:54,540
You pick up your phone, you dial somebody, and you're going to see the video projected on the wall.

2844
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:56,540
Well, we have that.

2845
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:59,540
We have video calling in the palm of your hand.

2846
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,540
And no one cares.

2847
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:01,540
FaceTime.

2848
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:02,540
Skype.

2849
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:07,540
Well, some, we find, it's interesting.

2850
02:32:07,540 --> 02:32:12,540
Now that it's there, it's not as commonplace as maybe we thought it was on the Jetsons.

2851
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:13,540
Computers on your wrist.

2852
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:14,540
Yeah.

2853
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:16,540
It's, it's, right?

2854
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:21,540
Like, I find that people, instead of doing voice or video calls, what do they want to do?

2855
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,540
They want a text message.

2856
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:25,540
That ended up being, like, I don't, I don't need to be seen right now.

2857
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:26,540
I'll just text message.

2858
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:28,540
That seems to be the thing that most people opt for.

2859
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:32,540
However, look, you can't deny that FaceTime and Skype and all that stuff has its uses.

2860
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:36,540
Such as showing off a baby to a relative on the other coast.

2861
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:45,540
Or a deaf person being able to communicate, you know, more with, with folks over telephone technology.

2862
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:47,540
And so on, you know?

2863
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:52,540
Well, we even, now, again, I really don't talk about where I work.

2864
02:32:52,540 --> 02:33:01,540
But, I mean, we have it incorporated now with the technology where there are voice and guided recognition for the blind to use the devices.

2865
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:02,540
Yeah.

2866
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:03,540
You know?

2867
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:11,540
And then, conversely, we, there's also increased image improvement, you know, contrast change.

2868
02:33:11,540 --> 02:33:15,540
Different ways to make it easier for people who have poor vision or might be losing their vision.

2869
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:18,540
So, it's got graduated steps.

2870
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:24,540
And I think that we're going to see a lot more games come out down the line that are going to be more accessible for other people.

2871
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:25,540
Yeah.

2872
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:29,540
YYR in chat says smartphones really have changed everything.

2873
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:33,540
OLR didn't mention a new big game launch this week, Candy Crush Soda Saga.

2874
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:34,540
Who cares?

2875
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:36,540
Well, there's a good reason for that, YYR.

2876
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:37,540
But I know you understand.

2877
02:33:37,540 --> 02:33:38,540
Let's see.

2878
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:40,540
So, that's, yeah, wow.

2879
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:41,540
It's so, so interesting.

2880
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:48,540
Tigerclass says, do you think people will look back and remember the zeros or the nots or, you know, the first decade of the 2000s?

2881
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:49,540
Absolutely.

2882
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:50,540
20 years.

2883
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:52,540
What has to happen when the teenagers turn 30?

2884
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:55,540
That's when, that's why 90s retro stuff is so big right now.

2885
02:33:55,540 --> 02:33:57,540
The Backstreet Boys are on tour.

2886
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,540
The Spice Girls are on a reunion tour.

2887
02:33:59,540 --> 02:34:02,540
Because the 90s are hilarious again.

2888
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:04,540
And that will happen in the next decade.

2889
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:07,540
The first decade of the 21st century will be hilarious again.

2890
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:09,540
So, yes, it will absolutely come back.

2891
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,540
They always come in 20-year cycles.

2892
02:34:10,540 --> 02:34:11,540
Always.

2893
02:34:11,540 --> 02:34:12,540
It's like the boomerang.

2894
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:13,540
Mm-hmm.

2895
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:16,540
Anyway, there's so much more we could say on this.

2896
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:17,540
In the interest of time, I'm gonna move on.

2897
02:34:17,540 --> 02:34:25,540
But just the idea that our, the people that are grandparents today didn't necessarily grow up on games.

2898
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:26,540
Maybe some did.

2899
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:29,540
Maybe some, I mean, you're seeing it more and more the way we did.

2900
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:38,540
So, I think when we're older, I think you're gonna see that there is gaming that is catered to a senior generation that grew up with it.

2901
02:34:38,540 --> 02:34:43,540
When I'm 60, 70 years old, you bet your ass I'm gonna want to be catered to.

2902
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:45,540
We'll have our new version of Pixel Shits.

2903
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:48,540
It'll be called the Geritol Edition.

2904
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:51,540
That'll be called the Don't Shit while you're playing.

2905
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:56,540
That'll be called the Pixel Shits, you know, sponsored by Depends.

2906
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:58,540
So, we have one more email.

2907
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:00,540
And it's from Warrior Bob.

2908
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,540
Hi, Warrior Bob. I miss you.

2909
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:06,540
It is actually, it's called Haiku Fan Mail for episode 575.

2910
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:10,540
Oh, my God. How did we miss that?

2911
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:13,540
That it's, this is the Haiku episode 575.

2912
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:16,540
Warrior Bob, this is another thing we do a lot carefully.

2913
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:19,540
We do the Dream Games carefully and these are very carefully selected as well.

2914
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:26,540
Warrior Bob Gold Star email for that alone for reminding us that this is a Haiku episode of OLR.

2915
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:27,540
Thank you, Warrior Bob.

2916
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:30,540
And I would love if you would go back and repost this on our forums because that would be awesome.

2917
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:32,540
Or someone should.

2918
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:35,540
Alright, so, aw, thank you. I miss you.

2919
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:38,540
Well, I mean, I would have said that, but thank you for missing me, too.

2920
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:40,540
Anyway, congratulations.

2921
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:43,540
575, that is quite a lot.

2922
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:46,540
In honor of that, I thought I'd send an email written in Haiku.

2923
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:50,540
Oh, well, I guess since there aren't any nature words, it's a Senryu.

2924
02:35:50,540 --> 02:35:54,540
Hold on a second. Fuck, not how many syllables are in a Senryu.

2925
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:57,540
Moving on, that is a shitload of shows.

2926
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:02,540
For some perspective, when you first started, arcades still existed, but the iPhone did not.

2927
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:06,540
Some video games are marketed to children younger than this show.

2928
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:09,540
Why do you do that?

2929
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:13,540
The episode list on the OLR Wiki is like 10 feet long.

2930
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:18,540
500 more shows, you'll have more shows than miles walked by the Proclaimers.

2931
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:22,540
Pretty freaking good for a show named after the Mobomoga guy.

2932
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:24,540
Anyway, you rock, thanks, and keep up the great work.

2933
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:26,540
Reject false icons, Warrior Bob.

2934
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:28,540
That was an amazing email, thank you.

2935
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:30,540
You're my hero now.

2936
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,540
I know, that was so cool.

2937
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:34,540
You get, like, a double gold star. You get the double plus good gold star.

2938
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:39,540
I can't believe that I could have done a Fugu question of the week around the Haiku thing.

2939
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:41,540
You know I love me some Haikus. Oh, man.

2940
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:44,540
Haiku singular and plural. Watch your grammar.

2941
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:47,540
You who read the Japanese games of the week.

2942
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:48,540
Oh, shush.

2943
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:53,540
Some important follow-up notes here from the chat, by the way.

2944
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:57,540
Some things that, you know, we had screwed up a minute ago.

2945
02:36:57,540 --> 02:37:02,540
Okay, some folks pointing out the Earthbound convention being in Tucson, Arizona.

2946
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:04,540
There's a joke there.

2947
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:08,540
Tucson was one of the towns in Earthbound.

2948
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:12,540
So they are having the convention in Tucson.

2949
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:15,540
To which I say, well played.

2950
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:17,540
I see what you did there.

2951
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:20,540
I can't believe I didn't think of that. I give that credit to Fifth Dream for that.

2952
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:23,540
SSJ100 Matt said the N-Gage existed when the show started.

2953
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:24,540
Oh, God.

2954
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:26,540
And you know what? We had two.

2955
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:28,540
Now they're gone.

2956
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:30,540
The N-Gage was just coming out, I think.

2957
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:32,540
It was the taco phone.

2958
02:37:32,540 --> 02:37:35,540
I remember going to the E3. They had, like, Civilization on the N-Gage and I was crying.

2959
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:40,540
Why would you buy a phone that you can play games on? That's ridiculous.

2960
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:46,540
I remember going to that E3 and busting out my N-Gage.

2961
02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:52,540
And the guy running the poor chirpy, you know, and I mean chirpy as in crickets chirping,

2962
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:57,540
no one over there N-Gage area said, oh my God, someone has one.

2963
02:37:57,540 --> 02:38:02,540
And then they sold it after E3.

2964
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:04,540
So, yeah.

2965
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:09,540
Fifth Dream says talking in Haiku is pretty easy to do. I make it rhyme, too.

2966
02:38:10,540 --> 02:38:15,540
YYR says real sweet episode. Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. What is a Haiku?

2967
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:18,540
All right. All right. That's going to do it for e-mails.

2968
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:23,540
I got to play this because Bobby had sent this to me saying the link is pod safe.

2969
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:27,540
It's the AT&T ads from the 90s that predicted everything.

2970
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:31,540
So going back to the e-mail before a little bit, check this out.

2971
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:38,540
Have you ever borrowed a book from thousands of miles away?

2972
02:38:40,540 --> 02:38:42,540
Across the country.

2973
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:47,540
Without stopping for directions.

2974
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:52,540
Or sent someone a fax.

2975
02:38:54,540 --> 02:38:56,540
From the beach?

2976
02:38:56,540 --> 02:38:58,540
You will.

2977
02:38:58,540 --> 02:39:01,540
And the company that will bring it to you, AT&T.

2978
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:05,540
And there's like seven of these all together. I'm not going to play them all.

2979
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:08,540
But that commercial, by the way, from 1993.

2980
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:14,540
And you're looking at that stuff going, wow, that's just GPS they just showed there.

2981
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:17,540
And that wasn't a thing that we had in 93, but we do now.

2982
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:20,540
The borrowing the book from a thousand miles away.

2983
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:23,540
I mean e-books is certainly a thing.

2984
02:39:23,540 --> 02:39:25,540
Technically you can borrow from libraries.

2985
02:39:25,540 --> 02:39:29,540
Oh, and the Prime. The Amazon Prime has that whole loaning the books out.

2986
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:32,540
And Google Book has a lot of the old public domain books in there, right?

2987
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:34,540
So you can kind of do that.

2988
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:36,540
And then doing the fax from the beach.

2989
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:41,540
It could be a fax per se, but you kind of have something that nobody faxes anymore.

2990
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,540
No, you'd be surprised.

2991
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:44,540
It's a PDF.

2992
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:46,540
Doctor's office says fax a lot.

2993
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:49,540
There's tons of people that still fax. I don't know why.

2994
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:51,540
But there's an app for that.

2995
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:56,540
So yes, you can do it from your iPad while sitting on the beach with Wi-Fi. That's amazing.

2996
02:39:56,540 --> 02:39:59,540
And I guess AT&T did some of it.

2997
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:03,540
That's, wow.

2998
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:06,540
So look at the commercials today predicting the future.

2999
02:40:06,540 --> 02:40:09,540
Because that's where we'll be in 20 years, but maybe a little differently.

3000
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:11,540
Maybe a little differently.

3001
02:40:11,540 --> 02:40:13,540
Or it may not have the reception you think it was. Like the video calling.

3002
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:15,540
That was supposed to be the norm.

3003
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:18,540
You video call everybody, but that's not really the way it works.

3004
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:20,540
Anyway, good stuff.

3005
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:22,540
Thank you for the e-mail bag.

3006
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:26,540
If you want to send us a mail for a later week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

3007
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:31,540
It's time to get angry with the segment we do every week here called the FUs of the Week.

3008
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:33,540
And in 30 years, there will still be angst.

3009
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:08,540
The house is in really great condition, but the previous tenants had this thing for sticking sticky hooks on the wall.

3010
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:11,540
And I mean, they're fucking everywhere.

3011
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:14,540
I found sticky hooks where I didn't think sticky hooks should go.

3012
02:41:14,540 --> 02:41:18,540
They're just everywhere. I can't.

3013
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:22,540
And the sticky hooks are stuck and they pulled the paint with them.

3014
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:26,540
And I hate them. I hate them, Rob. I hate them.

3015
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:29,540
So you'll fix it. Don't worry. Fix it, Jamie. You'll fix it.

3016
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:31,540
Or fix it, Dan.

3017
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:32,540
Sticky hooks.

3018
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:34,540
FU sticky hooks.

3019
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:36,540
Uh, Loki.

3020
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:41,540
Uh, it's FU that, you know, gets into it.

3021
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:43,540
Aw, sorry to hear that. I hope they feel better.

3022
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:46,540
All right, now reminding Jonas that it is almost midnight on the East Coast.

3023
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:48,540
Your FUs of the Week, sir.

3024
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:52,540
FUs to bad drivers for causing me traffic from going,

3025
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:55,540
just going to pull something downtown, it should only take me like 20 minutes,

3026
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:57,540
because there's three accidents.

3027
02:41:57,540 --> 02:41:59,540
It took me an hour and 30 minutes to get to my destination,

3028
02:41:59,540 --> 02:42:02,540
so fuck you bad drivers for causing a lot of this ruckus.

3029
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:08,540
Fuck you to Carl's Jr. for taking 40 minutes just to get a meal done.

3030
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:10,540
40 minutes for a frickin' meal?

3031
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:11,540
Yeah.

3032
02:42:11,540 --> 02:42:13,540
Oh no. Hell no.

3033
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:17,540
Well, I'll keep my FUs short, so I'll just leave it at that for now.

3034
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:21,540
All right. I don't really have a serious FU of the Week,

3035
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:23,540
so I'll just give a tongue-in-cheek FU this week.

3036
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:26,540
I'm gonna say an FU to the Resistance, an Ingress,

3037
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:29,540
because, yeah, yeah, if you're a Smurf, I'm talking to you.

3038
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:30,540
You know it.

3039
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:33,540
Because we had all these beautiful enlightened fields.

3040
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:36,540
This level 14 player was in our neighborhood, and we helped.

3041
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:39,540
I gave him some gear, and he set up all these beautiful fields

3042
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:42,540
in the neighborhood of enlightenment everywhere.

3043
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:45,540
And, you know, one of these Smurfs came by today and knocked it all down,

3044
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:49,540
so FU. FU to how addicting that game is, that's Ingress on the iPhone.

3045
02:42:49,540 --> 02:42:52,540
I'm having a lot of fun playing it, and it gets me out and about.

3046
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:54,540
So I say that very tongue-in-cheek.

3047
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:57,540
I know there's some of you that play Resistance out there that listen,

3048
02:42:57,540 --> 02:43:01,540
but a fish shake in your direction.

3049
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:04,540
All right. Let's move on with a few more stories for you guys,

3050
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:05,540
and then we'll get to the calls.

3051
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:08,540
So 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype,

3052
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:09,540
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

3053
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:10,540
Loki.

3054
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:11,540
All right.

3055
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:14,540
So there's some more updates regarding Tales from the Borderlands,

3056
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:18,540
which is Telltale Games' take on the Borderlands series,

3057
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:23,540
and apparently they give a little context to what the game's gonna be about.

3058
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:27,540
I guess it revolves around two characters, Rise,

3059
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:30,540
which is kind of this, like, Handsome Jack wannabe.

3060
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:34,540
Kind of looks like Handsome Jack, but obviously it's not Handsome Jack.

3061
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:38,540
And Fiona, who's some sort of con artist.

3062
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:41,540
And looks like it takes place after Borderlands 2,

3063
02:43:41,540 --> 02:43:44,540
so it's not gonna be kind of a prequel-type thing.

3064
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:47,540
It looks pretty cool, just based off of, you know, what they were showing.

3065
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:50,540
I guess Zero Sum's gonna be the first episode,

3066
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:54,540
and I'm not seeing when that's supposed to be slated.

3067
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:59,540
I guess maybe before the end of this, before the year's up.

3068
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:03,540
They're saying $20 for the season, $5 per episode's gonna be on PlayStation 3,

3069
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:08,540
PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC and Mac.

3070
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:10,540
I guess PC and Mac's gonna be a little bit more expensive,

3071
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:14,540
$25 for the season.

3072
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,540
Oh, looks cool.

3073
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,540
Nolan North and Troy Baker in there.

3074
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:19,540
So I'm down.

3075
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:22,540
Nice. Very cool.

3076
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:28,540
All right, and one more story I have for you guys on a good charity drive,

3077
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:31,540
and this is one, like, if you've been on the internet in the past couple years

3078
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:33,540
in gaming culture, you've probably heard of this one.

3079
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:36,540
Desert Bus for Hope. That's right.

3080
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:39,540
You can visit their site, desertbus.org, and if you weren't aware,

3081
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:44,540
the eighth Desert Bus for Hope charity drive is underway right now.

3082
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:47,540
And the folks at Loading Ready Run, they actually sit down

3083
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:50,540
and they play Desert Bus for a long time.

3084
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:53,540
And if you've never heard of Desert Bus, this is an infamous game.

3085
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:59,540
It was from a Penn & Teller collection that was on the CDI? Question mark?

3086
02:44:59,540 --> 02:45:00,540
It was Sega CD.

3087
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:02,540
Was Sega CD? Oh, shit.

3088
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:04,540
But it was one of those CD platforms.

3089
02:45:04,540 --> 02:45:10,540
And Desert Bus, what you did, you drive a bus from Las Vegas to Tucson.

3090
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:12,540
They're going to the Earthbound Convention.

3091
02:45:12,540 --> 02:45:15,540
You're driving a bus from Las Vegas to Tucson in real time.

3092
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:19,540
So it's an eight-hour drive, and you drive the whole drive,

3093
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:22,540
and you get one point if you correctly do it.

3094
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:25,540
That's it. It's just a long stretch of desert road, and that's it.

3095
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:27,540
Of course, the bus kind of veers slightly to the right.

3096
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:29,540
Yeah, so you have to correct every once in a while,

3097
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:33,540
or you'll drive off the road and kill everybody on the bus in a big fire, I guess.

3098
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:34,540
So there you go.

3099
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:38,540
Well, no, if I remember correctly, if you crash, you have to wait for a tow truck,

3100
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:40,540
and then you wait to get towed back.

3101
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:45,540
So it's even worse if you crash.

3102
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:47,540
Don't crash.

3103
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:50,540
So if you want to check out people playing the game and see if they're going to crash or not,

3104
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:53,540
and donate money to a good cause, the Child's Play charity,

3105
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:56,540
you can check that out again, desertbus.org.

3106
02:45:56,540 --> 02:45:59,540
That's pretty cool. Good luck to those guys that are suffering through that game.

3107
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:00,540
But you know what?

3108
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:02,540
With all the shenanigans that go on with that

3109
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:04,540
and all the people on the Internet that are having fun with it,

3110
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:06,540
is there really that much torture?

3111
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:08,540
No, that's how they can do it every year.

3112
02:46:08,540 --> 02:46:10,540
So good times, good times.

3113
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:13,540
Congrats to all you guys doing a good thing there.

3114
02:46:13,540 --> 02:46:16,540
All right, that does it for the news right now.

3115
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:18,540
We are going to open up Skype line.

3116
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:20,540
It is time, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3117
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:23,540
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

3118
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:24,540
if you want to give us a call.

3119
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:26,540
I'm only going to keep this open for a little bit

3120
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:28,540
since we are already to midnight on the East Coast.

3121
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:30,540
So if you want to get in, get in soon.

3122
02:46:30,540 --> 02:46:35,540
Meanwhile, I believe we're going to say bye to DarkSakura,

3123
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:36,540
is about to go on her way out the door.

3124
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:38,540
She has to leave a little early tonight

3125
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:40,540
because you're house sitting on top of everything else

3126
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:41,540
that you're doing right now, right?

3127
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,540
I am.

3128
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:45,540
My friends George and Amanda went to the Disney half marathon,

3129
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:48,540
the Avengers half marathon thing.

3130
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:51,540
And so I said I would cat sit

3131
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:54,540
and so I get to go take care of Coconut and Nestle.

3132
02:46:54,540 --> 02:46:55,540
Fun.

3133
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:56,540
It's the kitty's names.

3134
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:57,540
Those are cute names.

3135
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:58,540
All right, so have fun.

3136
02:46:58,540 --> 02:47:00,540
And DarkSakura, before we let you go,

3137
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:03,540
your final thought for tonight to leave our listeners with?

3138
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:05,540
That's it.

3139
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,540
A deep sigh.

3140
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,540
A deep sigh for all of you.

3141
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:08,540
Again, if you want to give us a call,

3142
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:11,540
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype,

3143
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:12,540
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

3144
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:13,540
You know, I'm looking at the Twitter,

3145
02:47:13,540 --> 02:47:15,540
twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3146
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:16,540
I might need to scroll back a little more.

3147
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:20,540
But I am seeing some retweets and some love for PixelShits.

3148
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:23,540
And I'm seeing screenshots are hitting the internet.

3149
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:26,540
I'm almost thinking I need to do a Let's Play a little later.

3150
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:29,540
Do some streaming on Twitch TV.

3151
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:32,540
Make this hashtag go.

3152
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,540
What, PixelShits?

3153
02:47:33,540 --> 02:47:34,540
Hashtag PixelShit.

3154
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:35,540
Hashtag PixelShit.

3155
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:36,540
We did it for President Cat.

3156
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:38,540
We can do it for PixelShit.

3157
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:40,540
Except we actually got PixelShits.

3158
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:41,540
Anyway.

3159
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:43,540
PixelShits tournament.

3160
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:44,540
There's still time.

3161
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:46,540
We can do President Cat.

3162
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:49,540
If Joystick doesn't run an article on PixelShits tomorrow,

3163
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:51,540
we're doing something wrong, people.

3164
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:52,540
We're doing something wrong.

3165
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:53,540
All right.

3166
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:55,540
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype,

3167
02:47:55,540 --> 02:47:57,540
Orange Lounge Radio.

3168
02:47:57,540 --> 02:48:00,540
Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories

3169
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:03,540
while I look at the Twitter feed for stuff before the PixelShits.

3170
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:08,540
I'm kind of distracted because there's still people streaming footage.

3171
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:11,540
Well, I'm not actually streaming it, but look at the screenshots.

3172
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:14,540
Footage from the next-gen version of, or I'm sorry,

3173
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:18,540
current-gen version of Grand Theft Auto V.

3174
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:20,540
Oh, it looks so nice.

3175
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:24,540
And apparently, they even had, I don't know,

3176
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:26,540
the first-person stuff's pretty crazy.

3177
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:28,540
Now, this is kind of funny.

3178
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:33,540
Say you want to take your PlayStation TV and make it portable.

3179
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:37,540
Well, they have a thing that you can plug it into to do that.

3180
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:39,540
It's called the Decavita 7.

3181
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:43,540
It's a seven-inch screen that you can plug the Vita TV into the back of it

3182
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:48,540
and make an even bigger PlayStation Vita, and it makes it handheld.

3183
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:52,540
I actually want one of these, but not for that reason.

3184
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:53,540
Why?

3185
02:48:53,540 --> 02:48:56,540
Because remember, I was trying to make a second-screen portable system

3186
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:59,540
to work with any sort of game system,

3187
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:01,540
and so guess what I could do with this?

3188
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:03,540
Because it has an HDMI in.

3189
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:06,540
It has power coming out of it.

3190
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:11,540
I can make my system and just run it through a Cronus Max

3191
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:16,540
to map the controls over to the Bluetooth from a PlayStation 3 controller,

3192
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:18,540
and away I go.

3193
02:49:18,540 --> 02:49:22,540
I've got a system that works second-screen for Xbox 360,

3194
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:24,540
Xbox One, whatever I want.

3195
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:26,540
So I'm going to pick one of those up.

3196
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:28,540
Maybe it's $200, though, if you're interested.

3197
02:49:28,540 --> 02:49:30,540
It's coming out next year.

3198
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:32,540
So it looks kind of cool.

3199
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:34,540
All right, I'm going to put a last call for calls.

3200
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:36,540
If you want to participate, talk about anything we've talked about tonight

3201
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:39,540
or bring up something maybe we didn't discuss,

3202
02:49:39,540 --> 02:49:41,540
at least we have YYR on earlier in the show.

3203
02:49:41,540 --> 02:49:43,540
We got to talk to somebody on Skype tonight.

3204
02:49:43,540 --> 02:49:46,540
I have nothing else, but we'll give one more chance for those calls.

3205
02:49:46,540 --> 02:49:47,540
Loki?

3206
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:51,540
And then the other thing is say you want to pick up those Amiibos and stuff,

3207
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:54,540
if you're not sure, you know, if you want to drop all the money.

3208
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:57,540
Apparently Nintendo has teamed up with Loot Crate to offer

3209
02:49:57,540 --> 02:50:03,540
some sort of Loot Crate edition that's going to feature Amiibo figures.

3210
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:05,540
It's still like 100 bucks or something.

3211
02:50:05,540 --> 02:50:06,540
It's ridiculous.

3212
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:08,540
It's not that great a deal.

3213
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:10,540
More expensive than buying them separate, I don't know.

3214
02:50:10,540 --> 02:50:11,540
Yeah, right.

3215
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:13,540
All right, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

3216
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:15,540
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3217
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:16,540
Hey, this is Azor Man.

3218
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:18,540
I'm sorry, say that again.

3219
02:50:18,540 --> 02:50:19,540
Azor Man.

3220
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:20,540
Azor Man, what's up?

3221
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:26,540
Yeah, I was listening to the show earlier about the Pixel Shits.

3222
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,540
Yes, that is the game.

3223
02:50:28,540 --> 02:50:31,540
Yeah, what do you want to say about Pixel Shits?

3224
02:50:31,540 --> 02:50:38,540
I was just wondering if, like, is Loki now inspired to do any type of, like, you know,

3225
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:44,540
Pixel Shit X game for, like, Orange Launch Radio?

3226
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:50,540
Loki, have you been inspired by Pixel Shits for your own creations that you're creating?

3227
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:55,540
No, but it does remind me that, like, you know, a lot of really great games are simple,

3228
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:58,540
and, you know, kind of what I'm doing right now is really complicated.

3229
02:50:58,540 --> 02:51:02,540
In fact, I, like, earlier this week, I had, you know, I'd gotten to the,

3230
02:51:02,540 --> 02:51:05,540
I'd been working on my editor to make stuff,

3231
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:10,540
and I'd gotten it finished to the point where all my brushes were sort of working,

3232
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:17,540
and I was messing around with it, but then I realized that it's not as optimized as I want it to be,

3233
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:21,540
and I got really frustrated and kind of just kind of said, you know,

3234
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:23,540
Fuck, am I going to have to start over again?

3235
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:28,540
You know, and so I kind of contemplated that, and I may start over again on it.

3236
02:51:28,540 --> 02:51:34,540
I just need to tweak a few things and do some stuff that I didn't want to have to do,

3237
02:51:34,540 --> 02:51:37,540
but now I'm going to do, I guess, if that makes sense.

3238
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:40,540
But, yeah, something like this would be fun where, you know, yeah,

3239
02:51:40,540 --> 02:51:45,540
you could take a concept like this and make it really fast, and it's still fun,

3240
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:49,540
and that's, you kind of, you know, with all the games that come out nowadays,

3241
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:52,540
with all the features and stuff, and you kind of forget that, hey, you know,

3242
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:57,540
the stuff that you used to enjoy was actually really simple, so I don't know.

3243
02:51:57,540 --> 02:51:59,540
That's a, you know what, that's an awesome lesson,

3244
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:04,540
and I think if I was YYR, I'd be very happy to know that, you know,

3245
02:52:04,540 --> 02:52:09,540
you kind of remind people of that, is that sometimes the silly, simple ideas

3246
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:10,540
are really, truly all the best.

3247
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:13,540
Look at Flappy Bird, perfect example, Flappy Bird. Extremely simple game.

3248
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:14,540
Yeah.

3249
02:52:14,540 --> 02:52:16,540
And that's, you know, you could have had something like that easily,

3250
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:18,540
like on an Atari or something like that.

3251
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:21,540
Even Minecraft, I mean, not to say Minecraft is simple,

3252
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:24,540
because there's definitely a very complex layer underneath it,

3253
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:28,540
but the concept is really basic.

3254
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:31,540
You know, it's moving cubes in a 3D space, essentially.

3255
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:33,540
Yeah, there's other things you do with it, rail cars and stuff too,

3256
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:36,540
but Minecraft's kind of a stupidly simple game too.

3257
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:40,540
Yeah, I was looking at that as well, and then like,

3258
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:47,540
it just seems that maybe something simple like that would come out,

3259
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:49,540
you know, with some lokis, like, you know,

3260
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:52,540
like it's clanking around, making these new games,

3261
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:54,540
because I remember you were starting with this like last year, right?

3262
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:58,540
I started trying to learn how to program last year.

3263
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:00,540
Right, I remember the whole process.

3264
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:03,540
I was just wondering if that soon comes out,

3265
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:05,540
because now this guy, Aaron, came out with this game,

3266
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:06,540
it would just be cool.

3267
02:53:06,540 --> 02:53:08,540
Maybe, I don't know,

3268
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:11,540
Orange Lawn's radio game should maybe come out soon, don't you think?

3269
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:16,540
You know, I've toyed with an idea like that before,

3270
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:19,540
but that was back when I was thinking of RPG Maker and stuff,

3271
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:22,540
but our caller here is a manager in training, look at that.

3272
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:24,540
Don't you think you're going to do this?

3273
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:25,540
I listen to you guys a lot,

3274
02:53:25,540 --> 02:53:27,540
and like I don't really speak too much of the chat,

3275
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,540
but like it's been over a decade.

3276
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:30,540
It's like hearing you guys talk about this,

3277
02:53:30,540 --> 02:53:31,540
like hearing him talk about it last year,

3278
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:34,540
and then like now there's like absolutely something he's creating.

3279
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:37,540
I'm just like eager to like see something of it.

3280
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:39,540
Yeah, and I'm eager to have something to show.

3281
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:42,540
You're slower than Duke Nukem Forever is what the caller's trying to say.

3282
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:45,540
Well, the problem is it's hard just making the engine,

3283
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:46,540
because it's from scratch,

3284
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:49,540
and unfortunately, see, I was trying to keep it away

3285
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:52,540
from like being like a straight up voxel engine,

3286
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:54,540
because, you know, all the voxel engines out there they have,

3287
02:53:54,540 --> 02:53:56,540
you know, you have your voxels, you have your chunks,

3288
02:53:56,540 --> 02:53:59,540
and, you know, that's how you load data and stuff,

3289
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:03,540
and, you know, with Unity, the problem I ran into was

3290
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:05,540
I could put all these blocks down,

3291
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:08,540
but when I had my thing checking for, you know,

3292
02:54:08,540 --> 02:54:10,540
what neighbors were next to, you know,

3293
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:12,540
so if I have a cube next to a cube,

3294
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:15,540
I don't draw the sides that are, you know, hidden,

3295
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:16,540
basically, in the geometry,

3296
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:19,540
but those checks were taking so long,

3297
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:22,540
once I got a lot of, you know, blocks on the screen,

3298
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:23,540
you know, I'd put one down,

3299
02:54:23,540 --> 02:54:26,540
and I'd wait a few seconds before it unlocked again,

3300
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:28,540
and that's the problem,

3301
02:54:28,540 --> 02:54:30,540
is I have to find a more efficient way to do that,

3302
02:54:30,540 --> 02:54:34,540
and so, unfortunately, I'm probably going to have to create

3303
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:37,540
some sort of chunk system in order to get that to work,

3304
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:39,540
so that it's not, you know, looking for something.

3305
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:41,540
I apologize if you may have a blog or anything,

3306
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:43,540
like your troubles?

3307
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:45,540
No, this is his blog.

3308
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:47,540
Yeah, that's the other thing, too.

3309
02:54:47,540 --> 02:54:48,540
I need to create a dev blog,

3310
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:50,540
because I have a website now,

3311
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:53,540
but I haven't done any of that.

3312
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:57,540
The Loki game is going to end up like Titan.

3313
02:54:57,540 --> 02:54:59,540
He's going to work on it for seven years,

3314
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:01,540
and then throw it all out and be like,

3315
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:03,540
ah, I should have just made Team Fortress 2.

3316
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:06,540
No, no, no.

3317
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:08,540
All right, going to the chat,

3318
02:55:08,540 --> 02:55:10,540
because you know the chat room is having a field day with this,

3319
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:11,540
Bobby Blackwolf saying,

3320
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:13,540
Loki game is vaporware.

3321
02:55:13,540 --> 02:55:15,540
AkumaJP, Loki forever.

3322
02:55:15,540 --> 02:55:17,540
Act F to Loki ghost.

3323
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:20,540
I have stuff.

3324
02:55:20,540 --> 02:55:23,540
I put, I posted images from the editor the other,

3325
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:25,540
it was like last week.

3326
02:55:25,540 --> 02:55:26,540
We're eagerly awaiting it.

3327
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:29,540
Maybe YYR can do some consulting with you for a small fee.

3328
02:55:33,540 --> 02:55:34,540
It's just figuring it out.

3329
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:36,540
But I learned, see that's the thing though,

3330
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:37,540
is I learned based on, you know,

3331
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:39,540
you do it wrong and you learn the right way to do it.

3332
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:40,540
That's right.

3333
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:42,540
Chatters, let's start taking bets.

3334
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:43,540
What will we see first?

3335
02:55:43,540 --> 02:55:45,540
Loki's game or Half-Life 3?

3336
02:55:45,540 --> 02:55:46,540
What will we see first?

3337
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,540
That's so wrong.

3338
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:49,540
All right.

3339
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:50,540
Thank you so much for the call.

3340
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:53,540
Anytime we can razz Loki out of a call, I appreciate it.

3341
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:54,540
And I really appreciate the support.

3342
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:56,540
A decade of listening to the show.

3343
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:57,540
That's amazing.

3344
02:55:57,540 --> 02:55:58,540
You rock.

3345
02:55:58,540 --> 02:55:59,540
Good.

3346
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:00,540
Thank you a lot.

3347
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:01,540
All right.

3348
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:02,540
Take care, my friend.

3349
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:04,540
All righty.

3350
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:06,540
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3351
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,540
Or use your name on Skype.

3352
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:08,540
Orange Lounge Radio.

3353
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:09,540
If you'd like to give us a call,

3354
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:11,540
I'll leave it open for just a little bit.

3355
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:13,540
Did you have any other last minute stories here?

3356
02:56:13,540 --> 02:56:15,540
I forgot that this is actually a VCD.

3357
02:56:15,540 --> 02:56:16,540
This isn't even a DVD.

3358
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:18,540
Oh, the thing that you loaned Jamie that she brought back?

3359
02:56:18,540 --> 02:56:19,540
She could have kept it.

3360
02:56:19,540 --> 02:56:20,540
I don't even want it anymore.

3361
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:21,540
Tell Liz it.

3362
02:56:21,540 --> 02:56:22,540
What is this?

3363
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:23,540
She found some-

3364
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:24,540
I don't remember what it was.

3365
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:25,540
Para Para Para.

3366
02:56:25,540 --> 02:56:26,540
Excuse me.

3367
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:27,540
Para Para Dance.

3368
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:32,540
It's a VCD, which means the resolution on it's gonna be shitty.

3369
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:33,540
That's like 300 by 200.

3370
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:34,540
What is it?

3371
02:56:34,540 --> 02:56:35,540
It's just like concert.

3372
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:37,540
VCDs are like disc versions of VHS.

3373
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:38,540
They're crap.

3374
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:42,540
No, it was, if I remember correctly, I don't remember what it's about.

3375
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:43,540
To be honest, it was-

3376
02:56:43,540 --> 02:56:44,540
Well, let's be real.

3377
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:45,540
The plot probably wasn't important.

3378
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:49,540
No, it's about obviously Para Para.

3379
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:54,540
I just don't remember why I bought it, because obviously I thought it was funny for a reason.

3380
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:57,540
You know, that's why I bought it, but I don't know.

3381
02:56:57,540 --> 02:57:04,540
Alright, well, it looks like the phones aren't lighting up, so I'm gonna go ahead and close down the phones so we can wrap up the show for the night.

3382
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:06,540
Jonas, thanks for joining us.

3383
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:11,540
Sorry we didn't get to talk to you more tonight, but you know, when an OLR dream game gets released, it's gonna-

3384
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:14,540
But I'm glad you could be here for the unveiling of Pixel Shits.

3385
02:57:15,540 --> 02:57:17,540
That's gonna be a holy shit moment.

3386
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:24,540
Tell us a little more once again, what can we expect T-Bagger, the big anime game room to be up to, and what cons are you going to next?

3387
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:29,540
We're actually gonna be starting to do some streaming at random days now, so-

3388
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:30,540
Nice.

3389
02:57:30,540 --> 02:57:36,540
Because we had a streaming on Friday for doing just random games, to show that we just play other games outside of the common games.

3390
02:57:36,540 --> 02:57:43,540
Because there's a bunch of games out there, but we're not gonna just keep playing the same ten games over and over and over.

3391
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:46,540
That's good, to show a little bit of variety.

3392
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:50,540
I mean, hey, we could probably do a Pixel Sh- a Pixel Shit stream.

3393
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:58,540
I'm telling you, I want everybody within the sound of my voice to do a Twitch TV stream for Pixel Shits this week.

3394
02:57:58,540 --> 02:57:59,540
I'll take fifteen minutes.

3395
02:57:59,540 --> 02:58:07,540
You know, even though I don't really follow it too much anymore, can we get like, you know, maybe Pixel Shits and Omega-Thon or something like that?

3396
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:10,540
That would be awesome.

3397
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:11,540
Awesome.

3398
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:15,540
But yeah, that's just something new we're adding to the plate and stuff.

3399
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:18,540
Alright. Where can folks find your Twitch channel if they want to check that out?

3400
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:23,540
Oh, twitch.tv slash TBAGR underscore TV.

3401
02:58:23,540 --> 02:58:31,540
Okay, TBAGR underscore TV. Awesome. I'll make sure I friend you on Twitch, because I'm not sure you're my friend yet. Or follower, whatever it's called.

3402
02:58:31,540 --> 02:58:39,540
And also, because YouTube can do 60 frames a second videos nowadays, we're playing on doing videos that are gonna be 60 frames a second at 1080p.

3403
02:58:39,540 --> 02:58:40,540
Nice.

3404
02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:44,540
Starting, actually, we're starting right now with the Pump It Up videos.

3405
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:45,540
Nice.

3406
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:47,540
Which I still need to finish.

3407
02:58:47,540 --> 02:58:56,540
Alright. Congrats once again on your amazing show. I mean, second place in the US for Pump It Up's freestyle. That blows my mind.

3408
02:58:56,540 --> 02:59:02,540
You're like one of those Starcraft all-stars that I saw at Blizzard last week, except you play with your feet.

3409
02:59:02,540 --> 02:59:04,540
You dance. You're a dancer.

3410
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:07,540
Alright, too bad it's a radio show and we can't make you show everybody your moves.

3411
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:09,540
No problem.

3412
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:11,540
The videos will be on YouTube.

3413
02:59:11,540 --> 02:59:12,540
Alright, sounds good.

3414
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:13,540
Hopefully this week.

3415
02:59:13,540 --> 02:59:17,540
Sounds good. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

3416
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:19,540
Oh, it's good to be back again.

3417
02:59:19,540 --> 02:59:20,540
It's good to have you.

3418
02:59:20,540 --> 02:59:26,540
And finally not actually have too much on my mind, just a competition. I was like, okay, I can go back playing video games again.

3419
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:34,540
You can just take it easy. That's right. You know what? A lot of the big stuff I had going on in my life has finally calmed down.

3420
02:59:34,540 --> 02:59:39,540
And so, yeah, I'm starting to get weekends where I'm like, alright, I get to play video games.

3421
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:45,540
And with Thanksgiving coming up, that's going to be a huge catch-up weekend for me. I'm so excited. You don't even know.

3422
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:49,540
That'll be the weekend that finally I get suckered into going back to, wow, just wait for it.

3423
02:59:49,540 --> 02:59:54,540
Alright, let's see. I want to thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

3424
02:59:54,540 --> 03:00:00,540
Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you like the show, always say tell a friend or two or five about the show.

3425
03:00:00,540 --> 03:00:02,540
Help spread the word because that's all we got.

3426
03:00:02,540 --> 03:00:09,540
We didn't have some huge website back in us. I don't have the money to throw to rent a hall in Vegas and try to find some sponsors.

3427
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:13,540
I'd love it if we did, but we don't. We really rely on your word of mouth. That's all we ask.

3428
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:19,540
So thank you guys. Let's get the last final thoughts here. Loki, your final thought tonight?

3429
03:00:19,540 --> 03:00:25,540
A couple of things. First off, Grand Theft Auto looks awesome. Second thing, apparently Far Cry 4,

3430
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:34,540
you may not see the PC reviews soon because they have not given codes to anybody that's reviewing the game

3431
03:00:34,540 --> 03:00:39,540
because there's going to be a day one patch and it won't be up until Monday.

3432
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:43,540
And so same thing happened with Unity.

3433
03:00:43,540 --> 03:00:44,540
Interesting.

3434
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:46,540
Just giving you a warning. Although on console, though, apparently really good.

3435
03:00:46,540 --> 03:00:50,540
So hopefully that's still the case on PC, but buyer beware.

3436
03:00:50,540 --> 03:00:57,540
Interesting. All right. And my final thought is, you know, I just every week, I'm so humbled by the support you guys give us.

3437
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:02,540
I mean, from the fan games created by something someone said off the cusp

3438
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:07,540
to the fact that some of you have literally grown up with the show listening for over a decade.

3439
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:10,540
I'm just I'm so humbled. And thank you guys so much.

3440
03:01:10,540 --> 03:01:17,540
And, you know, to kind of build on that email we got earlier, you know, gaming and the culture and everything,

3441
03:01:17,540 --> 03:01:24,540
even when there's stuff that pisses us off. And this year there's been a lot of stuff that got really heated.

3442
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:28,540
Let's put it that way. Even when a lot of that stuff is going on, you know, at the end of the day,

3443
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:30,540
this gaming culture and everything, this is this is stuff that's in my blood.

3444
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:38,540
And I'm so happy and fortunate to have this place to lend my voice every week.

3445
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:43,540
And the fact that even one of you listens and gives a shit means so much.

3446
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:45,540
So, you know, we're going to keep doing it.

3447
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:53,540
The idea that I'm going to have five more podcasts in 50 years, probably not too far from the truth.

3448
03:01:53,540 --> 03:01:57,540
So that's it. Have a great week, everybody. Thank you so much.

3449
03:01:57,540 --> 03:02:03,540
And we will see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

3450
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:07,540
