Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight is a very special number for us and we'll explain why. Also, there's PlayStation updates galore for both the firmware and a popular game on the console. Did they do harm as well as good? Find out next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 2nd of 2014, episode number 573 of our program. That is a number with some special significance, but I will get into that in just a moment.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First, let's go around and introduce ourselves. My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle every week with my co-host. Say hello over there. Welcome back. She was out last week, but she's back this week. DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers?

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Moving is shit.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Moving is shit. But it's done.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I now live in Grandpa's house.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I wasn't going to say last week, but so yeah.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's fine. I live in Grandpa's house.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Not the house he's living in, but the other house that he lived in.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right now it's still Grandpa's house, but it will be our house.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Funny how all that VoG network stuff kind of comes together in the end.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, now it involves real estate.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I love how you were like, you should come over and see my place, except well you've already seen it.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've already been there.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I like this. I love this. You're the one that moves, yet you brought me a housewarming gift tonight.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I believe the listeners should be clued in to what it is.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Bitch, I made that for me. I'm just sharing with you.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So what is this that you brought?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's hooch.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a peace offering.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's Jamie Hooch.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, it's not actually hooch because I didn't, you know, make make it.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Not like out of juicy juice and some yeast on an air conditioner or something like my friend Roy used to do.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's Blackberry Manischewitz, Coin Tro, which is a really good expensive orange liqueur, pomegranate vodka, brandy, and then this really good lime juice and sugar cane mixer.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Normally this stuff is like way expensive. I got a really good deal. I mean, you can drink this stuff straight. It's so good.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So if I sound a little out of it or disconnected tonight, now you know why. It's Jamie's fault. So there you go.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Grandpa came over here on Wednesday. He didn't bring me hooch. You would expect that drunkard to bring me hooch, but you brought me hooch.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You won't bring you hooch because he was busy drinking it.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's true. That's very true.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, I had some in the car. It's gone now. We let Victoria drive.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I appreciate that and happy move to you and may you get all settled in and all that.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Midna is ecstatic. I thought she was going to move into her litter box for a year like Shermy did.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh no. That cat's like sniff, sniff. I'm home. Let me shed on everything.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Nice.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so she also has learned how to headbutt the cabinets in the bathroom to get them open.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah. Our cat learned how to open doors too. That was interesting.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know how like sometimes if you don't push a door all the way, it might be closed, but not be like latched.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I learned that if you don't push them all the way, she'll headbutt her way in the room.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mine will be shut all the way and she'll be like, boom, boom.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then when the door to the bedroom is closed, you like see little black paws peeking out like, Mom.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right. Well, also an owner of some cats who I'm sure has stories to contribute to this conversation.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thankfully only one cat, but she tried to learn how to open doorknobs.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She knows that the doorknob is what opens the door and she'll paw at it, but she has no way to grab the doorknob.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
See, if we were dumb and had those, you know, doorknobs that have like the kind of handle on them.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, she'd be going through the house wherever she wants.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's an interesting thing we all have in common. We all only have one cat.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But here's the thing, though, is I put a cat door in my garage and she stays out in the garage now.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She, because we have our old sofa out there, she just snaps on the sofa all day long.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Tiger call on our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And Tiger call on our chat says, maybe you can teach the cats how to use the toilets properly.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They just need to learn how to flush.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've seen the kits. No, I'm not going to do that.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The first thing when we moved into this house that caught me off guard is that Sanrio started drinking from the toilet.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And that was nothing, that never happened in the old place.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But like in this place, yeah, Sanrio, I caught her one day, I was like, what are you doing? Don't do that.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And Alan's like, well, it's fresh water. And I'm like, ew.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not really fresh water.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not really.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, yeah, that was one of those quick lessons, even though two men live here, to keep the seat down at all times.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All right. Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I'm going to get into tonight's kickoff topic by giving you guys a little background and a reintroduction to Orange Lounge Radio.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
As I like to do every few months, as I know, we're fortunate enough being in a podcast that has a pretty decent-sized listener base.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you guys very much for your support.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We do get new listeners every now and again.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So just a reintroduction of our show.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The three of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, we all met actually at an arcade playing a little video game at the time called Dance Dance Revolution.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And Dance Dance Revolution, of course, was a video game that was made by Konami that was part of their Bimani series, or beat mania, if you will, or beat matching types of video games.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And there was a whole sorts, and I'm giving this really kind of Cliffs Notes version of it.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Some of you guys that have been music game enthusiasts for a long time will know that I'm cutting corners here, but bear with me for the sake of showtime.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There were a lot of other games involved in this too.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BeatMania 2DX, Guitar Freaks, which was before Guitar Hero, and so on.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we used to gather at a local arcade here known as Roseville Golf Land, and we would play the game.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know, coin up on the machine whose turn it's going to be, play the game.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sometimes we travel to the Bay Area to meet up with friends there and play the game there.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then we might, you know, when the home version started coming out, we learned how to mod our PS1s, either with a paperclip or for a little cartridge that went in the back, or the disc swap trick, or whatever it is used.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So we could play the import Bimani games like DDR Third Mix and have like little house parties and so forth.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And most importantly, after these Golf Land parties, we would play Dance Dance Revolution, we would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And we all sit together and just, you know, get to know each other a little more through talking shit about one of our favorite pastimes, video games.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And so that's what OLR essentially became, is it was this big meeting at the dinner table inviting all you guys to chomp on some mozzarella sticks.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And now you know why we talk about food so much.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Right, right, exactly. To chomp on some mozzarella sticks or whatever it is that's going to make you fat and talk some smack about video games with us at the world's biggest diner table.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's what OLR is.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now Orange Land Radio started exclusively dedicated to the music gaming community.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Although a good 90% of that was Bimani in that series.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But certainly there's a lot of love for the Bust a Move, Bust a Groove series depending on what country you're in.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Parappa the Rappa, Vibribin, which we got all excited about with the re-release a couple weeks ago, right?

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Even In the Groove in the later years of the show being a Bimani exclusive sort of thing.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Now when things sort of slowed down in the DDR community and the arcade scene unfortunately started to take a little bit of a tumble as Xbox Live and these sorts of things are gaining more and more precedence.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We had started originally a spin-off podcast dedicated to all video games at large because we kind of all sat down and realized, you know what?

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We love video games most of all.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like our love of music games is a part of that, yes, and that's something we all have in common.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But we all love video games.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Dark Sakura has a gigantic vault with all sorts of crazy ass import games.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's already being rebuilt as we speak.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I have a deep love of PC gaming and things that date back to the Commodore 64 and Atari 2600 and some prior radio experience from college and so forth.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Loki likes to get in there and break shit and mod shit.

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He likes to take the video game and make it his own.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And now he's programming his own game.

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So that's kind of where we are today.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
At some point we made our general show about video games, kind of the overarching show.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And that's the same show you're listening to today.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
573 episodes later after episode number one in June of 2002.

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So why do I give you this big ass backstory?

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because the number 573 holds some significance if you're a fan of these Beatmania and Bamani games.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Dark Sakura, would you care to elaborate with our audience a little bit?

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What's so special about 573?

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, to give you a small Japanese lesson.

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
First of all, there are two different ways of listing numbers in Japanese.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
For standard, you know, everyday counting, you have like Hitotsu for one.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The word for three would be Mitsu instead of San.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was like, grammar, Japanese words.

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's fine. I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But the rest of them are basically we have Go for five, Nana for seven.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then Mi for Mitsu for three.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So Go, Na, Mi, Konami.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yep.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So 573, Go, Nana, Mi.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And so you see that number oftentimes as little jokes in a lot of Konami games.

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Like I remember recently I was playing on Virtual Console on Super Nintendo.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or sorry, it was a Super Nintendo game originally, but I was playing it on Wii U.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And you remember how Legend of the Mystical Ninja had all these little houses with minigames,

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and one of them was the quiz show?

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, it asked a question and the answers were one, two, or 573.

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like that number makes no sense.

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But now looking back, it's like, oh, that was their little in-joke for the little Konami.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How about something else too?

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you know that Mitsubishi stands for three of those little diamond shapes?

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So three diamonds.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Interesting.

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Isn't Namco have a similar story behind it?

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I wasn't sure.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The words.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think so.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think there's a similar thing going on there.

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But anyway.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And some of the arcade hardware that games like DDR and so forth ran on.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So System 573.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, it was System 573.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So, you know, even though, you know, I don't want you guys to think we have a bias towards Konami.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because in some ways, our love of those series makes us hold their feet to the flame even more.

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like, you know, I'm kind of sad that DDR kind of isn't what it used to be.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But like all things, it's, you know, kind of come and gone and had its thing.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But yeah, Jamie?

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Actually, Act of Death said high scores in a lot of Konami games have 57,300 is the high score.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes, yes.

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Very, very good point.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So yeah.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The interesting thing is 765 according to Dark Tetsuya.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There you go.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So yeah, there's, you know, a lot of those sorts of jokes and everything.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But, you know, we obviously, if it weren't for this series of games, this show wouldn't exist.

160
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Plain and simple.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean, I don't know if I would have ever met Loki or Dark Soccer.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, maybe, you know, nerds are kind of a small circle.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe at a con somewhere down the line.

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But things probably wouldn't have played out the way they did.

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'd be throwing stuff at you at Rocky.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, right?

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You probably would have found me that way eventually.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I would have found you through Rocky.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who knows? Who knows?

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like, it would just be like a totally different circle.

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Like, so we do owe a lot to that, you know, despite the way things are 12 years later.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, we owe a lot to that.

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So here on this episode 573, we definitely want to tip our hat and say thank you to Bomani and the people that made it possible.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know, we made a lot of our friends through playing this game.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Some of them went to go on to work on the game.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You guys know Shane, one of my best friends.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's on the show a lot.

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He actually worked at Konami for a short while in some games.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We have a lot of friends at the show, people like Mel B and so forth.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What I had hoped to do tonight for episode 573 was try to get some of those people together and have a little bit of a party and reminisce a little bit.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Unfortunately, just everything I had going on in my personal life with my final Rocky Horror show after 16 years last week.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Or sorry, actually that was on Friday.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And BlizzCon coming up next week and Vegas a couple of weeks ago, it's just like this was the worst possible time for this number episode to have fallen for me personally.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So unfortunately we'll have to kind of just table some of that to a future episode.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Either something for like 20 November or maybe like episode 600 or something later down the line.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But we still want to make something like that happen in the future.

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I apologize, I couldn't make it happen tonight.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But you know, busy life.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And Flaco, didn't Flaco, well he was working at Konami, but I don't know if he worked on DDR.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah, he did work at Konami for a short time. I don't remember if he was DDR or not.

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I know the Winx was his big thing.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, I remember those stories.

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But yeah, that was part of it too.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So anyway, Dar Tetsuya actually compiled some of this stuff together about where is Bomani now.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So I thought we would take a walk down memory lane and catch up with our favorite music based video games.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you guys think? Do you even know where DDR is today you guys?

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't even.

198
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can't even possibly. Let's take a trip down memory lane.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
DDR 2014 is out in Japan. It's pretty much a software update, changing the interface and adding new songs.

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They do get events via EMUs, including things like Bomani Stadium, which had a baseball theme to it.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Each game in the Bomani series had its own team logo, and you could play special songs and charts.

202
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But if you want to play Extra Sage, you have to use Konami's pay-to-play service, Paselli.

203
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's the norm for releases in Japan nowadays, apparently.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
BeatMania 2DX is up to 2DX 22, or Pen Jewel.

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It has like a light-dark theme that switches between two time periods.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What time of day and the date that you play factors into some of the unlocks. That's kind of interesting.

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Some of the songs have a new difficulty chart to them called Legendaria with a little cross.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's actually a Coca-Cola Cross Bomani crossover in the game, and you unlock skins with different Coca-Cola brand logos.

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like there was a green lane cover with a Sprite logo on it. I had no idea that was a thing.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Did you know that you can have Soda branded 2DX lanes now, apparently?

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is there a Surge branded lane?

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe. One can only hope.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Pop and Music, as of the 21st game, they've stopped numbering them.

214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The one that's out now is Lapistoria.

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They've also stopped using genres for the song titles, but that's just for this new game.

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Guitar Freaks and Drummania is up to Gita Dora Overdrive.

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's no longer long version songs.

218
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Sorry, they were taken out at one point, and they just came back in Overdrive.

219
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So, that's that.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Dance Evolution, which is their take on the Kinect-style game.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They had that game as a Kinect launch game.

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's an arcade version in Japan.

223
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The arcade game got several song updates and some more crossovers from other Bomani games.

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
U-Beat, which a lot of people mispronounce Ju-Beat because it has a J, but the J is actually silent.

225
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's Yu-Beat.

226
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
U-Beat has a game called U-Beat Saucer for Film.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That was the last one they did there.

228
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Reflect Beat is up to Reflect Beat Groovin', which is like a music game in air hockey,

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and I believe that's out on the iPad if you want to try that out in iOS.

230
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And Sound Voltex is up to Sound Voltex 2.

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And there's a third installment that's been announced called Gravity Wars.

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So, Bomani ain't dead.

233
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's just a little different now than it used to be, and I kind of stopped following it as closely as I once did,

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
especially when they stopped releasing all the home versions.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like, do you know how bad I want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4?

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But then I realized I'm probably one of the only people that would want BeatMania 2DX on the PlayStation 3 or 4.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, they should do a digital version or something.

238
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You would think, or I don't know, but then how do you get the controller?

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Like, you could do it through PlayStation Now or something, but then how do you do the controller?

240
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Remember trying to play BeatMania 5 key with a PlayStation controller? Because you could do it.

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Not very well.

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And there's that horrible, horrible, horrible 360 remake of popin' music called Beat and Groovy

243
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that looked like it was literally half-finished when they released it, that you had to use the controller.

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There was no popin' music controller ever released for it.

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, there it is.

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, Bomani is dead, yo.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
BeatMania 2DX, 24 Doritos.

248
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, I mean, also Konami did a lot of downscaling, right?

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
They closed the office that was in the Bay Area.

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think they closed the one in Hawaii some time ago, right?

251
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's gone. And that's where a lot of the DDR was coming from stateside.

252
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So, you know, and you look at Konami now, and we've even joked about this in the past,

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
like, what do they have going right now besides Metal Gear and, you know, soccer?

254
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, P.T. came out of nowhere, to be fair.

255
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And P.T. looks pretty fuckin' amazing, which is Silent Hill, obviously.

256
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That looks pretty awesome.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But, you know, Konami isn't really crankin' out the games like it used to.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's the Kojima Soccer Machine.

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, it's the Kojima Soccer Company, in a way.

260
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They should really change the name.

261
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There you go. Do you guys have a, just before we get into some longer-form news

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and Housekeeping and all that and what we've been playing,

263
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
do you guys have, like, a favorite memory looking back on the years and years of O.L.R.,

264
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
especially the music game days?

265
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you have a memory of what kind of music games did for you?

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know. I just like coming to the parties. That was fun.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I was just here for the parties.

268
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Lugging my StepMania computer setup, you know, that was fun.

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I remember when you built a custom machine for Roseville Golf Land,

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and they had it for all of, like, a week.

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, then they charged me $300 in taxes for my work.

272
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, so awful. So awful.

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, they suck ass.

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because it was $1,000 for that machine to buy all the hardware for it and stuff,

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and they paid me for it, but then they also gave me a tax form.

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So I was like, but I just purchased things. I didn't actually do any labor,

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
so why are you taxing me? Oh, well, we have to give this to you in no way.

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What I should have done is given them a wrong Social Security number,

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but I was dumb, so.

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That would be wrong.

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
BlackDeftInChat says, Konami should do something like PT for Bimani.

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They could call it BT, Bimani Teaser.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
BlackWolf says, Konami is now mostly a casino company.

284
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The gambling games is what makes them their money.

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's true. You know, when I was at the Final Fantasy Fan Fest,

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I saw this giant machine there. It was like this huge rotating wheel,

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you know, pretty little thing at the Rio, and it had the Konami logo there in the corner.

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And we didn't sell the licensing rights in for some of that stuff,

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
because that would be awesome to, like, offload the licensing rights

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to somebody that would actually make games for it.

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's iOS now. That's where they're making some of their money back,

292
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
is YouBeat on iOS and ReflectBeat and all that stuff, whatever.

293
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
DarkSakura, do you have a favorite memory,

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
kind of looking back on the years and years of music gaming?

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I remember when I finally passed my first 7 in 2DX.

296
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think I squealed and broke people's eardrums.

297
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think I was there when that happened.

298
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Wasn't it, like, WarGame or something?

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It was 250 BPM. That was a lot of people's first 7.

300
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't 250.

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No, you did pass something else, and then, like, I want to say-

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then I did 250 BPM.

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, you played that, like, as your next song, and then you passed that too,

304
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and you're like, I am awesome!

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was something really bizarre, though.

306
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

307
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then my third one was Last Message. Remember?

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Because it had that little drum bar heart that was my favorite.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then, of course, you know, I remember passing my first 9s, my first 8s.

310
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I remember the birthday party we had on the floor by the fourth mix machine,

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
where Jessica brought cake, and I had my box of candy from Japan,

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and we sat on the floor and ate fucking cake with our fingers.

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And, like, nobody at Golf Land seemed to care.

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They're like, oh, it's them.

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, it's them.

316
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then the no shadowing party, the no shadowing thing,

317
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
so we decided to shadow everybody.

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh.

319
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
On Para Para.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's right.

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
When they tried to make that a rule that there was no shadowing allowed.

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And so everyone did it.

323
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Everybody did it in protest.

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then how it actually became my goal every trip to have somebody kicked out.

325
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I did. Damn those Roseville kids.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I used to have a really slow laptop that I'd have Dex Drive hooked up to

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that'd make custom DDR edits.

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
My favorite contest that ever happened on this show was Loki's Make Edit Get Porn.

329
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That was the thing in the early episodes of OLR.

330
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He had a big box of porn that he gave away to some kid.

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Whatever happened to that guy?

332
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Some kid that made an edit.

333
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
His life was forever changed.

334
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, right.

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Do you remember-

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He was 18.

337
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
When I say kid, I meant younger than me.

338
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Do you remember the edit I made for Tengoku? Or .59?

339
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah. It was like-

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Called Another.

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

342
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it was all the background offbeat stuff.

343
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Somebody actually passed it.

344
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I said, if anyone can pass this, I will buy you dinner.

345
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it was passed by-

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Was it Rick?

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No, no, no, no. Rick didn't pass it.

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was passed by Bran of DDR Freak.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ah.

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In Las Vegas.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Nice.

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I didn't buy him dinner. He said it was okay.

353
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But he bought it and then said I was-

354
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He beat it and then said I was evil.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He used to love him.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I remember we went to that Konami event thing and they were talking about all the different-

357
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It was Metal Gear Solid 3. I think they were showing off Metal Gear Online or whatever.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But I was more excited about the machine that they had there.

359
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

360
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I was like, oh, I'll play that.

361
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You were the first non-Konami person in America to play Supernova.

362
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah. And I had Naoki watching me.

363
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That was really awesome.

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That was definitely a moment of like, oh shit, this little show we started in the spare bedroom to extend our conversations.

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is like a thing. It was a moment.

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I remember I took the trip to San Diego to play Max when it was new.

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I was already in San Diego, but I made it a point I have to go to this arcade and I have to play Max.

369
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And so that was- They also had a 2DX sub stream at that mall.

371
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh gosh. Good times.

372
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I would say one of my favorite memories, being a little self-referential here, but I don't care.

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Probably the very first episode of Orange Lawns Radio that we did, because remember I lived in that house with a friend of mine from high school.

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And OLR was originally set up to have a very different tone because it was like every week was almost like a little bit of a house party,

375
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
which is why it didn't last very long that way, where we had people in the background playing 2DX and passing songs and people would be in the other room playing DDR.

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And it was like, it really was every week like a celebration, especially in the early years.

377
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And that was just a lot of fun, just getting everybody together, even though the sound quality was such shit.

378
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I remember-

379
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Going back and listening to it now.

380
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I remember the amazing migraine I had.

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah.

382
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, that was awful.

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's all I remember about that show is the migraine and the king of iron fingering.

384
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I remember from the very first show when you were- I actually think I have a clip of it.

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh god, no.

386
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I have a clip, because remember we used to do the teasers?

387
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, but please don't play that because-

388
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
When OLR was the station?

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Please, please, please, no.

390
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Aww, why not?

391
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Because I sounded stupid.

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No, you didn't. I thought it was hilarious.

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Fine. I was trying to talk about the Tetsujin, which I meant the Iron Man thing, and it was-

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
No, no, it wasn't that. That's not the clip. This is a different clip anyway, so don't worry about that. It's not the iron fingering.

395
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That was a later episode, and I don't remember which one it was, but it is-

396
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought it was the first one.

397
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No, it was not the first one. The first one was this one.

398
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh my god.

399
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay, you ready? You ready to hear this?

400
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
No.

401
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Wait for the sound quality here, and I'm gonna warn you guys. This is a 40-second clip. This is a commercial that used to be-

402
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
OLR was a station for a little while that had the highlight show every Sunday night. Here it is. A flashback for episode one.

403
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

404
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

405
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Any arcade.

406
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around, Jamie.

407
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh yeah, baby.

408
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And many different arcades.

409
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
She gets around.

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I am such an arcade whore.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Mother, your child. Jamie will.

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not gonna do your job, goddammit, I will.

413
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Join us every Sunday night from seven o'clock until nine o'clock.

414
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
See? The times change, but not much else has changed.

415
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, and now that I think about that, I don't want to be somebody else's child's parent, because I don't even have my own.

416
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Why the fuck would I want somebody else's kids?

417
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That was when we were having, I was having to go around and tell people not to change their diapers on the keyboard mania, because that's fucking disgusting.

418
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Why would you even have to do that? I mean, seriously.

419
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Because this is California and people are stupid and think that they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want.

420
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's a changing table, not a piano.

421
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No, because this is California and people feel like they're entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want to and it's fucking stupid.

422
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Alright, how about, how about one more before we get into our game movies? One more.

423
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It better not be the fingering.

424
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No, because you weren't here for episode two. This is episode two.

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That was when I was in the gay frat house.

426
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I have no idea.

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I was at 69.

428
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I knew, I knew what the episode one bumper was with that, but I have no idea what this one is.

429
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So, uh, this could be anything. This might be stupid for all I know. We'll see.

430
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

431
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Who was the last person to put their coin up?

432
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm going after that person. The hell with the rescue.

433
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.

434
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
A little, I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.

435
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
When I, I got up there and said, I'm playing.

436
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because this person put their token up. She starts talking about, no, he's mine, he's mine, I'm going to cut you.

437
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm going to kill you in the face. I'll kill my mommy on you.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Where, where is your mother? Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you. Go away.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Mommy's on the corner. She's earning dinner money.

440
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, my. The views and opinions of Chris Conley and Julia.

441
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
She's looking for daddy.

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Join us every Sunday night from 7pm.

443
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Once again, not much has changed. Loki making inappropriate jokes.

444
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
She's on the corner making dinner money.

445
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Good times. Good times.

446
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That actually reminded me of when I was at, um, Country Club Lanes.

447
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And the drunk guy tried to punch me and Dan got in a fight with him.

448
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't remember that. Oh, my God.

449
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah. I boycotted, uh, Country Club Lanes and went on a big tirade about them on DDR Freak.

450
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, my gosh.

451
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I remember going there, like, at midnight to play at three in the morning.

452
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because they're open 24 hours a day and play DDR Fifth Mix because they have Fifth Mix.

453
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This is back when they still had the first one. The US first one.

454
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, yeah.

455
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And, um, this little kid kept trying to get up on the pad while I was playing doubles, which is back in the day when I was playing doubles.

456
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I was like, you're going to get hurt. You're going to get hurt.

457
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And so she runs off. Next thing I know, her daddy comes and says, what are you trying to hurt my kid?

458
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I was like, I was trying not to, dumbass, which is pretty much what I said.

459
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And he was drunk and he's like, well, I'm going to take a swing at you.

460
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And he did. And I blocked him and it hurt him, not me.

461
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And then Dan comes running in, getting all in his face, and the guy gets thrown out by off-duty cops.

462
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I love that here we are, episode 573, and it's the exact same thing as episode one, bitching about unsupervised children.

463
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You know what? If it wasn't such a big problem, we would have to complain about it.

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Bobby's saying that we should have, uh, you know, last week on whatever, you know, for all of our, um, podcasts.

465
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You know what we need is some sort of algorithm that it does it automatically. It may make no sense whatsoever, but it would still be funny.

466
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It just cuts a random clip out of the show, like who knows what.

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, or just sections.

468
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Probably be me burping.

469
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We're about to get into, um, how was your gaming week, but Alan just walked into the studio. What's going on here, Alan?

470
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hello, I'm home early from work.

471
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Hi, welcome home early. What is this you're carrying in your hands?

472
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm about to give you a whole bunch of candy.

473
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yay. Just what I need. Candy, candy. Oh my gosh.

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So somebody brought all their leftover Halloween candy to work. Good times.

475
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That's what I did.

476
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Nice. Oh man, a Reese's peanut butter pumpkin. Those things are so good.

477
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Trick or treat. Oh, you know who likes these? Give these to Shane. Shane loves these.

478
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah. All right.

479
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Are those what I think they are?

480
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Andy's mints.

481
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I require two.

482
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The reason why I say give them to Shane because like he's like, Oh, the Olive Garden's awesome because they give you that mint at the end.

483
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm like, you know, that's just an Andy's mint, right? Anyway, tell, tell him their Olive Garden mints.

484
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
All right.

485
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
These are the best things ever.

486
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I know, right?

487
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I got rid of all of my candy at low cat and everybody was like, no, we don't want anymore.

488
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh no, I told my, my, uh, we weren't the only ones who discovered that soul caliber could be played with a Sega Dreamcast fishing controller.

489
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think we actually broke one of them when the two slammed together during a heated match.

490
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It still worked, but it doubled as baby rattle afterwards.

491
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is what I was doing in college rather than studying.

492
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Now I'm going to let you in on something I was planning to create as my first Unity 2D project, the title Grammar or Death.

493
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
At the start of the game, a poor stick figure is trapped in a dungeon tied to a chair.

494
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The player must choose grammatically correct phrases from never ending series of multiple choice questions with continuously decreasing time limit.

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
One wrong answer will result in a gruesome, gory death of the stick figure, complete with one of many loud screams.

496
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Possibly con, uh, contributed to the game by one Rob Roberts.

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But I've decided to scrap all of that because after listening to last week's OLR or last, last week's OLR, whatever you like to call it.

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My idea, um, I now have a much better and more amusing idea.

499
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And literally I will say it wasn't my idea.

500
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So thank you for that.

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I will say no more.

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now excuse me while I rub my hands together while gloating.

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
All my love, Aaron Yyr.

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Uh oh.

505
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Uh oh.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Uh oh.

507
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Budgie Ferret grammar.

508
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't, what, what did we say last week?

509
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I said I wanted another dream game, but I don't remember what it was.

510
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Oh no.

511
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We weren't here last week.

512
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This is last, last week.

513
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah, because it was the rod caliber episode, which came up a couple shows ago.

514
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So, you know, some people catch up, they binge listen to OLR.

515
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Like you binge watch chat rooms.

516
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We trust your memory cause we don't remember half the shit we do.

517
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Tell, tell me what I said.

518
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Um, I still, I like the grammar or death idea.

519
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think our soccer would have been all about that.

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm all about that.

521
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No, too violent.

522
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Too violent.

523
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Well, cartoony death might be okay.

524
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Like stick figure death is okay.

525
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's okay.

526
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So this is not too realistic.

527
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yyr, I love you.

528
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I want you to be my, my, uh, eternal, not soulmate.

529
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Are we getting the steam version of, uh, Budgie Ferret tossing?

530
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah.

531
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Maybe, uh, maybe you need to postpone work on all these other games until we get Budgie

532
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Ferret tossing on green light and we can, uh, unethically beg for upvotes.

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Greetings, OLR.

534
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, serious turtle.

535
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I was wondering if any of you had tried civilization beyond earth yet.

536
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Rob, I'm looking at you.

537
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes.

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
At first glance at some let's play videos, it really looks like a reskinned Civ 5, but

539
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
worse.

540
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Any thoughts?

541
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And on the topic of Forex games, Rob, have you tried Endless Legend yet?

542
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It is unbelievably fun, beautiful, great music, cool stories, and actually adds a lot of new

543
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
concepts to the Forex gaming front.

544
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And the price is a nice change too.

545
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I will look it up based on your recommendation.

546
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Now is a really busy period, but I will, uh, especially with the price.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Rob is a busy bee.

548
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Excuse me, the price is right.

549
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Um, well, things are going to come, like, everything kind of built up to this weekend

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and once BlizzCon is done, then my calendar clears up, so you, excuse me, hiccups.

551
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Uh, I blame Jamie's, uh, stuff in the flask for that.

552
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But, um.

553
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
My hooch.

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Your hooch.

555
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Um, but anyway, uh, I will check that out.

556
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
As far as Beyond Earth, yeah, I mean, it's easy to compare it to Civ 5 because they look

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
the same because they're on the hex grid.

558
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But when you really get down to the nitty-gritty rules and the fact that, you know, the tech

559
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
tree isn't a tree, it's a web, that right there changes things.

560
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And there's, you know, a bunch of other stuff that's different too.

561
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And the whole, um, harmony versus, what is it, like superiority and purity or something

562
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
like that.

563
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like that throws a whole other monkey wrench into how you win the game is completely different.

564
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Rob's got a Civ boner.

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

566
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Um, I actually, I'm going to be honest, and I said this last week on the show, I don't

567
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
think Beyond Earth is as strong as 5, but it's not bad at all.

568
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I still think I'm enjoying Beyond Earth probably more than I ever enjoyed Civ 3, which

569
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I never got into at all.

570
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Like, that's the Civ people don't really talk about ever is Civ 3.

571
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So.

572
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
All right.

573
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's more to this email.

574
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Jamie, have a taco on Rob tonight.

575
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No.

576
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
No.

577
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I think I got that in one of those, like, bundles.

578
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't want to eat a taco on Rob.

579
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They had like Civ 3 for like a buck ninety-nine points.

580
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't know if he's clean.

581
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Loki, I'm pretty excited about GTA 5 for PC in January, but be honest with me.

582
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Will the use of the N-word ruin the game for me?

583
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm pretty sensitive to cursing in games.

584
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No.

585
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's, it's not, it's really not that bad.

586
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, cause you're only, it's really, it's really only, uh, Franklin's friend that just

587
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
keeps, you know, you know, he just keeps using that over and over because that's the character.

588
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean, and it's funny though.

589
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Actually that, that guy that did the voice acting for that, he does, there's a car commercial,

590
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
like a, a local used car commercial that you can find him doing that for.

591
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And it's hilarious.

592
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He's just like, he's exactly like his character.

593
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Um, but no, it, the language in the game is not that bad actually.

594
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's, it's pretty, pretty tame.

595
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's not, it's not like San Andreas.

596
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay.

597
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, sorry.

598
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
If you can watch a movie that has course language, then course.

599
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I like that.

600
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, it's course.

601
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's like sandpaper.

602
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Like me when I get upset, except that's not a word I would use, but I'll use words that

603
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
start with F.

604
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm going to use course all the time.

605
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's all about Trevor anyways.

606
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Trevor is awesome.

607
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Seriously.

608
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Can I finish reading this email?

609
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yup.

610
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
OLR as always, I love the show.

611
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Look forward to the podcast every Monday minus the cursing.

612
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I guess the content and opinions more than make up for it.

613
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.

614
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm really effing sorry about my mouth.

615
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You know what?

616
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Language only has power.

617
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If you give it power, you probably like the Bobby black Wolf show.

618
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I, you know, I don't, I, I respect that some individuals prefer not to use that language,

619
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
so that's, that's fine.

620
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Just bear with me cause I was raised differently, so sometimes I let them fly.

621
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah.

622
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I just remember the one day that I nearly dropped my mouth open when my mom said one

623
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
day I'd end up up shit Creek.

624
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I was like, mom, since then has been just the one time she ever cursed in front of me

625
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
while I was a kid.

626
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I was like, wow, mom.

627
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Congratulations on.

628
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay.

629
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This one comes from hit Stan.

630
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Um, congratulations on your new high score.

631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I have a question.

632
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
When you return to a familiar music game, what kinds of music do you play on?

633
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Do you go back to license songs or old video game tunes?

634
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You know, do you try to full combo and easy song or challenge the games?

635
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Infinitely heart songs right away.

636
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I normally look for Prague rock with fast patterns and tempo changes.

637
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's hard to read those note charts, but conquering that makes me, excuse me.

638
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I have hiccups makes me feel like a boss.

639
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I would like to not have hiccups.

640
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Hi.

641
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I gave them to you.

642
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Coffee flavored hiccups.

643
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Um, I usually just go back and do the ones that were the most fun to me, even if I get

644
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
past them.

645
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If I'm playing a new game, like, um, an example I could give is that I actually was playing

646
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Hatsune Miku on PS3 cause it was on sale a couple of weeks ago while I was at fan fest.

647
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So that actually was like a new to me anyway, music game that I was playing.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I just would listen to a little previews and usually I tend to, uh, uh, drift towards

649
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
a trancy songs in that game.

650
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And I wish I could remember the name of that one song.

651
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
There's one song in there.

652
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There's one song in there I really, really liked.

653
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's kind of trancy.

654
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's one of the other characters.

655
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's not Hatsune Miku, but I love that you can put the other characters in the video,

656
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
including the men.

657
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So they can do all these very like, you know, uh, female oriented motions or, and he can

658
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
do vice versa.

659
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You can have females do the guy parts and it's fun.

660
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I think I just had something really offensive in chat.

661
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Did you?

662
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I want to say the song was called die, but D Y E I think it was the song I liked.

663
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Ciel said Rob needs Jesus.

664
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're nasty.

665
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You saw what I said.

666
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes, I did.

667
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm not repeating it on the air.

668
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
All right.

669
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's why I don't finish the email.

670
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Was that, was that?

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
No, there's more.

672
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay.

673
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Remember even when the given choices suck, there's always another option.

674
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Vote for Hollick.

675
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This email is brought to you by Columbus, Ohio, home of the never ending freeway construction.

676
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I've been listening to OLR since the to go edition in October 9th, uh, October, 2005.

677
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And it always helps me pass the time on my commute every week.

678
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Keep on going until you break the counter.

679
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, that was sweet.

680
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That is, that is a long time to be listening stuff too.

681
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Last email.

682
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yay.

683
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Last email.

684
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Hi folks.

685
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's the rage nator.

686
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I thought I'd send a quick email to ask a question and to impart some info.

687
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
First things first, the info for those who are PC gamers via via steam origin, et cetera.

688
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I found a site that aggregates news about game giveaways.

689
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Here is the link and it's, um, actually at, uh, epic bundle.com.

690
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Um, it's a much longer link, but I think you can get there just by going from epic bundle.com and I'm not getting struck by lightning because I'm a good Jewish girl.

691
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Um, if you take a look at, uh, if you take a look at the page, two thirds of the way down the page, there's a yellowish newsfeed box that's regularly updated.

692
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I suggest keeping an eye on this.

693
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Now, considering that Halloween was two days ago, I thought I'd pose this question.

694
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What classic games do you traditionally like to play around Halloween?

695
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's a Halloween feel to it.

696
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Personally, let's play super ghouls and ghosts, Castlevania one and four, medieval nightmare creatures, frozen evil one through three and hexen.

697
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's actually funny.

698
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We had, um, Dan just put on like all of the, uh, uh, Makamura music.

699
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The Daimakaimura music, cause that's really the best, but he had like different iterations from different systems and then, uh, played some Castlevania music for all the kids come into the door.

700
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And, but, um, honestly, uh, I like to play like really bad scary games, like the nightmare on a little street game, which is laughably stupid and the Friday the 13th game, which is also laughably stupid.

701
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And, uh, I kind of liked Friday the 13th on NES.

702
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, that was laughable.

703
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Um, I don't, I mean, keep in mind, I've had a very different Halloween tradition for about the past 16 years.

704
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So I don't really have a video game related tradition.

705
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Um, I will be looking to start one soon, I guess. I don't know.

706
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I sadly, I can't really answer this question.

707
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I mean, I play scary video games whenever, well, I don't like to play them a lot because, you know, my heart can only take so much and I get scared really easily.

708
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Have you played Among the Sleep yet?

709
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No, but I was gifted by a kind, generous listener named ActDeft a copy of Five Nights at Freddy's saying, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, you should stream this sometime.

710
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And I'm like, I'm, I want to say thank you for your kindness.

711
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm afraid of getting that game.

712
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I want to say thank you for your kindness and generosity and thinking of me.

713
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But on the other hand, I want to say, fuck you.

714
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You know what?

715
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Sorry to the guy who doesn't like story.

716
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You know what? I think that would make an awesome movie.

717
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What, Five Nights at Freddy's?

718
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah.

719
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You know the sequel's already-

720
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh yeah, already greenlit.

721
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yep.

722
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It didn't need a campaign to make that happen.

723
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And I'll tell you, people are already cosplaying. It's crazy.

724
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's just furries looking for an excuse.

725
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
No, no, no, no. That's-

726
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No disrespect.

727
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's all the Rocket Raccoon cosplay.

728
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Or, does Groot count, maybe?

729
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alright.

730
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That'd be more leafies.

731
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Woodies.

732
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Woodies. Yeah, that's what I'm going to call plant cosplay woodies.

733
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So that's it.

734
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Alright.

735
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That's it for the mailbag.

736
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If you want to participate in a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

737
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

738
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,000
FU to the ongoing pain in my left ear.

739
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's not like a deep ear infection. I actually did go to the doctor, but it's like, when you press on one part of it, it hurts.

740
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And it's not as bad as it was, but when I yawn or open my mouth, because it feels kind of like TMJ, except it pulls on my ear and makes my ear hurt.

741
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So when I turn my head a certain way, it hurts.

742
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I've been getting headaches because of it.

743
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:39,000
My doctor gave me ear drops. He said that the eardrum looks fine. I didn't have an infection, but it looks really red and horrible in there.

744
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And I work on the photos.

745
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Which is why many people are ever going to find out where I work.

746
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Except for the people that I've actually told.

747
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And no, I'm not pressing on it, but sometimes I roll over and lean on things.

748
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It was hurting on my pillow. That's how bad it was.

749
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
FU number two to the manic panic that only took on a little bit of my hair.

750
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That means I have to re-dye my ends, which I was going for red and purple.

751
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And I had another FU, but fuck it.

752
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Alright, Loki.

753
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I guess FU two, this headache that hasn't gone away and I've been taken since and stuff for it just doesn't seem to go.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But, I'm actually going to use this for another thing.

755
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I wanted to mention that if you are interested in Five Nights at Freddy's, that they do have it as part of the Halloween Humble Bundle.

756
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You pay over the average, which as of right now is $5.32.

757
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You get it.

758
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Along with a bunch of other games.

759
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's good for another three days.

760
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Alright, my FU of the week goes to I'm With You, headaches, because I had a really bad one at a really, really, really bad time.

761
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And yeah, FU to headaches, that's for sure.

762
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
FU to panic attacks.

763
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm pretty sure I had another one of those in the past week.

764
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's no fun.

765
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And then FU to being thrown under the bus.

766
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.

767
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm pointing at my eyes, I'm pointing at you.

768
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Let's move on with some more gaming news while I figure out why the oven won't stop beeping.

769
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Because it's completely possessed by Satan.

770
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Satan, yes.

771
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't believe in Satan.

772
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So this is kind of cool, we talked about this a little bit.

773
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That there was this lawsuit from Manuel Noriega who was attempting to sue Activision because of his portrayal in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

774
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You know, being portrayed as some sort of dictator and an all-around bad guy.

775
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Kidnapped murderer, enemy of the state type thing.

776
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Well, kind of is that.

777
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But anyways, the lawsuit has been dismissed.

778
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So, too bad, so sad.

779
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You don't get any money.

780
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But, I don't know.

781
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's interesting, actually it was funny because me not following politics or anything, I had no idea that the character in the game was actually a real person.

782
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Because they make up a lot of fictional villains in these games, so it's hard to tell them apart.

783
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's okay, you were pretty young in the 80s and I think that guy was all, his name was all over the place, you know.

784
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So, I forgot about that lawsuit though until you brought it back up.

785
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

786
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And that has to do with the second chance at a game you might have missed.

787
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Valkyria Chronicles was a Playstation 3 game, which I don't think a lot of people really checked out.

788
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because it didn't really come up on a lot of people's radars, but it was a pretty good tactical game.

789
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's getting a second chance on the PC, which is interesting seeing more and more of these companies put out titles that were once on console, like I know Square has been doing this a lot lately too, on PC.

790
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So, Valkyria Chronicles will be coming out on PC on November 11th for $20 or 20 Euros depending on where your region is.

791
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This is also interesting. You get, I think there was some DLC that was included as well, although that's not in this particular story I'm looking at.

792
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm assuming that's, you know, everything together. You can find some deals on the internet, by the way.

793
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Some sites are offering it for $13.86 or $14.99, so just look around.

794
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So, there you go. That's a pretty darn good deal for a game I think a lot of folks might have missed, Valkyria Chronicles.

795
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I only played a little bit of it. I think Alan owned the game, so I played a little bit of it, but unfortunately didn't get into it too much and I certainly didn't beat it.

796
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's just one of those games where probably some MMO got in the way and I never did end up beating it.

797
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Alright, anyway, we are going to open up Skype line. It is that time. Let's take some calls.

798
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to call and participate with our program on whatever topic you'd like to bring up.

799
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Or maybe there's something we didn't get to tonight that you want to bring up. Perhaps a game that you've been playing that you want to review or something along those lines.

800
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Looking quickly at our Twitter over at Twitter.com slash OLR, Dark Tetsuya tweeted us during the show here saying,

801
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Try as I might to locate the Orange Bats DDR routine on YouTube. I'm afraid the search has ended in failure, Frowny.

802
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Don't worry, I'm sure DarkSakura is probably rejoicing a little bit for that. Alright.

803
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I actually have it on a desk somewhere in my house.

804
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Do you really? You should bring that up. Anyway, we're going to go to the phones. We have a call coming in.

805
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

806
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Hey, how are you doing? It's me, Pau here.

807
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Hey, Pau. Wow, I don't think you've called into the show before and we see you. How are you doing?

808
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Pretty good. I've been just thinking about calling, not calling for almost three, four weeks, but I wasn't really sure and I decided to do it.

809
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Where are you from, Pau?

810
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I was born in Spain.

811
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh, okay. Where do you live now? In the States? Canada?

812
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, I'm in California now.

813
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh, you're in California. What part?

814
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah, Palm Springs.

815
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Okay, Palm Springs. Oh, that's where all the fun parties happen. Alright.

816
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
All my neighbors are like 70s, so super quiet.

817
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
There's a lot of old people in Palm Springs, quite a few.

818
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy? You made the decision to call into the show. Glad you did. What's up?

819
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, I was wondering with so many games coming out and with just so many releases at the same time, I was wondering for you guys so far, what was the biggest surprise of the year?

820
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like, which game? You were not really sure and then you realized that you just can't stop playing it.

821
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Ooh, this is a tricky question to get put on the spot with. Alright, let's see. Do you guys have an answer for Pau's question?

822
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And I invite the chat room to answer this too.

823
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Sure, put it off on everyone else, Rob.

824
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, no, it seems like Pau is taking a poll. I don't know if he's trying to catch up on some games that he might have missed, but what are some games this year that surprised you?

825
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I started playing Off this year. I was surprised at how good it was.

826
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Off?

827
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Off. You play as the batter and you're an avatar and you have to go on this holy adventure, but you walk around with a bat.

828
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's a weird French game and it's got a translation out. That and I did expect to love Hataful Boyfriend as much as I do.

829
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
There you go, Hataful Boyfriend. Loki, anything you can think of?

830
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Sadly, most of the surprises this year have been games that have been a lot more terrible than I thought they were going to be.

831
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You know, like, I guess Watch Dogs wasn't as good as I had hoped. Elder Scrolls Online, at least based off the beta, wasn't that great?

832
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I would say that probably in the positive, maybe, I was surprised, I haven't played it yet, but Far Cry 4 looks really good.

833
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I wasn't expecting it at Far Cry 4 this year and, I mean, that looks pretty fantastic.

834
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So, they'll be coming out in just a couple weeks here and, I don't know, Destiny's kind of okay, I guess.

835
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't know, Sunset Overdrive, I guess, would be a good surprise. Once again, I haven't played that.

836
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Call of Duty, I was kind of expecting to be good, so that wasn't really much of a surprise.

837
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I don't know, maybe Bayonetta 2? I mean, I haven't played that, but it looks good.

838
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm having a hard time thinking of stuff that was out this year that's not, like, obvious.

839
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Like, I could say, oh, the Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 4, because that turned out really, really well, but I feel like that's kind of a cop-out answer.

840
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Or I could say the Diablo 3 expansion. The Diablo 3 expansion, because it fixed all the problems of the game.

841
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
How about Shovel Knight?

842
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I was going to say Shovel Knight! You cut me off! Damn you! He took my answer. Shovel Knight.

843
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Shovel Knight was really fun, I played it. For me, I think it was probably Bayonetta 2.

844
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I was cautiously optimistic, because when that game has that kind of, you know, now get cancelled and then goes back again.

845
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I was cautiously optimistic, but I just played and I just had so much fun.

846
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I cannot remember the last time that I played a game and I genuinely loved what I was playing.

847
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
From the first second, when she just says, well, I just need some shoes that don't have guns on them, the lines were so ridiculous, but so good.

848
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The controls were improved, the camera was improved, so I think it just improved everything on the original.

849
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Even the online mode worked good, I mean.

850
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know about you, but I just laugh and laugh and laugh playing that game, because it's so over-the-top.

851
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Even from the very beginning, in the opening sequence with the New York City Christmas, it's just so over-the-top.

852
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I can't help it. I always scream laughing at some stuff. You know what that is, when you start screaming laughing.

853
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I think it's also just so hard and so refreshing to see a feminine character that at the same time is really feminine, but at the same time is extremely aggressive.

854
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think it's really challenging sometimes to write, so I thought they showed them making off to promote the game, and it was really clear that it was written with a girl developer.

855
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I just think the mix was just really, really good. I thought the writing was just really, really funny. Even the online mode worked great.

856
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm looking at our chat room to see if there's some votes in there.

857
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Dungeon Buster says Alien Isolation is good if you're an Alien fan. I've heard that's a good, scary game, too.

858
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A lot of folks are telling me to play that one and stream it to watch me pee my pants live.

859
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Let's see, some folks in the chat room, a couple of people saying Wolfenstein was really fun.

860
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah, I heard that was really good.

861
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I've heard that, too. I haven't played it myself, but I have a friend-

862
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I feel like Downsize the Hero is really short. That's why I didn't buy it, but I do want to buy it.

863
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
That's a really good feedback.

864
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah, I sort of go, oh, it's another reimagining of this game that had its limelight back in the 90s, but apparently it is really good.

865
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Well, you may remember, they have re-released- not re-released it, but tried reimagining it a few times now.

866
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So, I don't know. It's not entirely new.

867
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
All right. Well, there you go, pal. There are some of our suggestions here from the chatters and us in the studio.

868
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
All right. Well, thank you for having me, and I hope that Dark Sakura gets better with her ear issues.

869
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I have some chronic issues on my left one, so I understand her pain.

870
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Thank you. I appreciate that. It's thankfully getting better.

871
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just, I thought that it was completely better today, so I went without my medication, and IKEA ruined me.

872
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh, and my recommendation is if you can avoid it and don't use good headphones like this one, because I have chronic problems.

873
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
They always make it better if it's painful.

874
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I have to use the work headphones, but other than that, I don't really use them, so yeah. But thank you.

875
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
All right. Well, thank you for having me.

876
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Healing vibes to you both. Take care. Anytime, pal. Don't be a stranger.

877
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Bye. Bye.

878
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I always like hearing from new people here on Orange Laundry. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love our serial collars as well.

879
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Is that his icon? His icon looks like him.

880
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yeah, I think that was a little me. Let me bring that up again here.

881
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Oh, that's cool.

882
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So, you can see that there.

883
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, yeah. That looks just like him. Well done.

884
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,000
No, I like when people do avatars with preset stuff, and they actually get it to look like them. Like, mine looks like me, I think.

885
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Do you think my me looks like me?

886
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah. He's got your weird, you know, nose. I'm kidding.

887
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
My weird nose?

888
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I like your weird nose. It's very Dutch.

889
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Do you know that when, just to see, do you know that when I was born, apparently, when I, you know, came from the place that babies come from.

890
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
When you squelched forward.

891
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The first thing my mom said was, he has the blank her maiden name. He has the blank nose.

892
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Dan has the family nose. I think it's really a Dutch thing, you know?

893
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Might be, might be. Let's get to some more calls. Skype's lighting up tonight, but we have time to get a few more in here.

894
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

895
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

896
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Hey, Akdeft. How you doing, buddy?

897
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Really good, really good.

898
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
What's in your mind?

899
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Well, since you brought Steam during most of some of the show, I also wanted to talk about something Steam did recently.

900
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Oh, sure. What's that?

901
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They changed the currency in Mexico to pesos.

902
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I had seen you tweeting about this. So, since a lot of our listeners probably don't have that perspective from not living in Mexico, tell us about, like, what this change is and what it means.

903
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, some background first. And I have said this before on the show, that most of the games here sold on stores and that stuff cost way more than they cost in the United States.

904
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Right.

905
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Basically because of conversion and import fees and taxes and all that stuff, all that good stuff.

906
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Well, it's just like here if you want to buy a game that was released in Japan, we pay a shit ton of extra money for that.

907
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Yeah, basically, but at least that's a real import, but like the stuff that was released in the United States or in America, basically, it costs a lot.

908
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Only a few companies like Microsoft and sometimes Sony do match price, at least don't go a higher price.

909
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Nintendo stuff here sells a really high price.

910
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Yikes. So, what did Steam do to help this get better?

911
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:08,000
First, a lot of people, including me, thought that Steam was going to turn for the worse, that they were going to charge high prices or they weren't going to be at least that affordable, maybe.

912
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:23,000
But they came and it actually surprised me a lot because not a lot. Most of the games, like 99% of the games, cost way cheaper than the United States prices.

913
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Wow, interesting.

914
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Like, for example, Civilization Beyond Earth, it costs $50 on Steam in the United States. Here it costs 440 pesos. In the conversion, it's more or less like $40.

915
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Well, that's not fair. I'm opening up a Mexican account and I'm going to buy all my games with pesos. It's no fair.

916
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Everyone should do that. And it's something curious because it's not only here that happens. It's also on places like Russia and I think Brazil also have cheaper prices than the United States.

917
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's something that, and I didn't know this until a few months ago, that a lot of people buy from Russians or people on other places just to buy cheaper.

918
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I have heard of this before. In fact, I think this is how friends I know got cheap copies of Mass Effect 3 was like Russian keys or something like that from doing it that way.

919
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And then I like how I'm talking about getting cheaper games. I'm sure my friends over in the UK are like, shut up, because everything's more expensive over there.

920
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Do you think that maybe part of Steam wanting to start accepting the pesos in the community and so forth is to try and foster more of the trading card and the marketplace?

921
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Did that all recently open up for you guys too? Because I'm wondering if that might be a motive.

922
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:15,000
No, no, that's something we have always had. Even the market, I could sell the cards or even items from like Pink Fortress 2 and we got the amount in dollars, but now I get pesos.

923
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But that's something that we always have done. It's not something that is region locked. Something really curious though, especially carrying to the market.

924
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Like for example, you can now pay, not like credit, but it's something that you purchase the game on Steam, but you don't necessarily have to use a credit card or a gift card for example.

925
00:59:45,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You need to go to a convenience store like 7-Eleven just to make an example. We have a convenience store called Oxo. Oxos are everywhere. You can go to every corner and you can find one.

926
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So you can basically go there and pay your game and that's it. So yeah, it's really convenient too for people that don't have a credit card or even a PayPal account. So you can basically just go to the store and pay for your game and that's it.

927
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Interesting. Well, thank you for giving us a little insight as to how it works in other countries because sometimes we are very blinded by what we've got here locally. It's always interesting to hear what goes on in other countries.

928
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And having to deal with the conversions, but not anymore on Steam and now you're getting the better end of the deal.

929
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

930
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Alright, enjoy it while it lasts.

931
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Hopefully it never ends.

932
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Alright, well take care my friend and we'll let you go to get some more calls.

933
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Okay, looking forward to you playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

934
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Alright, bye my friend.

935
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Bye.

936
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Alright, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Alan's the best, he just brought me pizza. He's so cool.

937
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Alan can bring me pizza.

938
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Alright.

939
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Alan, pizza.

940
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.

941
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Or 1877 game OLR.

942
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, you had a burrito.

943
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I can tease if I want to Rob.

944
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's your party and you'll tease if you want to.

945
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Uh, that sounded wrong.

946
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Alright, well let's get to the phones. It's lighting up tonight, oh my gosh.

947
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

948
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's the one and only Rama.

949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I see you Rama. Uh oh, what's in the glass?

950
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Uh, it's a little bit of rum and coke.

951
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Good times.

952
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I was going to ask if you were drinking antifreeze.

953
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Not as good as the hooch I had.

954
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
No, I'm drinking in honor of a good friend, so.

955
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Alright, well I'll drink to them too.

956
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Good, good, good.

957
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Alright, what's on your mind my friend?

958
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Well, first of all I want to second act deaf and yeah, you have to do a live stream of Five Nights at Freddy's.

959
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I don't like peer pressure, but I do like this pizza.

960
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Rob, I will watch you play, I will come over while you play Five Nights at Freddy's.

961
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Will you hold my hand?

962
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I will hold your hand.

963
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yay.

964
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And then I will fucking laugh my ass off.

965
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Wow, Jamie, you're a good friend.

966
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm the best.

967
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I know, right?

968
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We'll see, after Blizzcon, after Blizzcon.

969
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, don't even get me started off at Blizzcon. I got a friend of mine, she's going nuts with her cosplay, getting it done for Blizzcon.

970
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm like, that's not...

971
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Is this our same friend?

972
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
No, different friend.

973
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Okay.

974
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Rob is popular, he has lots of friends.

975
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
By the way, did you see Kayla's costume?

976
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yes, I did.

977
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The disciple?

978
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
That was fucking gorgeous.

979
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Everyone needs to not give her a hard time for doing Homestuck cosplay.

980
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
We give everybody shit for every single cosplay that they do.

981
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's just, but I do understand where you're coming from though.

982
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I do understand though.

983
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Alright, so what's on your mind tonight? Is it just to peer pressure me into live streaming, or is it something else?

984
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Well, that too, but I called in to say congratulations for hitting episode 573.

985
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Thank you, I realize you understand what that means.

986
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yeah, and then when you were talking earlier about how you got into the Bimani scene, and so I started thinking about how I got into it.

987
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And then I remember that one phone call where... Can I remember her name?

988
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
She was on the show, Jason's old lady, and I said if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have...

989
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well, what about you guys? You gave her shit for that, and I do remember that.

990
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I remember that as well, yes, yes.

991
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And I think about that, I'm like, well, to be perfectly honest, if it wasn't for my last girlfriend who I was with 10 years back,

992
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I never would have known about all of this, because I go to the con, and I'm like, I see this dance pad sitting here, and I'm like, what the hell is this?

993
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I step on it, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, I walk away, and then at the time I'm flirting with her, she's like, do you play DDR?

994
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm like, what's that? And she's like, well, does she describe what it is? I'm like, yes, I do play DDR!

995
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And I'm thinking in the back of my mind, where the fuck am I going to find an arcade machine so I can play so I don't know exactly what I'm doing?

996
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
That is, that is funny. Well, you know, we always say at the end of every episode, tell a friend about the show, and it works!

997
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
We would not have Rama if somebody was not telling a friend about the show. There's a reason we do it.

998
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Mm-hmm, got that right.

999
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the congrats for episode 573, I appreciate that very much.

1000
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Hey, I'm going to put you on the spot, because we asked earlier, everybody, if you had to pick one song licensed, well, the two, one licensed, one unlicensed,

1001
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
best Bamani song ever licensed and unlicensed.

1002
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Okay, I did answer that, but I had two answers, but they're both licensed titles, so can I give them?

1003
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I don't know, judges?

1004
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Sure, I'll allow it.

1005
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:24,000
The first song is My Sweet Darling by Wildside, because that song was so catchy and so awesome, so I went looking to find the full version of the song.

1006
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Come to find out, it's a cover by a J-pop artist by the name of Yida Hitomi, who is one of my favorite artists, I listen to her albums on a regular basis.

1007
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Nice.

1008
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And my number two song is Tiggy Freckles, because when I first heard this song, I'm like, why does it sound familiar to me?

1009
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And I'm like, I know this song from somewhere, and then out of the blue, I just happen to be watching Kenshin, and I'm just like, this song, oh my God, it's a cover of Sobokazu by Moroni Kenshin.

1010
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I know that song as the song that makes it really easy to get max 300.

1011
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, then you remember how I would sing it while playing, but I only knew the Japanese lyrics, so I'd be like, I still to this day don't know the English lyrics to it, because I still run through the really high-pitched Japanese vocals in my head.

1012
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What am I gonna do when I get, something like that.

1013
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You'll find that someone has taken the English soul and just remixed it to Kenshin, I think it's pretty cool.

1014
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh my gosh.

1015
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Alright, well Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks as always for the call.

1016
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Hey, no problem.

1017
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Listen to Anime Jam Session, but oh, not this week, you guys are on repeat this week, right?

1018
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:46,000
No, we recorded an episode at Zenkai Con, so we'll be putting that in with some extra songs, and you know, we're gonna keep it fresh for everyone.

1019
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
That's it, so it's taped in advance, but still, it's live, not live from a convention.

1020
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1021
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Alright, check it out.

1022
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Alright, thanks my friend, take care.

1023
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You too, and instead of staying black, stay fabulous.

1024
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I always will, and I snap, and glitter has exploded everywhere.

1025
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Pao and I need to talk.

1026
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Have a good one.

1027
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
By the way.

1028
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
What?

1029
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Pao and I need to talk, because once the live-action Kenshin movie, with English subtitles, I know where to find it.

1030
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You know where to find it, alright.

1031
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Anyway, we are way past time tonight, we gotta wrap up, because, you know, tonight's a school night.

1032
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So, I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through on Skype, please consider sending us an email.

1033
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTradia.com, but be prepared to be put on the spot.

1034
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:42,000
If you're emailing us to talk about episode 573, be prepared to answer the question about your favorite licensed and non-licensed, and you can only pick one.

1035
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We are not waiving it for anybody else.

1036
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Dark Sakura was being very kind and generous to Rama.

1037
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Anyhow.

1038
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Just keep, I am stacking up lots of favors that I'm going to redeem in the form of a ticket to New York, and a place to crash.

1039
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Maybe you can cash that one in for, like, an authentic taco from New York City.

1040
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh, I'm already doing big, big favors.

1041
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
That thing I told you I'm working on?

1042
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Oh yeah, right, right, right.

1043
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh yeah.

1044
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
There you go.

1045
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Cash those checks, girl.

1046
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Cash those checks.

1047
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I save them up.

1048
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Let me just quickly check in with Loki for any quick last minute headlines here, before we sign out.

1049
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Last minute headline, I'm on level 1,964 clicker heroes.

1050
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Oh god, I forgot to try that game, that's probably a good thing.

1051
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Don't try it.

1052
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I won't.

1053
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It's pointless.

1054
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I don't know why I'm still playing this, just for no reason.

1055
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Because you have problems.

1056
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I do have problems.

1057
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Because I also don't have to look at the screen to play it.

1058
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It plays itself.

1059
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It plays itself.

1060
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Just like cookie clickers.

1061
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Alright, well then that being said, we are going to bring another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1062
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Hey, thank you guys for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1063
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It was a very diverse episode tonight.

1064
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:02,000
We had some good old fashioned debate and we had some good old fashioned memories looking back on some of the great foundations of where our show came from.

1065
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

1066
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What's that?

1067
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I was reminding you that we have a special cookie tonight.

1068
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I still have to bring it up.

1069
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But that's just for the live listeners.

1070
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The podcasters sadly don't get that part.

1071
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Because that's where we play things that don't necessarily belong to us.

1072
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So anyway, thank you guys very much for listening to the show and supporting independent podcasting.

1073
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Remember, if you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, then support another show.

1074
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But if you did like Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five or fifty about the program.

1075
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Who knows?

1076
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You might know the next Rama.

1077
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Just like somebody referred Rama to this show.

1078
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You might know them.

1079
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and keep this the place where every gamer has a voice.

1080
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And where we can engage in a lively debate respectfully.

1081
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I think that's one thing I really like about what we've been able to do here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That's my thought.

1083
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So let me go around and get everybody's final thought.

1084
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'll start with my actual final thought, which would be this pizza is delicious.

1085
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Nom nom nom.

1086
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

1087
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Reject false icons.

1088
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, look at you going for a classic there.

1089
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

1090
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
My final thought is I am done playing cookie cooker today.

1091
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Sure, you say that now.

1092
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, I'm level two thousand one, so I should be good enough.

1093
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
How many of the achievements have we gotten?

1094
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Eighty four percent.

1095
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's not a hundred percent.

1096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
All right.

1097
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1098
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
We will be back next week.

1099
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Podcasters, you don't have to do anything different.

1100
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
The show will show up on the feed just like you're used to.

1101
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Live listeners, keep in mind, we may be a little bit delayed.

1102
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Stay tuned to our Twitter for updates.

1103
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And Bobby Black Wolf will also provide updates live at VOG.

1104
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But I will be literally walking in the door.

1105
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
This also means that next week's episode will be produced by Loki.

1106
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
This will be interesting.

1107
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It won't be. It'll be just like it normally is.

1108
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
He pretty much gives me three quarters of the stories that go on the show anyway.

1109
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So it'll be just like any other week at OLR.

1110
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So we will see you next week.

1111
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I'll be back to talk BlizzCon.

1112
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Those of you that will be in Anaheim on Thursday,

1113
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I hope to see you at World of Podcasts.

1114
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Have a good night everybody. See you next week.

1115
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
