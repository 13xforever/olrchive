00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
The holiday season is officially here, so prepare your wallets for sales and discounts

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,060
aplenty, assuming what you want will actually be in stock.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,500
Enjoy the splendor of the season and join us for the next few hours of news, your comments

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,500
and more, right here on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,540
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,300
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,340
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this November the 30th of 2014 with the 577th episode of

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,620
our show.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,100
I hope those of you in the states had a wonderful thanksgiving, thanks for joining us either

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,940
the Sunday after if you happen to be here live, or the week after if you happen to be

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,140
listening to us in the car, on your commute, at your desk at work, or however it is that

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,300
you consume Orange Lounge Radio each week.

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,940
Thank you guys so much for listening.

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,140
We will be talking about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, probably food

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,240
and random tangents as well over the next few hours.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,140
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio, also known as Skie, where you can find me on Twitter

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,660
S-K-I-E, joining me as always.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,900
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Hi.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
How are you?

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Um, alright.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Yeah?

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Did you have a good thanksgiving?

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
It was very chill.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,900
It was awesome.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Yeah, that's it.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,020
It didn't involve going to anybody's house.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
Yeah.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,020
Or family drama.

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,020
Or drama at all.

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
Right.

33
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,220
It involved me, Dan, the cat, and turkey sandwiches.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,220
No, I hear you.

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,220
You know what?

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,140
Thanksgiving was just me, Alan, and my parents, and that is totally cool because no more family

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,320
dramas and it's, we go out to a restaurant now, we don't even cook or any of that.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,260
My parents are too old to cook and I'm not going to subject anybody to my cooking.

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
And it was great.

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,020
We just got a little turkey roast and roasted it, chopped it up, put it on some bread, threw

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,620
on some cranberry sauce.

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Yum.

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
Called it good.

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,620
See, I told you it would be about food tonight.

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,980
But, I mean, Thanksgiving, it's like we have a holiday to worship food in the state.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,740
I guess there's other stuff, history, but it's food.

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,980
Let's celebrate giving an entire indigenous population diseases.

48
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Right.

49
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
With turkey.

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Anyway.

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,000
Also yesterday was Dan's birthday, so I got a Boston cream pie because he said don't get

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,880
me a cake, but I didn't want to get pie, so I got the true essence of cake pie, Boston

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
cream pie.

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Well, there you go.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,220
Well, happy birthday, Dan, even though he doesn't listen to this show, but I know that's

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,500
why you were out last week because the family had thrown him a party or something, right?

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,660
We went to Chicago Fire and ate pizza and it was a maze.

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Pizza is a maze.

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,660
You know what?

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Stuffed gross pizza.

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Uh huh.

62
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
Pretty damn good.

63
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,660
Pretty damn good.

64
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
Also pretty damn good.

65
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,460
Also eating pizza on tonight's program.

66
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,660
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

67
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,780
Yeah, I'm not eating Chicago Fire pizza.

68
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I know.

69
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
Nothing that fancy here at OLR.

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Oh, no.

71
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Fancy?

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,500
If you meant by fancy, terrible, then yes, that would be an accurate description of Chicago

74
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Fire's pizza.

75
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,940
Now, I realize we are a worldwide show.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,460
We are fortunate to have listeners in countries all over the world and all across America,

77
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,980
so not everybody may be familiar with this chain round table, but I consider them to

78
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,740
be on the higher end of pizza chains.

79
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,900
They're also on the higher end of prices.

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I kind of think you get what you pay for with them.

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,960
The pizza's pretty good.

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,060
It's way better than like fricking Papa John's or something.

83
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Sorry.

84
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,860
The stuffed gross pizza is actually pretty good.

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,020
The garlicky, chickeny one.

86
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,300
Chicago Fire is like a restaurant pizza.

87
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,460
That's even a step above.

88
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,460
That's where you got to get a booth.

89
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,460
I don't like their pizzas.

90
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,460
I really don't.

91
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I hate their pizzas.

92
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,740
Because I've had several different types of their pizzas and everyone like swears by

93
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,780
them and I just, I can't understand.

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,180
Now on the other hand though, their garlic fries are fucking awesome.

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,660
That is right.

96
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,040
So their garlic fries, props to them that, who would have thought that a pizza place

97
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,660
had you know, bitchin' garlic fries.

98
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,180
The pesto strips are pretty good too.

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,980
I love how it's the Thanksgiving episode of Orange Laundry or the post Thanksgiving episode

100
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,280
I suppose of Orange Laundry.

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,140
And here we are talking about pizza.

102
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,700
I think I already know the answer to this, but I will.

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
America.

104
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,420
I think I know the answer to this here in studio, but I'll pose the question anyway

105
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,980
and I'll ask it to you guys in our chat room as well.

106
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,180
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

107
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,460
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and you can participate with our show by heading

108
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:24,260
over to live.vognetwork.com and you can join the chat room and we read comments on the

109
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,260
air and take your questions and so forth as the show is going on.

110
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,420
We usually tape right after the Bobby Blackwell show, however he had the night off, partially

111
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,400
due to the holiday, partially due to football.

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,120
So Bobby was off tonight, but he'll be back next week.

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,580
So asking you guys, did you do anything for Black Friday?

114
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,960
I went to work.

115
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Did you?

116
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
You had to work on Black Friday?

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,580
Well, I guess a lot of people do.

118
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,140
I normally work on Fridays, so I had to work.

119
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,500
I guess I'm thankful for my office job.

120
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,020
I also refused to spend money on that day altogether.

121
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
So I spent nothing.

122
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,420
Good for you.

123
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,220
So it's been five years in a row where I haven't spent anything on that Friday.

124
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,260
I didn't get gas.

125
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,340
I got free air.

126
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,100
I'm trying to think if we bought anything on Black Friday.

127
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
I did not go out.

128
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,980
I will not fight crowds, but I will go to like Target at 8 o'clock at night because

129
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,180
it's just like a normal day.

130
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,460
After all the crazies have hit it up in the morning, then at like 8 o'clock at night,

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,740
like if I need to get like bread and eggs, it's just a normal day.

132
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
You know what I mean?

133
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,020
Whenever I get at Target.

134
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,360
We didn't go this time.

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,460
We usually go at night, but this year we managed to stay home.

136
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,900
Loki, how about you?

137
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,380
Did you get caught up in any of that madness?

138
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,860
No, I licked at stuff.

139
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,700
Window shopping, I guess.

140
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,260
But no, there's nothing really I need.

141
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,700
I mean, I don't need an Android tablet for $20 or whatever it is, you know.

142
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,980
I mean, I guess I could get one for my son to trash, but there may be one for my other

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
son to gnaw on.

144
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,020
But other than that, I didn't really need anything.

145
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Well, taking it to video games, which is in theory what this show is about, you know,

146
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,540
there's a lot of game sites having sales like, what, Blizzard was selling World of Warcraft

147
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,900
for like five bucks and the Diablo games for 20 a pop, the expansion.

148
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
What else was out there?

149
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,980
Steam having a big sale, which was to be expected, I'm sure.

150
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,300
Even I was looking at, oh, only $10 for Gauntlet.

151
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,500
There's supposed to be a big square sale with a lot of the Final Fantasy titles.

152
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
There is.

153
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,220
I think we have a story on that coming up a little later, so yeah, but that is the thing

154
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,380
as well where, you know, if you want to get Final Fantasy XIV's, another big MMO, I think

155
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,900
was like 15 bucks, or you could go back and get like Tomb Raider for dirt cheap or what

156
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
have you.

157
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,980
So, were you able to resist all the online temptations as well?

158
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,040
I only bought one game and, you know, as the Steam sale rules, you never buy anything unless

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,380
it's at least like 75% off or something like that or I don't remember what the number is,

160
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,060
but I waited until something was, I bought Civ V just because, you know, everybody's

161
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,660
been recommending it and I know a few people play it, so I just figured, okay, I'll get

162
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
that.

163
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,500
But honestly, I was looking at the Steam sale stuff and even kind of went through my wishlist

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,880
and stuff and I, you know, scrolling down the page now because I don't really like how

165
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,780
they did all the recommendations now because it's, a lot of stuff repeats on there, but.

166
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,020
Yeah, I kind of don't like the new Steam layout compared to the old one.

167
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,140
I get what they're trying to do with the personalization.

168
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
I don't like it.

169
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,340
Seriously, they even be like, you know, here's Fez and here's Fez two spots down and here's

170
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,940
Fez again in this side and it's like, okay, one, it already says it's in my library, so

171
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,700
I don't need to really see that, but that was the thing, it's like all these games on

172
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,980
sale, you know, a lot of them were in my library already and so I'm like, eh, I don't really

173
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,380
need to buy these.

174
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,980
And then also the other games, like some of the newer games that just come out, my laptop

175
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,020
probably can't run those very well, so if I'm looking to buy any like new age, you know,

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:02,420
new games like say, Dragon Age or, you know, I don't know, even, oh, what the hell's that

177
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Namco game?

178
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,060
I don't know, one of the other ones, but if I'm going to buy any of those, I'm going to

179
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,260
buy them on console where I know that these are going to run okay, so I'm not really going

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,860
to try to, you know, get, you know, was it, I know they had really insane discounts on

181
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,420
like, you know, the Shadow of Mordor.

182
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,660
Yeah, I was just going to say, I was almost tempted with the Shadows of Mordor, but it's

183
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,500
like, I've got enough stinking games to play right now.

184
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,260
We'll talk about our gaming lease in a minute, but it's like, I got enough right now.

185
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,300
Yeah, I got Civ V and then the only other thing I bought because it was just a decent

186
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,380
price is I paid, I beat the average on the Sega Humble Bundle.

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,780
Oh yeah, I got that too.

188
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,100
So that was like $350 for a ton of fucking games, including, you know, like the Dreamcast

189
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,700
Collection and fucking Knights and shit like that.

190
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I somehow did not have Space Channel 5 on PC, so when I saw that that was in that Humble

191
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,660
Bundle, I was like, gotta get that.

192
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,260
So yeah, I mean, that's really the only thing, and I'm, I don't know about you, Rob, you

193
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,980
might want to look, they have, was a weekly one now, is Pinball FX 2 tables.

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,220
I heard that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,380
So I mean, I was like, eh, I don't really play pinball, but I'm like, eh, maybe.

196
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
Maybe.

197
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
But I didn't.

198
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,660
So that's really, that's all I bought.

199
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,740
I did hover several times over purchasing Dragon Age Inquisition, but it's still full

200
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,900
price, and I just didn't want to do it.

201
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:28,260
And also Diablo 3, but on PlayStation 4 digitally, but I just didn't do it, because I just have,

202
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,860
I already have two games on Disa I haven't played yet.

203
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,740
I still have another one that I'm only partway through, and I have, you know, a few other

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,100
digital games I just bought that I don't need to buy anymore games.

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,700
It's gonna end up being like the Steam library in my PlayStation Network.

206
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah, that's where, that's where things are going.

207
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,620
I was gonna say, wait till Christmas, though, in the post, you know, winter holidays, it'll

208
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,380
get even cheaper, I bet, with all the unsold inventory that's still left.

209
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,620
Plus there's like fucking games that like, I backed on Kickstarter that I completely

210
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,660
forget have, you know, not come out yet, that I get keys for and stuff.

211
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Yeah.

212
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
So I don't know.

213
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,500
I'm just not buying a ton of stuff right now.

214
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,580
Let's look at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

215
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,620
Raginator says, Sky, Sky, Sky, dude, there's no such thing as enough games.

216
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,420
I suppose that's a good point there.

217
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Let's see.

218
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,060
Raginator also saying, I went balls to the wall in the Steam sale.

219
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,020
I spent a record $90.

220
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Yikes.

221
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,980
Tigerclaw saying, I didn't buy anything on Black Friday, but I did buy today Smash Brothers

222
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,340
Wii U and a Fox McCloud Amiibo.

223
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,220
He put an extra O on it and says Amiibo, but yeah, one of those Amiibos.

224
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,800
So he has a lot of people jumping on that, especially with, you know, Nintendo's kind

225
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,580
of big comeback or whatever you want to call it.

226
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Let's see.

227
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,540
My dad went out for Black Friday for a toaster.

228
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,300
No one was at his local mall, surprisingly.

229
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm really surprised because it seems like every time I log into YouTube after Black

230
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,260
Friday, it's like people dragging each other through the parking lot of Walmart for a $5

231
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
crock pot.

232
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,980
I almost wanted to buy a toaster this weekend because our toaster, one side of it's really

233
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,020
derpy and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

234
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,700
What's the big fucking deal with toasters this Black Friday?

235
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,060
Well, it's just, I meant to buy one.

236
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,760
It's not necessarily because it was Black Friday, but I just wanted to get a toaster

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,620
because I don't know.

238
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,700
Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture in chat, saying, figures that two weeks after I buy

239
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,460
an Xbox One, Best Buy has it 20 bucks less and a discount on a second controller.

240
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,860
Managed to get them to price match, but it was a hassle.

241
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,820
I was really close to getting an Xbox One when I saw that it was now like another $20

242
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,740
cheaper for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and all that.

243
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,900
Oh my gosh, I really had to resist.

244
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Really had to resist.

245
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,340
Well, it's not that, and I just want to be clear, I want to get an Xbox.

246
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,560
I want to support Microsoft's platform and get some of the exclusive games.

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,340
It's purely a financial thing.

248
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
You're still talking about dropping $300 plus.

249
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,700
And also I'm looking at the exclusive games right now.

250
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,060
Forza Horizon 2, I haven't played it yet and honestly I haven't missed it.

251
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,180
To be honest, I haven't missed Drive Club either.

252
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Luckily there's so much else out right now to divert my attention.

253
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm not missing it either.

254
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,780
When Crackdown comes out, that's going to be pretty tough.

255
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,020
Same with the Wii U.

256
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,620
When Zelda comes out, that's going to be kind of tough to not justify purchasing that system.

257
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,100
It's like, God, I really want to play that.

258
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,360
Right now I'm hoping, we have a contest at my work right now where they're giving away

259
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,060
an Xbox One as one of the prizes.

260
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm like, eh, that would be kind of cool if I win that.

261
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,180
Probably not going to, but it would be kind of cool.

262
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,700
That's like people are like, I have so much debt, but I bought a lottery ticket.

263
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,820
Unfortunately it's Assassin's Creed bundle, which I fucking hate Assassin's Creed.

264
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,900
You're being like one of those people that's like, I'm so in debt right now, but I bought

265
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
a lottery ticket.

266
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Here's hoping.

267
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,700
But see, I'm not spending any money.

268
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,460
It's a free contest, so you know, no risk.

269
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,660
Now before I get into our official kickoff topic tonight, SG100Matt is clarifying the

270
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
toaster situation.

271
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,420
SG100Matt in chat says, his toaster was borked and couldn't toast bagels properly.

272
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,740
This is a serious problem in a Jewish household.

273
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,940
That's why you get a toaster oven.

274
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,260
I know we have a toaster oven.

275
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,740
I'm like, we're not a Jewish household per se.

276
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,640
We just really fucking love bagels.

277
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,140
So we have a toaster oven.

278
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
So just saying.

279
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,500
Are you one of those, like they have seriously the fancy one at work where it's the one,

280
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,320
like they have almost like the bagel shop where you put it into one side and it rolls

281
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,820
across the little oven.

282
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,400
And we'll look at you, mister, I was laid off and now I got this new job and they have

283
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
fancy toaster ovens.

284
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,960
They have a fancy cafe.

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,640
They have fancy cafes there that I buy my fancy Red Bulls during the day.

286
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,480
We have a fancy cafe too at Locat.

287
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Not where I'm at.

288
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,880
We have a cafe, but I wouldn't call it fancy anyway.

289
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Enough talk about that.

290
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Wood fired pizza, Rob.

291
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,260
I wish we have, I can get like a chicken strip basket.

292
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Is that a delicacy?

293
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I don't know.

294
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm going to take you guys to my work one day and just feed you.

295
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,640
All right, moving on.

296
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,780
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

297
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,400
This is an interesting article that was making the rounds on the blogs this week and it originally

298
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:15,200
comes from the site MCVUK.com and they ran a story about the co-founder of the games

299
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
workshop and the government's creative industries champion.

300
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,040
This is Ian Livingstone and some comments that he made this week at the first BFI video

301
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,880
games day in London.

302
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,680
This was the interesting quote he said.

303
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,400
Because you just bought Civilization V, Loki.

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,840
See if you catch the reference here.

305
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,920
Now is the second golden age of games.

306
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,560
As you know, when your civilization enters the golden age, you get increased production.

307
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Oh, forget it.

308
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Forget it.

309
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
All right.

310
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Now is the second golden age of games.

311
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,880
Anybody can make a game in their own creative, cultural way in a less formulaic way than

312
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,220
some console games in order to find new audiences.

313
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,780
He went on to talk about games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Minecraft,

314
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,800
even Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans, which is a big one on the iOS and I believe Android,

315
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,460
talking about games that have broadened gaming's audience and brought more people into gaming,

316
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,100
especially when you talk about something like Candy Crush Saga.

317
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,100
I would even add games like Words with Friends and Farmville to that list, bringing in a

318
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,940
demographic that wasn't always a quote-e-quote gamer.

319
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,220
He did say that there is still work to be done, saying games have always had a bad press.

320
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,340
Since the invention of chess, history has not been kind to games.

321
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,660
Grand Theft Auto V was the absolute embodiment of science meeting art.

322
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,220
It should have been put at the forefront of the British games industry as a success, but

323
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,340
instead it was castigated by the mainstream press.

324
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,260
So there you go.

325
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,060
And he also mentioned the mobile market as a cause for concern, saying, I love this quote,

326
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,060
for every Angry Birds, there's 20 million dead birds out there.

327
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,380
Meaning all those clones and knockoffs and everybody wants a piece of the pie when something

328
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
gets big.

329
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:06,740
But let's go back to his comments about, we are in a second golden age of video games.

330
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,220
What do you guys think of when you hear that?

331
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,900
And I'm going to pose this to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

332
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,980
What do you guys think when you hear that?

333
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,780
Do you tend to agree that we are experiencing a second golden age of games?

334
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,900
Because I know for a while there, like even just a year or two on this show, we were talking

335
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:27,140
about that it seemed like another video game crisis or crash akin to what we saw Atari

336
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,180
go through in 84 was imminent.

337
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,820
Are we in a golden age?

338
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
What do you think, Logie?

339
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,420
I don't think we're going to have a crash because there's just too many independents.

340
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
That's the thing.

341
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,380
You don't have, you know, big publishers kind of ruling everything.

342
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,500
Now you have, you know, people just fucking fed up with publishers and they're leaving

343
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,060
their development companies and starting their own developing companies and hell,

344
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,700
you know, it's easy now, you know, probably way easier than it was back in the 80s, you

345
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,340
know, to start your own development house and build your own games because you don't

346
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,140
fucking have to build motherboards anymore.

347
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,300
You just fucking download a game engine or learn a language and you can output to, you

348
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,500
know, iOS or Android or PC and relatively easy.

349
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,860
And so you can kind of take those creative ideas and run with them.

350
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
DarkSocker, what do you think?

351
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,580
Are we in a golden age of gaming?

352
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,460
I wouldn't necessarily say a golden age.

353
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:29,700
I just say that we're in a, I would probably say a, a hybrid metal stage, hybrid metal,

354
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
semi-precious.

355
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,340
I think that it's, it's exactly what Logie said.

356
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,780
I think that we've got definitely a lot of, uh, I'm going to say it's actually the

357
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,940
age of the small business in gaming where you've got independent developers getting

358
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,140
in, basically sticking it to the man and being successful.

359
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,460
I was just gonna say, yeah, cause you can have like a company try to do, you know,

360
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,380
really shady, stupid things like EA, um, and you know, have that totally flop in

361
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,340
the whole industry is not going to crash because of it.

362
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,500
To be fair, EA has kind of been sitting in the background this year.

363
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,460
I think EA took their licks and they're kind of, you know, they, they've let other

364
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,100
guys take a beating this year, you know, and it, and we've even talked about this

365
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,140
before where it seems like all the big companies kind of cycle through and

366
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,980
somebody's getting a beat.

367
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,300
Yeah.

368
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,900
Okay.

369
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,460
Who's had it worse this year, Logie?

370
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,540
EA or Ubisoft?

371
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,260
Recently within the last few months, Ubisoft, EA, let's look at the track record here.

372
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,180
They implemented their wonderful, uh, EA service where you pay $30 to get demos of

373
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,060
games now, and also they've basically blocking their games from being part of,

374
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,980
you know, any of the free deals that you get on PlayStation network or on, um, you

375
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,020
know, games of gold because, you know, they want pieces of the pie, of course.

376
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,660
And because of them, they're probably gonna see more, you know, um, segregation

377
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,940
with, you know, different, I can totally see Ubisoft and Activision following suit

378
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,060
and having their own services where, you know, XML money per year, nobody's

379
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,900
to get their games.

380
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,500
Um, so there's that, yes, I understand that Ubisoft's games, the least last

381
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,740
couple of them have been pretty Rocky at launch, but I just think that there's

382
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,060
just, I don't know, especially in the mobile side, you know, cause you don't

383
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,300
see that with Ubisoft that much and mobile site, there's some really shady

384
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,780
shit that they've done, you know, with the whole, um, now I'm not sure if this is

385
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,180
last year at this point, but you know, with fucking, um, was a dungeon keeper

386
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,740
and that kind of stuff.

387
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,580
I mean, it just really, they really hoard those microtransactions and I

388
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,260
guess they, they can do it, but it's kind of, you know, soils, some of these, you

389
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,820
know, popular franchises that they're bringing back lots of comments in our

390
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,980
chat room, uh, over at live.vognetware.com.

391
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,180
Dungeon buster saying there wasn't going to be a crash.

392
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,220
The market's too diversified for it now because the tools

393
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,540
are in everyone's hands.

394
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,780
ActDef saying, I think we're in a video game Renaissance right now.

395
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,580
I like that word.

396
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,820
Um, Johnny B 79 saying, I don't think we have another golden age going.

397
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,020
Wait until 2015.

398
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,060
Maybe it's the Indies age.

399
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,940
Uh, S200Matt saying gaming has its many problems, but I don't

400
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,180
think it will crash as a whole.

401
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,340
Are we in a golden age?

402
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,780
I don't know.

403
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,060
I think we won't know about that until time has passed enough for

404
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,900
us to look back at this time.

405
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,180
Well, and look at like, you know, look at what these big

406
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,740
companies are putting out now.

407
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,740
I mean, it's basically franchises, yearly franchises seem to be the

408
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,140
case, you know, like with Ubisoft and Sasses Creed and near the kind

409
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,100
of trying to get new franchises that they can have yearly additions of

410
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,620
because they think that's, what's going to sell, but look at some of

411
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,860
the, you know, these indie games that are getting a ton of attention.

412
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,380
Like even with, you know, the E3 press conferences and stuff,

413
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,180
Indies seem to be the forefront of a lot of these presentations

414
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,660
because they're unique games.

415
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,540
It's different.

416
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,540
You're not going to see, Oh, cool.

417
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,700
Madden's out again this year or, Oh, cool.

418
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,940
You know, another call of duty or, you know, Oh cool.

419
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,460
Another, I don't know, Loki Kevin Spacey though.

420
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,180
Hey, Kevin Spacey's awesome.

421
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,620
People got pretty excited about Kevin Spacey.

422
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,420
He's pretty awesome.

423
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,660
And you know, the game is fun, but comparing it to last year's game.

424
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,580
I mean, that was a really, you know, low mark the hit cause Ghost wasn't very good.

425
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,540
Uh, whereas black ops two is pretty good.

426
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,620
And if I was to compare this to black ops two, it's pretty similar, you know,

427
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,180
the style of game, but, you know, they've added a few different, you know, mobility

428
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,180
things that make it a little interesting, but it's not completely new game.

429
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,060
It's just a little different.

430
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,460
Right.

431
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,220
So, um, but you know, and, and I applaud, you know, like battlefield, you know,

432
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,860
doing battlefield hardline, you know, that's kind of cool.

433
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,580
It's different.

434
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,580
You know, instead of just throwing out another military shooter again.

435
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,900
Um, so I'm kind of down with that, but it's still though.

436
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
They're trying to, a lot of the times they're just put out these yearly

437
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,740
releases and it just seems like not a lot of efforts going into them.

438
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,020
And it kind of shows in the reviews even like, um, you know, I think NBA

439
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,900
live though this year did a little bit better than last year, but it was just

440
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,340
kind of, eh, you know, it's like, why even bother with some of these?

441
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,500
I sort of feel like video game right now is at a bit of a crossroads.

442
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,620
I definitely see the whole rise of indie development and it does seem

443
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,380
like it's so much more accessible now for people to go in and create their

444
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,620
own games because you, it's not just that the tools are there to necessarily

445
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,980
create games because the tools to create games have been there for a very long

446
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,340
time.

447
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,460
Like I think of, you know, going all the way back to the Apple two E and the

448
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,780
Commodore 64 days, you know, the stuff that us 30 something's played when we

449
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,140
were in elementary school, right.

450
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,700
You know, I remember you could type in and you could make your own programs.

451
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,420
So we even learned about doing things like, um, what was that drawing program

452
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,060
with the turtles?

453
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,740
That logo?

454
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,100
Turtle.

455
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,980
Or is it just called true?

456
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,060
I thought that it might have been logo.

457
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,340
I don't remember programming writers, logo writers, something like that.

458
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,540
I mean, but that was, that was how we learned logic and programming at a young

459
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,220
age, right?

460
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,260
Was, that was the big thing.

461
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,140
I don't even know if that's something they still do.

462
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,860
I hope they do.

463
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,820
That's pretty awesome.

464
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,180
And I completely retained none of that, but, uh, you know, what was the name of

465
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,420
that game that really influenced me as a child, Oregon trail?

466
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,260
I remember going to the computer labs, you know, with the monochrome green

467
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,740
screens and stuff, but, uh, yeah, it was just, it's like logo.

468
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Don't even remember that it was all, you know, Carmen, San Diego and Oregon trail.

469
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,220
I mean, that, that's all we played, right?

470
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,540
Yeah, but, but learning how to program in, in logo and the turtle drawing and all

471
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,020
that stuff is, is so important because learning about like, if then and logic

472
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,540
and things like going into my job that I do now or, or something I used to a few

473
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,980
years ago, I don't do it so much now, but I used to write a lot of policy

474
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,860
documents and a lot of that same like logic gating comes into play.

475
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,660
And it's like, you learned that at a young age.

476
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,220
I think it would be cool if they did teach, have even just like a programming

477
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,780
course in and, and do with games.

478
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,180
I think games would be a good way.

479
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,020
Cause it's something that's interesting to that age group.

480
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
Cause they kind of do that.

481
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,420
Logie, I think like in my junior high school, that was like an

482
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,660
elective we were able to take.

483
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:02,940
Yeah.

484
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,100
Cause I don't know if they do that.

485
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,380
Oh, at least when I went to high school, they didn't have anything like that.

486
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,380
Uh, they only had like typing, you know, it was like typing and typing too.

487
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,740
And, and so it's like, okay, you know, that's kind of dumb, but it would be

488
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,780
cool if they had that, um, I'd be down with that anyway.

489
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,260
I got a little tangenty, sorry.

490
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,900
Um, so I feel like on computers, that's always been something we could do, but

491
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,820
you know, when consoles came out, when like, like, let's say even the Atari

492
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,260
2600 or the Nintendo entertainment system, like, No, you couldn't

493
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,220
just make your own Nintendo game.

494
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,700
I mean, some people did and could, but that was something you really had

495
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,580
to have the tools to be able to do.

496
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,500
But now you're seeing more and more as we enter this more digital era where,

497
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,060
you know, even on, you know, PlayStation four, not only is the marketplace more

498
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,180
opened up for these smaller publishers to put their own creations directly on

499
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:00,420
the store, be that Apple's app store, Android store, um, uh, steam, you know,

500
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,700
those types of services, or even now you're seeing more and more of it on

501
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,780
Wii U, PlayStation, Xbox, like those are really opening up as well.

502
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,700
And it just seems like even within games themselves, there's

503
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,300
more tools to create games.

504
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,140
And I'm talking about things like things like twine, right?

505
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,980
Which, you know, is a big, popular, uh, people create their own text

506
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,260
adventure games and so forth.

507
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,940
Or even something like little big planet.

508
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,620
I would argue in a way as a game creation, like just last week, we were

509
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,900
talking about that somebody had what recreated final fantasy seven within

510
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,180
little big planet, and there's so much you can learn about making a game from

511
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,180
developing your own level of little big planet.

512
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,380
Like we have more games now that allow you to make games.

513
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,500
It's a, it's a, it's a very meta world that we're in right now

514
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,220
in gaming in that regard.

515
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah, definitely.

516
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,740
I think it'd be cool to see, like, you know, uh, I would love to see like,

517
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,580
you know, Mario maker and stuff to have that actually a little bit more

518
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,140
advanced to where you could sell level packs and stuff where you can, you know,

519
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,540
kind of advertise your stuff and make, you know, have a marketplace for that

520
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,660
kind of stuff would be pretty cool.

521
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,540
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetware.com many, many chatters

522
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,180
and they're confirming it is logo.

523
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,900
We've got linked to the Wikipedia articles.

524
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,020
That was a, you see, but now see logo meant something else 20 years ago.

525
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,620
And now I'm like, Oh, that's what channel RuPaul's Drag Race comes on as logo.

526
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,500
But you know, now it's a little different now.

527
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,020
Anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com, um, talking about,

528
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,780
uh, Akuma JP saying, I hate to say this, but good indie is good, but

529
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,700
too many garbage around now.

530
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,820
I'm kind of sick of it.

531
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Well, that's what the guy was talking about in his, his car in his speech was

532
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,820
that, you know, for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.

533
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,140
There is a lot of garbage out there.

534
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah.

535
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,860
And there's a lot of garbage even on steam and it's just, it's people.

536
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,300
I don't even, I think I would like to think that it's just

537
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,460
people trying to cash in quickly.

538
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,820
You know, there, there has been in a lot of these developers.

539
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,820
Um, they're not, they're not, they're not professional in their game making.

540
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,220
They're not professional in the way they interact with the community and,

541
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,900
you know, the press and that kind of stuff.

542
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:20,700
Um, so I think that there's some of those out there, but legitimately, I think a lot

543
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,260
of people are actually trying, you know, to get stuff on there and they're not

544
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,100
trying to just throw some crap together to get people to buy, you know, their game

545
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,580
and then never update it again, just make a quick buck because that's only going to

546
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,340
work once.

547
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,620
I mean, you're not going to be able to pull that trick off twice.

548
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,580
So I don't know.

549
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,020
It's, there, there have been some pretty terrible games, but that's what peer

550
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,300
review, that's reviews for.

551
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,980
That's why they have, you know, ratings.

552
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,820
There is that, but I would even argue that, you know, some people are there just to

553
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,380
cash in.

554
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,140
We know that, but some people can also learn something from a quote unquote,

555
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,860
terrible game.

556
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,500
Like look at some of the like funny little joke projects.

557
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,140
I use, I use that term loosely that we've talked about on OLR lately.

558
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,540
For instance, you know, let's talk, let's talk about Bobby while he's not here.

559
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,580
Cause there was that whole flappy vog thing that he did on the website, right?

560
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,820
Which you can still go and play.

561
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,180
And you know, it was, it was a silly version of flappy bird that we all got to

562
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,980
get involved with and lend our voices to.

563
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,220
But think about everything that he learned from that project.

564
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,460
He learned about developing unity on the web.

565
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,660
He learned about how to interface it with the vog website that he built because, you

566
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,300
know, there's the high score table that's built in.

567
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,580
It does the loot and all that stuff.

568
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,140
Like, you know, he can take that knowledge and use it on something else.

569
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,540
Yeah.

570
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,140
Or even, um, you know, Aaron had called in a couple of weeks ago talking about the

571
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,900
pixel shits game that he made, which we loved because that was, uh, spurned off an

572
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,060
idea here at orange launch radio, which by the way, I have to make sure I give this

573
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,020
a shout out at some point.

574
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,820
I'm so sorry to be so tangenty, but I don't want to forget this.

575
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,300
You have to check out this user on Twitter.

576
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,780
It's a click rocks, C L I C K R O C K S because earlier this week he actually

577
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:03,260
tweeted a box art that he made for pixel shits for Y Y R in the vein of inventory.

578
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
I just brought up here in the studio, it's awesome.

579
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,540
And Aaron saw it and loved it.

580
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,380
I sent it to him on Twitter and that was a learning project for Aaron too.

581
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:11,580
Yeah.

582
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,900
It's a learning project for him, but it's also another thing too, is it boils down

583
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,980
how simple a game can be and it can be fun.

584
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,860
And sometimes the most simple things look at the games that were on the

585
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,420
Atari's 2,600, they like literally had some of them one objective, you know, and

586
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,860
this one is, you know, make shits on the ground to stop the joggers that, and

587
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,860
that, and that's literally, and a lot of times like the crazy thing about pixel

588
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,220
shits is like, it really is not a bad gift for a joke project.

589
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,220
It's a really authentic 2,600 game.

590
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,940
Like I could have, I mean, I don't think it would have been a game about shit on

591
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,100
the 2,600, but that's what makes it funny.

592
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,340
But I could see this same idea where you're leaving, I don't know, sand traps

593
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,500
on the ground for people, pixel twigs and berries on the ground, you know, I could

594
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,140
see this like as an actual game on the 2,600 pixel squish, pixel squish, the

595
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,180
family channel version of the game.

596
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,300
Anyway, tangenty, but, uh, but good stuff.

597
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,100
All right.

598
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,660
Um, there you go.

599
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,620
So, uh, we would invite your emails on this, uh, at a future date over

600
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,900
at, uh, participate at orangeontrader.com.

601
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,820
If you want to email us on that, but in the meantime, we got to get to tonight's

602
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,660
news and I also want to start off tonight's show as we always do talking

603
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,340
about how was your gaming week and what video games have you been playing this

604
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,820
week, dark Sakura, I have two weeks worth of games.

605
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,180
Um, I have dragon age inquisition, of course, which I'm starting over because

606
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,180
I might've screwed up my soulless romance, which I know is going to make me cry.

607
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,420
It's already been kind of spoiled for me.

608
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,860
Um, but that's okay.

609
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,900
Cause I'm doing it anyway.

610
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,060
Um, I'm playing a, uh, elven mage.

611
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,140
So that was fun.

612
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,700
Uh, I also have been, uh, I actually played some final fantasy 14 earlier last week,

613
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,900
but I haven't touched it since inquisition came out.

614
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,860
Um, I played some other stuff though.

615
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,980
Um, I played some, uh, bejeweled.

616
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,820
I got that ingress thing, but I'm too lazy to go walk around my neighborhood.

617
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,740
So I haven't done anything with it.

618
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,500
It was just pretty.

619
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,700
So I just started looking at the colors for awhile and it was like, Oh, going crazy.

620
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,020
Did you really get into that?

621
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
I just got the game.

622
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,980
I haven't done much in it as in anything.

623
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,540
You signed up for green team, right?

624
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,460
Yes.

625
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:26,780
Good.

626
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,300
Um, cause I remember you saying that you hated the Smurfs.

627
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
I, I did that then.

628
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,100
Um, there's some listeners of the show.

629
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,020
I know play ingress and happen to be service.

630
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,100
I don't want to hate Smurfs.

631
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,260
Hey, it's a strong word.

632
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,340
They just annoy me.

633
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,340
And there's one guy here locally that really annoys me.

634
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,900
Ah, that's the game.

635
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,420
That's the game.

636
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,940
That's the game.

637
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,820
Okay.

638
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,540
Um, I also picked up, um, crap now I forgot the name of it.

639
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Um, and it's not injection or something.

640
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:05,940
It's, um, I can remember what the, it was something I got actually for, uh, my, uh,

641
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,420
for Mac and now for the life of me.

642
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,700
I can't remember what it was called, but it's on steam as well.

643
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,220
And then, um, I picked up, uh, crap, man.

644
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,860
I forgot what it was.

645
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,340
Oh yeah.

646
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,460
A game called mountain.

647
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,220
It's 99 cents and it's not really a game.

648
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,020
You're just a mountain, a mountain floating in the sky and you can spin

649
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:33,660
around and you can move all around the mountain, but it's a mountain.

650
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,180
Just floating there.

651
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,780
You're a mountain in the mountain.

652
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,780
No, you are, you are the mountain mountain, but you can spin.

653
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,180
How does a mountain spin?

654
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,380
It's floating in the air.

655
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,460
It's a floating mountain.

656
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,020
All right.

657
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,620
The clouds, it has clouds too.

658
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,460
And rain noises.

659
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,580
It's just, it actually is super relaxing.

660
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,660
I'm surprised.

661
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,500
I would think a game like volcano would be more up your alley.

662
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,180
Uh, that would be my version of it.

663
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,580
Yeah.

664
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,340
But no, it's 99 cents.

665
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,220
It's worth the dollar just to look at it for the novelty sake.

666
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,540
You paid a whole dollar for that whole dollar for that.

667
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:19,980
I Rob, I spent $4 on you today and a dollar on Allen, but I'm worth it.

668
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,620
A mountain though, mountains you climb.

669
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,140
All right.

670
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,020
Anyway, enough about the mountains.

671
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,940
Let's talk to Loki.

672
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,700
How was your gaming week?

673
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,340
My gaming week is now involving me filling out that claim form for free red bowl.

674
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,220
Hell yeah.

675
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,060
They'll say it was months ago.

676
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,700
Well, I just remembered about it and you can still fill it out.

677
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,340
So maybe I'll have to do that too.

678
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,700
Uh, anyways, so this week I played a few things.

679
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,420
I did get around to playing some call of duty.

680
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,300
So I played that.

681
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:56,100
I think it leveled up cause they had double XP this weekend from like 19 to I think 25.

682
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,540
So that was pretty fun.

683
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Um, I actually played on a few maps.

684
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,700
I haven't played yet, so I thought I had seen them all because it, I guess it just

685
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,500
doesn't cycle through them very well.

686
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,060
But I have got the two different maps that I haven't played.

687
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:15,060
And then, um, I played actually quite a bit of Lego Marvel superheroes.

688
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,300
Um, I think I went through about three or four levels, mainly because my son kept

689
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,060
making me watch there's this, um, has like, was it maximum overload and Lego

690
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,980
Marvel superheroes, maximum overload, which is a, it's like a web series slash movie.

691
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,340
It's like 20 minutes long and he's watched it about 10 times in the last three days.

692
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:42,300
And, um, so it's hilarious and Troy Baker is, you know, in it.

693
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,900
So, you know, Troy Baker, all the things.

694
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,020
And, um, you know, apparently he actually, I didn't realize he does

695
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,340
several voices in the game.

696
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,660
So he does Loki and he also does, uh, Hawkeye.

697
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,060
So cool.

698
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,700
And, um, the story's weird, but I'm going with it.

699
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,140
And, uh, so yeah, I played that and enjoying it.

700
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,420
Although once I'm done, I'm probably never gonna play it again.

701
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,860
And then Grand Theft Auto five, I played a little bit of that, got through some

702
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,780
more missions on that and, uh, I was trying.

703
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,260
So this is the only thing I don't like about the PlayStation four and it's good

704
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,820
for, it's probably good for this reason.

705
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,140
But for me, you know, the hacking, cracking, modding type, I don't enjoy it

706
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,980
because there's no way to remove updates from games, um, unless you, so I have to

707
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,700
delete the whole game and redownload it in order to remove updates because there

708
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,020
was an exploit that you could do with the stock market where you can basically buy

709
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,060
and sell some stock that's negative and it keeps giving you money and I wanted the

710
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,620
cheat so I can get more money so that, you know,

711
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,380
But they sell money online, right?

712
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,260
Well, they do sell money for Grand Theft Auto online, but not for the single

713
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,260
player game. And here's the thing though, is actually, that's not such a big deal

714
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,140
because I, I did pre-order the game, um, digitally.

715
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,500
So I'm supposed to get $500,000 for my characters, but I haven't gotten to the

716
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
point in the game where it gives me that.

717
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,900
So, um, it would be nice to have that now, but whatever.

718
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,180
I guess later on, once I get all three characters and it's going to give it to me

719
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,340
for all three characters.

720
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,740
Is this the downside to you having bought digitally?

721
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,980
Because if you'd bought that game on disc, you could have just unplugged yourself on

722
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,540
the internet and done that, right?

723
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,940
Uh, never updated the game.

724
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,660
And no, it's still a download the update.

725
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,980
I would probably be able to download the app or delete the update and it would be a

726
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,540
lot faster to just be able to install it.

727
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,540
But now I have to redownload, you know, 50 gigs worth of game.

728
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,940
And honestly, it's just not worth it.

729
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,380
I just, I'll play it, you know, the regular way, but it's just, I've played the game

730
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,020
before a hundred percent and completed everything.

731
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,420
And I know how long it takes and I'm kind of like, you know, I want to get a hundred

732
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,060
percent so I can start doing, you know, the Easter egg hunting stuff again, cause that

733
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,700
was kind of fun.

734
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,380
And hopefully they have more, you know, it's actually finished in this version of the

735
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,380
game, but you know, I, I don't really want to have to do everything again.

736
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,980
I want it to be as quickly as possible.

737
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,220
I want to cheat through everything because I've already done it and I just don't want

738
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,420
to have to, you know, work through getting a hundred percent on everything again.

739
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,540
Cause it was a pain in the ass the last time.

740
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,940
So yeah, that's, that's why I'm doing that.

741
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,140
But, um, whatever, I'll just play it.

742
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
I'm just, I haven't been going back to it very much.

743
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,700
So that's the thing is I thought I'd be really playing a lot more of it.

744
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,380
I still haven't even played Grand Theft Auto online.

745
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,420
You haven't transferred my characters over yet, but I probably will at some point.

746
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,540
Um, but I just, I'm kind of waiting for them to put out an expansion.

747
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,940
They're supposed to do it now that, you know, the new games come out, maybe when the

748
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,100
PC version comes out, but I really need a single player expansion.

749
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,380
All right.

750
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Crossing my fingers for you.

751
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,140
I did also forget about playing Smash Brothers on Wii U.

752
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,620
Oh yeah.

753
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,580
How did you enjoy that?

754
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,380
It was eight players of madness.

755
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,020
Eight players is kind of crazy on like, it depends on how big your TV is, I suppose.

756
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,860
But I seem to remember you guys have a pretty big TV, but imagine playing eight

757
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,940
players on our littler TV in there.

758
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,180
It's, it's kind of crazy.

759
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,660
We tried doing that and it's like, oh my gosh, just four players is great.

760
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,260
Eight players.

761
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,660
You got to have the right setup for that.

762
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,940
Yeah, but I forgot to mention it.

763
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,300
That's, that's where, um, Jonas's and Diego's, uh, anime game room team can get

764
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,340
us a projection screen or something that's big enough.

765
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,220
That's that would be my hope.

766
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,220
Um, let's see, a chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.

767
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,460
Johnny B 79 says, Rob, are you playing final fantasy 14 and wow.

768
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,820
Plus dragon age.

769
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,500
Geez, you got a hectic schedule.

770
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Um, actually the answer to that question is kind of yes.

771
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,860
Um, I did play some dragon age inquisition this week, but not a lot.

772
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,980
Uh, that game took a little bit of a back seat this week.

773
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Um, and yeah, luckily I've not had work since Thursday.

774
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,700
Cause, uh, my office job affords me, you know, the four days that, um, a lot of,

775
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,020
you know, banks and so forth get for this holiday.

776
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,660
So I've had a lot of time to kind of sit on my butt and play

777
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,820
video games, which has been great.

778
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,540
So yeah, I have been able to play a couple of MMOs.

779
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,380
So let's talk first about that.

780
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,620
If you follow me on Twitter, uh, then you probably saw earlier this week.

781
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,940
I did succumb to the fact that I knew I was going to be going back to

782
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,580
world of Warcraft because I've heard nothing but great things about this new

783
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,220
expansion.

784
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,420
So yes, I re signed up for world of Warcraft and I've been playing that

785
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,020
quite a bit over the past few days.

786
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,140
Um, which is funny cause I know Irene was here last week.

787
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm filling in for Jamie.

788
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,060
We, we had a bit of a deep discussion that kind of went to a dark place

789
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,420
a little bit on world of Warcraft.

790
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,900
We're talking about some of the negatives of it.

791
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,780
Cause I believe Irene said.

792
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,940
She, she didn't say the word hate.

793
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,380
She's another very strong word.

794
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,460
And she used to play Warcraft all the time, but now she couldn't stand it.

795
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,900
And it was just kind of interesting to talk about that and the social dynamic,

796
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,140
but all that stuff aside, I've been hearing nothing but great things about

797
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,980
Warlords of Draenor.

798
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,300
So I was like, all right, what the hell?

799
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,060
I've got some time here off work.

800
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,500
Blizzard has announced their Black Friday sales.

801
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,860
Warlords of Draenor isn't on it.

802
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,180
So let's just, let's just buy the damn thing.

803
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,140
Let's get in there and see what's going on.

804
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:05,340
So, um, I have leveled an Alliance character up to 94, just shy of 95 and a

805
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,300
Horde character up to about 91, um, just because I wanted to get my garrison

806
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,620
triggered on the Horde character.

807
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,660
Um, and, um,

808
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,260
Is it you didn't use your redemption code?

809
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,900
I, my 90 boost, I haven't yet.

810
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,140
No, the, my character to get boosted to 90.

811
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,780
I'm waiting to see what I want to do with that because I have a tune on one server,

812
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,300
Proudmoore, where I used to know a lot of people that played, but almost everybody

813
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,540
that was on Proudmoore left for another server.

814
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,580
Um, so I have my Alliance tune on a server, Blade's Edge, and that's where the guys

815
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,940
from gamebuoy.org play and some of their friends.

816
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,940
So that's why I've kind of been focusing on that server because I know people that

817
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
are actively playing there.

818
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,460
I know who you're playing.

819
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,820
Yeah.

820
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,140
Uh, and so my holy pally, yes, that's, that's the character I'm working on right

821
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,340
now.

822
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:57,140
So my 90 boost, what I'm sitting on that is maybe I'll find out I have some friends

823
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,780
somewhere else.

824
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,140
In fact, already on Twitter, another podcasting friend of mine is like, you

825
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,220
should come to Earthen Ring because we have a guild over here on Horde side.

826
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,260
So I'm saving that 90 boost for when I need a character on a server.

827
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,220
That way I don't have to pay to transfer one of the ones I have, if that makes

828
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,380
sense.

829
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,860
That makes sense.

830
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,580
So, um, just waiting for that to happen.

831
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,540
I kind of want to don't get super, I don't really want to get super married to Wow

832
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,180
though.

833
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,900
I don't know if I want to get into the whole rating a couple of times a week and

834
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,580
all that again.

835
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,100
I just don't know if my life is compatible with that anymore, but I will say just

836
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,940
on the pure standpoint of the expansion leveling from one to, or excuse me, from

837
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,740
90 to a hundred and the whole bit, I am pretty impressed at this expansion.

838
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,500
This expansion really is the best one they've had since at least Lich King.

839
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,740
It knocks the other two, Cataclysm and Pandaria knocks them out of the water.

840
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,300
Um, and a lot of that is that they've really made the experience very cinematic.

841
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,980
I was very surprised by, you know, you get right into the action and then you're in

842
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,620
an arena fighting a hundred people and fighting them off and then somebody's

843
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,780
yelling, run, run to the docks.

844
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,540
And you, you're having to get your characters, who's got a speed boost and

845
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,940
running through all this madness as fast as possible.

846
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,420
Like they've really taken some steps in this very old engine to make it very

847
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,060
cinematic.

848
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,380
And, um, you know, when you get introduced to the orcs that make up the iron horde

849
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,180
and the important players in the storyline, now the camera will pan by them and the

850
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,060
title will come up and you know, it'll be like Khadgar, you know?

851
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,300
And so, so you have a little bit of a name to a face and that whole thing.

852
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,460
So there's a very cinematic approach to it, which is something that I've really

853
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,340
loved in Final Fantasy 14.

854
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,300
So I kind of love that, you know, Warcraft is upping the ante in that regard.

855
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,220
Um, I've done a little bit of the dungeons.

856
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,900
I did the first two dungeons, the iron docks and the slag mines, I think it's

857
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,260
called.

858
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,740
Um, that's the only downside to the expansion I can think of so far.

859
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,900
It's not that the dungeons were necessarily bad.

860
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,780
But it's that there is still a lot of toxic people playing World of Warcraft.

861
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,460
And I know we just had a story last week about World of Warcraft subscribers

862
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,380
numbers are back up.

863
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,260
Well, I think a lot of the toxic people came back because I was running with, uh,

864
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,300
talking about gameboy.org, I was running with Captain Spike and First Mate

865
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,740
Slidekick.

866
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,180
We were running one of those dungeons together and Slidekick hadn't tanked a

867
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,460
dungeon in a very long time.

868
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,420
So he was taking it a little bit slow and somebody spoke up and said, you know, um,

869
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,100
well, if this retarded tank would go any faster.

870
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,500
And I was just, I just typed in all caps, dude, like, calm down.

871
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,660
So we're going a little slower.

872
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,700
It's not like a snail's pace.

873
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,580
Like, do you have to jump out and start like yelling at people and calling them

874
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,220
names?

875
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,740
And it's like, oh my God.

876
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,740
That's just when they vote kick.

877
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,460
Well, we do.

878
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,940
Here's the other crazy part.

879
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,700
We tried to vote kick because we have three people, right?

880
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,340
So we should be able to go get a vote kick through.

881
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,740
No, you need four.

882
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,700
And the other pug voted against it.

883
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,900
So we weren't able to kick the person.

884
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,300
So not only, I mean, it would be one thing if there was a toxic player and everybody

885
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,580
else was like, fuck you boot, but this guy was able to stay around.

886
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,620
Now I realized I can't really point and say this is Blizzard's fault because it's

887
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,220
not, you know, it's the toxic environment and it's the people that need to be dealt

888
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,460
with.

889
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,540
But I have to call it out as something that made me a little bit sad because I feel

890
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:23,900
like when WoW was at its worst, the player base that stuck with it, God love them at

891
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,340
least would not resort to this kind of crap.

892
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,740
So just don't be a dick if you're playing these online games or any game in general.

893
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,140
Just don't be a dick.

894
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,420
What?

895
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,620
It's going to take five more minutes to get through a dungeon.

896
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,180
Calm your tits.

897
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,540
Anyway, so otherwise though, they expect the Garrison's super addicting, even though

898
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,700
it's kind of like a big Facebook game that they've worked into.

899
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,100
Wow.

900
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,740
It's great that as you're working on your Garrison or as I call it, Mr.

901
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,500
Garrison, as I'm working on my Mr.

902
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:55,900
Garrison, that I will get rewards like gold or I will get rewards like experience for

903
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,860
my character or that I can build this enchanting hunt that will disenchant my

904
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,660
things for me and give me, it's like even though I didn't level this profession, I

905
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,940
could have access to it anyway.

906
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,420
So it really simplified a lot of things in that regard.

907
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,300
So there's a lot of really neat things that they did in Draenor.

908
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,100
Overall, at the end of the day, though, am I going to run away from Final Fantasy 14?

909
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,940
No, because the games are really different and there's still a lot, a lot, a lot I

910
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,780
really enjoy about Final Fantasy 14.

911
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,020
Like, you know, I talk about World of Warcraft being very cinematic, but there's

912
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,340
never going to be anything in World of Warcraft.

913
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,220
There's just not going to be anything in it like the introduction to the Shiva battle

914
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,740
for the most recent Final Fantasy 14 patch, which was so fucking epic.

915
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,620
Or the music.

916
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,460
I mean, WoW has great music.

917
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,700
I'm sorry, 14 with the dynamic soundtrack and everything like is, is a step above.

918
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,660
And it really is.

919
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,780
No fat chocobos.

920
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:46,860
That's right.

921
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,940
WoW does not have fat chocobos, unfortunately.

922
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,380
It does have pet battles though.

923
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,460
And then, but Final Fantasy 14 is not perfect.

924
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,820
You know, I would, the cross realm server and the flex rating and all that stuff

925
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,940
really changed WoW for a really, in a really, really good way.

926
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,980
And I really wish that was in Final Fantasy 14.

927
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,380
Like it is a little silly that we're all isolated on this one particular island.

928
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,540
And I can't play with these people over here.

929
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,060
You know, I would really like to be able to do that.

930
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,900
I'm hoping that is something they will work on as they get to their expansion,

931
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,860
Heavensward and all that.

932
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,820
But our UK friends can play on our servers.

933
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,500
Ooh, good point.

934
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,100
Good point.

935
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,540
You're right.

936
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,940
Our UK friends in Final Fantasy 14 can play on our servers.

937
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,940
We can go play on theirs and we can go play on the Japanese servers.

938
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,700
And we have an auto translator.

939
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,300
That's right.

940
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,420
That is, that is an advantage of Final Fantasy 14 versus WoW.

941
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:40,540
At the end of the day, you can make macros for working with other, you know, countries.

942
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,580
That's also the advantage of having, you know, Final Fantasy 14 being developed

943
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,860
by a Japanese company versus an American company.

944
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,100
You know, they're just different.

945
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,780
And I realize Final Fantasy 14 is what, only a quarter the size of World of Warcraft.

946
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,740
So it's tough to really compare the two games.

947
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,300
Or is it a British company?

948
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,420
I guess it's a British company.

949
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,580
I don't know.

950
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,860
It's an English speaking company.

951
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,420
There you go.

952
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,820
Anyway, so anyway, the competition is good.

953
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,620
I, you know, cause I see things in this new WoW expansion.

954
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,020
I'm like, I'm pretty sure that was lifted from Final Fantasy 14.

955
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,780
I'm pretty sure that came out of 14.

956
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,380
But at the same time, Realm Reborn would not fucking exist

957
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,860
if it's not for World of Warcraft.

958
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,500
I mean, Final Fantasy 14 1.0 is a hot fucking mess.

959
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,860
And luckily Yoshi P, the producer, played a lot of World of Warcraft and took a lot

960
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,700
of the great things that WoW did and made Final Fantasy 14 a playable game because of it.

961
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:36,060
So as long as the competition between the two and other players, Wildstar, Guild Wars,

962
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,620
Elder Scrolls, as long as the competition is a good, healthy thing and keeps these games

963
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,420
on their toes and getting better, great.

964
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,020
We all win.

965
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,020
FYI, our wallets lose.

966
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,380
What?

967
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,500
I have a red chocobo.

968
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,340
Congratulations.

969
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,340
His name is Hot Wings.

970
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,820
Congratulations.

971
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,700
Uh, Pow in our chat room saying, I'm still trying to get my mountain Final Fantasy 14.

972
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,220
I love the game, but I get lost all the time.

973
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,460
I have no sense of direction.

974
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,300
Uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, I think this was a bad luck scenario.

975
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,140
Usually you'll be able to kick someone for being an asshat.

976
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:13,500
It's just really unfortunate when time is more important to somebody when you're playing one

977
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
of the, being a decent human being, a decent human being.

978
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,820
Like when you're playing one of the biggest fucking time sync games in the universe, which

979
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,380
World of Warcraft is in a way.

980
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,180
So anyway.

981
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:23,860
All right.

982
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,540
I've just been like, stop being a shit.

983
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,260
Pretty much, pretty much.

984
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:27,820
Anyway.

985
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,900
And now for something completely different, because there is one other game I've spent an

986
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,660
awful lot of time playing this week that actually has nothing to do with MMOs or swords and

987
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,780
sorcery or any of that stuff.

988
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,380
And that is on the PlayStation 4.

989
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:43,820
I've been playing quite a lot of Geometry Wars 3, which came out on the PlayStation 4 just

990
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,860
this past week, uh, developed by Lucid Entertainment, which is made up, as I understand

991
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,780
it, of some of the key players that used to be with Bazaar.

992
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:58,340
And now it's published under Activision's new indie banner Sierra, which is not really a new

993
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,660
banner.

994
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,460
It's an old banner.

995
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,740
But anyway, you don't care about who made it.

996
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,380
You just want to know, is the game good?

997
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,780
And I have to say, yes, the game is, is awfully good.

998
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,900
I'm really enjoying Geometry Wars 3.

999
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:18,420
Um, it is quite the departure from Geometry Wars 1 and 2 visually, but gameplay wise, not

1000
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,900
really.

1001
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,980
Um, obviously the big trick in Geometry Wars 3 is that now a lot of the grids are in three

1002
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,700
dimensions.

1003
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,020
And because of that, they're in different shapes as well.

1004
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,260
Now, differently shaped grids is nothing new for Geometry Wars, because if you ever played

1005
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,060
the Geometry Wars game that was on the Wii, which was really underplayed and underrated,

1006
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,500
there was different shaped maps, maps in that as well.

1007
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,980
So the different shapes of the stages and so forth are nothing new for Geometry Wars.

1008
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,220
But in the three dimensions, certainly you have to kind of think about the way you're

1009
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,500
moving can really change what you can see on a stage.

1010
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,580
Let me, let me put it this way.

1011
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:59,140
So imagine you're playing on a stage that looks like a giant log, like a big, big cylinder,

1012
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,540
you know, type of log that's very long, but very narrow.

1013
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Well, if you're playing on the stage, but you're playing in three dimensions, you can

1014
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,420
imagine as you get to the bottom of the log, if you don't make a complete 180, if you take

1015
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,180
more of a 90 degree turn, now you're going to flip that so that it's shaped more like a

1016
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,780
tree.

1017
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,540
And now it's the long, it's, it's tall on your screen and narrow.

1018
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,740
Does that make sense what I'm saying?

1019
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,660
Like you can flip the stage on its side, but that is very, that can really control how much

1020
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,620
you can see of the ships that are coming and what's attacking you.

1021
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,700
So if you go in certain directions, it might roll down the stairs and over your neighbor's

1022
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:35,980
dog.

1023
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,340
Fuck off.

1024
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,620
Anyway, but what's really great about this game is that not only do you have that adventure

1025
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,300
mode where you have all these different shapes, stages to play and so forth, but you also

1026
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,580
have, you know, classic mode where a lot of the same stuff from Geometry Wars 2 comes

1027
00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:00,660
back, such as pacifism mode and king mode and all this stuff is available for you to

1028
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,100
play.

1029
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,380
They added a little twist now where you have little companions with you that you can either

1030
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,740
have be like additional firepower, or they can go and collect the little multiplayer

1031
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,660
bonuses.

1032
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,300
They can lay down mines.

1033
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,500
They do all these other things too.

1034
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,780
So I like a lot of the enhancements that they made to the game.

1035
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,180
It still definitely feels like a Geometry Wars game.

1036
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,420
And if you just want to play like old school Geometry Wars, you kind of can.

1037
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,820
And what I, what I mean by that is you can play with the old rules and the old enemies,

1038
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,740
but it is still in the new graphics.

1039
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,060
But that's okay, because the new graphics for the most part are very good.

1040
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,220
The only time I get a little overwhelmed is that sometimes I think my little partnership

1041
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,460
guy that's floating around with me, the one that goes out and collects all the multipliers,

1042
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,500
I keep thinking that he's an enemy.

1043
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,420
So I try to shoot him and avoid him, but it's like, no, that's your friend.

1044
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,860
Don't, you know, you can, you can run up and give him a hug.

1045
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,340
So sometimes you get a little overwhelmed graphically in that regard, but, um, I'm

1046
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,140
enjoying the game.

1047
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,940
I think, uh, I think it's pretty awesome.

1048
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,820
Let's see.

1049
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,940
Robert M in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I've heard a lot of comparisons to

1050
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Super Stardust.

1051
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,860
Well, if you think about it, Super Stardust was kind of inspired a little bit by the

1052
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,980
original Geometry Wars.

1053
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,820
So it's not that far of a stretch.

1054
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,860
I mean, a lot of twin stick shooters, uh, you know, owe a lot to Geometry Wars.

1055
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,540
So there you go.

1056
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,100
Those are, those are the two big games that have been taken up my week.

1057
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,540
In, in, in addition to the old regulars, I've actually been playing a lot of Diablo

1058
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,500
3 this week as well, just with Alan has been playing a lot.

1059
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,660
He's probably playing it right now.

1060
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,660
He's been playing a lot of Diablo 3 and we're leveling seasonal characters together

1061
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,260
because I really want to get him to 70 before they pull the plug on season one so

1062
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,620
he can get his transmog armor.

1063
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,500
So we've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 as well.

1064
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,780
Anyhow, enough about our gaming weeks.

1065
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,340
Let's get to the news right after some housekeeping, a very important housekeeping

1066
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,100
note for the show.

1067
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,060
Don't forget next week, December 7th, that is our next episode.

1068
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,820
That is going to be the early show, meaning we are going to be broadcasting at

1069
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,420
vognetwork.com at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1070
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,180
And for those of you guys overseas in the UK, this is great news for you because

1071
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,500
that's going to be eight o'clock at night for you guys.

1072
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,260
So no excuses.

1073
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,060
You can be here and participate with the show and call in.

1074
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,220
We'll try to open up the phones a little earlier than usual so that those of you

1075
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,660
guys in the UK, more of you guys can call in and participate.

1076
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,300
We really look forward to hearing from you guys.

1077
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,140
Certainly if you're here in the States and you happen to be around at noon or 3 PM,

1078
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,620
you can still tune in and still participate and all that good stuff.

1079
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,620
The other thing to note is that it will be rebroadcast at six o'clock after Bobby

1080
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,140
Black Wolf. For those of you guys that are kind of used to hearing it at six

1081
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,940
o'clock, it will be rebroadcast, but it will not be live.

1082
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,900
Some of us have some holiday commitments we're going to in the evening, so we're

1083
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,780
not going to be around.

1084
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,580
But yeah, next show will be December 7th at noon Pacific, eight o'clock in the UK.

1085
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,300
Check your world clock and convert noon San Francisco time on Sunday to your local

1086
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,300
time to figure out when we will be on.

1087
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,620
All right.

1088
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,260
Otherwise, twitter.com slash OLR and facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio are

1089
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,620
always the places to find us and friend us and be a fan of the show and keep

1090
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,300
independent broadcasting alive.

1091
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,340
We really appreciate it.

1092
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,500
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

1093
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,260
It's been a slow week, but there's still been some pretty, pretty big news to come

1094
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,300
out of this week, right, Loki?

1095
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:28,660
Yeah, Sony has had to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that

1096
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,220
it produced false and misleading advertisement during the launch of the

1097
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:40,460
Vita. And apparently, if you happen to purchase the Vita before June 1st, 2012,

1098
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,500
you can either get $25 cash or credit refund or a $50 voucher for select games

1099
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,420
and services.

1100
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,980
And basically, some of the examples, you know, they were saying that were kind of

1101
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,700
misleading. For example, they said, you know, they claimed that the Vita could

1102
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,180
pause any PS3 game at any time and continue to play on the on the Vita.

1103
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,380
I think they were showing that off with like MLB, one of the MLB games.

1104
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,140
I remember that.

1105
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,860
It'll be the show, which I think it was available on that one, but it's not, you

1106
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,100
know, it kind of implies that you can deal with everything, which you couldn't.

1107
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,700
And also, you know, seeing that if you own the 3G version of the device that you

1108
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:24,220
could engage in, they're seeing live multiplayer games through the 3G network,

1109
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,980
which, God, no, that's definitely not possible.

1110
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,380
And to be perfectly frank, there's really no reason to own a 3G Vita.

1111
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,580
Do they even make them anymore?

1112
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,820
They don't make them anymore.

1113
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,100
And I bought a 3G Vita.

1114
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,740
Me too.

1115
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:41,900
Because at some point in the whole thing, Amazon had it like a bundle deal that was

1116
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,340
cheaper if you got the 3G model or like maybe it was like $10 more.

1117
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,700
So I got the one that came out slightly earlier.

1118
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,740
I think it was like a week, it was out a week earlier, but it was the price ended

1119
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,220
up being pretty good based off what it was.

1120
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,460
You got a memory card in there and it was not so bad.

1121
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,780
But, you know, now that I think about it, I was like, you know, they did kind of say

1122
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,060
that.

1123
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:06,180
And then I remember that the 3G really did nothing except, oh, you can manage your

1124
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,700
friends lists and send messages and do Twitter and Facebook on your Vita if you

1125
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,420
really want to.

1126
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,740
But in this age of smartphones, it didn't really make sense because they had like

1127
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,180
asynchronous multiplayer is basically the only thing you do, which multiplayer over

1128
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,860
3G would not be fun.

1129
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,020
Anyway, for most, you know, Sony PlayStation experiences.

1130
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:34,420
I mean, I suppose if you were playing a Scrabble-like game on the Vita, then that

1131
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,540
would work.

1132
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,940
Man, how the fuck did we do multiplayer then back in the days of dial-up?

1133
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,700
I mean, shit, you know, I remember playing some dial-up multiplayer games like

1134
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,420
Command & Conquer and stuff that it was able to handle that.

1135
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,300
Actually, you've got a good point.

1136
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,700
Maybe it could have done more over 3G than we give it credit for.

1137
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,220
I mean, there are iPhone and Android games that do multiplayer that run pretty

1138
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,500
decently.

1139
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,940
I mean, there's MMOs on the freaking iPad, you know, so they work pretty easily.

1140
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,980
But whatever.

1141
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:07,660
So, cool, $50, you know, I'm looking forward to getting another rebate because I

1142
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,860
did buy one, although I don't have my system anymore, but I did pay for one.

1143
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,660
So I mowed my $50, right?

1144
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,700
Yeah, this news kind of caught me by surprise.

1145
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,500
I mean, I was like, all right, I guess if they're going to be giving me, what, $50 in

1146
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,020
merchandise or whatever, then I just hope...

1147
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,500
I'll take $50 in merchandise.

1148
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,900
I hope...

1149
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,100
Does $50 in merchandise mean like a gift certificate for the PlayStation Store?

1150
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,180
Because that'd be awesome.

1151
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:36,980
I'd rather buy like a PS4 game than a Vita game, which I think says a lot about my

1152
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,380
Vita, my poor Vita.

1153
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,300
But I guess I was just kind of taken by surprise because I didn't realize that this

1154
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,380
was something that the FTC was going after Sony for.

1155
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:52,260
And it's not like I've necessarily been sitting here going, Sony's lied to me and

1156
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,020
Sony had all these issues and dah, dah, dah.

1157
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,540
But I think we've all kind of been sitting here going, you know, the Vita, the Vita

1158
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,580
didn't really turn out the way we all thought it was going to.

1159
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,300
Let's be honest.

1160
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:09,780
I mean, people have sued and won against Red Bull for claiming that it doesn't give

1161
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,140
you the ability to fly.

1162
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:16,300
So, I mean, I'm not surprised that, you know, that they...

1163
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,500
It doesn't really give me wings?

1164
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,180
No, it doesn't give you wings.

1165
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,300
Does it give me horns?

1166
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,900
So, you know, I just I guess I'm not surprised that they did this.

1167
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,460
Cool. I mean, hey, you know, if I can get in on this and sure, yeah, I'll take, you

1168
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,260
know, some merchandise.

1169
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,300
Was that just because you're like, oh, hey, free shit or is this...

1170
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,780
Exactly.

1171
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,660
Hey, free shit.

1172
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,900
Nah, oh, I was duped.

1173
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,620
I mean, it was kind of underwhelming some of the stuff that they came out with.

1174
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,620
Like, you know, I was hoping that the Call of Duty game was going to be good and I was

1175
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,500
hoping, you know, that they'd have a Grand Theft Auto game on the Vita or, you know,

1176
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,540
Resistance and stuff.

1177
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,020
And all those games kind of were lame.

1178
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,300
And it's not necessarily Sony's fault.

1179
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,580
But it's just it didn't really come through with the promise of this portable gaming

1180
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,460
platform that was going to be so much better than the PSP was.

1181
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,260
And it just really kind of turned out like the PSP, if not maybe a little bit worse.

1182
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,060
I would definitely, you know, say there's a part of me, though, that although I didn't

1183
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:21,500
necessarily have a problem with the Vita per se, I mean, that was rooted in these

1184
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,900
issues that they got slapped on the wrist over.

1185
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,180
I mean, my issue is just that they weren't really putting out games on it.

1186
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,820
They had a pretty strong launch and then it dried up.

1187
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,900
And it's not even like the Wii U where they trickled out.

1188
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,500
And now the Wii U has a pretty impressive backlog of good games to play.

1189
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,140
But the Vita never even it was like, oh, you could just, you know, play your PlayStation

1190
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:40,540
four.

1191
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,660
We have we have a lot of indie games that are on every other platform down with getting

1192
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:50,140
one again, if I could play my PlayStation four games over the Internet, you know,

1193
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:54,100
through my work's Wi-Fi, if it was going to be fast enough to do that.

1194
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,220
But I don't think it is.

1195
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,860
So, you know, unfortunately, I just can't see myself doing that.

1196
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,180
But there is a part of me that goes, you know what?

1197
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,340
They did say you'd be able to do 3G multiplayer and you can't do that.

1198
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,380
And they did really make it seem like you were going to be able to pick up all your

1199
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,300
PlayStation games and do the streaming.

1200
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,780
You can do that.

1201
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,500
So there is a part of me that's like, you know what?

1202
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,980
Some some people do need to get slapped on the wrist for all these outrageous claims.

1203
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,740
What about I mean, what about I guess it's concept, though.

1204
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,740
But what about the Kinect?

1205
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,740
I mean, the same type of thing.

1206
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:25,300
They said they promised me I'd be able to scan in my skateboard and be able to use that

1207
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,260
skateboard in the game.

1208
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,580
Oh, but that game got canceled.

1209
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:33,500
Right. No, that you know, they have that feature, but it ended up being, oh, yeah, you

1210
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,100
can scan in a picture, but it's just going to pick up the color and it's going to be

1211
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,060
for, you know, was it that Kinect car racing game?

1212
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:44,140
And now every color that you'd scan to be like pink because that camera was shit.

1213
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,660
Now, Loki, on Xbox one, you can scan your face and put it in.

1214
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,460
Oh, yeah, that's so much better.

1215
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,820
Yeah, that's not an impossible task.

1216
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,740
You know, you have to have like the proper lighting and professional studio set up and

1217
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,900
yet, you know, multiple shots of your face.

1218
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,620
And it still looks like fucking Quasimodo when you're done.

1219
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,780
So, yeah, no thanks.

1220
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,660
I'm OK, I don't need my face in the game.

1221
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,860
Dark Sakura, do you believe the Sony should have been slapped on the wrist about this

1222
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,180
whole thing, the way they're being?

1223
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,220
Yeah, false advertising.

1224
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,220
Yeah, really. I mean, they might probably put it out with the expectation that it was

1225
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,340
going to be able to do that, but reality and expectation can be two different things.

1226
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,260
So at the very least, I think that.

1227
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,300
Having some sort of compensation for the lack thereof is a good idea.

1228
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:41,180
Yeah. Boy, so more bad news about the Vita for Sony.

1229
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,060
I mean, it really seems like that platform is going kaput, unless that PlayStation Vita

1230
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:50,780
TV or whatever can really turn that can really do well for him, because, I mean, I can

1231
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,660
only see the price of that going down.

1232
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,580
And honestly, it's a good alternative.

1233
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:59,180
If you're looking for something to stream Netflix on or something, it's not bad.

1234
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,300
And plus, if you're looking like to get in on some of these digital games and if you

1235
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,900
have PlayStation Plus, you already have a library for that thing.

1236
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,700
And there are those few Vita games that you really do need to play.

1237
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,460
It's like there's Persona 4, right?

1238
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,180
I mean, there are some Vita games that you are missing out on by not having it.

1239
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,980
I mean, you could probably count them on one hand, but you could have a place to play

1240
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,660
those, you know.

1241
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,900
Well, Persona 4, that was just on PlayStation 3.

1242
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,300
Isn't the Vita one the definitive version that they add extra stuff to it or something?

1243
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,180
I don't know.

1244
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:35,020
Yeah, but yeah, I mean, it's not a bad platform and, you know, at least it's region

1245
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:35,460
free.

1246
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:36,940
That's true.

1247
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,740
There is always that.

1248
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,180
It's your only region free handheld at this point, because, thank you, Nintendo.

1249
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:47,620
Well, speaking of Nintendo and handhelds, actually, Nintendo filed a very interesting

1250
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,700
patent this week.

1251
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:54,300
One of the posters over on the big NeoGAF forum found this, that there was actually a

1252
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,660
patent filed by Nintendo, which regards emulation of classic Game Boy titles on

1253
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:06,100
various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

1254
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,900
And you could see all the blah, blah, blahs if you, you know, really want to kind of

1255
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,700
read through this.

1256
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:16,700
But essentially, at the end of the day, it talks about emulation of the Game Boy on

1257
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,220
smartphones, tablets, other types of screens.

1258
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,620
Like, think about, like, when you're on an airplane and, you know, you could, do you

1259
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,340
know, you can play, like, games on those TV, depending on what airline is.

1260
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,660
You can, like, play games now on those airline TVs.

1261
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,500
You know, it covers all sorts of things like that.

1262
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:35,660
So this has a lot of people going, is Nintendo.

1263
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,020
I mean, Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure from investors to do more with

1264
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,780
iPhones and Android devices because mobile's where it's at, right?

1265
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,020
Even though for every angry bird, there's 20 million dead birds.

1266
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,700
Or is this a way to get, you know, strikes against people that make emulators for those

1267
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,300
platforms?

1268
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,540
Well, and that's what I wonder as well, is that, is it really about Nintendo wants to do

1269
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,140
something in themselves or they want to stop other people from doing it so that people

1270
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,300
have to buy a 3DS?

1271
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,340
But can they patent that?

1272
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,460
I mean, if, you know, other people have come up with emulators, but I mean, they, I would

1273
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,140
say other people came up with emulators before Nintendo came up with an emulator for

1274
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:09,980
those things.

1275
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,100
It'd be kind of hard to patent that.

1276
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,780
I would, it's hard to patent software.

1277
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,300
Yes, but at the same time, Nintendo probably patented it, you know, or Nintendo probably

1278
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:24,460
invented the emulator while the Game Boy hardware was still under patent.

1279
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,340
Because, you know, hardware patents expire after a certain amount of time.

1280
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:32,060
That's why you have devices like the Retron console that will play all that stuff, because

1281
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,260
technically they're allowed to do that.

1282
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,340
It's kind of a gray area legally, but it's one of those things.

1283
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,500
I'm surprised we haven't seen like a Retron type console for handhelds.

1284
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,300
The Retron 5 takes Game Boy Advance, which means Game Boy regular as well.

1285
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,940
It's, that's one of the five systems that it takes.

1286
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,740
So, and if you think about it, you could always run it through a Super Game Boy, do it

1287
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,180
that way.

1288
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,540
So in a way it does.

1289
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,220
Which, there you go, that would have been the first Game Boy emulator, right?

1290
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,500
Would have been the Super Game Boy.

1291
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,140
Sort of, I guess, but that's a hardware emulator versus like a software emulator.

1292
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,100
I mean, it's actually, you know, emulating the hardware through hardware versus like a

1293
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,260
program, like where it's all emulated through a program.

1294
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,420
See, it's tricky, but you're probably right.

1295
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:20,900
This is probably a preemptive strike to make sure that nobody tries to put like a Game

1296
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,980
Boy, like Pokemon Yellow or something.

1297
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,500
Are they on the market?

1298
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:30,540
Coming up on that, was it, you know, the Retron 5 stuff, you know, where they have all

1299
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,420
that available.

1300
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,900
Is that because, you know, after a while the patents expire and they become, you know, not

1301
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,940
public domain, but I don't know how exactly they do that legally.

1302
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,060
But is that because maybe the Game Boy ones coming up available, maybe people, maybe

1303
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,660
they're thinking that maybe someone's going to be able to legally emulate that stuff?

1304
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:52,180
Well, or not necessarily emulate, but like come up with like some sort of, I don't know, I

1305
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,820
don't know what their thought process is.

1306
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,820
I think part of the reason why the Retron 5 has avoided Nintendo's wrath and these other

1307
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,660
companies' wrath is because you still have to have all the original cartridges to play the

1308
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,140
games.

1309
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,580
But if you're talking about downloading something to your phone, those aren't going to

1310
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,420
take cartridges.

1311
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,740
So now we're talking about the precious, precious software is going to have to be, you

1312
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,380
know, digital.

1313
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,740
And that's what Nintendo is really trying to prevent.

1314
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,580
You know what I mean?

1315
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:19,260
Again, it's about preventing Pokemon, yellow, red, blue, what other Game Boy games, all

1316
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,100
the, Metroid 2 and all that showing up as downloads.

1317
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,460
I guess they could do it on phone.

1318
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,580
I mean, obviously they've done it on phones already.

1319
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,300
I just, touch screens, man.

1320
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,620
It's just not the same.

1321
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,420
Yeah.

1322
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,180
DarkTitsuya in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, I think they're just

1323
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:38,220
legally covering their asses as far as putting emulators on the various digital

1324
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,900
stores.

1325
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,260
Tigerclaw says, people can download paid versions of apps that will work on their

1326
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,740
devices when they sideload it.

1327
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,860
So Nintendo making games on it, people will just pirate it.

1328
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:53,420
And DarkTitsuya says, I found a few emulated GBA games on the Windows phone store.

1329
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,140
I'm just saying.

1330
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:03,780
I got, one time I got a MAME emulator on the iTunes because it was a public domain

1331
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,500
game that had slipped under the radar and Apple approved it, I guess, for, for

1332
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,780
publishing on the iTunes.

1333
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,140
But what it was, it was a MAME emulator.

1334
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,140
So if you had any, and you didn't have to jailbreak your phone, you have any type of

1335
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:19,820
file tree browser, like, um, what's that program, iPhone box or whatever, you could

1336
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,380
just plug in your iPad and dump ROMs into the directory.

1337
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:27,780
And this game would load all of the ROMs and you could basically turn your iPhone or

1338
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,140
iPad into a MAME emulator.

1339
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,820
And this thing was up on the iTunes store for like two weeks before Apple pulled it.

1340
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:39,140
So what I'm saying is that if things like that can sneak through, there'll be Game Boy

1341
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,580
emulators that sneak through as well.

1342
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,940
And that's what they've already implemented.

1343
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,100
They have stuff like that, but yeah, I don't know.

1344
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,820
I've just, I wouldn't hold out that this means that Nintendo is going to put out, you

1345
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,660
know, like an official Game Boy emulator or something like that, you know, or virtual

1346
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,140
console.

1347
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,780
It'd be nice if they had virtual console on mobile.

1348
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:01,780
I mean, I just think their concern is that, and surprisingly or not, their concern is

1349
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:08,820
that it wouldn't play as well as it would on, you know, like a console or a handheld.

1350
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,820
So I think that's why they're not, you know, doing anything like that because there's no

1351
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,300
way to guarantee you're going to get that same type of gameplay.

1352
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,780
And you just can't do that with touch screen only.

1353
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,580
All right.

1354
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:19,860
All right.

1355
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,820
Well, we'll see what happens if Nintendo ends up going after anybody in the coming weeks.

1356
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:25,300
We'll see.

1357
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,460
But meanwhile, we have more news, right, Darcacra?

1358
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,580
Well, we have another company doing the dance of accountability.

1359
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,740
And that is Ubisoft, of course.

1360
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:37,620
We know about the debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity.

1361
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,020
Well, they finally put out a formal apology.

1362
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,500
In fact, the apology comes from Yanis Malat, who is the CEO of Ubisoft Montreal.

1363
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:53,060
Basically, the quote goes, I want to sincerely apologize on behalf of Ubisoft and the entire

1364
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,580
Assassin's Creed team.

1365
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:58,260
These problems took away from your enjoyment of the game and kept many of you from experiencing

1366
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,260
the game at its fullest potential.

1367
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:04,580
To show our appreciation for your continued support, we're making the upcoming Assassin's

1368
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,860
Creed Unity Dead Kings DLC free for everyone.

1369
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:11,860
For season pass holders, we will also offer the choice of one additional game from the

1370
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,620
selection of Ubisoft titles for free.

1371
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,580
And that's the direct quote.

1372
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:20,020
So if you got the game, you get some free DLC.

1373
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,700
If you have the season pass, you get a free game.

1374
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:29,540
Free DLC is an interesting slippery slope, though, because, I mean, they never had to

1375
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,460
charge that DLC in the first place.

1376
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,500
But I don't know.

1377
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,940
I suppose at the same time, if you're kind of accustomed to Assassin's Creed games at

1378
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:40,580
this point, you knew you were going to be paying $10, $15 for, you know, expansions

1379
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,540
at some point down the line.

1380
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,140
It's the business model nowadays.

1381
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:43,620
Yeah, it is.

1382
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,420
It really is.

1383
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:49,780
They have what maybe just happened to have, you know, DLC set aside as an apology.

1384
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,340
Yeah.

1385
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,940
You know, that could be entirely possible.

1386
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,660
I think it was actually supposed to be the first legit part of the season pass.

1387
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:01,940
This isn't necessarily like when BioWare apologized over Mass Effect 3 and created

1388
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:06,820
DLC to give away for free, which in turn delayed all the rest of the DLC.

1389
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:07,700
But, you know, that's...

1390
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,980
Well, they said they haven't necessarily canceled the season pass.

1391
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,300
They're just giving this away for free and season pass holders are going to be compensated

1392
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,060
for what they've spent.

1393
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,900
Because those people took a huge leap of faith and many of them ended up disappointed because

1394
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,220
that, you know, that lady was missing a fucking face.

1395
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:24,420
Yeah.

1396
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,460
And they're being compensated by way of free games.

1397
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:30,820
Dear NPC lady, sorry we forgot to give you a face.

1398
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:31,700
Love Ubisoft.

1399
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,980
I think, uh, pal, I think you're misunderstanding.

1400
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,620
The season pass has not been canceled.

1401
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,860
In our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.

1402
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,660
Yeah.

1403
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,740
The season pass is not canceled.

1404
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,220
They did not say it was canceled.

1405
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,460
They just said that they are giving season pass holders an alternative.

1406
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,300
Which really the alternative should be Far Cry 4.

1407
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,460
You should really get Far Cry 4.

1408
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,500
Well, Far Cry 3 maybe, but I don't think you're getting Far Cry 4.

1409
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,980
No, Far Cry 4 is one of the games that they're allowing you to get.

1410
01:10:58,980 --> 01:10:59,940
Is it really?

1411
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:03,460
Yeah, so the games The Crew, which is, you know, the...

1412
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,180
We'll get into that.

1413
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,260
So these are new Ubisoft games.

1414
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:12,340
So The Crew, Far Cry 4, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed, Black Flag, Rayman Legends, Just Dance

1415
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:12,900
2015.

1416
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,940
Okay, don't do Rayman Legends because that's probably dirt cheap now.

1417
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:19,780
Just Dance 2015 wasn't a full price game anyway, so really you're left with four games.

1418
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,860
Far Cry 4 is probably the best.

1419
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,260
I don't know.

1420
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,700
I really like to dance, Loki.

1421
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,700
It's not a full price game.

1422
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,860
Utilize your full free benefit.

1423
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,380
I'm not smart shopping.

1424
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,500
You're not smart shopping.

1425
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,220
Yes, exactly.

1426
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,060
Get the full price game free.

1427
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,820
Buy the other game at a discounted price.

1428
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,200
All right.

1429
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,620
Well, what do you guys think?

1430
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,380
Is this a sufficient apology?

1431
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,060
Is this something Ubisoft had to do?

1432
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,740
I think it's nice that they're doing that.

1433
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:52,020
Uh, what they could have done is, I don't know, don't release a fucking buggy ass game

1434
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,500
at launch, especially with, I think Far Cry 4 has got some issues too, but it's not as

1435
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:02,260
bad and we're going to get into their next game that's coming out, which could possibly

1436
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,620
have same issues because they're hiding behind some sort of excuse.

1437
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,220
So we'll see.

1438
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:12,660
And it was already delayed as it was, you know, so I don't know.

1439
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,940
This is one of those things where Ubisoft certainly didn't have to do it.

1440
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:23,940
It's a good face saving move, pun intended, but I'm kind of curious, what is the long

1441
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,580
term strategy to make sure this doesn't happen again?

1442
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,460
That's what I'd really like to kind of hear out Ubisoft because you know, you're right,

1443
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,020
Loki.

1444
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,900
A lot of this is probably really rooted in the fact that the game was rushed.

1445
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,940
So I would just like to see Ubisoft say, you know what?

1446
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,500
We're going to take our, this is the steps we're taking to patch the game, but they do

1447
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,220
have that blog.

1448
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,580
So I think they're doing some of that.

1449
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:51,140
This is entirely EA 2013, you know, or even 2014 to some extent, because for example,

1450
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:55,940
Battlefield 4 was a fucking mess and it took a fucking long time to fix.

1451
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,460
And so what did they do with their big franchise games?

1452
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,380
They delay them to make sure they were OK.

1453
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,260
Dragon Age Inquisition, as far as I'm aware, doesn't have any issues.

1454
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,140
Got great reviews.

1455
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,660
Battlefield Hardline's been delayed to March to give it more time so they can have that

1456
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:15,860
game polished and make sure that it runs significantly better than Battlefield 4.

1457
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:20,020
So I think that they kind of learn their lesson and you need to take more time and get your

1458
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:24,500
games right the first time instead of launching them and just like hoping that there's not

1459
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,140
big bugs.

1460
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:29,140
I mean, how do you miss bugs like that?

1461
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,180
I don't think they did.

1462
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,060
I think what it came down to is that they launched it and they're like, well, we'll

1463
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:35,780
just fix it.

1464
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,620
You know, we'll fix it in a day one patch or we're hopefully going to get this patched

1465
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,180
up in time.

1466
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:44,660
I think they just did this to get it out so that they can, you know, because they had

1467
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:49,620
already delayed it once, you know, from the end of October to come in, you know, at the

1468
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:53,860
same time as Assassin's Creed Rogue and whether that was just a timing thing so that there's

1469
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,780
not two Assassin's Creed games coming out two different times or if it was just they

1470
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,580
needed more time.

1471
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:06,420
This is something that has to be fixed at a much higher level, I think.

1472
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:10,420
Yeah, because honestly, I mean, we're all kind of sick of playing beta testers for this,

1473
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:17,700
you know, you have a team of testers for these games, bugs where the face is missing shouldn't

1474
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,780
be something that I mean, I can see there could be a bug where if you do something really

1475
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:26,740
obscure that, oh, OK, you know, something weird happens and exploit more like, yeah,

1476
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,060
like some weird glitch or something or maybe some weird AI behavior every now and then.

1477
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,180
And that's fine.

1478
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:37,940
But like, you know, fate just testing with this stuff, it doesn't make any sense that

1479
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,980
you wouldn't catch this, especially if it's in all versions of the game.

1480
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,340
I don't know.

1481
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:43,780
All right.

1482
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,860
Well, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1483
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:46,820
All right.

1484
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:55,140
So speaking of different companies with issues, I don't even know why they're I know why they're

1485
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,380
doing this, but it doesn't make any sense.

1486
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,180
Activision.

1487
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:04,500
So they've been issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos for Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.

1488
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:10,980
Now, that doesn't make much sense if you think about it, but they're only doing that on videos

1489
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:14,420
that they claim are promoting cheating or unfair exploits.

1490
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,820
So some of these games have glitches in them.

1491
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:21,380
You know, you'll see lots of glitch videos and stuff from Call of Duty, you know, some

1492
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,580
of the past games and everything.

1493
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:29,700
But now instead of, you know, taking the time to fix these glitches, they're punishing the

1494
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,620
people that are finding these glitches and recording them in videos.

1495
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:41,460
So they're basically, you know, I guess Machinima was warning its members that, hey, Activision

1496
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:46,420
is being vigilant about Call of Duty videos lately, issuing strikes on videos showing

1497
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,060
glitches.

1498
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:52,420
If you post videos highlighting these glitches, your channel may be liable to receive copyright

1499
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:52,740
strikes.

1500
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,020
So please be careful.

1501
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:57,300
I'm sorry, but that's not what DMCA is for.

1502
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:02,420
DMCA is for stopping copyrighted footage from going out there, not because you don't like

1503
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,180
the video's content.

1504
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:08,340
So this is a slippery slope where, oh, okay, we don't want this video showing glitches

1505
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,300
in the game.

1506
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,940
Oh, well, we don't want this video coming out later on.

1507
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,900
You know, let's take a step further.

1508
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,820
Oh, we don't want this video out there because it shows a bad review of the game or something

1509
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:17,300
like that.

1510
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,740
That is the, you know, kind of the direction they're going here.

1511
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,620
And I'm sorry.

1512
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,100
You know what?

1513
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,980
Spend the time to fix it instead of punishing fans of your game showing these types of videos

1514
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:27,140
out.

1515
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,820
Hey, you know what?

1516
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,340
You're probably finding out about these glitches from these videos, so take the time to fix

1517
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,500
it instead of, you know, now you don't have to pay your testers that much more because

1518
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,020
you're having people test for you.

1519
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,300
I don't know.

1520
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,020
I just don't understand why they're punishing people that are doing YouTube videos of their

1521
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,060
video, you know, games.

1522
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:50,180
And you're absolutely right when you say that this is not an appropriate use of DMCA.

1523
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,180
That's not what it's for.

1524
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:57,300
And I would, I don't know, obviously it's going to be hard for like, you know, an independent

1525
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,180
YouTuber to fight back against it because, you know, they're not going to take...

1526
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,820
Because YouTube always sides.

1527
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,340
YouTube does not...

1528
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:07,220
And this is part of what pisses me off so much about YouTube.

1529
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,300
And this is warning, rant incoming, but there's...

1530
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,780
You look back at the history of YouTube and all this stuff we've talked about before and

1531
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,780
the other takedown notices they have and the copyright strikes, the way you fight it, they

1532
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:23,940
never side with the people that put them in the place that they're at.

1533
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,660
That is so fucked up.

1534
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,100
Like, why is there not a legit competitor out there to YouTube?

1535
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,100
It's probably because of the bandwidth and all that other stuff.

1536
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:39,940
But like, people need another place because YouTube constantly sides against its own users.

1537
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,860
And they know that for a fact.

1538
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:46,100
I bet you, you know, their legal department knows that this is not the proper use of DMCA,

1539
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,460
but who's going to fight them on it?

1540
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,700
No one is going to fight them on it because they have so many lawyers and so much money

1541
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,420
to throw at it.

1542
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,060
It doesn't matter.

1543
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:53,540
They're going to...

1544
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:56,020
They can shoot down anybody that tries to take them up on it.

1545
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:00,020
And I'm sure someone would argue that YouTube has to be against its users and up all these

1546
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,220
other companies asses because that's how they stay legal and avoid a lawsuit and copyright

1547
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,700
suits would be worse and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1548
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:11,540
But I just, I kind of also think you're living in a fantasy world with some of that.

1549
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,340
Like, I get, like, if somebody is going to take an entire episode of The Walking Dead

1550
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,780
and upload it to YouTube, that that has to be taken down or whatever.

1551
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,700
But some of these other things that are in more of a legal gray area, like what you're

1552
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,300
talking about, you know, where it's essentially, you know, fair use and criticism.

1553
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,180
What they need to have is like actual punishments for, you know, false DMCA.

1554
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:32,740
Yes.

1555
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:37,220
Because they have, you know, puns, you know, we've even seen this with like, you know,

1556
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:41,780
don't want to go there, but like, you know, some of the gamergate stuff and some of the

1557
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,340
other.

1558
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:47,460
You'll see a lot of people taking using DMCA to try to take down videos they don't like,

1559
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:51,940
you know, whether it be independent developers who are questionable that want to take down

1560
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,380
bad reviews of their games or bad let's plays or whatever.

1561
01:18:55,380 --> 01:19:00,100
Or, you know, publishers trying to take down, you know, videos of, you know, glitches or

1562
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,900
something in their games.

1563
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,660
You can't do that.

1564
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:07,140
You either let the videos all go through or you don't let any of them go through.

1565
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,980
I mean, that's the way I think it should be.

1566
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:12,020
I am so down with the idea that strike should apply both ways.

1567
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:13,940
There there should be.

1568
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:19,780
Well, it's hard to see who would mediate that, though, who would determine, you know, whether

1569
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,300
it's fair use or not.

1570
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:21,780
I don't know.

1571
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,460
Anyway, let's move on.

1572
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,500
We're going to talk about a story.

1573
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,900
Maybe this has to be mediated, too.

1574
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,300
I don't know.

1575
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:36,820
But GameStop has opened their mouths and said that they are worried that digital games are

1576
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:41,780
starting to become too cheap, and it's deterring customers from buying games at retail.

1577
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:46,020
This is a comment from Tony Bartell, who is GameStop's president.

1578
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:50,020
We want to help ensure that our industry does not make the same mistake as other entertainment

1579
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:54,900
categories by driving the perceived value of digital goods significantly below that

1580
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,100
of a physical game.

1581
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,100
When the free digital token programs end, we believe that the industry will need to work

1582
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:04,820
together to continue to price goods in a way that sustains profitability and encourages

1583
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,900
a great innovation that this category needs.

1584
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,860
He also said that research indicated that the average price a consumer pays for a full

1585
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,340
AAA game download is $22.

1586
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,900
Consumers expected to pay about $35.

1587
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:22,340
Um, it's supply and demand.

1588
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,660
I mean, if they're going to get it cheaper elsewhere, then they're going to get it cheaper

1589
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,060
elsewhere.

1590
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,060
That's why you don't sell PC games anymore.

1591
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:34,580
Well, they probably don't sell PC games very much anymore because you can get it cheaper

1592
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,060
on Steam or elsewhere at Origin.

1593
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,220
They're not always, it's not always the cheapest way to go on these digital stores.

1594
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:48,500
I would say even like on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace, a lot of times

1595
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,020
you're not going to see those deep discounts because there's no competition.

1596
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:56,980
It's you either get it on PlayStation Network or you buy it physical and that's it.

1597
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,100
Those are your two options.

1598
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:03,060
You're not going to be able to buy, you know, a code for some game cheaper on another

1599
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,700
marketplace like, you know, Amazon or something like that.

1600
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,860
They're not going to really have it discounted.

1601
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,780
It's going to be the same price across the board.

1602
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,660
Jamie, what do you think?

1603
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:18,740
I honestly think that it's just another symptom of relying a little bit too much on

1604
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:19,380
consumerism.

1605
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:24,580
If you want to have something that the consumer is going to buy, you put it at the price

1606
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,940
the consumer is going to afford.

1607
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,500
Right.

1608
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:34,660
And there's a big advantage to going away from printed media and the fact that you are

1609
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,260
creating less waste.

1610
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,860
It takes up less space.

1611
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:42,020
You're actually dealing with something that is not just more economically viable.

1612
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,980
But environmentally viable.

1613
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:50,020
Something that's going to be an ongoing sustainable model as, you know, the technology

1614
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:50,740
just improves.

1615
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:57,300
And I really do think that GameStop has also made the poor decision of oversaturating

1616
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:57,780
the market.

1617
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:00,500
You can't, it's like seeing Starbucks everywhere.

1618
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:06,260
And unfortunately, not everybody needs to buy a video game twice a day.

1619
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,940
Like some of us are with our coffee.

1620
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:16,820
So it doesn't, you know, as digital distribution is becoming more and more prevalent, it's

1621
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:21,220
basically what we ran into with Blockbuster versus having the Redboxer versus Netflix.

1622
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:26,180
It's going to be obsolete before too long.

1623
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,540
They're on their way to obsolescence and they see it coming.

1624
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:33,940
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says, well, GameStop, you wouldn't

1625
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:38,180
have to worry if you didn't oversaturate with retail stores and dick people on trade-in

1626
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:38,660
prices.

1627
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,540
Kind of part of what you said.

1628
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,060
Dungeon Buster says, too cheap.

1629
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:46,740
Let's not forget the GameStop tried to get into digital distribution with impulse.

1630
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:53,300
And yeah, on the PC side and that, or I don't know if it's just PC, but yeah, it just

1631
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,420
doesn't work out too well.

1632
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,820
I think that they're still viable as far as, you know, old games work.

1633
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,420
I mean, catalog is where it's at.

1634
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,100
They're not going to be able to make a ton of money, new release.

1635
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:08,100
And if everything goes digital, there's not going to be that market anymore.

1636
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:14,420
And I think, and I've said this before on the show, is that my incentive to go digital

1637
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:17,780
has to be because it's cheaper or there's some other value in it.

1638
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:21,060
Because when I buy a physical copy, that's mine.

1639
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:26,420
And the way the games work today and what we all fought for, yes, we fought for this

1640
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:30,740
because when Microsoft threatened to break this mold, they got dragged through the fucking

1641
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,380
coals and they still haven't recovered in many ways.

1642
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,940
We fought for that we would be able to have a game, it's my game, I own it, my physical

1643
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:45,700
copy, and I can give it to somebody else and loan it and much like a DVD or a VHS tape

1644
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,620
and they can play it and use it too.

1645
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,740
You have that equity.

1646
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:52,900
I buy the game and I have this and someday I could sell it back or give it to somebody

1647
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:56,980
else just as I sell a CD back or something like that.

1648
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,740
So it has to be about to tear me away from that physical copy.

1649
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:07,140
If you charge $59.99 for physical and $59.99 for digital, then I better see what's the

1650
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,660
fucking perk of getting it digitally.

1651
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,260
Now, for some people it's, oh, well, the game releases earlier.

1652
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:17,380
They will trade in the equity to play the game 24 hours sooner, which is not good enough

1653
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,220
for me, but for some people it is.

1654
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:19,780
That's fine.

1655
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:23,460
Um, I got my DLC bonus for Dragon Age.

1656
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:23,780
Yeah.

1657
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,660
Sometimes it's getting more stuff, uh, like free DLC when you buy digitally.

1658
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,460
And the game was installed and ready to go when I got home.

1659
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,020
Right.

1660
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,260
Yeah.

1661
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:38,180
But for me, I'm like, I still prefer physical unless digital is way cheaper, like a steam

1662
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,380
sale or something like that.

1663
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:39,700
Yeah.

1664
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,260
And I wish that they had the dynamic that they do.

1665
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:46,180
And they probably, I guess I would say maybe the publishers don't wish that they have this,

1666
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,820
but I wish that they had that dynamic where you could have the PlayStation Network and

1667
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:57,300
stuff as a place where you redeem stuff and then you can buy that, those codes elsewhere

1668
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,180
for different prices.

1669
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,860
Like say I want a digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5.

1670
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:06,900
You know, Amazon may have it for $39.99 or something one day and then, you know, Target

1671
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,900
has it for $59 or, you know, this other place has it for $49.

1672
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,420
You know, having those sales in different locations, you know, that'd be pretty nice,

1673
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:18,900
but they don't because it's, you know, I don't know, I guess the regulation that they have

1674
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:23,380
on there where you can't mark it down in one location and I haven't marked down another

1675
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,340
location, I guess.

1676
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,300
I don't know what the case may be, but I do wish digital games were a little bit cheaper

1677
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:35,380
because I, in like with Grand Theft Auto, see I bought digitally just because I wanted

1678
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,740
to play it early as possible.

1679
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:42,020
Also, I knew I wasn't going to sell it back, so I didn't really want to worry about that.

1680
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,180
And you weigh the pros and cons with every game.

1681
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,300
Yeah, and like, you know, I don't know.

1682
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:52,100
And plus, oh, and also because I was getting $15 back, you know, for buying a couple full-price

1683
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:56,580
games, I was going to buy Call of Duty digitally because I got it on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation

1684
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,860
4 for paying the same price.

1685
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,140
So essentially got a free game.

1686
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,020
And then I bought Grand Theft Auto.

1687
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,060
And so after I purchased that, I got $15 back on top of it.

1688
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:10,980
So it made it, you know, averaging out the cost, it made it cheaper than buying it at retail.

1689
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:16,500
So you granted later on, I could have bought those all at retail and then traded in.

1690
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:21,620
I think one other very important thing to consider with the whole physical versus digital

1691
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,700
is that, you know, with digital, we're still at the mercy of the cable companies and our

1692
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,460
internet connections at the end of the day.

1693
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:30,820
And there's still a lot of that that seems very volatile.

1694
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:35,700
And we've heard about, you know, Comcast testing these 300 gigabyte bandwidth caps and so

1695
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:35,780
forth.

1696
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:39,300
I mean, 300 gigabytes ain't going to get you a lot of PlayStation games.

1697
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,780
And that's because you do nothing else the rest of the month, which I bet you play a

1698
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,900
lot of those games online.

1699
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,500
You get any bandwidth for that too.

1700
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:53,140
So my worry is, you know, what if the shit hits the fan with these monopolies in cable

1701
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,020
internet service?

1702
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,020
Because in most towns, it's a monopoly.

1703
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,220
You have one choice.

1704
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:01,620
And if they make a decision that's going to really screw you over, digital may no longer

1705
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,420
be an option.

1706
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,100
So it's kind of like, I'm going to need that physical copy to exist.

1707
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:10,420
So that's another reason why I don't want to see digital necessarily take over, because

1708
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:16,500
right now we have an unregulated, you know, I know there's a big push for things to go

1709
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:16,820
the other way.

1710
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,340
And I think this is part of why it's important.

1711
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,900
But right now we have an unregulated data industry.

1712
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:26,180
Well, and also on top of this, you have the other factor, which is, you know, GameStop.

1713
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,500
Yeah, you have all these nice retail games and everything.

1714
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,140
And then granted, sometimes they do sell digital codes, which, you know, don't get me wrong.

1715
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:40,260
I don't really see why you would buy digital code from GameStop unless you unless you're

1716
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:44,660
trading in, you know, store credit that you have from trading games towards this code.

1717
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:49,220
I don't see a reason why you would purchase like, say, a season pass for something like,

1718
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,660
oh, I'm going to buy Assassin's Creed.

1719
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,340
I'm going to buy the season pass because all you're getting is a fucking code that's printed

1720
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,420
on our receipt that you're going to redeem anyways.

1721
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:01,460
I don't know why you would pay for that from them and pay tax on top of that or whatever.

1722
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,100
But you also have all these indie games.

1723
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:09,460
Once again, a lot of these indie games that are digital only that GameStop can't sell

1724
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,020
or even steam games, you know, GameStop can't really sell that.

1725
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,260
They can only sell steam cards or, you know,

1726
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:19,860
occasional box games that happen to have a steam code in them or whatever.

1727
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:25,300
So that's kind of a good percentage of the market that they're not able to touch.

1728
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,020
It would be nice to be able to resell some of the games.

1729
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,460
I have a lot of steam games that I got up to 90%

1730
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:34,420
because of all those games I've been buying of unplayed games.

1731
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,100
Well, it is interesting to see some of the things

1732
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:39,540
that steam is doing to give more equity to those downloadable games.

1733
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,900
And maybe steam isn't allowing you to sell those games yet,

1734
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,500
but with, you know, the family share and some of the other things they're doing,

1735
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,180
they're trying to sweeten the pot a little bit.

1736
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:52,420
I mean, family share isn't something I can do right now with a physical game.

1737
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,020
If I'm not sitting, you know, right near the person, you know what I mean?

1738
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,180
Like I can family share across a great distance,

1739
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,620
which I can't do with a physical game right now,

1740
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,340
which is funny because that's what Xbox was going to do.

1741
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,420
But we rejected it.

1742
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:11,220
Well, you know, actually, with iOS, you have family sharing now already built in.

1743
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,780
There's a family sharing thing for all iOS apps.

1744
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:20,100
Oh, so like if I buy an app, then, you know, if my kid has an iPad, they can get it too?

1745
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:25,220
You basically, you add their Apple ID into your family sharing plan.

1746
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:31,540
Whatever they buy, it is attached to their Apple ID, but anybody in the family can play it.

1747
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:32,180
Oh, interesting.

1748
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:35,860
And parents can control whether or not their kids can actually make the purchase.

1749
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:36,580
Interesting.

1750
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,460
And so you can also hide some of your purchases from each other,

1751
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:43,860
but that way family members will have the ability to make use of everything.

1752
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,940
Well, like say, you know, mom.

1753
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,900
So the kids don't need to see that mom and dad have been on Tinder?

1754
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,120
Yeah.

1755
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:55,240
You know, well, at any rate, you know, say this, say that you're playing, you know,

1756
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:01,000
some violent game that you don't want the five-year-old to be poking at,

1757
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,520
then you can hide that and they won't have access to it.

1758
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,960
But I mean, but that's, it's actually been existing and working rather

1759
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,400
smoothly now for the past few months.

1760
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,800
Or the subscription to Playboy magazine that they might have, you know, for the articles.

1761
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,960
Or, you know, bouncing boobs the app.

1762
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,120
Ideally, like I would like to see Apple approve that.

1763
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,800
I don't know.

1764
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,920
Ideally, I would like to see once that PlayStation Now service gets more in the swing,

1765
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:30,120
you know, swing of things where you have like PlayStation 4 games or something that you buy.

1766
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,760
Like, for example, Dragon Age Inquisition,

1767
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,880
one of the games I was thinking about purchasing digitally over the weekend.

1768
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,600
But I kind of stopped myself a bunch of times because,

1769
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,560
you know, I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna have to download that.

1770
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,480
And that, you know, I want to play it now,

1771
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,000
but then I'm not gonna be able to actually play it until, you know, tomorrow or something like that,

1772
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,680
because it's gonna have to download overnight.

1773
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,200
It really didn't take that long to download.

1774
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,280
All right, let's move on though, because we're running a little long.

1775
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,480
We still got plenty of ground to cover.

1776
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,720
So I'm gonna go to the next story over with Dark Sakura.

1777
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,200
Well, back to Ubisoft.

1778
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,840
It looks like they are learning their lesson with some of this too, because for the crew,

1779
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,960
the online racing game that's going to be coming out,

1780
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:14,840
they're basically not giving reviewers any early access.

1781
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,480
Everyone reviews it after the game is already out.

1782
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:23,000
Um, the servers are going to go on at exactly the same time for everybody.

1783
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:30,440
There is no embargo, but they are requesting that people put 40 to 50 hours into the game,

1784
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,400
so they get a quote, a full experience.

1785
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,840
And they do have a warning about early reviews to quote.

1786
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,000
It says, while we fully anticipate that you might see some reviews immediately at launch,

1787
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,920
largely built around the preview sessions we facilitated during the past months,

1788
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,640
or the limited contents of the closed and open betas,

1789
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:50,760
they won't be based on optimal conditions or reflect the finished game.

1790
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:56,520
There is something a little concerning there about Ubisoft saying,

1791
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,800
don't read the early reviews of the game.

1792
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,160
They're going to be wrong because they haven't experienced it.

1793
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,440
Where could a red flag possibly be in that line of thinking?

1794
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,200
Except if you think about it this way,

1795
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:14,680
there are features that change during beta editions and when you get the later ones.

1796
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:20,520
You know, in some cases have we played, um, how many of us have been in betas?

1797
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,560
They're like, Oh man, this beta sucks ass.

1798
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:23,960
Yeah.

1799
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,800
And then the game's been finished and come out and has been decent.

1800
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,080
Warcraft was that for me.

1801
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,280
I didn't like the beta at all.

1802
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,640
Okay, but let's be fair here.

1803
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,200
Okay.

1804
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,160
The beta for this game, the open beta was this week.

1805
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,680
The game comes out on Tuesday.

1806
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,320
So how much can you really change in like two days?

1807
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,480
I mean, I don't think that's going to be night and day different to be honest.

1808
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:48,040
I think final fantasy fourteens beta only had the one zone.

1809
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,360
And then the whole thing opened up when the launch came out.

1810
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,840
So, I mean, I don't know if it's anything like that,

1811
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,880
but there can be things that dramatically change.

1812
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,720
It had other zones a bit further into it,

1813
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,320
but no one could level up high enough to make use of the zones.

1814
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:03,720
Yeah.

1815
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:07,240
Cause remember I went exploring one day, high, you know,

1816
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,520
running past all the agro stuff and found Costa del Sol.

1817
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:11,880
I was like, Oh my God.

1818
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,160
I've got the whole, everything's level 35 here.

1819
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:15,800
What do I do?

1820
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,920
You know, but I'm just saying.

1821
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:22,440
And then I got, uh, uh, stabbed in the face by, uh, like the Imperial folks.

1822
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,200
So, well, I'll be very curious to see what the reviews look like,

1823
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:30,040
because I don't think, you know, reviewers are going to necessarily go negative just

1824
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,920
because of this whole thing, but it'd be interesting to see, you know,

1825
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,120
was the game kind of a stinker and is that why Ubisoft was holding out?

1826
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:36,440
I don't know.

1827
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,800
I missed the beta just because of all the other games I've been talking about.

1828
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:43,080
I wanted to check it out, but oops, I missed the chance.

1829
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:43,400
Bummer.

1830
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,200
They won't turn that into a free demo or anything like that.

1831
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,720
Dungeon buster and chat says, I really hope they stop calling things a beta when

1832
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,480
it's really that close to release.

1833
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,480
I can sort of forgive it because of the game that needs such an online stress

1834
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:01,560
test, they need to give it away for free so that a lot of people will hammer the

1835
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,480
server and they can accurately test the stress.

1836
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,560
You know, the stress that is kind of needed.

1837
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,840
Maybe they can call it a gamma.

1838
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:13,000
Yeah, that is, that is a term we don't use enough in game is, is gamma or a zeta.

1839
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:14,840
All right.

1840
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,120
Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1841
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,960
I believe things have slowed down dramatically, but I think there's still a

1842
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,760
few things here and there.

1843
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,240
Right, Loki?

1844
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:27,000
Uh, they're, they did have, you know, it has slowed down dramatically as we get

1845
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,720
into December, which is typically a very dead month.

1846
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:34,120
But, uh, this week, of course, as we just mentioned, the crew is coming out on

1847
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:39,400
PlayStation four, Xbox one, PC, and Xbox three 60 as well.

1848
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,840
Also on PlayStation three, kingdom hearts, 2.5 remix limited edition be coming

1849
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,080
out, AKA the last PlayStation three game.

1850
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,320
A lot of people plan on buying a tradeable pin.

1851
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,040
We, this is what we ordered it so I could put that on my lanyard.

1852
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:55,880
Fair enough.

1853
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:02,280
Uh, also the disc versions of Terraria on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1854
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:07,400
Then on Friday, ultimate NES remix for 3DS, uh, NES remix pack for the

1855
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,960
Nintendo Wii U and captain toad treasure tracker on the Wii U.

1856
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,440
That's it.

1857
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,360
All right.

1858
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,520
Let's travel over to Japan on the 4th of December in Japan.

1859
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,120
Call of duty, advanced warfare.

1860
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,360
The dubbed edition comes out there.

1861
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:26,680
Guilty gear XRD sign in regular and limited edition is out on PlayStation

1862
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:31,160
four as is Puyo Puyo Tetris available on the PlayStation four.

1863
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:35,160
I don't know how our crossover between Puyo Puyo and Tetris works, but it's

1864
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,200
like a versus.

1865
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,080
It looks interesting.

1866
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:37,880
Yeah, it's like a versus.

1867
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,200
One person plays Tetris while the other place Puyo Puyo, which, uh, what Dr.

1868
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,560
Robotniks mean, mean machine.

1869
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,360
A lot of you probably know Puyo Puyo as Kirby's avalanche.

1870
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,480
Also available on the PlayStation four, the crew and little big planet three

1871
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,800
getting their Japanese releases this week.

1872
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,960
Xbox one also sees Puyo Puyo Tetris and the crew this week.

1873
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,800
Also on December 4th.

1874
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,040
Yes.

1875
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:04,440
The Xbox one is out in Japan, uh, on the PlayStation three little big planet

1876
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,560
three, getting its release as well as call of duty, advanced warfare, the

1877
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,600
guilty gear game I mentioned before and common rider summon ride comes out on

1878
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,960
the PlayStation three this common rider on the Xbox three 60 call of duty this

1879
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:23,160
week in Japan on the Wii U common rider summon ride and Taiko no Tatsujin

1880
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:24,600
controller pro.

1881
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,880
I don't know if that is to support an upcoming game or if I missed a Taiko

1882
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,480
no Tatsujin release, but this is just the controller is not the game itself.

1883
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,560
So maybe if it's like actual Taiko size, I wonder if there is, if there

1884
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:38,280
isn't something that's on the marketplace, this looks like it's in a

1885
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,160
neat little like plastic wood looking stand.

1886
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:41,960
Oh, that is nice.

1887
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,240
This is a nice looking little thing.

1888
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,440
So I wonder where the game is.

1889
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:49,720
Maybe I missed when that was released, but I could also be something that's

1890
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,000
like download.

1891
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,560
Like, cause I could see that it's probably something you could download

1892
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,480
and then the Wii U touch pad could be a drum.

1893
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:59,720
Did any of the deluxe Bimani controllers come with the game?

1894
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,220
I don't know.

1895
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,120
Anyway, uh, let's see.

1896
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,640
Also on the Wii U there's a lot of stuff coming up on the sixth.

1897
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,320
A lot of it happens to be accessories though, but, uh, the big, big, big one,

1898
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:15,400
of course, uh, smash brothers for Wii U gets its Japanese release on the sixth.

1899
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:19,560
So a lot of people probably hearing about us eating that game up and looking

1900
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,240
forward to playing it themselves.

1901
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:24,360
So you've got to look forward to, uh, there's still more to go on the Vita

1902
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,840
this week, Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3 comes out as well as Diablolic

1903
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,960
Lovers Van Dead Carnival in regular and limited edition.

1904
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,600
Cause the Vita gets way more in Japan than it does here.

1905
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,440
Uh, the culture is very, very different.

1906
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,720
A lot of the Japanese games.

1907
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,120
And in fact, I was looking kind of at some of the stuff coming out next

1908
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,000
year and there's a bunch of Atlas games I hadn't realized that were coming

1909
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,560
up.

1910
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:49,080
Uh, also of note on the 3DS, Shingeki no Kaijin, Genri Saigo no Subasa

1911
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:54,120
Chain and Sengoku Musou Chronicle 3, Derby Stallion Gold.

1912
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,960
Also on the 3DS.

1913
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,800
Wait, what was the last one?

1914
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,760
I just closed it.

1915
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,480
Derby Stallion?

1916
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,720
Oh no, listen, it's an Attack on Titan game.

1917
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,120
Yeah.

1918
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:02,760
So that's cool.

1919
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,560
That's cool.

1920
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,200
How about the UK?

1921
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,840
Uh, just Call of Duty on like damn near everything.

1922
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:16,440
And, um, Never Alone, uh, Kishima, um, now this is actually in, um, one of the,

1923
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:20,920
uh, uh, I forgot the name of the particular Eskimo dialect.

1924
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:27,080
Um, but it's, uh, Kishima Ingichuna, which is called Never Alone.

1925
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:31,640
And I've actually, uh, it's on my, my wishlist on Steam actually.

1926
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:36,760
Um, but it's a, uh, it looks really pretty.

1927
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,520
So I want people to buy this game.

1928
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,480
I want it to do well.

1929
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,320
It's on PS4, Xbox One and PC.

1930
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,240
All right.

1931
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:43,640
That's it.

1932
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,720
Yeah.

1933
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,200
All right.

1934
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,800
I said it was slow, didn't I?

1935
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,600
I guess so.

1936
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,320
I didn't think it was that slow.

1937
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,040
No, I didn't.

1938
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:50,920
Loki did.

1939
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,440
Oh, all right, fine.

1940
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:52,680
All right.

1941
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,040
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

1942
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,080
And then the classic game of the week, but first Loki.

1943
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:57,400
All right.

1944
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:04,360
So the human rights campaign has recognized EA for promoting LGBT quality by, um, awarding

1945
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:09,800
them with a 100% score in the latest corporate equality index.

1946
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,240
And it's, I guess the third year that they've received the perfect score.

1947
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,040
So good job EA.

1948
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,800
At least you can get some things, right?

1949
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:23,320
Yeah, it is very interesting how the quote unquote worst company in America yet does

1950
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,160
some things so, so, so well.

1951
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:30,600
And, uh, yeah, I mean, it does seem like any pride parade I've been to, EA's had a presence

1952
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:30,840
there.

1953
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,720
It's equal opportunity forced labor.

1954
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,360
They just, they, they just don't fuck over their employees.

1955
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,960
Like they fuck over their consumers, I guess.

1956
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,880
They just fuck over all of their employees equally.

1957
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,040
That's, that's all any of us want.

1958
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,640
We all want to be screwed equally.

1959
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:53,800
Everyone needs to have equal access to mandatory overtime and spousal abuse.

1960
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,080
I'm kidding.

1961
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,720
Jokes, jokes, calm down.

1962
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,200
No, at the end of the day, that is, that is a great thing.

1963
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:04,360
I know EA was a sponsor of the first gamer acts and they do a lot with the community

1964
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,000
and so forth.

1965
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,360
And let's, let's talk about diversity and dragon age inquisition.

1966
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,960
Cause it's pretty, it's actually still pretty sad.

1967
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:16,600
Well, it's not shoved in your face either, which I think some people unfortunately who

1968
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,520
are like, why is it matters?

1969
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:23,160
All this stuff and dragon age, it's like, well, it's not exactly shoved in your face.

1970
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,680
Like it's all just diversity of people you run into.

1971
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,640
I still think it's absolutely hilarious.

1972
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:35,080
So one of the pairings happen if you don't romance certain characters.

1973
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,200
Yeah.

1974
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,960
I think it's adorbs.

1975
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:38,680
No spoilers.

1976
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:39,640
All right.

1977
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:40,760
Let's move on.

1978
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,800
Talk about this before the classic game of the week, those smash brothers game cube

1979
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,400
adapters, uh, did you know they're selling like crazy here?

1980
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,480
Uh, this is, this is a mess.

1981
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,000
I mean, they're impossible to find.

1982
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,360
And of course everybody's jacking up the price of the Amazon resellers.

1983
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:00,520
Nintendo sells something that's impossible to find with artificial shortages because

1984
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,440
they couldn't anticipate the demand.

1985
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,040
Do you think it's artificial?

1986
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,040
Do you think it's artificial shortage?

1987
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,680
Because I would almost argue that I don't think it's artificial shortage so much as

1988
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:15,400
it's, you know, I think they really didn't know that this would sell so crazy.

1989
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,000
Well, then they didn't anticipate the demand so that you would think that we'd get it

1990
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,200
right by now, considering that, you know, they seem to miss guess that's across the

1991
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,560
board regardless.

1992
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:30,120
Now I did mention that the game is coming out in Japan and some people have resorted

1993
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:34,360
to importing the Japanese controllers as kind of a workaround.

1994
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,920
So I thought that was kind of a clever way of doing it.

1995
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,920
So, all right.

1996
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,240
Well, let's travel back to a classic time in video game history.

1997
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,680
Maybe, maybe it's something that you could actually play on a GameCube.

1998
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,000
But I actually, even though the classic game of the week only has to be 10 years old or

1999
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,040
more, I think this one actually goes a little further back than that.

2000
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,560
More like 20 or even 25 years old.

2001
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,560
The classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault and

2002
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:07,560
find a game that she thinks, hey, forget all that newfangled shit like your Warcraft and

2003
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,520
your Dragon Ages.

2004
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,080
Play this instead.

2005
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:11,580
Yeah.

2006
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:17,320
And I was actually, I will dedicate this one to one of my favorite video casts, Classic

2007
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:23,640
Game Room, because I'm picking dude's favorite game that he uses for every, every display

2008
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:24,840
and test of controller ever.

2009
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:26,520
Trexton!

2010
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:28,360
Anyone ever played this?

2011
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,680
I definitely have not played this game before.

2012
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,560
Trexton came out in Japan as Tatsujin.

2013
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,400
It came out in 1988.

2014
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,800
It's a vertical spoiler shoot-em-up.

2015
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:50,760
And it was by Toaplan, which came out later on the Mega Drive and PC Engine in Japan.

2016
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,120
It is set in outer space and you are a spaceship.

2017
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,840
You get power-ups, go through different planets.

2018
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,680
You have an eight-way joystick on the arcade version and a shot and bomb button.

2019
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,600
You've got five levels and they're bosses, but they loop forever.

2020
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,040
And you get, of course, more and more difficult as you go in.

2021
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,040
And this gives us some fucking great music.

2022
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:12,760
Rob, would you mind?

2023
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,840
Yes, I will turn it up.

2024
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:27,080
Anyway, it's basically you start off with a power shot as your weapon.

2025
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,560
You get different icons.

2026
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,360
You can get S to increase your speed.

2027
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,120
You get Bs for your bombs.

2028
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,320
In the Japanese one, it's Tatsujin bombs.

2029
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,080
In the US, it's Destroyer bombs.

2030
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:50,040
And then you basically start with every bomb that you use.

2031
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,640
You get a smart bomb.

2032
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,760
The ones that are dropped near the ship and destroy anything in range.

2033
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:02,520
And then you also have other bombs that will damage items further away on the screen.

2034
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:09,240
By the way, every time you start a new life, you get three bombs.

2035
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,320
You also get Ps, which are your power-ups.

2036
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:14,200
I told Dan that he had a lot of P earlier because he was playing this.

2037
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:19,800
You can get other icons up to 10.

2038
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:23,080
And the icons will carry over your lives.

2039
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:30,760
If you die, you would actually be able to spend your icons so that you can power up again.

2040
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,280
They put this into one of their other games called Fire Shark.

2041
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:41,880
You also get one up or two up icons, which will increase the number of lives of which you get.

2042
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,840
And these are covered by shooting certain objects.

2043
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,680
You get different weapons.

2044
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,520
You get the red, which is the power shot.

2045
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:52,040
So you get red projectiles going forward, which is pretty balanced.

2046
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:58,120
Green is the Tatujin beam, or the Truxtun beam, that's green moving lasers.

2047
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:01,240
And it's the strongest weapon per projectile.

2048
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,040
But it doesn't have much spread.

2049
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,680
And then you have blue, which is the Thunder Laser,

2050
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,560
which basically just has blue lightning that goes all over the screen.

2051
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,600
Almost kind of like the lightning attack from Raiden 2.

2052
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,080
But not quite as effective.

2053
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,760
It doesn't like loop and latch onto them.

2054
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:24,120
And of course, if you get extras of those, once you're fully powered up, you get another 5,000 points.

2055
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,920
It's really a good game.

2056
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:32,040
I mean, in easy mode, it's super easy.

2057
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:36,120
But when you get into normal mode, it's actually got a decent amount of challenge to it.

2058
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,400
Of course, it gets a lot harder in the other difficulties.

2059
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:45,240
But it's one of, I would say it's up there as one of the best space shooter games.

2060
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:49,640
So, again, dedicated to one of my favorite video casts.

2061
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,760
Thank you, Classic Game Room, for sharing this one with me.

2062
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:57,160
Because it was a game I did not play when it was new, but I played it as an adult.

2063
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,040
So, thank you.

2064
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,520
There you go.

2065
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,920
As people should do with the Classic Game of the Week.

2066
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,280
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

2067
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,400
Truxtun, which I admit is a game I have not played myself.

2068
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,880
But it looks like, it definitely looks like a competent shooter of that era.

2069
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,240
Pretty much.

2070
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:11,560
Alright.

2071
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,920
1988.

2072
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,680
Alright, 1988, yo.

2073
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,640
Alright, there it is.

2074
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,920
Classic Game of the Week.

2075
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,680
We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

2076
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,160
I know we're running long so far, but we still have plenty of show.

2077
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,760
We have rapid fire news.

2078
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:25,000
The Fugal Question of the Week, of course.

2079
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:25,880
Emails.

2080
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,840
That contest from Jackbox Games we'll get to when we get back.

2081
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,680
The FUs of the Week.

2082
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:36,520
And plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2083
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:46,440
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

2084
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,880
Live on this Sunday night.

2085
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:54,120
November the 30th, 2014 with the 577th episode of our program.

2086
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,680
Thanks for tuning in.

2087
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,040
If you happen to be here live.

2088
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,320
If you're listening on the podcast or whatever to get you through the week.

2089
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,360
In the car.

2090
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,240
Via Stitcher.

2091
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,600
Via the iTunes store.

2092
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,560
Via TuneIn.

2093
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,680
Whatever it is you use.

2094
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,640
Thanks for participating.

2095
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:08,760
We really appreciate it.

2096
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:13,480
And a big thank you to those of you that participated in our contest last week.

2097
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:15,400
If you missed it.

2098
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:18,600
You missed it because it was only a one week deadline to get in there.

2099
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:24,840
But we asked for your best Drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.

2100
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:28,120
And Drawful, of course, is one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack.

2101
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,800
Which is available on PS3, PS4, and Xbox One.

2102
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,880
And we all are big fans of what they are doing over at Jackbox Games.

2103
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,880
And big thanks to them for giving us a code to give away here on the program.

2104
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:43,400
And we asked you guys to submit your drawings of Orange Lounge Radio.

2105
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,600
You only could use MS Paint in the spirit of Drawful.

2106
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,000
And DarkSakura, I promised you guys.

2107
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,480
She would come back from her week off and be like.

2108
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,840
What did you guys do to the mailbox?

2109
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,120
She filled it up with a bunch of stuff.

2110
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,880
But I explained to her what's going on.

2111
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,400
And she picked a winner.

2112
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,880
And DarkSakura, would you describe what the winning

2113
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,960
Orange Lounge Radio artwork looks like here?

2114
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:02,840
It's an orange.

2115
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,200
On a couch.

2116
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,960
With headphones on.

2117
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,360
Thinking about arrows and shit.

2118
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,480
It's the poop that really won it over for me.

2119
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,160
So poop wins, right?

2120
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:15,640
Poop wins.

2121
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:16,600
So congrats.

2122
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,960
I'm four years old.

2123
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,920
So congratulations.

2124
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,840
It is literally a pixel shit.

2125
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:32,040
A good old poop joke won it for Master of the Claw or MXC was our big winner there.

2126
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,680
So check your email if you happen to be listening.

2127
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,240
Master of the Claw and check that out.

2128
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,480
And a big thank you to all you guys that participated.

2129
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:44,760
We had a good time going through and looking at all your horrible, horrible drawings.

2130
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,640
But they cracked us up.

2131
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,000
MXC is in chat right now.

2132
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,500
Oh, is he?

2133
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,160
Oh, then check your email because I sent you something.

2134
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,360
Yay, MXC.

2135
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:53,160
Your shit won.

2136
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,840
Well, enjoy a non-shitty.

2137
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,040
I did, however, enjoy the other two quite well.

2138
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,520
They were very well done.

2139
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,640
But if you want to win, you have to have dicks or shit in it.

2140
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:08,680
All right.

2141
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:09,180
There it is.

2142
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,480
Let's move on.

2143
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,800
We've got some more show to get into here.

2144
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:21,560
And, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2145
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,000
But first, some rapid fire news.

2146
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,640
Loki.

2147
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:27,880
So this is probably good news for those looking to play some more Dark Souls.

2148
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:35,720
Dark Souls is coming back as part of the Dark Souls, was it, the Scholar of the First Sin,

2149
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,640
which will be coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

2150
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,960
Now also Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

2151
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:48,040
It's going to be, I guess, an expanded edition of the game.

2152
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,360
And they're going to have some new balance tweaks, new NPCs, and a new expanded story.

2153
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:57,320
Plus, well, I guess if you're on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, also enhanced visuals.

2154
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,480
And it'll be the first time you can play it on the system.

2155
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:01,800
So that's pretty cool.

2156
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:04,600
Let's see.

2157
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,200
Do they have a date for this yet?

2158
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:11,800
April 7, 2015 is when it's expected to come out.

2159
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,760
So and that's in North America, of course.

2160
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,240
And then, of course, since we're just literally, well, we just started December

2161
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,840
or we will be starting December and a little bit here.

2162
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,960
Let's look at the games with gold that we have coming out as well.

2163
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:36,120
So for this month of December, we've got some pretty cool stuff.

2164
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:40,120
Let's see, the Raven Legacy, the Master Thief,

2165
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:45,160
which is going to be from December 1st through the 15th for Xbox 360.

2166
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:53,240
And then the 16th on through the end of the month, SSX, which looked pretty cool.

2167
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,800
I like SSX, so yeah, worth checking out.

2168
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:02,520
And then for Xbox One, what are we getting for Xbox One?

2169
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:07,160
Worms Battlegrounds is going to be the game that you get that month.

2170
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,480
Okay, cool.

2171
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:14,600
And then, let's see, for PlayStation Network, of course, they've already kind of talked

2172
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,160
a little bit about some of the stuff that you're getting on PlayStation 4.

2173
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:23,080
They mentioned was Injustice Gods Among Us was going to be the first full PlayStation 4 title,

2174
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,320
retail disc PlayStation 4 title is going to be on PlayStation Plus.

2175
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:29,880
So that'll be coming, as well as Secret Ponchos.

2176
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,120
And then on PlayStation 3, they're going to have Deadly Premonition,

2177
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,920
the Director's Cut, Hitman HD Trilogy.

2178
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:42,760
Also the, I guess, re-release of Hitman 2 and Hitman Contracts.

2179
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,920
Oh, I'm sorry, that's part of the HD thing.

2180
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,280
I thought that was coming to Vita as well.

2181
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:52,760
No, for the Vita, I guess they're getting Final Horizon and a shooter called Titan Attacks.

2182
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,480
So not bad.

2183
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,400
All right.

2184
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:57,640
Yeah.

2185
01:51:58,200 --> 01:51:59,640
Free stuff, sort of.

2186
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,960
Free with an asterisk, because you're paying a monthly fee for it.

2187
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:02,920
I'd be nice to check out Injustice.

2188
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,360
It'd be nice to have another game.

2189
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,960
Already bought Injustice on the sale.

2190
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:06,920
Well, it sucks for you.

2191
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:07,720
Yeah, it sucks for me.

2192
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,280
Well, I mean, honestly, who thought that that would have been, like,

2193
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,600
one of the first titles that they put on that service?

2194
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:12,840
I mean...

2195
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,760
I would have thought it would have been Knack, for sure.

2196
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:15,480
Yeah, exactly.

2197
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:19,400
I'm quite surprised that Knack isn't on there yet, because it's worth nothing at this point.

2198
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:20,360
Or even Killzone.

2199
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:23,240
You know, Killzone would have been, you know, interesting to see on there.

2200
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:26,840
Well, perhaps one of these titles will be the next one to be given away for free,

2201
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,880
because there's a Black Friday sale going on on PlayStation.

2202
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,120
If you're listening live, you can probably still get it on this.

2203
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,520
If you're listening on podcast, you're probably a bit too late.

2204
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,560
I'm not going to read everything that's on sale, but some of the highlights.

2205
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:41,960
Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls Ultimate Edition, only $20 on PlayStation 3.

2206
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:45,560
$35 on PlayStation 4, which is a pretty good deal, because that game's pretty recent.

2207
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:49,720
Borderlands, the pre-sequel on PS3 for $39.99.

2208
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,000
See, Shadow of Mordor, only $30 on PS3 or PS4.

2209
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,920
MLB 14, The Show, only $20.

2210
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,920
And Transistor on PlayStation 4, only $8.

2211
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:03,080
Although that was a PlayStation Plus title not that long ago.

2212
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,440
I think that's the game I bought on Mac.

2213
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,000
Oh, it is.

2214
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:07,960
It was Transistor.

2215
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,160
It's supposed to be pretty good.

2216
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,440
I haven't played it myself.

2217
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,200
I haven't started it, but that's the game I got.

2218
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,640
I kept looking at Shadow of Mordor, but I just don't know if I want to play that game.

2219
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:19,480
I mean, it looks good, but I just don't know.

2220
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,160
It's one of those, like, I don't know if I really want to play this type of thing.

2221
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:25,880
You know, because it's like Assassin's Creed.

2222
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,400
They keep comparing it to Assassin's Creed.

2223
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:29,000
I really don't like Assassin's Creed.

2224
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,920
Well, we'll see which one of those titles ends up the next big sale.

2225
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:36,280
And plus, if they're discounting it that much now,

2226
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:39,080
you know that they're going to continue to discount that thing going forward.

2227
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:43,480
So this is not going to be the first time that that's discounted that low.

2228
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,320
Now, it should be noted that Square Enix is also doing a massive sale,

2229
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,280
but you probably don't ever shop at their online store.

2230
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:57,160
If you look at their site directly, that's store.na.square-enix.com,

2231
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:00,200
or if you Google Square Enix store, you'll probably find it.

2232
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:04,280
There's a lot of stuff, like 50, 60% off on their store,

2233
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,040
and I would name them all, but we're talking like over 200 games.

2234
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,800
But you can get things like newer titles like Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn,

2235
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,800
I believe was $16 on PlayStation 4.

2236
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,560
Let me tell you, that's a pretty freaking good deal.

2237
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,280
I mean, granted, that game has a monthly fee,

2238
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,600
but for an MMO, that's a really, really good deal.

2239
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,080
You can also get things like Thief and Tomb Raider.

2240
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:27,320
I wanted to say, I saw like Final Fantasy II on PSP was like $4.

2241
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:28,440
Something like that.

2242
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,400
They're really trying to unload some of their inventory there.

2243
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,000
So if you are a Squeenix fan, check it out.

2244
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,120
I just want the full four thing with the extra chapters.

2245
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,000
That's the big thing I was looking for.

2246
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,880
On the PSP?

2247
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,680
No, no, no, no, no.

2248
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,520
I want the PC iteration of that.

2249
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,120
It's down to $6.40 from $15.99.

2250
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:45,320
The PSP version though, right?

2251
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,440
No, PC.

2252
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:46,920
Oh.

2253
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,240
Yeah.

2254
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,720
So I'm going to be probably ordering that.

2255
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,160
Does that have the after years in it?

2256
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,640
It just says Final Fantasy IV.

2257
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,240
Nah, it doesn't have the after years in it.

2258
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,600
That's the DS version.

2259
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:59,160
Yeah, the after years is the one that I want to play.

2260
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,840
After years, they never put into 3D.

2261
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,520
After years, it's only in the 2D.

2262
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,640
So, yeah.

2263
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,960
So just throwing that out there anyway.

2264
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,640
So check that out.

2265
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,080
Coming up this week, the Game Awards.

2266
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,560
One of those, this moved really fast type of things.

2267
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,720
You know, it was just last week you were talking about it was announced

2268
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,840
and the nominees were out.

2269
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:18,440
Now they're coming up.

2270
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,480
They're on Friday.

2271
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,360
So I heard that we're going to have one of our listeners there.

2272
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:27,880
So I'm hoping to get a Man on the Street report from the Game Awards.

2273
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:31,800
But in the meantime, some of the things that we have to look forward to at the Game Awards.

2274
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,680
One is that Metal Gear Online is going to be there.

2275
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,240
That's right.

2276
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,320
Jeff Keeley tweeted out,

2277
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:44,440
Hideo Kojima will join us at the Game Awards to world premiere Metal Gear Online.

2278
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,480
So that's something you can look forward to at the Game Awards.

2279
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:50,360
But they already had Metal Gear Online.

2280
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,040
On the PSP, right?

2281
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,160
No, it was part of the PS3 versions of Metal Gear Solid 3.

2282
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:55,960
Oh, that's right.

2283
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:58,840
It was like the other game, but they shut down the servers.

2284
01:55:58,840 --> 01:55:59,960
So it's not there anymore.

2285
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,640
So I don't know.

2286
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,240
So they're bringing the servers back?

2287
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:03,640
I don't know.

2288
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:07,000
Maybe it's probably a more robust experience than what they have before.

2289
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,840
Well, we'll find out, won't we, Loki?

2290
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:10,040
We'll find out.

2291
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,040
I'd rather have another trailer for you.

2292
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,960
No Man's Sky, to be honest, but whatever.

2293
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:19,000
Well, Jeff Keeley is teasing also on Twitter because he invested a lot into this.

2294
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
This Friday night, we will showcase more than a dozen world premieres at the Game Awards.

2295
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,400
So Metal Gear Online is one of them.

2296
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:29,400
What could the other 11 be?

2297
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,560
Metal Gear Online 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2298
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:34,040
Who knows?

2299
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,240
There could be some big stuff here.

2300
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:35,640
We don't know.

2301
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,440
I mean, some big games got revealed at the Game Awards in the past.

2302
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:44,760
Skyrim was unveiled, or sorry, when it was the Spike TV Awards or whatever they were called.

2303
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,280
But, you know, the previous iteration.

2304
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,280
I know they're not going to do another Elder Scrolls game.

2305
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,800
It's going to be Fallout next, but...

2306
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,880
Well, Fallout 4 could be one of the announcements.

2307
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,800
It seems about the time.

2308
01:56:53,800 --> 01:57:01,640
So, uh, Elder Scrolls Online never going to come out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

2309
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,800
You know, it got pushed back to April.

2310
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,480
Didn't we have a story on it a couple months ago?

2311
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,440
I think it was pushed back.

2312
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,000
No one cares.

2313
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,760
That's a problem, I think.

2314
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,680
Yeah, maybe an expansion will be out.

2315
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,320
Who knows?

2316
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,640
So yeah, a dozen world premieres coming for that.

2317
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:18,520
And lastly, you know, if you prefer to just have your games free, then one that I've recommended

2318
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,200
before is a game called Path of Exile, which is a bit of a Diablo clone.

2319
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,040
It's a very Diablo-esque sort of game.

2320
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:29,480
But if you haven't checked it out, Path of Exile just got a content update to 1.3.0.

2321
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:34,920
It does a lot of changes with PvP, but there's also some new challenge league as well.

2322
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:37,240
The Torment and the Bloodlines Challenge League.

2323
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,480
So if you haven't checked out Path of Exile, this is something you might want to check out.

2324
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:44,120
There's also an updated passive skill tree.

2325
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:48,360
And if you've never seen the skill tree in Path of Exile, good lord, that thing is a mess.

2326
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,120
I don't know what to do.

2327
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:51,880
I'm so overwhelmed when I look at it.

2328
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:53,240
Anyway, there it is.

2329
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,200
Path of Exile is 1.3.0.

2330
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,040
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for rapid fire news?

2331
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:03,480
Well, there's a game that I should have mentioned in my classic game that I did not,

2332
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,920
because I finally did the entire full playthrough of Hot to Full Boyfriend.

2333
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:11,720
And I'm happy that now everybody else gets to experience the crack

2334
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:17,800
and the weird feels and the what the fuckness of it.

2335
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,720
Because it's going to be on PS4 and Vita in early 2015.

2336
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:28,680
It is a game where you date pigeons, but it really goes a lot deeper than that.

2337
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:32,040
It has this whole alternate world thing going on with it.

2338
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:39,160
And a statement by Hatomoa, who is a manga artist who created the game,

2339
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:43,240
says she was really, really happy to see it come out on PlayStation.

2340
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,160
She never thought that it would be out.

2341
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,360
And all you need is Dove.

2342
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,240
So there's that one.

2343
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:58,520
Also, in other news, if it ever loads, the GameCube controller for

2344
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:07,400
there's going to be a Super Smash Brothers edition for the UK, but it's being delayed.

2345
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:15,320
There was a report on NeoGaf that they got emails from Amazon UK and ShopTo saying that

2346
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:21,080
the GameCube controller Super Smash Brothers edition is being delayed until sometime later

2347
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:21,720
next week.

2348
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:23,240
So sorry, folks in the UK.

2349
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:29,160
They have to shift more of that inventory here our way.

2350
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,640
Yeah, we're being greedy Americans again.

2351
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:32,600
Sorry.

2352
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,160
Not sorry.

2353
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:43,080
And last but not least, there is an item being removed on December 31st, and that will be

2354
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,880
Tetris being removed from the eShop.

2355
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:51,080
So if you want it, I guess you better get it now.

2356
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,840
Not really sure.

2357
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,400
Nintendo hasn't said anything, but I don't know.

2358
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,400
I kind of think I might be going to get some Tetris.

2359
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:04,040
I mean, it's not like you can't play Tetris one of 50,000 other ways with all the various

2360
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,080
Tetris games that are out there.

2361
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,560
But the Game Boy version is really one of the greatest.

2362
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:08,680
Well, I'm not sure.

2363
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,560
This just says Tetris.

2364
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,240
It doesn't say it's the Game Boy version.

2365
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,360
I think it is the Game Boy version.

2366
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:12,600
It is.

2367
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,640
Okay, because my favorite.

2368
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,640
I really do like the NES one better.

2369
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:21,320
So NES one or the Tetris DS was really like one of the best ones they ever did was so

2370
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:21,800
good.

2371
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:22,200
Yeah.

2372
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,640
I don't know if you ever check that version out.

2373
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:25,640
The Sega Tetris arcade was pretty good.

2374
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,040
Yeah.

2375
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:27,960
Oh, the one with the gigantic joystick.

2376
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:29,000
No, no, no, no.

2377
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,320
It was just a regular arcade iteration.

2378
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,080
Oh, I think it only came out in Japan.

2379
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:36,440
I was gonna say, because didn't Atari do the Tetris game here in the arcade way back when?

2380
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:40,120
There was the huge mungus controller edition.

2381
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:40,520
Yeah.

2382
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,280
But there was also just an arcade iteration that Sega put out.

2383
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,560
So much Tetris.

2384
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:46,840
Yeah, that one was really good.

2385
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,680
It was kind of difficult, but really good.

2386
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:48,920
Yeah.

2387
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,920
All right, well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

2388
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:05,160
Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.

2389
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:11,080
You can find us on Facebook at facebook.com orange launch radio and google.com plus orange

2390
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:13,160
lounge radios where you can find us on social media.

2391
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:17,960
You take Facebook and you take Google and you slam those words together, you get foogle.

2392
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,480
It's the foogle question of the week.

2393
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:23,560
And this is in line with the story that Jamie read us earlier about the crew.

2394
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:28,280
The press will be receiving advanced copies of an upcoming Ubisoft game.

2395
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:32,280
While it might be easy to peg this on the recent debacle over Assassin's Creed Unity,

2396
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:36,200
Ubisoft says that this is due to the necessity of needing a full experience with other players

2397
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:37,000
online.

2398
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,520
What are your thoughts on hearing this?

2399
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:42,840
Do you believe more game reviews should be held back so that a game can be fully absorbed

2400
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:43,640
on launch?

2401
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:47,560
Do you think game companies should hold games back more often or do you use reviews to determine

2402
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,880
if you will buy a game in its launch window?

2403
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:53,640
Now we got a lot of good answers tonight and a lot of them are pretty lengthy, so I'm going

2404
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:57,000
to have to be a little picky choosy tonight, so I apologize.

2405
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,760
If you do want to see all the answers though, I encourage you to check our communities.

2406
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:04,760
I'm going to start with Google Plus and Brozime who responds and says,

2407
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,480
I personally won't buy games without a review unless I have the utmost faith the company

2408
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,000
will deliver as promised.

2409
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:19,160
With Ubi's current trend of poorly optimized or buggy releases, I know I need information

2410
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,080
to buy anything they release.

2411
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:25,880
It's also worth noting Activision and EA regularly put up servers for reviewers to play

2412
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,160
online with other reviewers before they release games.

2413
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:31,000
Why can't Ubisoft do the same?

2414
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:36,440
Well, without discounting your point because I believe you raised some good ones, I do

2415
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,160
believe Ubisoft came out and said it's not going to be enough people.

2416
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,320
The press and all that would not be enough.

2417
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,200
There has to be more.

2418
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:46,440
It's got to be more and more and more people for the experience that they're going for.

2419
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,400
That would be also assuming that a lot of people buy the game though.

2420
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,000
Just saying, just saying.

2421
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:55,160
Over on Facebook, let's see.

2422
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,560
We have Fabrice A replies and says,

2423
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:01,080
Holding back a game is to hide a bad game.

2424
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:09,320
I read several reviews anyway unless it's a game I know is going to be a good game.

2425
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:11,560
Andy R. replied and said,

2426
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:15,080
As someone who reviews games as a hobby, I definitely agree that a game review should

2427
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,240
be held until the game can be absorbed enough.

2428
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:21,960
I usually review JRPGs and because I work full time outside this hobby, I don't always

2429
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,560
feel like I have a good handle on the game in the week or the two that I have the game

2430
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,840
before it comes out.

2431
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,200
In those cases, I'd rather hold my review than release something that's not helpful

2432
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,400
to anyone reading it.

2433
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:34,840
That said, I do think it's in the best interest of the companies to try and allow reviewers

2434
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,240
to get reviews out before the game comes out.

2435
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:40,760
Obviously, if they can have a good game that's getting good reviews before launch, that helps

2436
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:41,400
sales.

2437
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,800
I feel that a lot of the onus should be on the reviewers to not release half-baked reviews.

2438
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:49,080
Sadly though, most of the big review sites seem to care more about getting their review

2439
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:53,080
out first so they can get clicks than about releasing a proper critique.

2440
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:56,920
Unfortunately, in these days where online components make up large portions of games,

2441
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:01,160
publishers holding review copies until launch might be the only way to get some of these

2442
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,280
websites to behave.

2443
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:03,640
Let's see.

2444
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,240
Hits Done replies and says,

2445
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,120
I no longer trust sites that accept terms from publishers to get review copies of games

2446
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:10,920
before launch.

2447
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:16,600
I will wait for word of mouth from my friends or from independent media before I drop any

2448
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:17,880
cash myself.

2449
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:21,960
Reviews ought to be based on the experience I would get if I bought the game, bugs and

2450
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,800
all, so this is a good thing for me.

2451
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,520
Lastly, Ursa Being Slurpy says,

2452
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,520
Ubisoft is definitely up to no good.

2453
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:32,840
I generally watch YouTube reviews for games I'm not sure about, but some games I'll buy

2454
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,880
regardless of reviews just because I enjoy the story, etc.

2455
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,600
Elder Scrolls, Witcher, Psy, Warcraft.

2456
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:40,600
Remember how I said I wouldn't be to re-subbing to WoW?

2457
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:43,080
Well, my orc shaman is half a level away from 100.

2458
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,520
I feel your pain.

2459
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:45,320
I feel your pain.

2460
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:46,920
So there you go.

2461
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:51,800
It seems like a lot of people are kind of like, here's something shady going on here,

2462
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,560
and I do use reviews.

2463
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:56,920
But, you know, we have that very strongly worded one there from Hits Done saying that

2464
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:01,000
I will not trust a site that buys into the publisher's reviews.

2465
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:05,480
So it does seem like more and more sites are starting to push back, though.

2466
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:09,080
I mean, after the whole mess with Assassin's Creed, you know, a couple of the big ones

2467
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:14,040
came out and said we will no longer adhere to embargo dates that are after the launch

2468
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:14,540
of the game.

2469
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,640
And so I guess this was Ubisoft's way of responding saying, well, then you will not get the game

2470
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,080
until the game is released.

2471
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:25,960
So it's this interesting push and dance that's going on here.

2472
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:28,360
We'll see how it affects the sales of the game.

2473
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:32,760
I kind of think, I don't know, the crew is coming out at kind of a bad time.

2474
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:33,960
It missed Black Friday.

2475
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:37,240
I mean, I realize there's still a lot of shopping needs left, but people are so consumed with

2476
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,440
a bunch of other stuff right now.

2477
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:43,720
If it comes out and it's fine, then I don't think it's going to be an issue.

2478
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:48,520
If it comes out, it's all broken, then it's going to be an issue.

2479
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:52,040
It's going to be a big issue with Ubisoft because that level of trust, you've already

2480
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:55,320
fucked up a few games in a row that have come out.

2481
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:58,600
Now, it's like we can't really trust you with this.

2482
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:03,480
And we know that this is because of some sort of issues with the game.

2483
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:07,000
And you kind of knew they were going to be there and you're trying to stop people from

2484
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,720
canceling their preorders, if you know what I mean.

2485
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:14,520
And I just have a feeling even though they are beta testing this stuff, I mean, they've

2486
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:21,000
been tested other games before and it still was a pain in the ass to play that day one.

2487
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:25,240
The crew, thankfully, I don't think is going to be as high demand to say like, you know,

2488
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,120
Destiny or something.

2489
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:29,080
So maybe it won't be so bad, but I don't know.

2490
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:31,560
All right.

2491
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,360
Well, what's that?

2492
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:36,840
I read the first response I read was from Google.

2493
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:41,080
I did not read all of the responses tonight because a lot of them were lengthy and were

2494
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:42,040
running a little long.

2495
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:47,000
So I thank everybody for replying and I encourage everybody to go read all the answers on our

2496
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,640
Google Plus and our Facebook pages.

2497
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:54,920
They're facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash or excuse me,

2498
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:58,280
google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

2499
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:58,840
Blah, blah, blah.

2500
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:00,120
I got a little tongue tied there.

2501
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,440
So yeah, some weeks we have time to read them all.

2502
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:06,280
But tonight I didn't because some of you guys got really, really, really lengthy.

2503
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:09,320
So all right, let's move on.

2504
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,760
Let's get into some more news.

2505
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,400
Loki.

2506
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:17,160
So Sony now is planning on shifting their focus towards PlayStation as regard in regards

2507
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:23,880
to, you know, their income, because right now they were, I guess, kind of sharing some

2508
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,080
of that with smartphones.

2509
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,960
But I don't think their smartphone division is doing that great.

2510
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:32,360
They're saying that right now they're expecting to lose 30 percent of the sales by next spring.

2511
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:39,320
And, you know, basically, you know, the PlayStation division's been up and they're up by 25 percent,

2512
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,720
I guess, as much as 13.6 billion dollars.

2513
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:47,320
So maybe, I don't know, it makes sense.

2514
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,840
I mean, go with what's working.

2515
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:54,280
I mean, if you're going to try to do mobile and that mobile market's kind of saturated,

2516
02:07:54,280 --> 02:08:00,840
then maybe it's, you know, focus all your, you know, focus most of your money towards

2517
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:01,800
what's working for you.

2518
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:03,000
That's cool.

2519
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,760
Maybe we'll see some better stuff out of the PlayStation side because of that now that

2520
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,200
they're focusing more resources.

2521
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:12,920
Maybe, I don't know, maybe something that has to do with Morpheus when it comes out.

2522
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:14,520
I don't know.

2523
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,640
It can't be a bad thing that they're putting more focus on PlayStation.

2524
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,840
Don't forget, you know, what else is happening this weekend is that PlayStation experience

2525
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:23,320
is happening.

2526
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:30,760
So, I mean, even though this is traditionally a slower news period, I can't imagine Sony

2527
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:34,920
doesn't have at least one big thing they're going to pull out of their hat at the PlayStation

2528
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:35,320
experience.

2529
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:39,000
You know, there's got to be something they're going to get that crowd really excited about

2530
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,080
that, oh yeah, I got to play this.

2531
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:44,680
You know, there's going to be something there that's going to have everybody really excited,

2532
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:45,080
I think.

2533
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:46,600
So, we'll see.

2534
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:50,040
I'd be down with a better version of PlayStation All-Stars.

2535
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,240
Oh, you think that's worth revisiting?

2536
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:53,880
I think so.

2537
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:58,840
I don't think, I think if they got, I mean, I think the hard part is, you know, memorable

2538
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,280
characters because, you know, there are a lot of PlayStation franchises, but it's not

2539
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:05,480
anything like the Nintendo, but I think if you get the gameplay there, then it won't

2540
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,360
be so bad.

2541
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:08,280
Hell, throw some indies on there.

2542
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:10,360
You know, that would be pretty cool.

2543
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,120
Yeah, we'll see.

2544
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:15,080
Well, indies made a pretty good showing at E3, so we'll see.

2545
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:18,920
I mean, maybe that's just because there wasn't a lot else to show for the rest of this year

2546
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:22,680
because the titles on PlayStation have been a little light, but we'll see.

2547
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:23,320
We'll see what happens.

2548
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:29,960
Moving on, this would be a game I bet a lot of you would love to see at the PlayStation

2549
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,520
Experience.

2550
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,760
Unfortunately, I doubt it, but you never know.

2551
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:40,920
Final Fantasy XV, actually, I don't know how many of the other companies Sony got to buy

2552
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:46,200
into this, but considering that this demo is supposed to be, what, April next year,

2553
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:49,160
it would not be far-fetched that they might have something at PlayStation Experience.

2554
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:50,760
This is Final Fantasy XV.

2555
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:56,760
Final Fantasy XV, more and more has been coming out on this game, which, of course, a lot

2556
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,960
of people have been joking is the Broad Trip Final Fantasy, because that's pretty much

2557
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,460
all we've seen.

2558
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:06,760
But anyway, there is, of course, the promotion where you can get the demo if you pre-order

2559
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:11,160
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which most Final Fantasy fans will be getting anyway.

2560
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:17,400
But also noting that the demo will be two hours' worth and possibly up to four if you

2561
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,880
are one of those people that explores everything.

2562
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:23,320
Like, if you're still in the Hinterlands in Dragon Age, you'll probably get four hours

2563
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,200
out of that right there.

2564
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:27,960
That's just like a Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pains right there.

2565
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:28,600
Right?

2566
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,880
Or the Ground Zero or whatever.

2567
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:35,000
That's, you know, the experience that some companies charge $20 for.

2568
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:39,720
It's Final Fantasy XV episode Duske.

2569
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:40,840
Is that how you say that?

2570
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:41,640
Duska?

2571
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,120
Duske?

2572
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,400
Duske?

2573
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:44,440
I don't know.

2574
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,320
How's it spelled?

2575
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,480
D-U-S-C-A-E.

2576
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:49,640
Duske.

2577
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:50,840
Duske.

2578
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:51,800
Episode Duske.

2579
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,080
Type 0 launches on March 17th.

2580
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,960
The demo will come after that, not necessarily at the same time.

2581
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,640
I thought it was like April or something.

2582
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:04,040
So not far-fetched that you might see something about this at PlayStation Experience, though.

2583
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:08,680
But don't forget that this game is also going to be on Xbox One, right?

2584
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:08,920
Yeah.

2585
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,280
Final Fantasy XV is on Xbox One.

2586
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:14,280
It's just not going to have the same promotion because I don't believe Type 0 is on Xbox

2587
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:14,520
One.

2588
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,040
So there you go.

2589
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,120
All right.

2590
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:22,120
Coming soon, but not soon enough.

2591
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,800
Let's move on with some more stories.

2592
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,760
Dark Sakura.

2593
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:28,840
Well, get ready to be pissed at Verizon again.

2594
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,880
I know that we've been touching back and forth on the whole net neutrality issues going on.

2595
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:44,280
And there's been talk with the FCC over reclassifying broadband and mobile broadband to common

2596
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:47,640
carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.

2597
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:54,280
Well, Verizon says that if the FCC doesn't reclassify it, they won't sue.

2598
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:55,240
Yeah.

2599
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:58,120
Everyone who's using Verizon, listen up.

2600
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,280
Talk to the company that you were using the service of.

2601
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:07,000
Send them letters or change your service if they're going to be acting this way.

2602
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,040
They've already sued the FCC and won once.

2603
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,520
But if this reclassification goes through, they're not going to have any grounds to stand

2604
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:14,680
on it.

2605
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:18,520
They're going to try to suit to have it changed back to what it is now so that they can keep

2606
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:24,040
gouging their prices and form as close to legal a monopoly with other companies that

2607
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:24,440
they can.

2608
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:27,560
Or more of a trust.

2609
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:29,640
So keep your eyes on them.

2610
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:33,720
I remember what I talked about earlier, the whole fact that we're buying all these digital

2611
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:38,840
games, yet, you know, the service that's really delivering that to us is unregulated.

2612
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,760
So we'll see.

2613
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:43,960
It's I think it's still risky until we have some resolution on this.

2614
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:49,400
So I think I think a big rude awakening is going to come in for some of these companies

2615
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,440
in the next couple of years, though.

2616
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:51,240
We'll see.

2617
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:51,560
We'll see.

2618
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,000
Meanwhile, lucky.

2619
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,520
All right.

2620
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:01,640
So I don't I'm pretty sure this is not legit, but there's been some videos going around

2621
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:07,320
and pictures showing that an amiibo figure is being used to open the Moscow Metro gates

2622
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:10,520
using the near field communication.

2623
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:17,720
My guess, since the video is not playing for me, is that either somebody put the actual

2624
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:24,040
NFC chip from one of those cards from the metro in the amiibo, which I've heard people

2625
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:29,240
doing similar things with other types of things, you know, like they put the card in there

2626
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:30,360
just look fancy.

2627
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:34,360
But I don't think it's legit that, you know, an amiibo figure is actually opening those

2628
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:34,680
gates.

2629
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:37,160
I'll be hilarious if it was, though.

2630
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:41,080
Not that I would encourage the stealing of free rides, but it'd just be really funny

2631
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:44,600
if the systems were so similar, but I just can't imagine that's how it works.

2632
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,640
Yeah, I don't think so.

2633
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:46,840
I'd be very curious, though.

2634
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:51,560
Like, I'm surprised nobody's hacked one of those on a PC yet, or is that just happened

2635
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,240
and we just are not hearing about it.

2636
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:56,680
That somebody's because they have to have those readers for PC, right?

2637
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,760
So somebody's reading one of those figures on a PC.

2638
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:00,520
You don't even need a PC to read those.

2639
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:01,880
You can use read them with a cell phone.

2640
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:04,600
My cell phone can read your field communication stuff.

2641
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,080
That's right.

2642
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:09,480
Now with the fancy-dancy 6+, I think you can do that, too, because it's how Apple Pay works,

2643
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:09,720
right?

2644
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,720
So my phone can read it.

2645
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:13,320
So you can read them, but you can't.

2646
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:17,080
It's hard to write to them, I think, is what the problem is.

2647
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:22,280
And you also, I don't know if they have it encrypted or, you know, how exactly that works.

2648
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:27,400
And I can't imagine the amount of data that's on there is very, you know, big, but it's

2649
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:28,680
probably just like stats.

2650
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:29,320
I don't know.

2651
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:30,280
It'd be kind of weird.

2652
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,280
I don't know what exactly they store on there.

2653
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,520
Yeah, I'd be very curious what that looks like.

2654
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,960
If you could get in there, you might be able to figure out what else they're going to use

2655
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,920
it for in the future.

2656
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:44,680
Although they also probably use some type of proprietary compression that, I mean, even

2657
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:48,200
if you could pull the data, that doesn't mean you could decompress it.

2658
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:53,000
If I were Nintendo, that's how I'd try to keep it safe is that I would have compressed

2659
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:58,760
data on those things that decompresses when it comes over to the Wii U, which would be

2660
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:02,920
another reason why I don't think the subway trick is really, oh, you buy this figure and

2661
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,120
you get free subway rides.

2662
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:04,840
I think you're right.

2663
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:07,000
It's somebody replaced the chip or what have you.

2664
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:12,680
Well, because if you imagine if they figured out how to do that, just in devil's advocate

2665
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:15,080
here, imagine they figured out how the amiibos work.

2666
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:22,280
Someone puts a smartphone app or whatever that, oh, look, your phone's amiibo now.

2667
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:22,760
Boop.

2668
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:25,880
You know, that's an amiibo and it's any amiibo that I want.

2669
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:30,680
And I can store all the things or I can mod my stats or, you know, all sorts of exploits

2670
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,400
you could do with that.

2671
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:37,720
Sg100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, my girlfriend has her Boston Metro pass

2672
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,520
as a ring.

2673
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,760
She got it from a Kickstarter and it's pretty useful.

2674
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,680
So yeah, some people put these chips in all sorts of things.

2675
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:47,800
I wouldn't even think to put that in jewelry.

2676
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:48,600
That's so crazy.

2677
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,100
Oh my gosh.

2678
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:54,040
I think they don't, they sell also now though, those like life alert bracelets, do something

2679
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:58,040
like that where now instead of, you know, remember the whole life alert thing?

2680
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:03,320
They actually will have a programmable thing using the Bluetooth coming from a smartphone.

2681
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:03,480
Yeah.

2682
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:07,080
Like some of them are like USB devices now that could have like some of your medical

2683
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,640
records on it if need be or just all the information.

2684
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:14,040
So yeah, I've actually, well, I mean, I use the same function on my iPhone, but yeah.

2685
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:14,540
Yeah.

2686
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:15,800
So interesting.

2687
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:16,860
All right.

2688
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:24,920
And Sg100Matt linking to the ring, which apparently is part of the MBTAgifts.com website.

2689
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,800
I didn't even know that was the thing.

2690
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:27,000
That's pretty cool looking.

2691
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:27,500
Yeah.

2692
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,480
The Sesame ring.

2693
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:29,980
That's great.

2694
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,520
The wearable Charlie card.

2695
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:33,020
Wow.

2696
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:37,720
I love how this guy in this is looking like a power ranger when he's using the, I bet

2697
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:42,840
Shane would like that power ranger there and make that picture with a fist anyway.

2698
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:43,080
Yeah.

2699
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:47,000
And then to kind of go back on them hacking that, uh, apparently there was a guy that

2700
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:51,720
actually did that with Skylanders and got seasoned assisted pretty fast.

2701
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:52,600
Really?

2702
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,100
Yeah.

2703
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,440
Oh, come on though.

2704
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:55,960
It's gotta, it'll show up somewhere else.

2705
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:00,600
So the trick, and this is, this is goes for anybody that's wanting to do this out there.

2706
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:03,080
You don't talk about it until you have it working.

2707
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:06,680
You upload to the internet, you get your cease and desist and too bad it's on the internet.

2708
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:08,040
Too bad it's already on the internet.

2709
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:08,540
Right.

2710
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:13,240
Get it on some video site or hosted in another country.

2711
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:13,400
Yeah.

2712
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:14,920
Don't talk about it until you're done.

2713
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,120
Yeah, that's how you do it.

2714
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,880
That's and that, that can also go for anybody that's making a fan game or anything, or,

2715
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:24,440
you know, doing translations or something that, you know, one of those companies might

2716
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:29,000
sue you because you're using their properties and, you know, just don't, don't say anything

2717
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:29,500
until it's done.

2718
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:34,840
Well, we were talking about what could possibly be revealed at the PlayStation experience.

2719
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:38,680
Well, we don't know maybe something that soon, but we do know something that's supposed to

2720
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:42,760
be coming at E3 next year as far as PlayStation is concerned.

2721
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:45,320
It's coming from Level 5.

2722
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:48,120
This is the studio that made Ni No Kuni.

2723
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,880
They also made Yokai Watch.

2724
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:54,840
And you may have heard of White Knight Chronicles, which was, I think that game was probably

2725
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:57,320
a little bigger in Japan, but it was a pretty neat game.

2726
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:02,280
White Knight Chronicles 1 and 2 were released here in the States, and they were almost a

2727
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:03,480
little too complicated.

2728
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:05,080
They had a lot of online stuff.

2729
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:09,640
It felt a little bit MMO-ish, but there was a White Knight Chronicles live stream that

2730
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:14,280
happened recently, and the president of Level 5, Akihiro Hino, said that they have been

2731
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:19,080
working on a PlayStation 4 title, and it will be unveiled at E3.

2732
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:23,640
He said he wants to create a game that exceeds the White Knight Chronicles titles developed,

2733
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:26,600
and White Knight Chronicles, of course, was developed in collaboration with Sony Computer

2734
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:27,560
Entertainment Japan.

2735
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:32,920
If you're a PlayStation Plus member in Japan, you can get White Knight Chronicles 2 for

2736
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:33,560
free, actually.

2737
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,720
It's one of their PlayStation Plus titles right now.

2738
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:42,040
There was also a White Knight Chronicles PSP prequel developed by Matrix, who made Final

2739
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:43,960
Fantasy III on the Nintendo DS.

2740
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:48,440
So we don't know what they're making, but this makes it sound like it could be another

2741
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:50,600
epic RPG of sorts.

2742
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:52,600
Hopefully the demo won't suck.

2743
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:57,960
IkumaJP is in chat just going, no, nope, nope, nope.

2744
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:00,520
Oh, he really wasn't a fan of that, though, if I remember right.

2745
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:03,800
Yeah, but he likes Yo-kai Watch, which I want.

2746
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:04,840
There you go.

2747
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:09,560
All right, so we'll see what comes out of that.

2748
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:11,960
IkumaJP says White Knight Chronicles not big.

2749
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:16,920
Well, it wasn't really big here either, and somehow it got a sequel, so I assumed it

2750
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,880
had to be big somewhere.

2751
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:19,160
Is it big in Europe?

2752
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:22,360
I don't know, it was one of the sequels that kind of surprised.

2753
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:24,600
Maybe it was because Sony was invested in it, I don't know.

2754
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:28,600
I just remember the sequel to White Knight Chronicles had the original in it because

2755
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:33,320
you had to play the first, I mean, you could start the second game, but it was way harder

2756
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:37,080
to start the second game at the base level they gave you than to level a character through

2757
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:37,880
the original game.

2758
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:40,200
So, interesting.

2759
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:43,160
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

2760
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:45,000
Every week, you guys email us.

2761
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,480
Participate at orangelaungerated.com is the place to send those emails, and Dark Soccer

2762
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:54,520
will dive into the mailbag and pull out the emails she believes are worth reading tonight.

2763
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:56,280
Gross.

2764
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:56,780
Ew.

2765
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,600
All right, Dark Soccer, read some emails.

2766
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,120
All right, words.

2767
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:04,360
All right, first one is a skeezy's question.

2768
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:06,520
What's up, Orange Lounge?

2769
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:07,880
Sorry I haven't emailed in a while.

2770
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,240
I've been really busy working.

2771
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:11,160
Anyway, my question is pretty simple.

2772
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:14,360
In Mario Party, which character do you always seem to pick and why?

2773
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:14,860
Lol.

2774
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:17,000
Hope you guys are doing well.

2775
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,120
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

2776
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:19,240
EA skeezy.

2777
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:21,080
Um, I usually get stuck with Daisy.

2778
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:26,600
Um, which I'll either use her or Waluigi, just because Waluigi is kinda lanky and weird.

2779
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:31,240
Um, you guys?

2780
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:33,000
Sorry, quickly, what was the question again?

2781
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,400
Who do you get stuck using in Mario Party and why?

2782
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:39,400
I always elect to use Peach because Peach is the winner.

2783
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:43,640
If I can't play Peach, I stomp and throw a fit.

2784
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:45,880
Like, there's no other, there's no other character that I'll play.

2785
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:47,640
Do you stomp your little foot and pout?

2786
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:48,140
I do.

2787
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,280
You've played Mario Party with me.

2788
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:53,160
What about you, Loki?

2789
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:56,760
Um, probably just like the same characters I normally pick.

2790
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:59,720
And, um, Mario Party, to be honest.

2791
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,800
So probably, like, Yoshi.

2792
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:04,860
There you go.

2793
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:07,560
Next email.

2794
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:09,880
Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.

2795
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:14,040
I just wanted to give you guys a brief update on the situation with Galaxy as the educational

2796
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:18,280
game that you guys reported on having partnered with the New York Academy of Sciences to bring

2797
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,640
wholesome education to children.

2798
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:22,360
Oh no, I can only imagine what this is gonna be.

2799
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:27,720
Apparently half of the team has been let go, reducing their headcount from about 15 employees

2800
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:28,520
to seven.

2801
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:33,000
This includes the company's creative director who co-founded the studio along with the CEO

2802
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,920
and was, from what my roommate tells me, the only person who was actually able to keep

2803
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:41,000
the project together and keep the tyrannical CEO in check.

2804
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,640
Now that they are gone, they're down to only one programmer and no one is there to make

2805
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:49,880
sure the CEO doesn't verbally beat everyone in the company into a figurative pulp.

2806
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:53,640
It seems that most of the remaining team is seeking other employment and prospects for

2807
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:58,760
the game ever releasing, much less being at a high enough quality to teach children science

2808
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,720
are bleak.

2809
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:03,160
I know that most of the listeners have probably already forgotten about the company, but since

2810
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:07,240
you guys initially reported on it with high hopes and I chimed in with my perspective

2811
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:10,920
on the matter a few months ago, I figured I would close the loop and assure you guys

2812
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:15,400
that Galaxies will undoubtedly be a miserable failure.

2813
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,080
Yours truly is HP.

2814
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:30,520
P.S. I'm a few episodes late, but here's a tribute to OLR for episode 575, Rob Jamie

2815
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:33,000
Loki, the only show where every gamer has a voice.

2816
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:04,520
But these guys way high up like the CEO, the creative director don't.

2817
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:04,760
Yeah.

2818
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:07,160
So the creative director probably knew what he was doing with the CEO.

2819
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:10,840
Unfortunately, didn't last email hot mess.

2820
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:11,800
Sounds like hot mess.

2821
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:12,360
The game.

2822
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:14,440
I have to read you the subject first.

2823
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:15,480
Are you?

2824
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:16,600
Wait, sorry.

2825
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:18,280
Just one other quick thought on that last email.

2826
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:22,520
Whoever, you know, that's involved with that whole thing should like at least write a book

2827
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:26,360
or something like at least a manifesto, at least a blog post.

2828
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:26,600
Yeah.

2829
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,000
At least an angry blog post or something.

2830
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:29,560
Do the thing.

2831
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:34,600
Are you having issues with explosive projectile diarrhea?

2832
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:36,040
Join the support group today.

2833
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:36,440
Lols.

2834
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:37,560
What?

2835
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:39,720
That's an email we got.

2836
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:39,960
Really?

2837
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:40,920
That's an email.

2838
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:41,480
Hi, gang.

2839
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,040
And you read it?

2840
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,680
Oh, there's more.

2841
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:45,000
Okay.

2842
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:47,000
Now I have to burp.

2843
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:47,400
Thank you.

2844
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:52,920
Well, at least you don't have to projectile whatever that thing is.

2845
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:53,320
What?

2846
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,680
Explosive projectile diarrhea.

2847
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:55,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2848
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,160
That would be a messy support group.

2849
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:58,520
Hi gang.

2850
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:02,840
It's that time of year again where people watch a ton of football.

2851
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:03,400
Yuck.

2852
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:05,240
Stuff their faces with food like no tomorrow.

2853
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:06,920
Followed by shopping.

2854
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:10,280
That being said, that brings up my topic for this email.

2855
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:13,880
What geek-centric stuff did you three buy within the past few days,

2856
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:19,080
be it gadgets, games, music, et cetera, either in a brick and mortar store or online?

2857
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:23,160
Personally speaking, I did all my shopping online on Wednesday.

2858
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:28,120
I had spent a personal record breaking $90 on Steam's fall sale, bought 17 items,

2859
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:32,600
and spent $30 on iTunes, which went toward the Medal of Honor Frontline soundtrack,

2860
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:39,320
the bulk of Sleepy Hollow season two, Crazy Chocobo from the Final Fantasy 13-2 OST,

2861
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:41,960
and the Halo Suite from Halo CE OST.

2862
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:45,080
This email is brought to you by Crazy Chocobo, the greatest song ever,

2863
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:46,440
despite what Act Deft would say.

2864
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:49,080
That's for you to start a fight.

2865
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:51,000
What, Loki?

2866
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,680
I was going to say going to projectile explosive diarrhea or whatever.

2867
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:55,400
Oh my God.

2868
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:59,320
That'd be a great subtitle for the sequel to Pixel Shits.

2869
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:02,920
Pixel Shits 2, projectile explosive diarrhea.

2870
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:03,960
Or explosive projectile diarrhea.

2871
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,720
Let's do the 8-bit edition.

2872
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:06,360
I love it.

2873
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:10,360
I didn't really buy much of anything.

2874
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:12,520
I did buy games for other people.

2875
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:13,640
Nothing really for myself.

2876
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:19,640
I bought a couple of things, but mostly I ended up finding an M-Flow album on iTunes

2877
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:21,720
that I didn't own, and I bought that.

2878
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:23,560
I bought the...

2879
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:28,600
I pre-ordered Greg Proops' book, The Smartest Book in the World.

2880
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:30,920
I didn't realize he was doing a book.

2881
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:32,120
He was just here in Sacramento.

2882
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:32,680
We missed him.

2883
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:37,160
But he took a picture with that cat, the local celebrity cat.

2884
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:37,960
Oh, really?

2885
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:38,680
I forgot the name.

2886
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:39,000
Norm.

2887
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:40,760
Norm, the big fat cat.

2888
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,960
It would put Sharmi to shame.

2889
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,600
How funny.

2890
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:43,480
That was a funny picture.

2891
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:44,120
It was on Facebook.

2892
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:48,360
Honestly, the only thing that I ended up buying was the Warlords Draenor expansion.

2893
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:49,080
Isn't that enough?

2894
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:53,480
Because it's being expected.

2895
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:54,520
Addict.

2896
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:56,920
And the Sega Humble Bundle.

2897
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:59,080
I guess I did buy that in the past couple of days.

2898
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:06,760
But no, when you get down to the fact that you spent probably about less than $5 on how

2899
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,320
many games?

2900
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:10,440
Yeah, that's less than lunch.

2901
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:16,200
I'm still trying to pay off my credit card from all the other tech shit I've bought throughout

2902
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:16,600
the year.

2903
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:18,600
Now is just not a good time.

2904
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:23,400
You know, so that's what I got.

2905
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:27,000
I got to pay off the credit card before I can think about any other big tech geeky purchases

2906
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
such as the Xbox One that I want.

2907
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,120
And I was tempted.

2908
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:30,920
I was tempted.

2909
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:32,440
I'm getting my present tomorrow.

2910
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:33,400
Lucky.

2911
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:39,400
My extreme wonderful present that I can't really tell many people about because it might

2912
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:40,120
tell people where it works.

2913
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:41,640
Why would you say it now?

2914
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,960
Just because I'm super excited about it and I wish I could.

2915
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:46,520
But it's going to be so awesome.

2916
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:47,560
Tease of a teaser.

2917
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,680
All right, any other emails?

2918
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:51,000
Um, no.

2919
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:54,680
All right, then that means it's time to get into the FUs of the week.

2920
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:16,360
If you try to just say pronounce FUs like it's just spelled, it would be FUS, which

2921
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:17,320
means we have a short way.

2922
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:19,080
Absolutely.

2923
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:20,680
So what is your FUs of the week?

2924
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:22,840
Fuck you to Mercy Medical in Daphne, Alabama.

2925
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,800
I don't know without going too much into detail on this.

2926
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:35,240
It's where my grandmom was being kept and apparently she has been very much neglected

2927
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:35,480
there.

2928
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:40,600
And so if I could teleport there and punch every single one of you that works there in

2929
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:42,120
the face, I would do it.

2930
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:45,960
But since I cannot, I'm encouraging my mother to sue the ever living shit out of me.

2931
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:47,720
Just let me know.

2932
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:50,120
Um, yeah.

2933
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:54,680
So the state that my grandmom is in right now, I put directly blame on them.

2934
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:56,280
So fuck you.

2935
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:57,480
Fuck you a lot.

2936
02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:03,080
And, um, it's really difficult.

2937
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:04,280
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

2938
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:13,720
Loki, fuck you to my cat for deciding to vomit on all the things that we enjoy.

2939
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:19,800
Um, I understand cats, you know, have hair balls and they spit up and stuff like that,

2940
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:23,960
but she always picks like shit that's really annoying.

2941
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:31,000
Like, for example, my son's remote that he chews on is in the middle of the floor and

2942
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,960
you know, she fucking walked over to vomit on it.

2943
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:35,160
And so she did that.

2944
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:39,800
Or like, for example, our Christmas tree, which is in the garage in a box.

2945
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:43,000
She hopped up on the box to vomit in the box.

2946
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:49,080
And now today we have like an Afghan on the, um, couch, you know, that we've been using

2947
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:52,200
this like, and she's been actually laying in it and she fucking threw up in that.

2948
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,760
I'm like, what is your problem, cat?

2949
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:59,560
Seriously, throw up on the floor so I can clean it up there instead of, you know, on

2950
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:00,520
things that we use.

2951
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:01,980
That's it.

2952
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:09,080
Uh, my, a few of the week goes to a recent bout of Twitter drama that I'm seeing unfolding

2953
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:09,720
tonight.

2954
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:15,000
Now, look, I don't watch the walking dead, but I respect that some people out there watch

2955
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,880
their shows and they don't want to get spoiled on their shows.

2956
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:20,920
So some of y'all need to check your East coast privilege.

2957
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:23,000
You need to check your East coast privilege.

2958
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:23,400
That's right.

2959
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:27,480
I'm looking at you, New York city and Boston OL army members.

2960
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:33,400
Not that I think you ever would spoil TV shows here in the chat or whatever, but, uh, seriously,

2961
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:38,040
if you're going to post spoilers on Twitter and Facebook, not cool.

2962
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:42,520
And don't fucking tell your West coast friends where you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter.

2963
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:45,880
No, you shouldn't be on Facebook and Twitter posting that stuff.

2964
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:48,840
Rude, rude a tease.

2965
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:53,320
There should be like a 24 hour period, at least on spoilers.

2966
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:59,160
It's fine if you want to post like OMG or I can't believe it or WTF BBQ LOL.

2967
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:03,480
But I'm just saying like, I could tell you what happened on the walking dead tonight.

2968
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:04,920
I don't even watch the fucking show.

2969
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:07,480
So some of y'all need to stop.

2970
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:08,360
You're ruining it.

2971
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,200
All right.

2972
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:10,600
That's it.

2973
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,040
Yeah.

2974
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:15,240
And, uh, some people saying the walking dead Facebook page gave it away.

2975
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:16,200
That was really stupid.

2976
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,680
I hope they get raked over the coals for that one.

2977
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:19,800
That was not cool.

2978
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:21,080
All right.

2979
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:23,080
Uh, let's move on a few more stories for you guys.

2980
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:26,680
Then we'll open up the Skype line for some calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or

2981
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,240
username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word, uh, your calls in just a minute

2982
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:32,440
here after a couple more stories.

2983
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:42,840
So the head of X-Box Japan, uh, Takashi Sensui has resigned and he basically will stay with

2984
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:47,320
Microsoft, but he's going to be working at the US headquarters instead.

2985
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:55,720
And, um, you, of course, this doesn't help the fact that the X-Box one hasn't really

2986
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:57,800
been selling that well in Japan.

2987
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,240
Not much of a surprise.

2988
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:06,120
They're saying that they've only sold three or was it 38,461 units since September.

2989
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:14,760
Um, and I guess the vast majority of the units were sold the first four days, but it hasn't

2990
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:16,120
really picked up since then.

2991
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:21,880
I've never really been doing much over there anyways, as far as like promoting.

2992
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:25,480
I don't think any of the really exclusive games that they've been kind of showcasing

2993
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:26,520
for it have come out yet.

2994
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:36,280
Um, so I guess now they're saying that the X, the X-Box Japan, um, lead is now going

2995
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:45,560
to, uh, Yoshinami, uh, Takahashi, who I guess has been there for 20 or who joined the company

2996
02:31:45,560 --> 02:31:49,800
in July and has been there or previously before that at 24 years at Sony.

2997
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,000
So, hey, you know what?

2998
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:51,960
He's been at Sony.

2999
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:54,680
He knows how to sell consoles, you know, in that territory.

3000
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:59,400
Maybe, uh, maybe it'll help, but I'm not expecting miracles.

3001
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:01,480
Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room saying too bad.

3002
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,640
He's a very, very smart man.

3003
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:09,080
Um, unfortunately he could be the smartest guy in the world, but, uh, it's, uh, if the

3004
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:14,840
X-Box one isn't selling, then, uh, that's going to be an issue because I doubt it's

3005
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:16,680
just this one dude's fault.

3006
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,640
No, obviously not.

3007
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:20,520
No, it's not one person's fault that it's not selling.

3008
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:24,200
It's, I don't think there's a lot of factors that go with to that.

3009
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:30,680
And the fact that he's going to the US side of it, um, maybe can be better use elsewhere.

3010
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:31,240
I don't know.

3011
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:31,480
Yeah.

3012
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:37,000
I mean, they released the system way late there and they didn't really have anything

3013
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:39,080
Japanese exclusive out there.

3014
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:43,480
They were kind of relying more on the fact that it's kind of the reverse thing for what

3015
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:44,120
happens here.

3016
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:47,240
Like there's a lot of games we go, Ooh, we want to import that from Japan cause that

3017
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:47,960
looks awesome.

3018
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:51,560
Well, there's a few things that there's, there are some Japanese gamers that want to import

3019
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:53,160
stuff from here in the US.

3020
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:57,320
Cause we've got, you know, things like halo and call of duty and stuff, you know, but

3021
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:02,840
I don't just don't think it's a big enough crowd to, uh, carry a whole system.

3022
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:03,640
That makes sense.

3023
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:04,680
Yeah, it does make sense.

3024
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:04,920
Yeah.

3025
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:09,400
And I would bet the crowd that I just talked about with that as much smaller than the ones

3026
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,400
here that want to import from Japan.

3027
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:18,520
So anyway, um, moving on into one more story for you guys tonight, and this has a lot of

3028
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:20,760
people talking on social media and so forth.

3029
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:21,640
It's not spoilers though.

3030
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:22,440
Don't worry.

3031
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:28,280
And this has to be a Nintendo essentially commenting on an interview with GameSpot that

3032
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:33,320
Toad and Toadette don't have set sexes or genders.

3033
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:36,680
Just sit on that for a minute.

3034
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:41,560
Toad and Toadette may not actually be gendered characters the way you think they are.

3035
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:44,760
If they are mushroom people, then that would make sense, right?

3036
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:46,680
Because mushrooms reproduce by spores.

3037
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,920
Quote, this is maybe a little bit of a strange story, but we never really went out of our

3038
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:56,360
way to decide on the sex of these characters, even though they have somewhat gendered appearances.

3039
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:59,880
But I think what I can say is that Toadette and Toad are not siblings.

3040
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:03,320
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they are adventure pals.

3041
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:06,280
And that's certainly true here in Captain Toad.

3042
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:15,000
So, you know, I think, yeah, a mushroom is a plant and in a way I'm oversimplifying things,

3043
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:20,440
but a mushroom is a plant and, you know, not, not everything necessarily has to, you know,

3044
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:23,320
have, it's a plant.

3045
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:25,960
I don't know.

3046
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:31,560
I think some people think way too much about this stuff, but at the same time, I do understand

3047
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:36,120
and I've known people, you know, on the internet and from the years that I've done Rocky Horror

3048
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:39,720
Picture Show and some of the other conventions I've gone to in the past, I understand that

3049
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:45,800
some people feel like they don't fit in on the gender spectrum on one side or the other.

3050
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:50,440
So that's where you get, you know, things that they call, you know, Jamie might have

3051
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:53,960
to help me out here with some of the terms because I've heard gender queer as one of

3052
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:59,720
those self identifying or I've seen by gendered, agendered, agendered.

3053
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:01,480
That's, that's the other one I was trying to think of.

3054
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:02,760
So there's certainly those folks.

3055
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:05,160
So I think it's kind of nice.

3056
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:07,080
Representation is always nice.

3057
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:11,480
It's always nice to know you're not alone and that goes for anybody who's in any sort

3058
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:12,440
of minority, right?

3059
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:17,160
And that's why there's been calls for more diversity in video games because there's so

3060
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:19,000
many diverse people that enjoy video games.

3061
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,560
So I think if you are one of these folks, it's, it's maybe nice to hear that, you know,

3062
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:27,400
there's characters out there where gender is not really an issue.

3063
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:32,920
I think just in this case though, I think Nintendo is kind of saying, you know, if you're

3064
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,720
sitting there thinking about how does toad reproduce, maybe you should, maybe you really

3065
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:39,320
don't need to be worrying about that right now.

3066
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,560
This is mushrooms reproduced by spores.

3067
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:42,120
That's right.

3068
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:48,040
And typically when you see a mushroom cap, it's actually part of a much larger system

3069
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:49,240
of a single organism.

3070
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:51,800
Just saying, just saying, just saying.

3071
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:55,560
So, uh, pay attention in biology.

3072
02:35:55,560 --> 02:35:56,120
There you go.

3073
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:06,040
Uh, I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, SSG100Matt in chat saying, isn't Berto

3074
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:06,920
a guy?

3075
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:10,920
That was a whole, that was a whole nother thing that Nintendo kind of got into and the

3076
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:14,120
whole thing ended up being, wasn't it like a mistranslation or something like that?

3077
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:18,520
Originally, but now I think they've kind of gone with it, but hey, uh, poison's a guy.

3078
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:19,880
Yeah.

3079
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:25,080
And, uh, the poison is technically not transgendered, but is transvestite.

3080
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:29,960
And there's a, but there is a transgendered character for sure in the new dragon age,

3081
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:30,600
uh, as well.

3082
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:32,520
Cause Jennifer Hale voices him.

3083
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:35,160
And it's, um, it's a pretty cool story.

3084
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:38,840
If you, uh, read, uh, I mean, I know you're probably trying to avoid spoilers, but, uh,

3085
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:41,400
they, they get into it a little bit and explain it a little bit.

3086
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:43,800
Actually, the solace stuff has already been spoiled for me.

3087
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:48,680
So I spoiled myself on the iron bull stuff just because it's too weird.

3088
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:52,520
Raginator in chat says, guy, technically mushrooms aren't plants.

3089
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:53,640
They're fungi.

3090
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,680
Plants have chlorophyll.

3091
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:55,640
Mushrooms don't.

3092
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:56,520
You know what?

3093
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,360
I said I was oversimplifying things.

3094
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,480
So sit down, please.

3095
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:00,840
So there you go.

3096
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:02,600
Rob's a fun guy too.

3097
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:06,840
Actdeft in chat saying, I think adventure pals means other stuff.

3098
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:11,560
Um, you're thinking of like our toad and toadette friends with benefits.

3099
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:15,080
I think you're thinking a little hard on, I think you think you're way too into this.

3100
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:15,240
Yeah.

3101
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:17,720
They sit in the closet or at least their spores together.

3102
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,520
Ooh, it's shiny.

3103
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:25,880
Uh, I don't care what gender or whatever toadette is.

3104
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:30,360
I still think toadette is, um, not a character I enjoy seeing in Nintendo games.

3105
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:30,760
Just saying.

3106
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:34,840
Double dash ruined toadette forever for me.

3107
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:35,240
Just saying.

3108
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:37,880
All right, let's move on.

3109
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:41,160
We're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3110
02:37:41,160 --> 02:37:43,880
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3111
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:48,040
If you'd like to give us a call and be on the show, that would be awesome sauce.

3112
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:48,840
We'd love to have you.

3113
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:52,680
If you have more comments on anything we've talked about tonight or something, maybe we

3114
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:57,720
didn't get into again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

3115
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:58,120
Radio.

3116
02:37:58,120 --> 02:37:58,840
All one word.

3117
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:00,840
While we wait for some calls to come in.

3118
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:03,000
I'm trying to find the blue shell haiku.

3119
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,080
I'm going to check on any, uh, it was just something like, fuck you, blue shell.

3120
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:08,120
I will fucking wreck you.

3121
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:08,520
Fuck you.

3122
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:09,320
Fuck you or something like that.

3123
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:09,480
Yes.

3124
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:10,680
All right.

3125
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:12,280
It was totally perfect.

3126
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,280
Any last minute stories, Logie?

3127
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:14,520
Yeah.

3128
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:20,920
If you're into nostalgia and you happen to also like looking at code, the complete source

3129
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:24,440
code for Doom on the 3DO has been released.

3130
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:31,400
And you can actually check it out now at github.com slash old dash school.

3131
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:32,520
And it's spelled really weird.

3132
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:39,000
So O-L-D-E dash S-K-U-U-L slash Doom 3DO.

3133
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:41,800
So pretty cool.

3134
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:43,480
And you can check it out.

3135
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:47,960
I guess it's, you know, the C source code there.

3136
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:49,880
So that is kind of rad.

3137
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:54,440
I, even though I don't really understand source code, like what all goes into it, I think

3138
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:57,960
sometimes that kind of stuff can be really fun to read about and try to look into.

3139
02:38:57,960 --> 02:38:58,520
Did you?

3140
02:38:58,520 --> 02:38:58,920
Yes.

3141
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,360
A haiku about Mario Kart.

3142
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,120
Are you kidding me?

3143
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:03,560
Who the fuck threw that blue shell?

3144
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:04,440
I will fuck you up.

3145
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:05,880
There it is.

3146
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:07,560
Perfect.

3147
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:08,600
All right.

3148
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:12,200
Again, it's 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3149
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:14,920
I thought I saw a call come in, but I missed it while Loki was talking.

3150
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:16,680
So give you another chance there.

3151
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,240
No, that's fine.

3152
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:20,200
You have a right to do your thing.

3153
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,600
Do you have any other stories while we wait for the phone to light up again?

3154
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:26,760
No, but I know that there's that Call of Duty online that's in China.

3155
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:31,960
And so I'm actually going to check out, see if I can play that this weekend or next week

3156
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:32,920
because it looks pretty cool.

3157
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:37,800
It's basically like the modern Call of Duty stuff in the old Call of Duty Modern Warfare

3158
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:40,680
maps, which is basically what I want to play.

3159
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,400
New Call of Duty on those awesome maps.

3160
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:45,400
So there you go.

3161
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:46,200
I want to check that out.

3162
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:46,440
All right.

3163
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:47,880
Let's go to the phones because it's lighting up.

3164
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:48,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3165
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:49,320
Who's this?

3166
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:50,920
Pal here.

3167
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:51,400
Hey, Pal.

3168
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:51,880
How you doing?

3169
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,240
Pretty good.

3170
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:54,360
Packing, packing.

3171
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:55,640
So, but everything okay.

3172
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:56,840
What's that?

3173
02:39:56,840 --> 02:39:58,280
You packing.

3174
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,920
I need, I'm moving in a month or so.

3175
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:06,440
So I'm just packing and pack the video games last.

3176
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:07,560
Pack the video games last.

3177
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:08,920
You'll need something to entertain yourself.

3178
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:10,120
Yep.

3179
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:10,520
What's up?

3180
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:17,480
I was going to recommend a Vita game that I bought recently.

3181
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:22,840
Ah, since early in the show, we were talking about the Vita settlement and we were kind

3182
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:26,600
of talking about, eh, there's not, it doesn't seem like there's a lot, a lot on the Vita

3183
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:27,720
right now to make it worth it.

3184
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:30,360
But you, you think there's something that is worth checking out.

3185
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:31,000
Tell us about it.

3186
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:35,400
I don't think it's amazing, but I'm really enjoying it.

3187
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:40,040
It's called a Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1.

3188
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,200
I'd say three times faster.

3189
02:40:42,200 --> 02:40:43,080
I've heard of this.

3190
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:43,580
Okay.

3191
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:46,440
I'm enjoying it more than I expect.

3192
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:55,160
It's basically JRPG with a lot of anime looking, you know, graphics.

3193
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:59,880
But I kind of really enjoying it.

3194
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:03,640
It's kind of like, it's self-aware.

3195
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:05,480
So I'm not too sure that some people might like it.

3196
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:11,320
Some people might not, but it's basically four goddesses who represent each of the

3197
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:13,800
consoles in the nineties.

3198
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:19,240
So one is supposed to be PlayStation, Sega, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

3199
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:19,740
Really?

3200
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:25,640
And they're literally fighting a war that is called Console Wars.

3201
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:29,880
And they're fighting for such a long time that they don't remember what they're fighting

3202
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,200
for.

3203
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:38,200
So it's really silly and absurd, but at the same time, the fighting system is pretty interesting.

3204
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:44,440
Since in some point you can modify your own engines and even you kind of create your own

3205
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:45,480
quest if you want to.

3206
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:50,120
So it's extremely self-aware.

3207
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:52,360
If you like anime, you might like it.

3208
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:57,240
But I think it's kind of something nice to have on the go.

3209
02:41:57,240 --> 02:42:00,680
So it's not around 10 minutes you can finish a quest.

3210
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:02,360
So it's pretty fast.

3211
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:04,120
There is some text.

3212
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:06,520
It takes like two minutes between quests.

3213
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:08,680
So it's not that huge dialogue.

3214
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:10,680
You know, I've heard of this game before.

3215
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:11,800
I just didn't know a lot about it.

3216
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:16,280
I knew it was a JRPG, but that sounds really funny how it's all the different games.

3217
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:20,840
I'm assuming it's not so in your face, but it's very subtly these different consoles

3218
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:21,800
involve the Console Wars.

3219
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:22,680
That sounds kind of awesome.

3220
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:27,000
Two important things regarding the game.

3221
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:33,080
One is if people want to check it out, be extremely aware of the title.

3222
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:36,920
Be sure you get one that says dimension Obtunia.

3223
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:39,640
The one that says at the end Rebirth 1.

3224
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:45,400
Because that's the remake done for the beta and it's much better than the previous version.

3225
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:48,520
So be sure you don't buy the previous one by accident.

3226
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:56,120
Because I even see big main websites using the wrong captures for the review.

3227
02:42:56,120 --> 02:42:57,320
They have the wrong pictures.

3228
02:42:57,320 --> 02:42:59,720
They have the wrong content.

3229
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:00,840
It's pretty awkward.

3230
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:01,800
Shame, shame.

3231
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:02,600
They should know better.

3232
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:04,760
And the second thing just to finish.

3233
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:07,880
There is some dialogue.

3234
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:13,080
There's some big sexualized and there's some soft erotic moments.

3235
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:20,040
But if you're the kind of person that gets really turned on by that, be aware there's

3236
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:22,120
some dialogue.

3237
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:29,800
Even though it looks kind of magical girl type of thing, it's definitely not for kids.

3238
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,360
I see.

3239
02:43:30,360 --> 02:43:33,240
You broke up a little bit there, but I think I caught mostly what you were saying.

3240
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:38,440
Some of the dialogue is a little salty if you're not necessarily into that.

3241
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:40,440
Looking at our chat room, some comments here.

3242
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:44,120
Act F saying, I heard that Natunia is one of the games that's actually good for the

3243
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,440
Vita, but it can be hit or miss from what I've read.

3244
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:48,920
Maybe that depends on the version, Act F.

3245
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:51,720
Maybe not everybody's looking at the right version.

3246
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:55,400
Dark Tetsuya asking, didn't Kenji and Afune have a cameo in one of those games?

3247
02:43:55,400 --> 02:43:56,280
Yes, he did.

3248
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,400
Yeah, that's cool.

3249
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:04,680
I think during this week, it's on sale for 30 bucks in the store in the US and no other

3250
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:05,400
regions are.

3251
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:05,900
Is it?

3252
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:09,960
I might have to check this out because my Vita needs a little love.

3253
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:11,400
I don't even know if it's charged right now.

3254
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:13,080
All right.

3255
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:14,200
So that's it.

3256
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:14,440
All right.

3257
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:16,040
Well, thanks for the recommendation.

3258
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:19,160
It's good to know a little more about that game and something that we should be checking

3259
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:19,800
out on our Vitas.

3260
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:20,280
Thanks, pal.

3261
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:21,320
Thank you.

3262
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:22,040
Have a nice night.

3263
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:22,280
All right.

3264
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:22,600
Take care.

3265
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:23,240
Thanks for calling.

3266
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:25,080
All right.

3267
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:26,840
And just make sure you get the right one there.

3268
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:28,520
The one that has that subtitle at the end there.

3269
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,640
Very important.

3270
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:30,280
Big difference.

3271
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:30,920
Big difference.

3272
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:34,360
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3273
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:36,760
Hey, if you think there's a game that's not getting enough attention out there, like,

3274
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:40,360
pow, just kind of say, or the people are getting it straight up wrong, go ahead and

3275
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:41,960
give us a call and clear the air.

3276
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:43,720
Or any of the other news items we talked about tonight.

3277
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:48,280
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3278
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:52,520
I am trying to bring up the Twitters real quick here because I thought I saw a few tweets

3279
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:53,400
come in.

3280
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:57,880
Again, we try to get to some of your questions at Twitter.com slash OLR.

3281
02:44:57,880 --> 02:45:04,040
Sometimes I lose things in between the other stuff that gets tweeted to us and retweeted

3282
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:05,480
and so forth.

3283
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:11,960
But I do see a tweet from Soutor that says, anybody at OLR into the Harvest Moon games?

3284
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:13,880
I've only played the handheld ones, though.

3285
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:17,480
I just ordered Harvest Moon, a new beginning for the 3DS.

3286
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:19,880
In all honesty, no.

3287
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:23,800
I tried playing one of them because somebody told me it was very similar to Animal Crossing.

3288
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:25,240
I think it was on the GameCube.

3289
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:27,000
I couldn't really get into it at all.

3290
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:27,560
No.

3291
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:30,520
The milking the cows, the tending to the fields.

3292
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:32,920
It's like Farmville, pre-Farmville.

3293
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:33,640
Yeah.

3294
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:34,200
But I understand.

3295
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,280
I don't want to make it sound, oh, and it's horrible.

3296
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,120
No, I get why some people are into it.

3297
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:40,440
But it just wasn't something that really grabbed me.

3298
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:45,320
It's very impressive that it has stayed going so long as it has.

3299
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:47,720
So there you go.

3300
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:51,640
Flaco Jones responding to last week's Classic Game of the Week.

3301
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:52,600
Dark Soccer, you weren't here.

3302
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,680
Did you see what I picked for last week?

3303
02:45:54,680 --> 02:45:56,040
Uh, I did.

3304
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:56,920
And then I forgot.

3305
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:01,400
Well, Flaco says, Ghostbusters is one of my favorite Commodore 64 games.

3306
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:03,480
Of course it's Commodore 64.

3307
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:06,440
Well, to be fair, though, Ghostbusters had a port on the Sega Master System.

3308
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:09,960
So one could say I was trying to pull a Jamie last week.

3309
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:13,160
No, I had to show a little love to the Commodore 64.

3310
02:46:13,160 --> 02:46:14,600
All right, we do have another call coming in.

3311
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:15,320
So let's get to it.

3312
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:16,440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3313
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,320
Who's this?

3314
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:17,960
Hey, what's up, guys?

3315
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:18,680
This is Kaijuto.

3316
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:19,240
Hey, Kaijuto.

3317
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:20,440
What's on your mind, buddy?

3318
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:23,960
And I just want to comment real quick on the story you mentioned earlier about GameStop

3319
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:26,840
complaining about the digital versus the physical.

3320
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:29,000
Yes, I think there's a lot of strong opinions on this.

3321
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:29,500
What's up?

3322
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:34,940
I don't necessarily think that there's actually a problem with the digital versus the physical.

3323
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:37,100
I think people are still buying physical.

3324
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:38,140
I'm one of them.

3325
02:46:38,140 --> 02:46:43,260
But a lot of times, people are buying off of Amazon and other places.

3326
02:46:43,260 --> 02:46:46,140
I don't think it necessarily has to deal with the price.

3327
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,740
It's just the availability.

3328
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:49,180
I love GameStop.

3329
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:52,780
But one of the things I noticed with them, I'm a person that loves to buy my games new.

3330
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:55,980
I don't subscribe to their user, you know, their used game stuff.

3331
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:58,940
And they don't ever restock stuff.

3332
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:05,820
They'll get not any of the big games, not like Grand Theft Auto or any of the NBA games

3333
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:06,540
or anything like that.

3334
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,580
I mean, they always restock those.

3335
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:10,780
But any of the smaller games, they never restock them.

3336
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:14,620
They get them that first week, sell them all out, and then they don't restock them.

3337
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:21,100
Like if they really want to make sales, I think they need to look more into new games

3338
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:22,220
and restock.

3339
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:24,060
And maybe people wouldn't be going to Amazon.

3340
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:28,220
Because half the time, the main reason I like going to Amazon is because usually they don't

3341
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:29,500
have the game that I'm looking for.

3342
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:33,100
So I have to go on Amazon to find that game physically and buy it.

3343
02:47:33,100 --> 02:47:36,780
Yeah, you know, Kaishudo, I think you just hit the nail on the head, a big part of the

3344
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,180
reason why I personally stopped going to GameStop.

3345
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:42,380
Like I haven't gone into one in a while.

3346
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:47,260
And a big part of the reason is that I remember going into a GameStop, and I remember what

3347
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:48,300
the game was.

3348
02:47:48,300 --> 02:47:50,060
But it was something that just came out on release day.

3349
02:47:50,060 --> 02:47:53,820
And I went to the GameStop, and I asked for the game that had just come out that day.

3350
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:55,340
And they were like, well, did you pre-order it?

3351
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:56,780
And I'm like, no.

3352
02:47:56,860 --> 02:47:59,420
And the guy kind of like shamed me a little bit.

3353
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:03,660
Like, you know, like, well, you know, it's a popular game, so you should always pre-order

3354
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:06,140
games, and we don't have any for people that didn't pre-order it.

3355
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:07,420
And I was like, all right.

3356
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:14,220
So I walked to the Target in the exact same shopping center, and they had a bountiful

3357
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:15,820
amount of copies of the game.

3358
02:48:15,820 --> 02:48:17,420
And that's when I said, you know what?

3359
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:18,780
Fuck it.

3360
02:48:18,780 --> 02:48:23,820
I don't need to go into a store and fucking get a lecture about not buying into this whole

3361
02:48:23,820 --> 02:48:27,740
pre-order bullshit that I know is just a profiteering scheme for you guys.

3362
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:33,900
That was the same with a PSP, I think, where they said, you know, good.

3363
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:35,180
Like, it was at the launch of the PSP.

3364
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:35,900
They're all good luck.

3365
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:36,700
Find it anywhere.

3366
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:37,660
It's sold out everywhere.

3367
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:38,380
Went to Best Buy.

3368
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:40,460
They had like a whole bunch of them just sitting there.

3369
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:42,940
I'm like, oh, OK, I'll just get it here.

3370
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:46,140
And this is all over because I experienced the same thing.

3371
02:48:46,780 --> 02:48:52,140
A lot of games that I go looking for, like I remember just recently I went to get a Pokemon

3372
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:52,700
Black 2.

3373
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:55,340
Black 2 and White 2.

3374
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:57,180
And GameStop didn't have it.

3375
02:48:57,900 --> 02:48:59,820
The guy told me, you know, it's a really old game.

3376
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:02,860
He hasn't seen it in a while.

3377
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:05,420
I went right over to Target, got both of them.

3378
02:49:05,420 --> 02:49:08,380
It's just like, you know, you start to do shit, man.

3379
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:09,740
That's all you got to do.

3380
02:49:09,740 --> 02:49:11,740
What did that just instill in me for the future?

3381
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:15,660
I can either go to GameStop and get a lecture, or I can go to Target and get my game and

3382
02:49:15,660 --> 02:49:16,780
no questions asked.

3383
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:21,100
Because it's one of those cases where I actually kind of prefer that the people selling me

3384
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:23,260
the game at Target aren't game enthusiasts.

3385
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:24,400
Yeah.

3386
02:49:24,940 --> 02:49:28,140
Yeah, I got into a big debate one time about all that.

3387
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:33,420
A lot of people were saying that when it comes to GameStop, that they prefer, you know,

3388
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:35,900
people should know about gaming and blah, blah, blah.

3389
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:38,780
I'm like, for me, all they need to know is the price.

3390
02:49:38,780 --> 02:49:41,980
All they need to tell me is the price and that they have it in stock.

3391
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:43,900
I can do all my research online.

3392
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:46,140
You know, I don't need a video game expert to work in the store.

3393
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:47,900
I know people got to make money.

3394
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:50,220
Not everybody has time to learn about video games.

3395
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:51,580
They just got to make that quick dollar.

3396
02:49:51,580 --> 02:49:53,020
So that's all they need to know.

3397
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:54,460
They just need to know what's in their store.

3398
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:57,500
And I don't necessarily, and to make it clear, because I know we have a lot of people who

3399
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:59,340
listen to the show who do work at GameStop.

3400
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:03,580
And I just want to remind you guys, like my problem isn't necessarily with the frontline

3401
02:50:03,580 --> 02:50:07,500
workers, although there's always going to be a few bad apples in every barrel and there's

3402
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:08,860
a few at every company.

3403
02:50:08,860 --> 02:50:13,580
But I think a lot of times that attitude that I got, because you just said you got that

3404
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:16,620
same attitude, you live in a completely different part of the country than I do.

3405
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:19,500
That clearly then comes from the top down.

3406
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:22,780
That's an attitude that's passed on in the corporate environment.

3407
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:25,580
And that's not something I necessarily fault the people on the front lines.

3408
02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:30,300
The reality is, though, again, that's not going to convince me to come back into the

3409
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:33,980
store when I can get the game without a lecture somewhere else.

3410
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:34,220
Yeah.

3411
02:50:34,220 --> 02:50:37,020
But to that guy's defense, like he wasn't lecturing me.

3412
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:39,660
He actually sounded upset by it.

3413
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:42,140
He was just saying that, you know, it's an old game, hasn't been around.

3414
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:45,100
But it wasn't like, you know, see, you should have got it early.

3415
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:45,900
It wasn't like that.

3416
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:47,740
I never got any of that type of treatment.

3417
02:50:47,740 --> 02:50:48,780
But I know what you're talking about.

3418
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:49,900
Wish I could say the same.

3419
02:50:49,900 --> 02:50:50,060
Yeah.

3420
02:50:50,060 --> 02:50:50,940
Still love GameStop.

3421
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:51,820
Still support them.

3422
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:57,660
I think that they're a major reason why games were selling like hotcakes back in the mid

3423
02:50:57,660 --> 02:50:58,460
2000s.

3424
02:50:58,460 --> 02:51:01,660
You know, so I credit them for a lot of where gaming is now.

3425
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:03,660
I don't agree with that guy you're talking about.

3426
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:05,420
The guy who said we're in the golden age.

3427
02:51:05,420 --> 02:51:06,460
We're not in the golden age.

3428
02:51:07,420 --> 02:51:08,380
Definitely not in the golden age.

3429
02:51:08,380 --> 02:51:09,820
I don't know what he's talking about.

3430
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:11,260
But why not?

3431
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:12,060
Quickly, why not?

3432
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:17,260
Just for the simple fact, it's like, you know, we have the same games being reproduced.

3433
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:18,540
Not a lot of like new games.

3434
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:19,740
A lot of things are sequels.

3435
02:51:20,540 --> 02:51:25,900
Really what I think is the place that's experienced in the golden age is probably the indie game

3436
02:51:25,900 --> 02:51:26,140
scene.

3437
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:31,180
Like I see the whole indie game scene the same way that I see.

3438
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:35,820
Remember back in like in the mid 90s when Hollywood went indie and all those indie movies

3439
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:37,900
were picking up Oscars and all that type of stuff.

3440
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:39,180
We're in that type of situation.

3441
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:42,860
I don't see AAA doing really well or any of that type of stuff.

3442
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:45,020
I think all that stuff is going downhill.

3443
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:47,020
But as far as the indie scene, yeah, we're getting a lot of stuff.

3444
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:50,460
And of course that also feeds into the digital thing.

3445
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:54,380
Because a lot of these indie games, they don't make CDs or anything.

3446
02:51:54,380 --> 02:51:58,780
So that's another reason why people may not be going into that GameStop.

3447
02:51:58,780 --> 02:52:01,900
Because they have to buy these games digitally online.

3448
02:52:01,900 --> 02:52:03,660
Because that's the only way they can get it.

3449
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:06,780
That's a very interesting comparison with the film industry.

3450
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:08,860
Because I know we've kind of addressed this before.

3451
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:14,220
But movies had to go through similar growing pains when it became easier for anybody to

3452
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:15,020
shoot their own movie.

3453
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:17,740
When camcorders became more and more popular.

3454
02:52:17,740 --> 02:52:22,060
And that was probably about the time was the mid 90s when anybody could shoot something

3455
02:52:22,060 --> 02:52:23,020
on VHS.

3456
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:24,380
And we got what?

3457
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:25,820
The Blair Witch Project out of that.

3458
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:29,500
Which, you know, whether you loved or hated that movie, it was one of the biggest independent

3459
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:30,620
smashes of all time.

3460
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:35,660
And that was, you know, literally people running around in the forest at night on their camcorders.

3461
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:37,500
So yeah, very good point.

3462
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:38,140
All right.

3463
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:39,260
Take care, my friend.

3464
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:39,660
All right.

3465
02:52:39,660 --> 02:52:39,900
All right.

3466
02:52:39,900 --> 02:52:40,300
Bye bye.

3467
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:41,420
Bye bye.

3468
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:11,020
But that's all right.

3469
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:11,420
I understand.

3470
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:12,700
I didn't touch it since.

3471
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:16,780
No, I looked at the logs over the last few months and there's been no one on it.

3472
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:18,860
So as far as I can tell.

3473
02:53:19,820 --> 02:53:21,900
So we'll just have to move to PlayStation 4 or something.

3474
02:53:21,900 --> 02:53:23,100
Anyway, we do have another call coming in.

3475
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:24,060
So let's get to it.

3476
02:53:24,060 --> 02:53:25,020
Hi on Orange Launch Radio.

3477
02:53:25,020 --> 02:53:25,900
Who's this?

3478
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:26,620
Hey, it's Dave.

3479
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:27,340
What's going on?

3480
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:28,380
Hey, what's up, Dave?

3481
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:29,100
How you doing?

3482
02:53:29,100 --> 02:53:29,820
Not much.

3483
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:32,140
Just called in to ask you guys a question.

3484
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:33,900
See if anybody else felt this way.

3485
02:53:33,900 --> 02:53:37,020
I guess it's just more negativity from me after that last call.

3486
02:53:37,900 --> 02:53:43,100
But is it just me or does it feel like over the last, I don't know, like half decade or

3487
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:50,140
something Black Friday sales have just gotten crappier and crappier and crappier?

3488
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:57,340
Black Friday itself just seems to have transformed in the past five years.

3489
02:53:57,340 --> 02:54:00,220
And I think that's kind of leading into it a little bit.

3490
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:03,980
Like what you're saying where like the sales are getting crappier and crappier because

3491
02:54:03,980 --> 02:54:08,700
I think there's more of that expectation there that, you know, you have to have these

3492
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:11,420
huge doorbuster sales and so forth.

3493
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:15,020
And the stores have to be open on quote unquote,

3494
02:54:15,020 --> 02:54:17,820
Gray Thursday, which the rest of us call Thanksgiving.

3495
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:21,500
Like that wasn't a thing when I was a kid.

3496
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:24,620
I don't even remember Black Friday being a big deal when I was a kid.

3497
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:28,460
I remember you don't go to the mall that weekend because it's the biggest shopping

3498
02:54:28,460 --> 02:54:29,260
weekend of the year.

3499
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:30,060
But it wasn't like...

3500
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:31,580
They never really called it Black Friday.

3501
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:32,300
It was just like...

3502
02:54:32,300 --> 02:54:36,460
It was called that by the employees because, oh my God, consumerism.

3503
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:40,860
Or, you know, if you want to get technical, it's the day where the stores would finally

3504
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:43,500
be in the black for the year after running in the red for the whole year.

3505
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:45,340
That's really where the name comes from.

3506
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:49,660
But now it's Black Friday because somebody's going to get a black eye fighting for a toaster.

3507
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:55,820
I mean, you know, maybe it's just that I'm getting older and, you know, I care less about

3508
02:54:55,820 --> 02:54:56,060
stuff.

3509
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:57,740
I just don't get excited about things.

3510
02:54:57,740 --> 02:55:01,820
But I remember, you know, when I was in high school and like CompUSA stores were still

3511
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:02,220
around.

3512
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:04,300
Oh, I wish those were still around.

3513
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:08,940
But they had sales and I'd always be like, oh, there's like, you know, two or three things

3514
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:10,220
that I really, really want.

3515
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:11,180
That's really cool.

3516
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:17,020
Now I'm old and cranky and I see sales and I go, I want just one thing.

3517
02:55:17,020 --> 02:55:19,900
And that I don't even see one thing like not even on Steam.

3518
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:25,100
And maybe that's part of the iterativeness that the last caller was talking about.

3519
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:28,940
It's just the same game with a different name on it every year.

3520
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:29,420
Right.

3521
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:34,940
I want, you know, I want like a Baldur's Gate again where I'm like, I pay 50 bucks and I

3522
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:37,100
feel like I really got my money's worth out of this.

3523
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:44,300
Well, that's a whole nother problem that really has nothing to do with Black Friday.

3524
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:46,220
And that has more to do with DLC.

3525
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:47,580
But that would be a whole nother episode.

3526
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:49,340
You can probably see where I'm going with that.

3527
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:51,260
That would be a whole nother episode of OLR.

3528
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:54,780
But I think with the Black Friday stuff is concerned.

3529
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:55,900
Yeah.

3530
02:55:55,900 --> 02:55:58,380
I mean, I had my eyes set on one thing as well.

3531
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:00,140
The Warlords Draenor expansion.

3532
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:01,740
I wanted to get that cheaper somewhere.

3533
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:02,700
Wasn't going to happen.

3534
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:03,900
Nobody put it on sale.

3535
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:05,740
So yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.

3536
02:56:05,740 --> 02:56:11,100
But at the same time, you know, we live in a culture now where it seems like we've got

3537
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:16,220
sites that really make it their business to have things on sale all year long.

3538
02:56:16,220 --> 02:56:18,220
And that would be like Walmart.

3539
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:21,500
That would be Amazon would be an excellent example of this as well.

3540
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:24,380
Like buying into the wholesale culture.

3541
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:28,300
I mean, Steam kind of does this too with games in a way.

3542
02:56:28,540 --> 02:56:34,300
But you have to kind of ask yourself, does the quality necessarily match something that

3543
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:35,260
I'm getting on sale?

3544
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:38,940
An example of that would be televisions on Black Friday.

3545
02:56:38,940 --> 02:56:41,580
You know, I'm sure Walmart was selling some TV for what?

3546
02:56:41,580 --> 02:56:45,900
Like probably like a full 100 inch TV for like 30 bucks, right?

3547
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:47,180
I don't know what kind of things they sell.

3548
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:48,540
They sell crazy shit on Black Friday.

3549
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:54,060
But the problem is the TV probably is missing something that you're probably used to seeing

3550
02:56:54,060 --> 02:56:54,780
on a TV.

3551
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:56,460
Like it probably doesn't have component cables.

3552
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:00,780
It's probably like HDMI only or some of these HD TVs.

3553
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:03,820
I don't think they do this so much anymore, but a couple of years ago you could get the

3554
02:57:03,820 --> 02:57:07,180
cheap HD TVs, but they only did 720p.

3555
02:57:07,180 --> 02:57:08,140
They didn't do 1080p.

3556
02:57:08,140 --> 02:57:17,420
They had some like a really cheap cheapo laptops, tablets that they were selling for like sub

3557
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:17,820
$100.

3558
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:25,740
Oh, I walked into Best Buy and yeah, I remember seeing a tablet and the tablet was unbranded.

3559
02:57:26,780 --> 02:57:29,980
I didn't know that you could sell a tablet that didn't have a brand.

3560
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:32,940
It just had a Microsoft logo and it was a seven inch tablet.

3561
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:40,140
Yeah, I think really at the end of the day, I'm just grumpy that I'm not seeing anything

3562
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:42,380
on Steam that I'm really excited to buy.

3563
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:48,460
To be fair though, we all know there's going to be another sale coming at the end of the

3564
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:49,100
year.

3565
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:54,460
So if everybody didn't blow their load on Thanksgiving so that they could get a few

3566
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:59,260
more sales before the big holiday, and then you're going to have that big after holiday

3567
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:02,540
sale, I can sort of see why we're in that position.

3568
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:06,060
I think Steam is uniquely positioned in a different way.

3569
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:10,060
Well, if you can get Dragon Age Inquisition to go on sale for that one, then I'll be happy.

3570
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:17,900
Sadly with a game like that, oh, well, since you bring that up, it's not going to go on

3571
02:58:17,900 --> 02:58:20,540
sale on Steam any early.

3572
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:23,420
It'll be on sale on Origin before any of those other sites.

3573
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:27,580
You're right, I don't think I've given Origin any money yet.

3574
02:58:28,460 --> 02:58:29,980
I'm really trying to hold out.

3575
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:34,540
I know, but then I think an excellent example of this, Dave, would be Titanfall.

3576
02:58:34,540 --> 02:58:39,660
I finally bought Titanfall on the PC because it went on sale for like half as much.

3577
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:40,300
Where?

3578
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:41,180
On Origin.

3579
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:43,740
Yeah, it's like $10 right now or something.

3580
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:44,860
Now it is, yeah.

3581
02:58:44,860 --> 02:58:47,660
Because it's not as good of a game as they hyped it up to be, unfortunately.

3582
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:50,140
My brother's upset because he paid full price for that.

3583
02:58:50,140 --> 02:58:51,100
I know, I know.

3584
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:52,860
But that's what happens.

3585
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:55,340
I'm sure Mass Effect is dirt cheap on Origin right now, too.

3586
02:58:55,900 --> 02:58:59,260
Which means you can go buy every single version in existence, too.

3587
02:58:59,260 --> 02:58:59,820
Yeah, that's right.

3588
02:58:59,820 --> 02:59:02,380
You can probably get the whole damn trilogy for $20, I'm sure.

3589
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:07,340
Alright, well, Dave, my friend, thank you for your call, even if it was a little grumpy

3590
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:09,020
cat, but you know, I understand.

3591
02:59:09,020 --> 02:59:11,820
Sometimes not all the news is sunshine and rainbows.

3592
02:59:11,820 --> 02:59:13,260
Yep, you guys have a nice night.

3593
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:14,060
Alright, you too, my friend.

3594
02:59:14,060 --> 02:59:14,380
Take care.

3595
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:15,260
Alright, bye-bye.

3596
02:59:15,260 --> 02:59:16,060
Bye-bye.

3597
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:19,660
And here's the thing that'll inevitably happen to Dave, too, is whatever that game is that

3598
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:20,700
he wants, he has his eye on.

3599
02:59:20,700 --> 02:59:22,380
Let's say Dragon Age Inquisition.

3600
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,660
You know what's going to happen.

3601
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:26,300
He's going to buy it, and then what's going to happen the very next day?

3602
02:59:26,940 --> 02:59:28,140
It'll go on sale.

3603
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:29,820
So I have a last minute story, if you want.

3604
02:59:29,820 --> 02:59:31,500
Sure, real quick, let's do one more story here.

3605
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,940
I am going to shut down the Skypline, though.

3606
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:35,020
Thanks to those of you guys who called and got through.

3607
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:37,820
To those of you that didn't get through, I'm sorry.

3608
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:38,780
Thank you for trying.

3609
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:40,220

3613
02:59:45,820 --> 02:59:48,700
I know I don't always read those every- I read them.

3614
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:52,060
I don't necessarily always read them on air, but I always appreciate those of you that

3615

leave a comment on the episode.

3616
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:53,920
Loki.

3617
02:59:54,300 --> 03:00:00,780
Valve has changed the rules for Steam gifts for trading stuff like that.

3618
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:07,420
So for example, all new games purchased as a gift and placed in the purchaser's inventory

3619
03:00:07,420 --> 03:00:09,660
will be untradeable for 30 days.

3620
03:00:10,860 --> 03:00:15,580
We've made this change to make trading gifts a better experience for those receiving the

3621
03:00:15,580 --> 03:00:15,980
gifts.

3622
03:00:15,980 --> 03:00:21,020
We hope- we're hoping this lowers the number of people who trade for a game only to have

3623
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:25,260
the game revoked later due to issues with purchaser's payment method.

3624
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:35,260
Oh, so there's people out there that buy the game, sell the code on eBay or whatever,

3625
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:39,340
put it in the other person's Steam account, and then flip the charges on the company or

3626
03:00:39,340 --> 03:00:39,660
so.

3627
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:41,340
I see what the- I see what the exploit is.

3628
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:43,420
I would have even thought of that.

3629
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:44,220
That's shady.

3630
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:45,900
That is very shady.

3631
03:00:45,900 --> 03:00:48,620
But that's also annoying though, if you're buying somebody a gift.

3632
03:00:48,620 --> 03:00:49,260
Yeah.

3633
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:52,300
Well, no, you just don't put it in your own inventory first.

3634
03:00:52,300 --> 03:00:53,420
Oh, you just send it straight to them?

3635
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:55,420
That's the- yeah, you can send it straight to them.

3636
03:00:55,420 --> 03:00:56,460
Well, okay.

3637
03:00:56,460 --> 03:01:00,300
Yeah, but you can buy something as a gift and drop it in your own inventory first if

3638
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:03,260
you don't necessarily know who you're going to give it to, or you're going to save it

3639
03:01:03,260 --> 03:01:04,380
for trade fodder.

3640
03:01:04,380 --> 03:01:07,900
Like, you could trade a $2 game for a bunch of trading cards or something.

3641
03:01:07,900 --> 03:01:09,900
Like, that's the whole idea behind it.

3642
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:14,060
But yeah, if I want to buy you a gift, Loki, if I want to buy you a game, like let's say

3643
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:18,620
you love Civ V so much, I'm going to get you Civ Beyond Earth for Christmas.

3644
03:01:18,620 --> 03:01:20,060
I could just drop that right in your inventory.

3645
03:01:20,060 --> 03:01:20,780
I'm not going to have a problem.

3646
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:22,540
I'm not going to have to sit on that for 30 days.

3647
03:01:22,540 --> 03:01:28,380
That would be silly of Valve to do because the whole reason they built that wishlist

3648
03:01:28,380 --> 03:01:30,780
thing in is so that they can tell you.

3649
03:01:30,780 --> 03:01:35,580
Like, if I'm looking at a certain store page, hey, Loki has this game on his wishlist.

3650
03:01:35,580 --> 03:01:36,860
It's on sale.

3651
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:38,620
You haven't gotten him a gift yet.

3652
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:39,820
Buy, buy, buy.

3653
03:01:39,820 --> 03:01:41,580
They want me to be able to drop that in your inventory.

3654
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:42,140
That makes sense.

3655
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:43,420
They just want to buy a password.

3656
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:44,860
They buy it for me first.

3657
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:49,180
So act deft, confirming you can still gift it, just not trade it.

3658
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:51,820
They're saying that that's supposed to deter resellers.

3659
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:56,220
So people that, you know, are selling games, they, they probably need to do that.

3660
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:58,700
There's a lot of shady stuff that happens with the steam reselling.

3661
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:01,340
So I see why they're, they probably haven't been resort to that.

3662
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:01,980
It makes sense.

3663
03:02:01,980 --> 03:02:02,540
All right.

3664
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:04,780
Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3665
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:07,260
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.

3666
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:09,580
Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.

3667
03:02:09,580 --> 03:02:12,700
And if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or three

3668
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:13,500
about the show.

3669
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:14,860
Help spread the word.

3670
03:02:14,860 --> 03:02:19,020
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you got to give us more of those voices

3671
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:20,380
so we can get the news out there.

3672
03:02:20,380 --> 03:02:21,340
Don't forget guys.

3673
03:02:21,340 --> 03:02:26,220
Next week's show, December 7th, noon is when it will actually be live.

3674
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:30,780
So this is the chance for those of you guys overseas or in a different time zone to participate

3675
03:02:30,780 --> 03:02:31,500
with the show.

3676
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:36,380
Of course, if you're, if you're the other way on the globe, like I know Akuma JP is

3677
03:02:36,380 --> 03:02:38,140
like, that's like 3 a.m. for me.

3678
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:39,740
I'm not going to be able to, sorry, sorry.

3679
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:45,340
Maybe, maybe another week we'll do, we'll do a show at 3 a.m. for those of you guys

3680
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:46,380
on that side of the globe.

3681
03:02:47,100 --> 03:02:49,500
Maybe, well, maybe, maybe we'll see.

3682
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:49,820
All right.

3683
03:02:49,820 --> 03:02:51,500
Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.

3684
03:02:51,500 --> 03:02:53,740
We'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

3685
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:55,100
So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.

3686
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:55,900
Your final thought tonight.

3687
03:02:55,900 --> 03:02:58,780
So apparently there was this thing going on in Microsoft store.

3688
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:03,260
If you purchase Connect Sports Rivals for the Xbox One, you can purchase another game

3689
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:03,820
for free.

3690
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:08,060
Oh, so for example, Connect Sports Rivals was $24.99.

3691
03:03:08,220 --> 03:03:11,820
And you could add Grand Theft Auto 5 for free on the Xbox One.

3692
03:03:12,380 --> 03:03:14,620
Uh, it wasn't supposed to work that way.

3693
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:15,100
Oops.

3694
03:03:15,100 --> 03:03:19,100
Uh, so now that's, that's closed, but yeah.

3695
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:21,980
So, um, that's silly.

3696
03:03:21,980 --> 03:03:25,100
But, um, yeah, so hopefully I'm working more on my game this week.

3697
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:30,940
I started rewriting the engine again and, uh, hopefully this will be the last time.

3698
03:03:32,300 --> 03:03:35,900
And yeah, I'm going to look at maybe shutting down the Minecraft server, even though it's

3699
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:39,660
only like five bucks a month, it's just, nobody's playing it.

3700
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:42,380
That's just, that's five bucks a month that you're spending on a Team Fortress 2

3701
03:03:42,380 --> 03:03:43,340
server or something else.

3702
03:03:44,380 --> 03:03:48,300
It's even, I'm not playing it and I have no desire to go back and play it cause it's

3703
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:50,220
just like, I don't know.

3704
03:03:50,220 --> 03:03:53,500
I can't dedicate a lot of time to one game.

3705
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:55,820
Jamie, Jamie, do you have a suggestion for the money?

3706
03:03:55,820 --> 03:03:57,900
I could just give you five bucks every month.

3707
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:03,340
Well, I've kept it running for like, you know, years, a couple of years, a couple of

3708
03:04:03,340 --> 03:04:05,420
years, and it's just not my Normandy out of it.

3709
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:07,900
It's just not, I mean, I could, I'm going to back up everything.

3710
03:04:07,900 --> 03:04:11,500
You copy the server and then that way people can have their own local copies of it.

3711
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:13,820
Maybe I can, I can download the server and stuff.

3712
03:04:13,820 --> 03:04:14,460
That's fine.

3713
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:18,780
You know, that's what I'm, of course I'm going to do that, but like, I think it's

3714
03:04:18,780 --> 03:04:23,980
more advantageous to like, if we were going to do something like that, to go to a public

3715
03:04:23,980 --> 03:04:26,940
server or something where we could all go to the same one.

3716
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:31,340
So if we're not playing, there's actual people on the server to play with instead

3717
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:33,420
of just it being dead.

3718
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:33,980
You know what I mean?

3719
03:04:33,980 --> 03:04:35,100
That, that was always the problem.

3720
03:04:35,740 --> 03:04:40,540
Yeah, I'd play on it, but I'd be the only one on for an hour and I may see somebody

3721
03:04:40,540 --> 03:04:43,740
once in a while, but it's not like it's always packed with people.

3722
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:45,740
All right.

3723
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:46,860
That was a long final thought.

3724
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:48,140
That's all right.

3725
03:04:48,780 --> 03:04:52,780
My final thought for the night is I've had a really good restful period of being able

3726
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:54,620
to sit on my big butt and play video games.

3727
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:58,540
And I'm, I'm sad that it's coming to an end, but I am thankful that, you know, I

3728
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:01,820
have a job to go to tomorrow and, and all that good stuff.

3729
03:05:01,820 --> 03:05:07,100
So, um, I just want to say thanks for tuning into the show on a holiday weekend

3730
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:09,820
and, uh, hope your holidays went well.

3731
03:05:09,820 --> 03:05:11,980
And, uh, hope your winter holidays will be going well.

3732
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:15,340
I know a lot of the celebrations begin for that in the coming week.

3733
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:19,180
So, um, I hope whatever you're doing for the holidays is great.

3734
03:05:19,180 --> 03:05:20,860
And thanks you guys so much for your support of the show.

3735
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:22,860
Uh, dark soccer, your final thought.

3736
03:05:23,740 --> 03:05:25,500
Um, don't be a dick.

3737
03:05:26,060 --> 03:05:26,540
That's right.

3738
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:27,260
Don't be a dick.

3739
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:28,140
All right.

3740
03:05:28,140 --> 03:05:30,380
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

3741
03:05:30,380 --> 03:05:34,220
We will be back in seven days at a different time to do it all over

3742
03:05:34,220 --> 03:05:36,780
again and talk about whatever should come up in the news next week.

3743
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:37,820
PlayStation experience.

3744
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:41,500
I imagine is going to be coming up the game awards and whatever is unveiled there.

3745
03:05:41,500 --> 03:05:45,180
So, uh, even though it's a slow retail, well, it's a fast retail period, a slow

3746
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:48,380
retail release period, uh, there's still going to be a lot of stuff coming out in

3747
03:05:48,380 --> 03:05:51,100
this past week, so we will see you in seven days to do it all again.

3748
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:52,380
Thanks you guys so much for tuning in.

3749
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:53,180
Have a wonderful week.

3750
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:53,420
Bye.

3751
03:05:54,140 --> 03:05:56,780
