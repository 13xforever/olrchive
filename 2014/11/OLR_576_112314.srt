00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,480
This week, excitement in online gaming as Blizzard struggles to maintain World of Warcraft's

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,720
uptime after Draenor's release and another Sony Network cracking scare.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,440
Even if they're down, we'll tell you about some interesting alternatives along with your

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,440
comments, calls, and emails right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,560
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:45,760
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 576, November the 23rd of 2014,

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,840
joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,080
gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,760
Here in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
She is out tonight.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,840
I believe it is her husband's birthday tomorrow, today, tomorrow today?

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,960
Somewhere around there, but the celebration is today, so she's out to go celebrate with

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,400
her man, so I hope she's having a good time, and happy birthday, Dan, whenever it happens

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
to be.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
But here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Hello.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Hi, Loki, how are you doing?

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm doing okay.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Except for my dinner sucked.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,120
Yeah, I heard about that.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,600
You know, for those that are playing the home game, the ever popular listening to OLR, betting

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
pool.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
What did Loki eat for dinner tonight game?

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
You went to Jack in the Box.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I went to Jack in the Box.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Which these coasters wouldn't think of right away.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Yeah, so I went to Jack in the Box, and they got a turkey bacon cheddar sandwich.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
It is the season.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Which is fine, I mean, you know, because sandwiches have a, I normally get the bacon ultimate

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,520
cheeseburger, and I'm just, you know, after a while it gets, you know.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
It's the same thing.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
You have to shake it up a little bit.

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Variety.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
And their sandwich is nasty.

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,680
I don't know, they put some sort of sauce on it, it's just gross, so.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Was it like cranberry?

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Because it's turkey?

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
It's not cranberry.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,440
No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, it just tasted sour.

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,320
And seeing with the fries, the fries are good until that last fry, the very last fry I had

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
was just off.

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
It was just like something, and it's like this sour taste, I had like literally spit

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
it out of my mouth.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
And now that is the fry that is representative of the whole.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,760
The fry that's like stuck permeating in my mouth, like thanks, you know.

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Every time you think about your horrible Jack in the Box night, you're going to remember

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
that fry.

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,840
Well, it was just like, you know, I had, left late because I was putting away laundry, and

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,240
they had the bleach to sink, and just annoying stuff, and so I got late, you know, I didn't

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,560
get to order a pizza or anything like that, and I was like, you know, driving, I'm like,

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,200
well I can stop here, well I might not be on time if I stop here, so.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm like, well it's either going to be McDonald's or Jack in the Box, I, McDonald's is kind

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,440
of meh at this time of day, so I'll do Jack in the Box, and yeah, I was just kind of like,

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,000
I guess I'll have that, and then it was just terrible.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
I do want to talk about games of course, because this is a video game podcast, but quickly

58
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,700
I thought I'd ask you since you're on the topic of food, it is the week of the Thanksgiving

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,920
holiday here in the States.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,800
Happy Thanksgiving to you out there, for those of you that are celebrating it this week.

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,360
If you aren't celebrating Thanksgiving this week, well enjoy in your country from the

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
comfort of your living room, watching the crazies in this country on Black Friday.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Enjoy watching everybody on television at the local Walmart fighting over a $5 crock

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,300
pot, you know, pulling out weaves, threatening people, somebody will get shot, some shopping

65
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,520
mall somewhere.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Have fun from the comfort of your home wherever you may be.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
No, no, no, no.

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
No one will get shot, someone will get trampled to death, that's the new shot.

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,600
You know what, I'm going to stay home and play video games, that was the way Black Friday

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
was meant to be.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:54,520
You'll stay home and you go on certain online, you know, purchasing websites to...

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,480
You make it sound shady, like am I going on XTube, where am I going?

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,440
You don't purchase anything on XTube, seriously, all the content there is lone.

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
That's Cyber Monday, Loki, get with your buzzword lingo.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,360
But it's all the pre-Black Friday stuff.

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,520
Now it's pre-Black, oh that's right, what do they call it, Gray Thursday?

77
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
No, it's Thanksgiving.

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
It's Thanksgiving.

79
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
It's not Gray Thursday.

80
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
It's Thanksgiving.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,200
It might happen to be gray outside, because we're having that kind of weather, but it's

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Thanksgiving.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Gray Thursday.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,640
I heard that term on the news the other day, and I'm like, it's fucking Thanksgiving.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,360
They're dumb, they're just trying to be buzz-worthy.

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,400
I know, I know, and then they have a graphic to go with it.

87
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Gray Thursday.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,740
Alright, anyhow, hey, look, when we're feeling sad and gray, we always have this gal here

89
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,080
to cheer us up.

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,960
Joining us in studio tonight, welcome back to the show for the Multitap podcast.

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,760
Hey, hold on, hold on, I gotta, sorry, I gotta, I-

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Way to wreck the intro, this better be good.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
Ron must suggest he and I go to Subway.

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,200
No, now see, now I've been to Subway, and I even thought about that, but Subway also

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,720
tends to be pretty crappy this time of night.

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Did you, did you literally interrupt the guest's introduction to talk about a fucking sandwich?

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Did you?

98
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,840
To be fair, Subway's horrible, I agree.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
It's true.

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Welcome to the show, Princess Irene.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Huddle.

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
How are you?

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Would you like a sandwich?

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Fuck no.

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,520
I already had one earlier.

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
How are you doing, Princess Irene?

108
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I'm okay, I'm good.

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Yeah?

110
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
How are you?

111
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Good, thanks for jumping in to fill in tonight.

112
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Sure.

113
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
How are things for you?

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
How's life been treating you lately?

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
It's exactly the same.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Exactly the same.

117
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Yeah.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
I would ask you, well, what, you know, usually I go, oh, well, what's new on the Multitap

119
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
podcast?

120
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,240
But like, you were just here like six weeks ago, so I mean, did you do anything in the

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,600
past six weeks that we all know about?

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
I think we released like a couple of episodes.

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Go check them out.

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Whoa.

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Hey.

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Where can folks hear the Multitap podcast?

128
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,960
Just briefly, for those new listeners who might have gotten the past couple of weeks,

129
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,720
where is the Multitap podcast and what can folks expect to hear on it?

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Sure.

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,360
You can find it on FFOP.net.

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,880
That stands for Fistful of Potions, and that's kind of our umbrella place that we kind of

133
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Sure, sure.

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,960
But I and I mean this with all complete respect, but I can't get out of my head that it's Fistful

137
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
of Poop.

138
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Like a monkey.

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Neither can I, Rob.

140
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Fistful of Poop.

141
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
FFOP.

142
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
All right.

143
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
So that's a good way to remember it.

144
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Yeah, I know.

145
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Whatever works, right?

146
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Right.

147
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Right.

148
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Right.

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,560
And you can probably expect to hear just a lot of crap.

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Way to talk up your show.

151
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
I know.

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Woo!

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Fistful of Poop.

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
That's right.

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
To the boom.

156
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Rimshot.

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
FFOP.

158
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Right.

159
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
No, it's a fun show.

160
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,640
It's a bummer we couldn't get any of your co-hosts back tonight, but you're plenty.

161
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Yeah.

162
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Everyone's out of town.

163
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Oh.

164
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Well, that happens during Thanksgiving.

165
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Go figure.

166
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
That's right.

167
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah.

168
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Go figure.

169
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Let's see.

170
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
What else do I want to ask you about?

171
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,560
This week was 20 November, which was another holiday of sorts for the DDR and music game

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
nerds.

173
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,940
I guess it's totally dead in my mind now.

174
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,500
The two day celebration of 19 November and 20 November happened this past week, which

175
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,660
if you don't know what that means, there was a song in the, I believe it was in the original

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
DDR.

177
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,960
No, I don't think it showed up until third mix.

178
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You know where it was?

179
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
It was in Beatmania.

180
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,680
It was in Beatmania, the five key game.

181
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,660
There was a song called 20 November.

182
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,100
So that has kind of been adapted as the unofficial Bamani holiday.

183
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,060
So and you and I didn't necessarily meet playing DDR as I met a lot like that's how I met Loki.

184
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,480
It's how I met Dark Sakura.

185
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,600
You and I knew each other before that, thanks to Rocky Horror and other things.

186
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,320
But Bamani was a huge part of your life as well as mine.

187
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,800
How did you kind of get into music games way back in the day and what did that do for you?

188
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Me?

189
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah.

190
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,700
Well, I think the first time we played DDR was when we went to Las Vegas.

191
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,440
We went to like a Rocky con or something like that and we just saw it and you're like, oh,

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
this looks really cool.

193
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
And I'm like, that's stupid.

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't want to dance in front of people.

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm like, dumb.

196
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,920
And then you played it and I think I played a game, but then I just, I kept following

197
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,640
you to places like arcades and stuff and you kept playing DDR and I was like, oh, I'll

198
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
play it too.

199
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
And it was really fun.

200
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, it was.

201
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
It was the music.

202
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Right.

203
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
It's all about the music.

204
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,520
I don't remember the second part of your question.

205
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,620
Oh, what are some memorable experiences you got out of the whole thing from being a part

206
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,280
of the Bamani community for a few years?

207
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
I guess I got like friends and stuff from it.

208
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
That was pretty cool.

209
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Right on.

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Is that how you met Fafop?

211
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Not even remotely.

212
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I met Fafop.

213
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I met them through school.

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Gotcha.

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah.

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,680
I will remember a favorite memory that involved you.

217
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,600
And that was, we went to a tournament in Los Angeles, you and me, it was called the cyber

218
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,280
beat nation tournament.

219
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,600
This tournament was at Koreatown was what was like little Korea.

220
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,560
And I don't remember the name of the place, but this is a really big tournament.

221
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,260
This is one of the biggest tournaments they probably had.

222
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,240
And there was a lot of freestyle and there was perfect attack.

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,520
And pretty much throughout the entire weekend in the back of the arcade, there was Irene

224
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,740
and I in a tiny little booth singing karaoke for hours and hours and hours.

225
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,280
We played the fuck out of that machine.

226
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,880
This was before karaoke revolution or rock band or any of that shit.

227
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,840
There was this little thing, and the thing about it was not only could you sit there

228
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,000
and sing the songs, which there was a lot of American songs in there, even though some

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,960
of them had been translation, translation back again, like Google translate one way

230
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
in the back again.

231
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,720
There was a lot of Japanese songs and Korean songs and things in it too.

232
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,320
So we would go through the catalog and when you would sing the songs, you got scored at

233
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
the end.

234
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
And the whole thing became about like getting a high score.

235
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,120
And I remember I got a 100 on some song and then you did a song and got like a 21.

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm pretty sure it was the lower score, the better.

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
I seem to distinctly recall.

238
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
It was like golf.

239
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
It was like golf.

240
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Yes, exactly.

241
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Yeah, I was on par.

242
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Yeah.

243
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
So there you go.

244
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,260
There's a memory involving Irene for you guys was going to a DDR tournament to play karaoke

245
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
all weekend.

246
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Right.

247
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,520
Like you guys don't even know we were in that booth the entire weekend.

248
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I don't even know who won the damn tournament.

249
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
I really don't.

250
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Yeah.

251
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
I don't think we gave a shot.

252
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Like really.

253
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,040
And I think when people would come close to the booth to try to play the game, we would

254
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,120
like bark at them or something like, fuck off.

255
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
This is our game.

256
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
This is our territory.

257
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,480
You know what is really too bad about that whole thing too.

258
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,640
And I guess I can talk about this now.

259
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,380
It's been years and years, but they never did the sequel.

260
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,400
And they actually had asked me to MC the second tournament if they did one.

261
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,880
And I was always like, fuck yeah, I'll do it.

262
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah.

263
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
That sounds really exciting.

264
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
It's a huge tournament.

265
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
They didn't have the opportunity for OLR, which was still blooming at the time and everything,

266
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,240
but they didn't end up having the tournament.

267
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
And I don't remember why.

268
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I don't know.

269
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't think the arcade went under or anything, but it's just, they didn't get the interest

270
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
or something happened.

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,420
They couldn't financially pull it off.

272
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,960
So that was always too bad.

273
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,520
And you, I mean, I think the prize that you wanted that one was a DDR machine, right?

274
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I think so.

275
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,120
And how do you fucking top that?

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
It's kind of downhill from there.

277
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
It was like a solo 2000 or something.

278
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
It was still pretty awesome.

279
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Yeah.

280
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yeah.

281
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Considering it was like 2002 or something.

282
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,240
So, uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

283
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,520
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

284
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,040
voice of geeks network.

285
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,280
That's vognetwork.com and our chat room of course, at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Raginator

286
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,040
in our chat asking, is there any chance that Irene could change fafop.com to fafap.com?

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,880
I think we talked about that last time you were here that like, you might have to get

288
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
that domain as well as forward.

289
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Yeah.

290
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm currently working on that as of five seconds ago.

291
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Okay.

292
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
You have your people working on it right now.

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Yes.

294
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Yes.

295
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
All right.

296
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
That's happening.

297
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
That's happening.

298
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Uh, let's see.

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,440
Rama pointing out that November 20th was also DDR's 16th anniversary.

300
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Oh my gosh.

301
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Shut the front door.

302
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
16 years.

303
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
That's true.

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
1998 was the year it launched.

305
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Right.

306
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh my gosh.

307
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
And we first played it in 2000.

308
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
You and I.

309
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Was it 2000?

310
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Cause it was at the Rocky 25th convention in Vegas.

311
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah.

312
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah.

313
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,840
It was you, me, iguana girl and somebody else was there with us, I thought.

314
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
All playing.

315
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Yeah.

316
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
I don't remember.

317
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
I don't remember.

318
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Somebody else was with us.

319
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
It was so long ago.

320
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I know.

321
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
As our memories are fading.

322
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I have Alzheimer's.

323
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Um, let's see.

324
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,720
Act F pointing out the 20 November is also Mexican revolution day.

325
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Whoa.

326
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, maybe that's why it's dance, dance revolution.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,440
So wouldn't it be like by Llamas by Llamas, I don't know Spanish.

328
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm sorry.

329
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,200
I just ruined that joke, but I have a Luciano.

330
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,880
If I titled these episodes, tonight's episode would be by Llamas revolution.

331
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah.

332
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
There you go.

333
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,480
Uh, well, you know, in Europe it was called dancing stage.

334
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,800
I do know that because I guess, you know, you can't say revolution over there.

335
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,480
It's a bad word.

336
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
So it's dancing.

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
That's true.

338
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
It really is called dancing stage.

339
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Right.

340
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Call.

341
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,600
It's one of those things where like, they finally released it as DDR years later.

342
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,040
They just knew that it was going to be a fad, so you're going to go through this dancing

343
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
stage.

344
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,920
Well, it's like, it was like us and dragon quest for some reason it was dragon warrior.

345
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,600
And then finally at some point they were like, all right, it's dragon quest.

346
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah.

347
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Make up your fucking minds guys.

348
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh my gosh.

349
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
All right.

350
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Um, let's see.

351
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,400
Also in this part of November around Thanksgiving and because of the black Friday and the $5

352
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,280
crock pots I talked about a minute ago, this is the time of year where all the games are

353
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,600
coming out because you got to get your game on the shelf before black Friday, the official

354
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,160
start of the holiday season, because you know, that's when people are going to go out and

355
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,880
get the gifts that are going to show up under the tree.

356
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,080
The games sell the most during this time of year.

357
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,840
So we just have an avalanche of games to pick from this week.

358
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,340
Um, I do want to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been

359
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,700
playing this week.

360
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,800
But before we get into that completely, I kind of want to ask you, how do you pick the

361
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,420
games that you're going to play this week?

362
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,060
And this might be a really tough question.

363
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm going to pose this in our chat room too over at live.vognetwork.com.

364
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,320
How are you picking out of all these games?

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,220
You know, not everybody can afford to buy all 10 games they want.

366
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,120
Some people can't really afford to buy one of the games they want, but how are you able

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,460
to pick which game it is that you are going to play this week?

368
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,620
Loki, I'll start with you.

369
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
How did I pick which game?

370
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
How did you pick?

371
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,820
I bought, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, and so I played that for a bit, at least a few

372
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:53,340
days out of the week, and then the other few days I played Lego Marvel Super Heroes, mainly

373
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,540
because one of the days I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto 5, it was downloading a patch,

374
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,860
and so it took a long time.

375
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,900
It was going to be like another hour before I could play it, and I was like, eh, I'm just

376
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
going to play something else.

377
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,020
And so I played that, and I kept playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

378
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,700
I did want to get Far Cry, maybe Dragon Age Inquisition.

379
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Why?

380
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Why?

381
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,940
Far Cry 3, I loved that game, and it looks like a pretty incredible game, and Inquisition,

382
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,680
everybody's kind of doing it.

383
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
So it's like, got to get it.

384
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,060
Peer pressure is, okay, I mean, this is the thing people don't usually want to admit,

385
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,780
but is peer pressure a factor?

386
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
I'll kind of openly admit.

387
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,780
I mean, I want to get games that I can play with friends with, and unfortunately not everybody's

388
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,700
on the Grand Theft Auto bandwagon, because I don't know what's wrong with you people,

389
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,680
but seriously, not everybody's on that bandwagon, and so...

390
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,980
If it had come out like a month sooner, I probably would have bought it, but now it

391
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,660
has to compete with all this other stuff, and it's like, okay, I spent like $200 on

392
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,660
video games this week.

393
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
That's a lot of money.

394
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
No more.

395
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
You know?

396
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
I don't know.

397
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
I don't have to get Inquisition.

398
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,420
See, the thing is, I'm waiting for the Black Friday sales to see what's going to be discounted,

399
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,580
because there's even like, you know, I've been seeing some of the early stuff, and like

400
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,100
they have, was it Middle Earth Shadows of Mordor for like 25 bucks?

401
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,420
I mean, that just came out.

402
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,580
Why is it discounted so much?

403
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,300
It was supposed to be a pretty good game.

404
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,220
I mean, that might be worth picking up, or Wolfenstein down to $25, although I'm not

405
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,660
sure if I want to buy, because I'm already sitting on like a few games on my PlayStation

406
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,500
4 that I haven't played yet.

407
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,780
Like I have Watch Dogs and Destiny that haven't been touched yet.

408
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,860
And I know it's coming up later in the show, but it's no secret that this time of year

409
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,540
means a Steam sale is going to be coming at some point.

410
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,940
Speaking of things I haven't touched yet.

411
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Right?

412
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,380
And that's just going to be the problem worse.

413
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,020
Then it'll be like, oh, I just picked up $2 games.

414
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,380
Here's the thing though, I'm getting to the point now, even with like the Humblebundles,

415
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,800
and I tend to buy most of the Humblebundles, I'm getting to the point where I'm not picking

416
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,220
up because I own most of the games already.

417
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
Right.

418
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,820
And it's getting to the point where they're repeating enough stuff where it's like, well

419
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
shit.

420
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,060
You know, like this last Humblebundle I bought, I bought the highest tier so I could change

421
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,500
to a four so I can give the Rob.

422
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,460
But uh, thank you by the way, it was very nice of you to have no time to play it.

423
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Exactly.

424
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,300
It's like, you know, all these other games, like I looked at my list of unredeemed keys

425
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,820
on the Humblebundle and I'm like, well shit.

426
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Yeah.

427
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Cause I have all these already.

428
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,300
How many copies of Fez do I have?

429
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,420
Like way too many damn copies of Fez.

430
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
More than anyone needs.

431
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,420
You know, it's just, it's ridiculous like, oh hey, cool grid unlocked in grid two.

432
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,020
I'm never going to play these games.

433
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,660
Why am I buying these things?

434
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
All right.

435
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,620
I'll come back to you later and ask you more specifics about how Grand Theft Auto five

436
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
is going and all that.

437
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,980
Uh, look at our chat room though.

438
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,820
Cause I asked you guys in chat what, uh, you know, what you are weighing and what to play

439
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
this week.

440
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,180
Uh, act dev says I pick the game I'm most excited about and probably the one I'll play

441
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,420
the longest too.

442
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,540
Hence why I pick smash and vid power says, same here.

443
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,460
I picked the one I was eagerly anticipating, which was smash guys.

444
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,980
You know, it says it's easy to pick games because most of the crap they have out now

445
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,180
isn't worth buying.

446
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm only looking to get grand theft auto five and smash Pokemon grand theft auto five and

447
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,380
smash were the only games I was waiting for.

448
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,180
Oh, and Sims four and civilization beyond earth.

449
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
That's about it for me.

450
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,500
That's still sounds like a pretty good big list guys, you know, that's still a lot of

451
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
games in the list.

452
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
I don't know.

453
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,340
Uh, but uh, Irene, what, what do you factor in this week and like, what am I going to

454
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
play?

455
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,140
Um, I think about what's already on my 3ds.

456
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,000
So it's more like I'm on a budget.

457
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,960
I don't have time for $60 game week.

458
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Yes.

459
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
And also a time budget.

460
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,880
So what's going to take five to 15 minutes, which is usually the me Plaza.

461
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I see.

462
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
So you have to kind of weigh in because you have the school and the other stuff that gets

463
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
in the way.

464
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,400
What can I play quickly?

465
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Right.

466
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,440
So you don't have time to play dragon age inquisition, even if that was something that

467
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,200
was up your alley, which I don't think it is.

468
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Nope.

469
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah.

470
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
You don't have to, ain't nobody got time for that.

471
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Nobody got time for that.

472
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Nobody got time for that.

473
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Right.

474
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
So what are the retro titles and kind of what you like, if I kind of look at a list of what

475
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
are Irene's favorite games, a lot of them tend to be like retro stuff.

476
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,160
Is that because it's more bite-sized or, um, not real.

477
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,560
I mean, that's all just stuff that I have played because I don't have time to play current

478
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
games anymore.

479
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,960
I, you know, I haven't played them, but I've played a lot of older games.

480
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,640
So that's usually why all of my favorite games are older games because I haven't played any

481
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
new games.

482
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
I'm too busy.

483
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, and you can always, and you can always come over here and play the stuff that I got

484
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
suckered into buying.

485
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, like you did with Smash this week, right?

486
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

487
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Totally did that.

488
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That was fun.

489
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,520
Uh, we'll talk about your thoughts on Smash in a minute here.

490
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Uh, for me, I think, you know, and the thing I didn't really get to get into as Loki was

491
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,700
talking, I think peer pressure does play into it just a little bit.

492
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,720
Like I kind of think that's what finally broke me on Dragon Age Inquisition.

493
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Like I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really, like I didn't get it super into Dragon

494
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Age Origins.

495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,340
Like I tried, but it just, I don't know if it was too slow or if it's just the engine

496
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,540
wasn't like Mass Effect, so it didn't really pull me in the same way or the store.

497
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
I don't know what it was.

498
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,500
I couldn't get into Dragon Age Origins.

499
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
I don't like hate it.

500
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,780
I just really couldn't get into it, but I bought Dragon Age Inquisition because I knew

501
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,220
Alan was a big fan of it.

502
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,680
I knew my roommate was a big fan of it and there would be a lot of chatter about the

503
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,500
game in this household.

504
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,100
And I was like, oh, it has a multiplayer mode and multiplayer is supposed to be kind of

505
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
like Mass Effect.

506
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,740
And I really liked Mass Effect's multiplayer mode way more than I ever thought I would.

507
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Uh, so I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going to do it.

508
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,380
Here's the 60 bucks.

509
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,100
And I really enjoyed Dragon Age Inquisition.

510
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,520
I'll talk about that more in a minute, but I, I'm really glad I bought it.

511
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,780
Like the game pulled me in, in a way that Origins didn't do.

512
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,380
So I'm like super into the game.

513
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,660
So it's a, it's a place where peer pressure actually paid off.

514
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,180
I actually think you're onto something.

515
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,380
There's always this fear of missing out.

516
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,460
I think that a lot of people are susceptible to that.

517
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,580
And I mean, I don't know, we're probably gonna talk about this later, but the whole Warlords

518
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,100
of Draenor thing, like how the sub, you know, has risen.

519
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah, we'll get into that.

520
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Yeah.

521
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,220
So I kind of think that's part of playing part of that too.

522
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
That's okay.

523
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,840
Let's talk about Draenor for a minute and we will get into that and, you know, and have

524
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,420
a more lengthy discussion about, you know, what Blizzard's doing amongst all the chaos

525
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,540
happened this past week, but you are a former World of Warcraft player.

526
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,860
In fact, you're the one that kind of got me into it.

527
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
One of a couple people.

528
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
Yeah, I know.

529
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Right.

530
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
So you got me into it.

531
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
I don't play anymore.

532
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,940
But I found it really hard to resist the temptation to go back this week because everybody is

533
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,540
up that expansion's ass.

534
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Right.

535
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,740
Like, and I'm not hating with that comment.

536
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
I'm not hating with that comment.

537
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,260
I'm really happy for Blizzard and I'm happy that that expansion apparently has turned

538
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,340
out as good as it has because I really lost interest halfway through Pandaria when basically

539
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,100
Blizzard had thrown five mans out the window, which is the thing I enjoyed most in the game

540
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,220
and I couldn't stand LFR and stuff anymore.

541
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,140
But it seems like people are really loving this expansion, the story, and a lot of the

542
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,260
other things about it.

543
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,900
I know people that haven't played in a very long time that are super into it and that

544
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,620
peer pressure is kind of making me go, I, I got to do it.

545
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
I got to try it.

546
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,700
Like even though I'm paying for 14 and I got, I've got to, everybody's loving wow.

547
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,280
I've got to try wow at some point.

548
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,060
But luckily this week I've been able to tell myself, okay, Rob, you just bought three,

549
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,620
no four, because I bought the Jackbox game too.

550
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,240
I bought four games this week.

551
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,640
I do not need fucking wow to make me not play any of it.

552
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Right.

553
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Right.

554
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,000
And you know, it's such a weird dynamic with wow.

555
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,720
You kind of have to strike while the iron's hot because maybe a few months down the line

556
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,600
it's not going to be as appealing.

557
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,400
You know, people will drop off and it just won't be, so it has to be the right conditions

558
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
too.

559
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,720
So right now is when everyone's jumping back on board and everything's still fresh and

560
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,940
no one, you know, all the contents new and stuff like that.

561
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,960
So it would be the ideal time to do it.

562
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,080
And I will tell you, I despise wow, I do.

563
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,400
But even I was tempted for a millisecond, like, man, I really miss PVP and just, I miss

564
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,320
wow and I just, I would love to go back, but it's just like, no, I mean, I'm done with

565
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
that.

566
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,280
So, but yeah, there's just this confluence of just factors that make it sound appealing

567
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
and I don't know.

568
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,360
Without getting too dark, I hope I'm not going down too much of a dark road here, but you

569
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,880
used to be really into wow and now you say I despise wow.

570
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,640
That's a very strong term.

571
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
What flipped for you?

572
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Wow killed my brother.

573
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm just kidding.

574
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
I shouldn't laugh.

575
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,560
It's a horrible thing to say.

576
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
No, it's not.

577
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,400
No, it just, you know, thinking about all of the money I spent on wow and all the time

578
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,720
I spent on wow and how much more I could have been doing with my life rather than playing

579
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
wow.

580
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,740
And you know, some of the friendships and the fake friendships that I created with wow.

581
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,120
And I say that earnestly, like fake friendships, because sometimes you got to play that game

582
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,240
in the game to do anything.

583
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,640
Like, you know, if someone finds out you're a girl in the game, wow, it just turns around

584
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
180 for you.

585
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Like they will, there's just this intricate game you have to play with them.

586
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,360
And it's, it's not anything I really wanted to be a part of, but that's just, it was kind

587
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,240
of the expectation, I guess it was created in the environment of wow.

588
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,040
Anyway, that's a whole different topic.

589
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,560
But that was fascinating.

590
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,840
You could do an entire movie on that.

591
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Whoa.

592
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
No.

593
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,440
But I mean, it was just, you know, there were some great things about it.

594
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,400
I loved PVPing, you know, I loved interacting with my friends and stuff, but it was just,

595
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,960
you know, it was affecting my real life too much.

596
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,880
And I just, you know, the more I think about it, the more resentful I get about it.

597
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
So

598
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,080
You know, what's interesting is, you know, I have Hoard House, which was a World of Warcraft

599
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,480
podcast for a few years, and I'm pretty tuned into the Warcraft podcasting community of

600
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
which there's a lot of podcasts.

601
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not sure I've ever heard in the years of, of, of doing those podcasts, I've ever

602
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,860
heard somebody talk about the real social game the way you just did.

603
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,600
That's very, that's, I mean, and I can't really argue with you and what you're saying, but

604
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,640
it's a very interesting layer of wow that nobody who's into it really talks about, which

605
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,760
I find very interesting.

606
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah.

607
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,980
I mean, nobody, I think, you know, no one wants to acknowledge that that happens and

608
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,480
it's not just wow, it's, it's every MMO that you play or any sort of

609
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Or any multiplayer game.

610
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Right.

611
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
It can be League of Legends.

612
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Right.

613
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Exactly.

614
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Yeah.

615
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,520
You know, but I mean, everyone knows that it happens.

616
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,340
It's just, nobody really acknowledged or they're just kind of, you know, they're blind to it.

617
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
They just think that that's

618
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,440
And just to be clear, you're not only talking about the whole like IRL girl angle.

619
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Right.

620
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Right.

621
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,100
You're talking about, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is what I'm hearing.

622
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,660
You have faked friendships in an MMO to advance your MMO game.

623
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
Yes.

624
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,660
Even though you didn't particularly necessarily care for the person who, who might've been

625
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
helping you out.

626
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Right.

627
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Yeah.

628
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,660
And people have done that with me too.

629
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
So it's not, and that's okay.

630
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,380
I mean, that's just how the game is played.

631
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,820
It stings the first time, but you know, you just get used to it.

632
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,380
It's par for the course.

633
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Wow.

634
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah.

635
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,220
Loki, when are you going to start playing MMOs?

636
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,100
Want to be my friend in WoW?

637
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,540
I'll be your friend.

638
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,220
Help me get a two player amount.

639
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Right.

640
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Wow.

641
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,040
Uh, let's see, uh, Kaijuto in chat says, wow, screwed up MMOs.

642
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,500
It went with mediocre and now every MMO just follows suit.

643
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,260
Kaijuto also saying she realized how mediocre WoW is.

644
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,020
It is very, you know, I can't hate on the mediocrity of WoW because it went from, I

645
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,060
mean, if you think of all of WoW's predecessors, what came, what MMOs came before WoW?

646
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,700
I mean, there was request Ultima online, how difficult were these games?

647
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,580
How hard were, were they to access for the quote unquote, I guess, casual gamer or, you

648
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,140
know, not super experienced gamer.

649
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,900
You know, I can credit WoW with, with being very accessible, you know, and I appreciate

650
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,540
that because I'm, I'm, I, I, I like games, but I'm not amazing at them.

651
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:51,500
So Blizzard has become a PC gaming powerhouse and now also console, you know, they're, they

652
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,460
dabble in the console stuff too, but Blizzard's become a PC gaming powerhouse by dumbing

653
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,780
down.

654
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,540
And I don't mean that in a harsh way, but just like, I love Blizzard games too because

655
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:08,020
they dumb down what can oftentimes be very difficult genres so that everybody can play

656
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
them.

657
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Right.

658
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,500
And they, and they're, they did it with, um, Starcraft.

659
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,860
They did it with Diablo is a simple dungeon crawler.

660
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,340
They did heroes of the storm big time.

661
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,100
The only mobile I can wrap my head around is heroes of the storm.

662
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,020
And now they're going to do it again with the shooter.

663
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,420
And you've got all these people, and I don't know if it's just this whole effect that Blizzard

664
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:34,300
has that I don't want to say Blizzard creates a cult, but like going, but going to Blizzcon

665
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,660
was a very interesting experience because there's so many people that are like, I hate

666
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,220
first person shooters, but I'll play Overwatch.

667
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,180
I'll play it because it's Blizzard bow down, bow down, I'm going to play this.

668
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,140
And I got to admit, even I played Overwatch and the first time I didn't totally get it,

669
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,260
but the second time I was like, God, this character development is really good.

670
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,940
And I could see myself getting really into this.

671
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Yeah.

672
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
And that's what it is too.

673
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,300
They might sacrifice, you know, um, very involved gameplay or, you know, whatever, but they'll

674
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,940
enrich something else in the game.

675
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,460
They'll make a really good, you know, storyline or, you know, whatever.

676
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,380
So I think that's probably what the draw of wow was, was, you know, they're sacrificing

677
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,340
that, but they're making in, in making it more accessible to gamers.

678
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,460
They improve other aspects of the game to make up for it.

679
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,500
And to be fair, I don't think I would use the word mediocre with wow, because I really

680
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,380
think wow set the bar in some ways, but I do think there are games that have taken some

681
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,860
things in wow and done it better.

682
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,140
Y'all know I'm addicted to Final Fantasy 14.

683
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,680
I think there's some elements that 14 does better, but I'm not necessarily saying that

684
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,740
all of it's better.

685
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,780
It has its drawbacks as well.

686
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,580
But um, you know, it's just, there's these other MMOs that are all worth checking out,

687
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,700
but nobody does it because they're too tied up in the social game of wow.

688
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,260
You know, I would acknowledge that wow has devolved since its origins.

689
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Absolutely.

690
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,860
And I think girl, you were coming out swinging tonight.

691
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
It's true though.

692
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
It has.

693
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,140
I mean, if you, let's talk about this.

694
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,380
I mean, you think about, you know, vanilla wow.

695
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,700
If you want to argue with princess Irene, uh, by all means, uh, tweet us at OLR or you

696
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
want a bump?

697
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Let's go.

698
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
You want a bump?

699
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Let's go.

700
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
No, no, I'm just saying, okay.

701
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Ah, you know, I really love the game.

702
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
I loved vanilla.

703
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Wow.

704
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,020
Um, burning crusade, you know, wrath kind of sucked.

705
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,260
Um, but I mean, once you start looking at when they took all of the pop culture references

706
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,920
and the memes and stuff overboard, when it kind of broke the verisimilitude of the game

707
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,560
and it went from a fantasy game to a pop culture game and they just were not even subtle about

708
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
anything anymore.

709
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,940
They were getting too ironic with their stuff.

710
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,220
Are you saying there was one too many poop quests?

711
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Yes.

712
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,300
I'm saying that there were one too many poop quests.

713
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Yes.

714
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,340
You know, and I just, it was, it was fun at first, but then it just became too overt and

715
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,460
too much.

716
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,500
And I think that really just, you know, it devolved into something for, you know, it

717
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,900
was like fucking 12 year old dick and fart jokes, which you know, I normally love, but

718
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,420
I also loved original wow.

719
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
And it really just ruined it for me.

720
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,500
Well, some of the people that are talking about warless arena or say it's, it's a return

721
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,380
closest thing to vanilla and burning crusade and that period right in between that we've

722
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,380
seen since.

723
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,540
And see, that's so depressing because I don't want to go back to wow, because I know life

724
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,720
after wow and it's beautiful and it's sweet.

725
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,820
And then if I go back into wow, it's sucking me back in.

726
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,640
But I know people that play wow that are completely like functional, happy people.

727
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
You know, I don't want to.

728
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm not one of those people.

729
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,940
I don't do that when I play wow.

730
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,340
I sit for 12 hours on a Saturday and PVP all day.

731
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
That's okay.

732
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,900
So as long as we're clear, people react differently and that's how you did it.

733
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Exactly.

734
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Yeah.

735
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I want to get through school.

736
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
So.

737
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
All right.

738
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Let's see.

739
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,020
We've got from Alan alchemy, who I believe is talking about the social elements of, of

740
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
wow.

741
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,540
The social game quote, everyone in my raid group ain't shit and are actually kind of

742
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,580
racist, but we progress hard modes easily and they fit my schedule.

743
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
So, Oh, well.

744
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Wow.

745
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,620
See, see, you have to pretend to like these fuckers.

746
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Like yeah.

747
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Oh, racism.

748
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Good times.

749
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
All right.

750
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,620
Let's go raid.

751
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,020
You know, like I just, I, I don't want to do that.

752
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,480
I don't want to put up with bullshit just to do things with people, but not that everyone

753
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:15,960
that plays wow is racist, but most of them, definitely grandpa, but I'm not hating on

754
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
it.

755
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,240
I just, you know, it's, it's kind of a slippery slope for me.

756
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
It's all right.

757
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Wow.

758
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,200
I did not know this was going to delve into the dark side of MMO chat, but that was, that

759
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
was great.

760
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
No therapy time for a read.

761
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,840
You're actually like lying back in Jamie's chair.

762
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Just kicking it.

763
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Just talking about, wow.

764
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,000
If you were the smoking kind of as you'd have a cigarette in your hand, just, you know,

765
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,040
looking back on it, like a grizzled veteran, let's talk about, wow.

766
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
All right.

767
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Well, I do want to move on with the show and talk a little bit about what have we been

768
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,160
playing this week specifically, I guess we've touched on it a little bit, but now let's

769
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,040
get into some of the details and maybe some of the stuff that got missed.

770
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Loki.

771
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
How was your gaming week?

772
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,360
Um, I played Grand Theft Auto and, um, it's awesome.

773
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,780
You know, I, I downloaded it digitally cause I had, you know, pre-ordered, so unlocked

774
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:10,620
on Monday and, um, I started playing through the story, no story campaign.

775
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,100
I actually tried streaming some of it and that worked out okay, I guess.

776
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:21,420
Um, and then also I did play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, still kind of bored

777
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
with that game.

778
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I don't know.

779
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,260
It's just kind of okay, I guess.

780
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,900
But at the time you don't want us picking out games to get from my PlayStation four.

781
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,140
I was just like, eh, it looked pretty good, but it's all right.

782
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
I don't know.

783
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,660
I probably, if they made another Infamous game, I probably would not pick it up.

784
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,200
Um, but Grand Theft Auto, yes, Grand Theft Auto is amazing.

785
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,620
And I did play through a lot of it in first person mode, although I've now gone back to

786
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,700
third person mode again, cause I don't know, I kind of got over it.

787
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,100
It is hard to like, you know, see around yourself and, um, it might be fun to like play, you

788
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,860
know, Grand Theft Auto online that way, if you're playing in online mode, that was only

789
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,580
people playing in that mode, but, uh, I don't know, it looks really good.

790
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,560
It's very pretty and I love all the new animals, you know, cats and stuff wandering around

791
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
a lot.

792
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,020
And, um, I don't know, it's, I did watch a little bit of your live stream and I saw the

793
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,660
cat and now, yes, I got very distracted, you know, I was supposed to be stealing a car.

794
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I'm like, okay.

795
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Yeah.

796
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,620
So, now there's a lot of cats and they're not, not rare at all, so you see them quite

797
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
a bit.

798
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Um, so I did that and I think the other day I was occupying myself playing with Chop,

799
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,900
so I was throwing a ball at people.

800
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,140
As I take his ball, throw it at a person, they get pissed off and when they get pissed

801
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,160
off, he goes and attacks them and kills them.

802
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,500
So that's kind of fun.

803
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,740
Um, so I was doing that.

804
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,500
And then, um, what else?

805
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,300
Uh, Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

806
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,060
So I had originally got this to play with my son and it's just hard to play with him

807
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,820
because he doesn't really understand how to use the controller too well.

808
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,140
I mean, he can mash some of the, you know, buttons in it and he wanted to play as Hulk

809
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,900
and stuff and then he got frustrated once he passed the Hulk stage that now it's Captain

810
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,220
America and, um, oh, who else was it?

811
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,460
Captain America and Mr. Fantastic.

812
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,180
So I was playing through the campaign to get to, you know, the free mode part of the whole

813
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,780
thing where you can kind of run around New York.

814
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,740
And so I was playing through that and I finally got that unlocked, but then I kept playing

815
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,420
it because, you know, it's okay.

816
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
I don't know.

817
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
I was trying to unlock all the characters.

818
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,020
I'm still not sure how to switch characters.

819
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,940
I think I'll figure that out later on, but I guess there's supposed to be some sort of

820
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,580
secret room with Deadpool, but Deadpool's everywhere.

821
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,540
He like has so many cameos and everything.

822
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
It's hilarious.

823
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,980
Um, so I just have to play through it, I guess some more to find Deadpool.

824
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,580
That's who I'm really trying to unlock.

825
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:59,740
Um, the story's okay, I guess, uh, ran across, um, oh, what's his name, um, I don't know.

826
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,820
It's mostly the Avengers stuff right now, uh, them run through and damn, they have like

827
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,980
a ton of Spider-Man content and like the first like four or five villains were all Spider-Man

828
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
villains.

829
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,540
I'm like, okay, Spider-Man's in this level and this level and this level.

830
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,700
Is Doctor Octopus the first one you run into, like the very first one?

831
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
Sandman's the very first one.

832
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Sandman and then Doctor Octopus and then, then it's what, Green Goblin and then Venom

833
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,940
and it's like, okay, you've gone through all of the Spider-Man villains, stop.

834
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,460
And then, um, who would it end up being?

835
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:40,980
Then you finally run into Magneto and, um, uh, Sabretooth and you fight, uh, oh, what's

836
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
his name?

837
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,820
Uh, Abomination again.

838
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
I don't know.

839
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,980
There's a lot of characters in it.

840
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,460
It's kind of cool.

841
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,740
So I played through that and it's fun.

842
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,740
I probably will still play through it again because the only thing, granted, I thought

843
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,620
it was, I've, I've already beat the campaign a hundred percent in the Xbox 360.

844
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,620
So it's like, and I remember how much of a pain in the ass that was to do that.

845
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,340
That took a long time and I'm just kind of regretting having to do that again because

846
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,700
I want to get in on that whole, you know, Mount Chiliad mystery Easter egg thing, but

847
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,260
you have to have a hundred percent to do that.

848
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,100
And then it's kind of like, oh, I don't want to do that again.

849
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,700
It took so much time, so I'm just hoping someone releases like a save game cheat or something

850
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
like that.

851
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Cause I really don't want to have to go through the whole campaign yet.

852
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
It was good.

853
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,380
It's just, it's a long time, a lot of time dedicated to that, but maybe, maybe I'll do

854
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
it.

855
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
You know, who knows?

856
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,520
I do want to pick up far cry four at some point, but all these games take a long time.

857
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,220
That's why Lego Marvel superheroes.

858
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,340
It's just kind of linear for the most part, although the open world stuff's really huge

859
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
too.

860
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,580
I was like, holy crap, this map is huge.

861
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,780
I mean, it's kind of empty, but it's very, there's a lot of stuff and I'm still not really

862
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,440
sure what collecting all those studs do if I can like buy things with that.

863
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,620
So I've been just collecting them anyways, but there's a ton of collecting this.

864
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
I don't know.

865
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Cause it's shiny and I'm like, I don't know them getting points.

866
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
I guess.

867
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Are these points?

868
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Are they money?

869
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
What, what are these things?

870
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
I don't know.

871
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,540
So maybe I'll just look it up on the internet.

872
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,340
But uh, so yeah, that's what I've been doing this week is just really those games.

873
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
All right.

874
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,620
Well I'm going to try to cover this quickly.

875
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
I know.

876
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
I'm sorry.

877
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
Real quick.

878
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Real quick.

879
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,100
I also played more of the, um, well you want to talk about a sandwich play, no play room.

880
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,420
I didn't play any sandwiches.

881
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
No, actually my son was playing play room.

882
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,300
Um, he was playing the alien.

883
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,740
My was like some alien one, um, brave, like a toy alien and you destroyed, like it almost

884
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
looks like a little bit playing.

885
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,820
Destroyed a bunch of like cardboard things.

886
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
And so he loves it.

887
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,180
Like he literally spent like two or three hours playing that the other day all by himself.

888
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
I was like, Hey, cool.

889
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
All right.

890
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
That's it.

891
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
All right.

892
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,060
Uh, I will try to be quick cause I, I had, I covered a lot of ground in gaming this week

893
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,820
and so I'm going to try to be quick.

894
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,420
So I played a lot of my usual stuff like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo three because, and the

895
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,880
reason why I played a lot of Diablo three and probably more of that than anything else

896
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,500
this week is that Alan decided to make this his week that I'm just, I don't know why,

897
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,060
but I've decided I'm going to beat Diablo three finally.

898
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,620
Maybe watching me play all that time finally rubbed off on him and he was like, I want

899
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,060
to do riffs and all the cool things that Rob talks about.

900
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,580
So he finally beat the game and he's level like 69 he's really close to that 70 cap right

901
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
now.

902
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,720
Um, so he's been playing Diablo three, so I've been helping him out and I've just been

903
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,620
playing a lot of it because of that.

904
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,540
Looking forward to the new patch, trying to finish out what I want to do in season one

905
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,900
before it hits.

906
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,220
Um, so a lot of that old, the old stuff I've been playing, but new stuff, lots of new stuff.

907
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,580
Dragon Age Inquisition, which I mentioned a little bit ago.

908
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,420
Um, I, I got really sucked into the game because the game really hits the ground running with

909
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,420
the story.

910
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,500
I found the story very interesting.

911
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,860
I think the characters are really interesting and this is something BioWare does very well.

912
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,220
Uh, they did it in Mass Effect and I know they did this in the other Dragon Age games.

913
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,660
I just think the characters are really, really interesting.

914
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,380
You know, I know Dragon Age gets a lot at a lot for its diversity.

915
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:06,700
I think that just goes to enhance the, the stories, the backgrounds that all these different

916
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,180
characters have that you can really go down a rabbit hole of exploring these people's

917
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,500
paths, where they come from and their stories.

918
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,860
This is, it's great.

919
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,580
And so many different party members.

920
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,580
Um, I also, a lot of folks comparing Dragon Age Inquisition to Skyrim in some ways, and

921
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,980
I definitely feel the Skyrim influence in the game.

922
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
And the reason why...

923
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,180
No, don't say that.

924
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Don't say that.

925
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
You have to buy it now.

926
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,060
And the reason why Irene's making a face, like, I don't like Skyrim face.

927
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,780
What is wrong with you?

928
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,220
Absolutely nothing.

929
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,820
I have my own opinion, Matt.

930
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
What is your quick opinion?

931
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,620
Clearly, it's clearly because you haven't played a little PC mods.

932
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
You can make that game.

933
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
Clearly.

934
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
Clearly.

935
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,620
What is clearly your problem with Skyrim?

936
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,100
It is clearly fucking boring as shit.

937
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Okay.

938
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
So you know what?

939
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,940
I can see why people get bored with Skyrim.

940
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
I really can.

941
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
Yeah.

942
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,940
Because it is, it is a slow burn.

943
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Yes.

944
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,300
And it isn't necessarily a game that kind of, I mean, I don't know, it does kind of make

945
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
your own excitement.

946
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah.

947
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,780
I don't even think it's on fire.

948
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,860
It's not a slow burn.

949
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
It's just sitting there.

950
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Like a candle.

951
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Right.

952
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
That isn't lit.

953
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,580
The thing about Dragon Age Inquisition, if you've read up on the game, everybody heard

954
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
about this.

955
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,580
The very first area you go in, the Hinterlands, you're doing the quest and suddenly you're

956
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
going down the map.

957
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Oh, there's a side quest over there.

958
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,780
Oh, there's a side quest over there.

959
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,700
Oh, there's a camp I need to mark over there.

960
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
Oh, there's, there's...

961
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
Can't fucking deal with that.

962
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,700
I can't.

963
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,060
Side quest, side quest, side quest, and then you go do one side quest.

964
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,660
There's five more side quests to do.

965
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,220
So it's like, you get stuck in this one fucking zone because you can't stop doing the side

966
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,620
quests that are all showing up on your map with very similar icons to Skyrim, might I

967
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
add.

968
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
I just kind of noticed that.

969
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
It was very interesting.

970
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Uh, it just, yeah.

971
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,980
So, but, but I kinda, I like that, that you go down this and then there's, there's more

972
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,500
and you go keep further down.

973
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
There's even more and more.

974
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,300
And I kind of liked that there's so many things to do, but I really stress if you are playing

975
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,900
Dragon Age Inquisition, leave the fucking Hinterlands when you can.

976
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,520
Go progress the story because you'll get more characters.

977
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,140
I don't want to do spoilers, but there are more characters, pretty, at least two to three,

978
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,460
three new characters you can get pretty quickly after you get out of the fucking Hinterlands,

979
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,220
you can always go back.

980
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
And that's what I did.

981
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,260
I went and I got three new characters and then I went back.

982
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,580
So now I'm, I'm doing the burn in the Hinterlands again.

983
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:24,220
And then I got to another area, the Storm Coast, which is another open world area that

984
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,900
has five more things to explore.

985
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,700
It's just like, Oh my God, there's so much to do.

986
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,860
So a lot to do in Dragon Age Inquisition.

987
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,580
Now it's not a perfect game.

988
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,580
And the other reason why I compare it to Skyrim is that Dragon Age Inquisition has some pretty

989
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:45,980
hilarious glitches and we have to be fair for a minute because all of the internet sat

990
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,620
here and gave Assassin's Creed Unity a hell of a time last week over some of the bugs.

991
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,460
Yet, come on, there's some pretty derpy things that happen in Dragon Age Inquisition and

992
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,500
people aren't talking about that.

993
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,340
So that needs to be called out.

994
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,580
There are definitely some choppy frame rate things that happen.

995
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,660
The thing that gets me is dancing characters, like characters that will start to move in

996
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,080
these really erratic patterns for no reason.

997
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,780
And I'm like, why stop doing that?

998
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,420
Now we don't have anything as bad as say somebody's face is fucking missing.

999
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,700
Like there's nothing that bad, but there are definitely still some technical glitches that

1000
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,100
take you out of the experience for a little bit.

1001
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,100
I do consider that minor in the big picture because those minor things aside, the game

1002
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,740
is really beautiful.

1003
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,900
And you know, when glitches aren't happening, there's a lot of gorgeous things to look at.

1004
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,740
Cutscenes are rendered very well.

1005
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,380
The way your custom design character is woven into the experiences is really, really something.

1006
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,980
So there's a lot of good stuff in Dragon Age Inquisition.

1007
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,520
I think if you are into RPGs, it's worth checking out.

1008
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I did not really play the first two games.

1009
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,920
I don't think you have to have either to get fulfillment out of this game.

1010
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,180
So just throwing that out there.

1011
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,920
Multiplayer is kind of, I don't want to say it's thrown on.

1012
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,980
There's definitely a rich experience in there, but it is completely disjointed from the single

1013
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,980
player game.

1014
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
They are two separate games.

1015
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,500
They have nothing in common.

1016
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,140
So I, well, sorry, when I say nothing in common, I mean what you do in one does not impact

1017
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,620
the other and vice versa.

1018
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,700
The battle system is very similar.

1019
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,020
That's what they do have in common.

1020
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,500
But yeah, I was actually a little disappointed that multiplayer is so separated from the

1021
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,260
single player experience because there's A, no reason to play it, meaning B, it's hard

1022
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,460
to find people to play it with.

1023
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,980
And if I grind and grind and grind in multiplayer, I don't even get PlayStation trophies to show

1024
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
for it.

1025
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,260
Because unfortunately I think there's some people out there that are so opposed to multiplayer,

1026
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,000
they're like, oh, well I'm not going to pick up Dragon Age if they have multiplayer trophies

1027
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,780
because I don't do multiplayer and PvP, ew, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1028
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,280
Well A, the multiplayer Dragon Age isn't PvP.

1029
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,960
It's all dungeon crawling, four man stuff.

1030
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,620
And I see trophies as achievements and they are optional.

1031
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,060
And if you, I mean, if you decide not to do the content, that's kind of your own damn

1032
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
problem.

1033
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,060
Like, I don't know.

1034
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:10,620
I don't understand why they couldn't do just some things for multiplayer to make it a little

1035
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,420
more tied to the experience.

1036
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,220
It was a little silly.

1037
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,740
Yeah, that's kind of stupid.

1038
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,900
It's like, what's the point then?

1039
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,520
I mean, there are a lot of people who are just achievement whores and they just want

1040
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,100
to get every single achievement.

1041
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,640
And that's why I assume they didn't put it for multiplayer, but you're just kind of making

1042
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,640
it useless then.

1043
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,620
It's like, we spent all this time developing multiplayer, but no one's going to play it.

1044
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,740
And for me, at the end of the day, it's not as fluid as Mass Effect's multiplayer was.

1045
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,520
And that kind of takes me out of the experience a little bit.

1046
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,860
Like I don't, I don't, I think that's the best word I can think of to describe it.

1047
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,500
It's just not, it's just not very fluid.

1048
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,380
It's kind of like you go through a dungeon, you kill a few mobs and then it's like, oh,

1049
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,380
I look around here.

1050
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,500
I look around here and then, oh, now we're going to wave two.

1051
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,900
And it's just, I don't know, it just, it doesn't really feel as strong as the single player

1052
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
game itself.

1053
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,780
And I don't think it, it doesn't, I think a good multiplayer experience compliments

1054
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,300
the single player experience.

1055
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,380
And this does not compliment anything.

1056
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,780
This is a spinoff.

1057
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,260
This is like playing the Dragon Age game on Facebook or something.

1058
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,260
It's that kind of spinoff.

1059
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,020
I mean, ultimately, like I hate to sound so damning of it because I do think, I think

1060
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,960
you could have a little fun playing multiplayer a few times, especially if you had some friends

1061
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,660
to play it with, but then you'll be like, why am I playing this?

1062
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,500
I need to go back into single player mode and actually progress my game.

1063
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Right.

1064
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Right.

1065
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Okay.

1066
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,420
So we're going to do a Jackbox Party Pack, which by the way, we have a code we're going

1067
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
to give away.

1068
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,900
We're going to give away a copy of Jackbox Party Pack for the Xbox One or PlayStation

1069
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,900
Four.

1070
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
We're going to give it away.

1071
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
You can be live listener or podcast listener.

1072
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,260
We're going to do a contest and I'll talk about that at the start of part B. And obviously,

1073
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,180
you know, we've had them on the show before.

1074
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,980
So just that whole disclosure in case you think that's going to taint my review.

1075
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,780
But I had, I had a great time with Jackbox Party Pack.

1076
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,540
It is that, it is a party pack.

1077
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,980
It's a bunch of little like board games virtually.

1078
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,820
And you might remember when we had them on the show, we talked a little bit about that

1079
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,900
experience of doing the tablets and cell phones as controllers.

1080
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,660
And it works very, very, very well for games like Fibbage.

1081
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:17,220
And I think a standout in the pack is Drawful, which you play, you played it too.

1082
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,780
You, you'd enjoy Drawful, right?

1083
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,780
It was fantastic.

1084
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,500
Drawful was a hell of a lot of fun for such a simple concept, but the way that it's all

1085
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,180
weaved together with being able to draw it on the phone and everything is, is really

1086
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
cool.

1087
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,820
And because it was on PlayStation 4, we were share playing with Extifer.

1088
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,020
And so there's no lag.

1089
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,940
He can see the screen like he's sitting in the room and he's on his phone and he can

1090
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,940
play with us.

1091
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,060
And we're talking through the TV.

1092
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,940
Like it's just technology.

1093
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,340
It's so fucking great.

1094
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,340
Right?

1095
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,340
Dun, dun, dun.

1096
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,340
Oh my God.

1097
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,340
So that was really cool.

1098
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,540
The only part, like if you play, you don't know Jack, for some reason they decided to

1099
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,500
put the tablet controls in that too.

1100
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,700
And I don't understand why they went down that, well I do and I don't, like not everybody

1101
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,860
has four $40 controllers for PlayStation 4 or whatever, but I still kind of think controllers

1102
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,820
should have been an option because I think in some of the more precise things you have

1103
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,900
to do and you don't know Jack, such as, um, the, the very last round, the Jack attack

1104
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,260
where you have to be like the first person to push the button when you, like that is

1105
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,620
skills and reflexes.

1106
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,300
And unfortunately when you add the lag of cell phone browser into that, it really detracts

1107
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,300
from the experience.

1108
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,460
So I think, you know, one feedback I would have for the developers is that I don't think

1109
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,540
you made the right call in saying tablets only in multiplayer in that.

1110
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,940
I would love to see controllers or tablets.

1111
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,460
I mean, that's great for the people who don't have four controllers, but I know what I used

1112
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,220
to do is I would tell my friends when they came over to play, you don't know Jack, bring

1113
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,180
your controller and then we don't have that problem.

1114
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,100
So I just, I would like to see them bring that back.

1115
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,180
But otherwise I think, I think, uh, I mean, it was what, 25 bucks and you get five games

1116
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,420
and I think Fibbage and Drawful are definitely the standouts.

1117
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,900
Word Spud is okay.

1118
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,300
I didn't, I know you weren't really super into it.

1119
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,060
It's a very simple idea.

1120
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,140
It's basically like just chain one word to another and then everybody votes if they like

1121
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,140
it or not.

1122
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,660
You know, it's a very simple concept.

1123
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Um, I just didn't get, not something I think you'll play a bunch, but the other games kind

1124
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,380
of lifted up where it's like, Oh, this is just a bonus.

1125
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Absolutely.

1126
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Um, other games I've played this week, Super Smash Brothers on the Wii U.

1127
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,980
Um, Oh my God, why did I even buy the 3DS version at this point?

1128
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,620
Like it's like the three, this is going to sound really harsh and I'm going to get some

1129
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,700
hate from some fans, but like after playing the Wii U version, the 3DS version is garbage.

1130
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,920
I'm sorry.

1131
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,980
That is how I feel.

1132
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,720
It's like, I cannot go back and play the 3DS version because it's just like, you have this

1133
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,220
huge experience on the Wii U that looks beautiful.

1134
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,860
It plays smooth.

1135
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,340
It is so beautiful to look at and fun.

1136
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,860
I cannot go back and play it on the 3DS.

1137
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,380
That just felt like an appetizer for the main course.

1138
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:59,900
And just to think, if they had not made the 3DS version, we'd have the ice climbers.

1139
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Yeah.

1140
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,900
I don't know.

1141
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,300
And some will argue with me, well, the 3DS version serves its purpose.

1142
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,420
It has separate modes.

1143
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,060
It serves its purpose.

1144
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,500
You can play a portably.

1145
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,660
I get all that.

1146
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,780
That's all fine and good.

1147
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,660
Yay for you Smash Brothers fans.

1148
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,640
I'm glad you have a portable version.

1149
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,140
It's not for the more casual fans.

1150
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,140
It's not worth it.

1151
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,820
That's awesome that you have a portable version of your console game experience, or if you

1152
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,300
know you had made a more powerful handheld system, you might be able to stream it to

1153
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,300
that console.

1154
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,180
Like I don't know, the Vita does.

1155
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,220
Maybe it's for people who don't have Wii U's.

1156
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,220
Sure.

1157
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,220
Why not?

1158
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,220
Are you saying you?

1159
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,220
Pretty much.

1160
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,220
I'm their target.

1161
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,140
You've played the Wii U version.

1162
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,940
Are you like, I love Smash 3DS, or are you like, hmm, this is a subpar experience?

1163
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,020
Honestly, when we were playing on Friday, it didn't seem that different.

1164
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,300
I mean, like we played the new levels.

1165
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,540
That was fun, I guess, you know, and then the eight player Smash was just, it was a

1166
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,540
little cray.

1167
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,900
Like I couldn't see anything.

1168
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,900
Yeah.

1169
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,900
The eight player Smash is a little crazy.

1170
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,900
Level editor.

1171
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,900
Yeah.

1172
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
There's level.

1173
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,900
I didn't play around a lot with a level editor yet.

1174
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,180
I just haven't had the choice, but because there's so much in the game and I realized

1175
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,380
there's some things that like were in melee that weren't in this, like the whole like

1176
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,500
story modes and things, which kind of sucks because I did really like that in melee and

1177
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,980
I don't really care for the board game they put into this.

1178
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,700
It's not really as rewarding, but there's still like, like to say it's a huge detraction

1179
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
from the game.

1180
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,820
There's so much other shit in there.

1181
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:35,780
Like the home run challenges, the Mii battles, the classic mode where you fight the master

1182
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,940
hand at the end and all that and all these other, you know, meta games they have in it.

1183
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:45,620
You know, it's still a very rich experience, but I was perfectly content just playing the

1184
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,380
main Smash mode over and over and over again as we were doing on Friday night.

1185
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,380
I had a lot of fun.

1186
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,380
Right.

1187
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,380
Right.

1188
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,020
And that's why I think it's not, I'm not so sad that I don't have the Wii U version because

1189
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:59,260
it's like, you know, this is cool, but it's not like, I'm not sad that I don't have it

1190
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
or anything.

1191
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,020
So that's, well, that's, that's probably Nintendo wants you to be a little sad because they

1192
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,540
do want to sell more Wii U's.

1193
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,540
So sure.

1194
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,540
But I mean, it wasn't enough.

1195
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,540
I mean, I don't know.

1196
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,540
That's fair.

1197
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,220
All right, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1198
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,780
Act F says the 3DS version is great for what it is, but the Wii U version definitely blows

1199
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,260
it off the water.

1200
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,260
Uh, let's see.

1201
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,220
Black Wolf points out the 3DS can be used as a controller for the Wii U version and

1202
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,900
you need the 3DS game to do so.

1203
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,540
That part was awfully convenient.

1204
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:33,360
Well, that's at least one way to play the better version on the 3DS.

1205
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,780
But that actually did end up being very convenient because like all I have here are Wiimotes.

1206
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,900
You know, we have like the Wii U game pad is it, but I was like, Irene, Nathan, bring

1207
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,820
your 3DS's and then you guys have controllers and that actually worked out pretty well.

1208
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,820
Yeah.

1209
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,380
And I was already used to controlling with it.

1210
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,380
So it's perfect.

1211
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
Yeah.

1212
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,140
And Nathan was able to get his custom scheme or whatever he has that he does.

1213
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,660
You were telling me not to let him do that.

1214
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,660
And I did.

1215
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,660
And then he beat our ass.

1216
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,660
Yeah.

1217
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,660
Oh, well.

1218
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Told you.

1219
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,660
Uh, amiibo integration.

1220
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,080
Um, I did buy three that I bought my three amiibos.

1221
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,760
I have, uh, Mario, Peach and Samus, which good, good, good choices.

1222
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,560
Although I kind of wish I bought link kind of wish I bought link instead of Mario, but

1223
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
that's all right.

1224
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
Yeah.

1225
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,640
Um, I, the figures are well-crafted and I think the figures sit well on a display as

1226
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,400
for the way they're integrated into the games.

1227
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,400
Yeah.

1228
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,480
I kind of take it or leave it.

1229
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,080
Like if you haven't seen it yet, you, what you do, you take your amiibo and you can tap

1230
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,980
it to the Wii U game pad and it enters the game as basically a computer controlled character.

1231
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,760
But it's a special character that levels up the more you beat up on it and it learns from

1232
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,480
you the way you beat up on it.

1233
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,160
If you tend to block attacks, they'll learn to block attacks.

1234
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,520
If you tend to do more of X than Y, they'll do more of X than Y.

1235
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,160
So they start to take after you and they get a mind of their own and you can level them

1236
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,960
all the way up to level 50.

1237
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,320
Why you would do that, I'm not, that's the part I'm not understanding.

1238
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Why?

1239
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,240
Ultimately the goal of leveling them to 50, and I'm sure some of the Smashaholics out

1240
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,680
there will be like, well, you can do a mode where it's you and your amiibo versus a friend

1241
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,320
and your friend's amiibo.

1242
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,840
And you know, you could have the amiibos fight each other to have like an amiibo style tournament.

1243
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,660
And I'm kind of sitting here going, I, I think, I think you're stretching a little bit with

1244
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,200
those functionalities.

1245
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Those are a bit of a stretch from what the game is really about, which is beating up

1246
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,040
on your friends.

1247
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,920
But the figures are nice and I sort of go, okay, if they get you little perks in games,

1248
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,160
then that's kind of neat too.

1249
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,480
I get a little extra outfit in Mario Kart, all right, cool.

1250
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,360
I get some extra weapons in Hyrule Warriors, cute.

1251
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,680
You know, I like that they at least function in more than one game, but I really think

1252
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,540
if you're going to obsessively collect these amiibo, I hope you like the figures because

1253
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:55,800
what they're going to do for you in the game, I, you could get one amiibo and kind of get

1254
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,320
a good enough taste of what they're going to do in the various games.

1255
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
You know what I mean?

1256
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:04,480
So are, do they have any plans to make any amiibos-centric games where you need to have

1257
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,800
the amiibos to play?

1258
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,040
Wait for Pokemon Wii U, I'm sure.

1259
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,160
Yeah, probably.

1260
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,600
I'm sure that is coming.

1261
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,880
I just don't know what it is.

1262
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,080
I would be very curious.

1263
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,800
Here's something not a lot of people have been asking this question, but I'm going to,

1264
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,600
I'm going to ask it out here.

1265
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,600
What is the amiibo implementation going to look like in Splatoon?

1266
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,520
Because I could see that game really doing something with this, where you start to put

1267
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,360
the characters in Splatoon and maybe they are again doing some type of level up or something.

1268
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,480
I would like to see something, I don't know if Nintendo is ever going to build this, I'd

1269
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,600
like to see something where I level up my character in Mario, or excuse me, I level

1270
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,700
up my character in Smash, and now when I use that amiibo in Splatoon, because it's leveled

1271
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,740
up in Smash, it can do this.

1272
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,900
And something where the amiibos kind of become this personal achievement gallery, if that

1273
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,380
makes sense, and the more I've played these other games and leveled up in other games,

1274
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,740
the more it's going to do for me elsewhere.

1275
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,420
I would really love to see Nintendo to go down a path like that.

1276
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,500
Not going to hold my breath, but that would be my, you know, how could they make this

1277
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,540
even more exciting?

1278
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,820
Give me more of a reason to level my amiibos to 50.

1279
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,060
Right, I was actually just going to say that, because were you the one that was mentioning

1280
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,300
that if you get your amiibo to level 50, it's as strong as a level 9 CPU?

1281
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,300
I think stronger.

1282
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Stronger than a level 9.

1283
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:31,380
So I can see doing that, you know, but aside from that in other games, your amiibo is not

1284
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,300
going to really grant you any more power than other players, is it?

1285
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,100
It's just giving you extra perks, like fun, like you said, extra outfits and stuff like

1286
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,100
that.

1287
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,780
It's like a little custom character that, it's like a pet.

1288
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,080
It's a pet rock.

1289
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,320
It takes after some of your features, you know what I mean?

1290
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,000
And they're how much each?

1291
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,120
$12.

1292
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,320
And how many are they planning to release total?

1293
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,260
Don't quote me on this, but it looks like one for every character in Smash Brothers.

1294
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,800
That's the way it's going right now.

1295
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,200
So every character in Smash Brothers will have one.

1296
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,240
So do you think this is more of like a hardcore collector kind of a thing or do you think

1297
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,960
this is ever going to appeal to like the general market?

1298
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
I think it's both.

1299
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,600
I think it's a hardcore collector thing and it's the general market because mommy, mommy,

1300
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
I want the Mario.

1301
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Mommy, mommy, I want the peach.

1302
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,600
Mommy, mommy.

1303
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I think that's...

1304
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,200
Oh, you think the mommy, mommy stuffs, you know, are bad with, you know, I've been hearing

1305
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,200
all these stories of these.

1306
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
Well, and daddy, daddy too.

1307
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,880
Well, no, I've been hearing all these stories of like, these are sold out at all these stores

1308
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,880
and stuff.

1309
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,760
I'm like, it boggles my mind why?

1310
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,920
I mean, yes, I understand that it's Mario.

1311
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Cool.

1312
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Okay.

1313
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,920
It's Mario.

1314
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,160
But the functionality with the games that support it right now is kind of, eh, I mean,

1315
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,840
it's just, it's very, it's not like Skylanders or something where at least those characters

1316
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,840
can actually fucking play them.

1317
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,480
It's a unique experience where it's like, Ooh, AI character, who gives a shit?

1318
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,480
Did you read that fucking fan wank on a news site that I will not name, but it was a shapely

1319
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:06,120
article on why Disney should buy Nintendo.

1320
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,400
And it read like, like fucking fanfic that I was reading on this site because I'm like,

1321
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,520
Disney's never going to buy Nintendo and Nintendo's gonna never let themselves be bought by Disney.

1322
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,380
But anyway, I'm getting beside the point.

1323
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:22,520
The only thing in it that made sense was Disney would want Nintendo because Nintendo has strong

1324
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:31,640
characters that 20 and 30 year olds are very attached to, which, you know, Disney has a

1325
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,960
lot of characters that people are attached to as well, but some could argue that they

1326
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,120
target a different generation than Nintendo gets.

1327
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,240
Well, no, I mean, you're right.

1328
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,840
20 and 30 year olds are very strongly attached to it, but also children of this era.

1329
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Oh yeah.

1330
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
Absolutely.

1331
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,080
Because the 20 and 30 year olds pass them on to their kids.

1332
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
Exactly.

1333
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
Absolutely.

1334
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,080
So that was my long winded answer to your question was that, uh, it's the characters,

1335
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,520
the characters are so strong.

1336
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
It's the same.

1337
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,200
How do people want toys from the latest Disney or Pixar movie that they see that don't do

1338
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,360
anything but have a swinging arm, you know, or something like that?

1339
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
The arm swing?

1340
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,360
Sometimes.

1341
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
Depends.

1342
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Anyway.

1343
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
All right.

1344
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Uh, wow.

1345
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Sorry.

1346
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,080
I have talked a lot about my gaming, but it was just a lot to play.

1347
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,640
I didn't even get in a little big planet three.

1348
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,440
I played little big planet three.

1349
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,600
They have some new mechanics like the, uh, the gun that sucks and blows.

1350
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,720
Can I think of that scene from Wayne's world?

1351
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,800
She's gone from suck to blow.

1352
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
That's not from Wayne's world.

1353
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,080
That's from space ball.

1354
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,640
Oh, what's from space balls?

1355
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
Why did I know?

1356
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Uh, what was this haircut?

1357
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,400
Yeah, it certainly does suck or I don't know, whatever, whatever.

1358
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Anyway.

1359
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,280
So that whole thing.

1360
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
Yeah.

1361
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,520
The new guns and the new elements that they do, they have that and they have like the

1362
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,040
portal esque kind of gun that fires a ball and if you fire it into a certain shape, uh,

1363
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,720
it will port you there.

1364
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,080
And so, okay, that's all good, but what does this all end up being?

1365
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,800
This is stuff to put on the canvas for the level creators where the really strong content

1366
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,800
is going to come out.

1367
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,640
So I'm really excited to see what people develop with this.

1368
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,360
I'm enjoying little big planet so far, but holy shit, we're an hour into the show.

1369
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,280
We haven't even touched the news yet, so, uh, let me get to Irene quickly and your gaming

1370
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,800
week and anything you want to share with listeners tonight on what you've been playing.

1371
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,960
We already talked about it.

1372
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,280
Jackbox and Smash Brothers.

1373
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Okay.

1374
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,280
Yeah.

1375
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,280
There you go.

1376
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,280
Well, thank you.

1377
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,280
You're, you're giving up your segment essentially to help us save on time.

1378
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,800
I think we already talked about it, so.

1379
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
That's true.

1380
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
We did.

1381
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,800
All right.

1382
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Uh, let's see.

1383
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,800
Let's see.

1384
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,760
Uh, Alan Alchemy says it's sucking my will to live was the Wayne's World thing.

1385
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
That's it.

1386
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Sucking my will to live.

1387
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,760
That's it.

1388
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
All right.

1389
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,440
Um, let's get into, uh, some housekeeping real quick.

1390
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,200
Uh, if you missed the announcement last week, we will be doing our show on December 7th.

1391
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,640
That's in two weeks at a special time.

1392
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:57,280
That show will be broadcasting at noon Pacific time, three Eastern time, eight o'clock for

1393
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,160
those of you guys in the UK, uh, for what is that called UTC or whatever that is.

1394
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,640
Um, so we're doing that because Jamie and I have an event we want to attend, uh, personal

1395
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,320
later in the evening, but we thought it's a good, Oh, two for one shot because our overseas

1396
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,840
listeners sometimes say, when are you going to do a show that we can participate with

1397
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
and we can call into?

1398
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
So here's your chance.

1399
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,640
December 7th, that will be broadcast, uh, much earlier in the day.

1400
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,240
Um, but certainly I'm not saying only UK people can participate.

1401
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,240
Absolutely not.

1402
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,640
Uh, if you happen to be around at noon or three o'clock or whatever, then by all means

1403
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,500
listen and give us call and all that good stuff.

1404
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,560
So we will be doing that, uh, in a couple of weeks or if you're not, it'll be rebroadcast

1405
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,560
of the regular time.

1406
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,560
That's right.

1407
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,040
It'll be rebroadcast to the regular time, right after Bobby black Wolf.

1408
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,960
So however, however you or, and it will be on the podcast feed for those of you guys

1409
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,440
that are like, I don't do live shows.

1410
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,040
I don't, I don't do live pod.

1411
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,600
I need you on Monday to get me through workday, then we'll be there for you too.

1412
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,600
All right.

1413
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,480
Uh, let's get into some news already.

1414
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,480
Holy moly.

1415
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,480
Busy, busy week.

1416
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,480
Loki.

1417
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,480
Yes.

1418
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,640
So busy week also for, um, Activision and blizzard world of Warcraft, um, has been having

1419
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,080
a little bit of issues, especially right after the release of warlords of Draenor.

1420
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,520
They had people DDOS in their servers.

1421
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,760
They had, you know, just Q problems.

1422
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,720
So they finally decided, Hey, you know what, we're going to address this.

1423
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,640
Um, you know, basically saying, you know, the quality of the content does not excuse

1424
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,440
the subpar launch experience we delivered.

1425
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,960
And I apologize for that.

1426
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,020
And that's J Allen Brack, the executive producer of world of Warcraft.

1427
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,880
And basically saying, you know what, uh, we're making things better.

1428
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:38,040
We're working on reducing, you know, the cues and the compensate people for their troubles.

1429
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,760
We're going to give you a five days a game time.

1430
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,160
So that's pretty nice.

1431
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:49,760
At least they're fixing that and, uh, apparently doing pretty well, especially, um, back up

1432
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,320
to 10 million subscribers after the launch of the newest expansion.

1433
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,520
So, so how about that?

1434
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,700
3.3 million copies day one.

1435
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,120
So they're back up to 10 million.

1436
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,880
They were down to like seven, four, seven, six somewhere I heard was the last number.

1437
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,860
And now they're up to 10 million.

1438
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,440
So that whole peer pressure thing we talked about earlier and the feeling of it's, it's

1439
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,440
working a lot.

1440
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,800
I'd be curious though, you know, I granted there are 10 million right now, but how quickly

1441
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,600
are they going to get through all that content and just, you know, is it going to be three

1442
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,820
months from now that they're back down to, you know, they're going to see that drop again?

1443
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,120
I think that's a very fair question to ask because Blizzard has really said nothing about

1444
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,760
patches and what else is to be looking forward to.

1445
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,720
I think they're going to save a lot of that this time for just when people are starting

1446
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,000
to feel burned out a little bit and they're obviously they're slowly rolling out content.

1447
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,160
That's what they do now.

1448
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,720
Like the raid isn't out yet.

1449
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,860
The raid launches, I think next week, don't quote me on these dates, but I think the raid

1450
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:52,240
launches next week for the normal raid and then the mythic, which is their new heroic

1451
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,200
or however it all breaks down, that is out in two weeks and the LFR happens then too,

1452
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,820
but you can only do one part of the raid in LFR.

1453
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,760
The rest of LFR opens up over the course of like four more weeks or something like that,

1454
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,640
which it makes sense the way they're doing it.

1455
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,000
I can't really fault them for the way they're slowly rolling out.

1456
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And I think it does take a lot of that pressure off.

1457
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,240
Like I got to level up to on her tonight.

1458
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,000
I've got to do it tonight so I can raid with the people or I'm going to get left out in

1459
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the cold.

1460
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Right.

1461
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Like thankfully they don't do that anymore.

1462
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,080
Uh, so I'm okay with that.

1463
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:26,640
But yeah, I mean, Loki, what is it going to look like in three months once a lot of people

1464
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,640
have gone through the raid?

1465
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,640
I don't know.

1466
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,640
Well, and also the fact that a lot of the time, um, that was, you know, cause they have

1467
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,600
that token to level you up.

1468
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,120
Remember to, I forget what it was now.

1469
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,480
The boost to 60 or the boost to 90, excuse me, boost to 90 or something.

1470
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,740
So that's going to take a lot of the grinding time out.

1471
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,560
So it's going to kind of quickly, you know, it's going to make the game go a little bit

1472
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
quicker for you.

1473
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,920
So I don't know if that's, you know, a great thing.

1474
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,560
So many of those people have so many alts already at 90 because of Pandaria's drought.

1475
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,040
I think they're probably not as worried about it.

1476
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,580
I think it's interesting though that out of 10 million subscribers, only 3.3 million bought

1477
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,840
the expansion.

1478
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,960
But one thing to consider that number is from the first 24 hours or something like that.

1479
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,360
And it doesn't include China, which you probably can figure half those subscribers in the 10

1480
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,000
million are China, Asia, and other regions that don't have that expansion yet.

1481
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,360
So 3.3 out of 5 million makes a lot more sense because I know not everybody jumps on board

1482
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
with the expansion.

1483
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,020
And also not everyone's going to jump aboard the first 24 hours and people got to wait

1484
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,020
for paychecks.

1485
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,020
Exactly, exactly.

1486
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,020
So that makes a lot more sense.

1487
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,020
And you consider that.

1488
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,540
But when I first heard there's numbers, I was like, why did only a third of the players

1489
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,540
buy the expansion?

1490
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,800
Oh, it didn't come out in China at the same time.

1491
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Got it.

1492
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:43,840
So yeah, wow, it looks like the expansion is doing very well for them.

1493
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,400
If you really want to push me over the edge, Blizzard, because here I am looking, all my

1494
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,940
friends are playing, wow, maybe I should play some wow.

1495
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,880
Tell me what the patches are going to look like and what there is to look forward to

1496
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,240
and what my money's really going to end up buying.

1497
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,220
Because if you can kind of get that one, I don't know what it is that would be that key

1498
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,600
thing that would bring me back.

1499
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,560
Maybe that level syncing I've always talked about.

1500
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,640
I don't know why they don't do it.

1501
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,280
Or maybe more five man dungeons will get me really excited.

1502
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,760
That's probably going to send me over the edge and I'll do it.

1503
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,640
I'll go back to wow.

1504
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,760
I don't know what exactly is happening with Warlords of Draenor.

1505
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,400
I haven't watched any trailers.

1506
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,880
I haven't really heard anybody talk about it to me because I'm not interested in wow.

1507
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,320
But have they talked about some of the ways that this expansion is going to be different

1508
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,600
from the last couple of expansions that they've had?

1509
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,600
Last few?

1510
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:37,720
They've been pushing like the garrisons, which is, you know, the new, it's their new profession

1511
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:43,540
basically, but they don't frame it as a profession, but you know, the garrisons and it's a return.

1512
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,000
It's let's do the time warp again, because they're going back to Burning Crusade to fix

1513
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,800
a timeline or something like that.

1514
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:55,280
So it's, you know, a whole time travel thing that they're doing.

1515
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,200
And then they simply took a lot of talents out is my understanding.

1516
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,980
Now Blizzard had to simplify their own MMO to make it more accessible.

1517
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,980
But you know what?

1518
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,980
That's good.

1519
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,040
They were just getting too disparate with their stuff.

1520
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,200
And that's kind of what I mean is not in terms of what they're adding, but like how they're

1521
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:18,680
making the gameplay experience different from what were very mediocre expansions.

1522
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,120
And they did the squish, the item squish.

1523
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,120
Yeah.

1524
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,120
That happened.

1525
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,640
So now, you know, the math and all that isn't so obscene with how much stats everything

1526
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,280
was.

1527
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,880
But I haven't heard a lot about PvP.

1528
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,300
I didn't hear about any new Battlegrounds or anything like that.

1529
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,040
But one thing Pandaria did have like two or three new Battlegrounds.

1530
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,760
There's a lot of Battlegrounds in WoW.

1531
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,100
I kind of miss them.

1532
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:45,680
Like I actually really enjoyed the PvP game in WoW, which is weird because I don't usually

1533
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,260
super get into PvP, but some of those Battlegrounds are really fun.

1534
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:53,680
Like I know you hated it, but I loved Isle of Conquest, which is a lot of fun.

1535
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,240
That new one they put in really wasn't bad.

1536
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
I don't remember the name of it.

1537
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,440
It was the very last one they did.

1538
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,960
The Goblin Mines or something.

1539
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,240
No, there was a Goblin Mine.

1540
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,240
That was one.

1541
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,240
Then there was like another one.

1542
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,240
Anyway.

1543
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
Sorry.

1544
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,240
It's been a while.

1545
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,440
But yeah, there's a lot of fun PvP in there.

1546
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,440
Right.

1547
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,440
I mean, they don't need to change anything really with their Battlegrounds.

1548
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,440
I feel like.

1549
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,360
I mean, they can stop making new ones.

1550
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,080
I mean, the people that like for me, when I was PvPing, I did Gulch all the time.

1551
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,400
I sometimes did Basin.

1552
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,640
I don't need them to reinvent the wheel for me.

1553
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,400
I'm playing them because I like it how it is.

1554
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,120
And it doesn't get old for me because it's playing against other people that's making

1555
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,200
it new every time.

1556
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,480
So I don't know.

1557
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
Yeah.

1558
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,400
And like as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, it really doesn't have a strong PvP game right

1559
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
now.

1560
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,640
They have like one arena and they have something called Cartno Flats or Frontlines, which is

1561
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,960
sort of Arathi Basin, sort of.

1562
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:48,520
But the weird twist on Final Fantasy 14 is that it's three factions, not two.

1563
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,680
So it's everything is now is like 3v3 or whatever you call it.

1564
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,680
Right.

1565
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,680
Kind of puts a new twist on it.

1566
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,680
Interesting.

1567
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,680
Very interesting.

1568
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,480
So, I mean, a lot of the PvPers are just they're playing the MOBAs now, so they don't really

1569
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,360
need that from WoW.

1570
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,400
Rama in our chat is asking, wait, when did this become WoW Lounge Radio?

1571
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,080
Hey, you know what?

1572
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,040
Because 10 million people are playing World of Warcraft right now.

1573
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,040
It's kind of big news.

1574
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,040
What happens when you miss an episode of...

1575
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Take an episode of Warhouse off.

1576
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,040
All right.

1577
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,040
All right.

1578
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,040
Look, you want to hear consoles?

1579
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,040
I'll tell you consoles.

1580
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,040
Here's the thing.

1581
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,240
Your Sony information is safe.

1582
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,240
That's the news.

1583
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:32,080
There was news out there that apparently about 2,000 PlayStation Network logins had been

1584
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
hacked.

1585
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,360
But Sony has responded saying, we've investigated the claims that our network was breached and

1586
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,560
have found no evidence that there was any intrusion into our network.

1587
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,440
Unfortunately, Internet fraud, including phishing and password matching, are realities that

1588
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,180
consumers and online networks face on a regular basis.

1589
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,280
We take these reports very seriously and continue to monitor our network closely.

1590
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,640
Apparently, a group did take responsibility finally for, speaking of World of Warcraft,

1591
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,160
the denial of service attacks that were happening on Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV were also

1592
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,480
claiming to have obtained this information.

1593
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,160
But Sony saying there is no...

1594
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,160
Move along.

1595
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,160
Nothing to see here.

1596
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,280
That's what Sony is saying.

1597
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,160
I still think this is just a good reminder.

1598
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,520
Use a different password on these technical sites than you would use in other places.

1599
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:24,880
Because this Sony, Blizzard, Square Enix now, apparently, Microsoft, all of them are

1600
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
targets.

1601
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,720
And two-step authentication when you can.

1602
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,940
When you can have two-step authentication, absolutely.

1603
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:33,400
Your email is a must.

1604
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,160
Because if somebody gets control of your email, that's it.

1605
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,160
You're done.

1606
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,400
They can get anything else.

1607
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,080
Your banking, whatever else.

1608
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,320
Get two-step authentication on your email if nothing else.

1609
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,560
So just a friendly little reminder from us here at Orange Launch Radio, because we don't

1610
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,320
want dickbags to steal your information.

1611
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,040
Your information is important to us.

1612
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Thanks, Rob.

1613
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,040
You're welcome.

1614
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
Anytime.

1615
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,040
That's what we're here.

1616
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,040
We're your friends.

1617
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,040
Loki.

1618
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,040
So this is pretty sweet.

1619
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,040
There's a new Kickstarter.

1620
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,040
Yeah, I know.

1621
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,040
Another Kickstarter for another game.

1622
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,920
But this is awesome because it's Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick.

1623
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,860
They're doing a brand new Maniac Mansion-style adventure game, and it looks straight up like

1624
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,860
Maniac Mansion.

1625
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,120
I mean, the old-school LucasArts point-and-click adventure game.

1626
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:23,400
It's called Thimbleweed Park, and it's Brainiac Branchin'.

1627
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,700
It looks awesome.

1628
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,160
So go check it out.

1629
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,600
They're going to pretty much hit their funding.

1630
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:36,300
They're already at $355,000 of their $375,000 goal, and they have 24 days to go, so there's

1631
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,600
pretty much no chance that they're not going to.

1632
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
It's going to happen.

1633
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
Interesting.

1634
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,640
People really longing for those 2D adventure games.

1635
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,400
I remember at some point people tried to say that genre was dead, and then Telltale

1636
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:52,600
puts out all these award-winning games, and fans are doing these 2D.

1637
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,760
This genre is not dead.

1638
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,400
People still love this stuff.

1639
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,780
Just the art style and everything looks just like...

1640
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:03,920
It's straight up out of the 90s.

1641
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,600
They even have a little animated image here.

1642
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:15,120
It looks like they'll use balloon animal with corpse.

1643
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,760
You can try all those things, and it's awesome.

1644
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,600
And who wouldn't try to use a balloon animal with a corpse, really?

1645
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,920
This is getting into awkward time.

1646
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,920
It's pretty awesome, and some of the rewards.

1647
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,520
Let's see here what they're giving away.

1648
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,720
$20 gets you the game.

1649
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,680
If you want to spend more than $20, it looks like $30, or $25.

1650
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:41,560
$25 is the I-pirated maniac mansion in Monkey Island when I was a kid, and I feel bad.

1651
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,320
This reward tier instantly absolves you of all guilt, including the theming part game.

1652
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,800
That's kind of funny.

1653
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,200
Subsequent tiers also include guilt absolution.

1654
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,360
That's awesome.

1655
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,360
That's awesome.

1656
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,280
Looking at our chat, Dungeon Buster says, CinnaWear is also doing a Kickstarter for

1657
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,400
an HD version of Rocket Ranger with new gameplay bits.

1658
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,840
Just tell me when they start Kickstarting a new Legend of Chirandia, all right?

1659
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,120
Seriously, that would be awesome.

1660
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,160
Game Guru says, donate to this game or the hamster gets microwaved.

1661
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,480
That was my favorite part.

1662
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
Yep.

1663
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,480
Oh boy.

1664
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
That's awesome.

1665
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,480
That's a dark place.

1666
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,480
Let's see.

1667
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:25,200
SSJ100Matt says, I think people just desire the old days where that quote, not the greatest

1668
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,160
game of all time, Super Metroid ruled.

1669
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,680
Why did you put that in quotes that it's not the greatest game of all time?

1670
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,600
Because it is the greatest game of all time.

1671
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,960
Who would dare argue with that sound logic?

1672
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:44,400
It's because games like Maniac Mansion and Secret of Monkey Island and stuff are just

1673
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
timeless.

1674
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,120
They're just greatly written games.

1675
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:52,760
And also, even though that one bullet point was supposed to be funny about the piracy,

1676
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,280
it really unveiled it there.

1677
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Absolve yourself of the guilt from being a kid.

1678
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,920
Hey, kid.

1679
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,200
Now that you have a job to make money, give me your money.

1680
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Right.

1681
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
Right.

1682
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
I mean, that's a big part of it.

1683
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,200
It's stuff we remember.

1684
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,080
Hey, back in those days, it was difficult to pirate games.

1685
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,200
You had to rip apart those disks.

1686
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,040
And I'm not talking about the actual floppy disks.

1687
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,840
I'm talking about the code disks that you had to turn and match up the phrases in order

1688
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,320
to photocopy this.

1689
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,840
Or I had to call my friend and be like, all right, get out the box.

1690
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
Turn to page 24.

1691
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
All right.

1692
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,600
What's the third word in the second paragraph?

1693
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,080
You know what we're talking about, though?

1694
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
Come on.

1695
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
I do.

1696
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
I do.

1697
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
That's why I say it.

1698
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,040
Or one of my favorites was covert action, where it was like, you had the page of the

1699
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,080
mugshots and you had to be like, which one is this operative?

1700
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,800
And if you get it wrong, the game would be like super hard.

1701
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,000
You can do anything in it and make good times with copy protection.

1702
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Good times.

1703
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Do you have any copy protection memories?

1704
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
No.

1705
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,720
Moving right along.

1706
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,720
Space Quest 4, I remember.

1707
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,440
And because I actually did buy the game and I had the manual and sometimes I'd still get

1708
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,880
it wrong.

1709
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,560
Mine was Leisure Suit Larry, the remake that they did, because you had to answer trivia

1710
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,160
questions to get into the game.

1711
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,160
And they were quite...

1712
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,640
It wasn't really copy protection, but it was making sure you were of age.

1713
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,040
And so it would ask you questions that only somebody in their 20s or 30s know the answers

1714
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
to.

1715
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
But we got them all right.

1716
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,040
We'd be like 13.

1717
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,080
We get them all right.

1718
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,320
It's like, yeah, we're going to see some pixelated titties.

1719
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,640
Why were you excited?

1720
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,520
I don't know, because everybody likes titties.

1721
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,520
Yeah, pixel tits.

1722
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,480
That'll be the sequel.

1723
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:44,800
At the top of part B, by the way, I've got to ask you about last week's show and this

1724
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,600
whole pixel shit phenomenon, but we'll save that for later.

1725
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:53,320
Anyway, let's get into another story, and this one is about the game Evolve, which a

1726
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,040
lot of people are looking forward to.

1727
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,360
This is that whole four versus one game.

1728
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,960
Lots of people looking forward to this.

1729
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:05,360
And some folks are going to be very happy to hear that DLC maps in Evolve, they will

1730
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,560
be available for free.

1731
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,640
And this is to ensure that you don't have one person who doesn't have the maps.

1732
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,320
They're not able to play multiplayer matches with other people or getting kicked out of

1733
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,600
public rooms because they don't have a certain map.

1734
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,660
So they just decided, you know what, we're going to make the maps free.

1735
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,000
So that's always nice to hear about free DLC.

1736
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,680
But just so you know, Evolve will have some other pay DLC.

1737
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,760
For example, you're going to have characters and monsters that are pay DLC.

1738
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,380
But the good news is, even if you didn't buy them, if your friend did, you'll be able to

1739
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,780
play against them.

1740
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
And that's alright.

1741
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:45,340
I mean, we were playing Mario Kart 8, I didn't even talk about it during the game, we were

1742
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,620
playing Mario Kart 8 with Extrovert online, right?

1743
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,020
He has not bought the DLC pack.

1744
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:55,900
We were able to still pick Tanooki, Mario, and Zelda, and Link from Zelda, and he was

1745
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,460
able to see them in the race.

1746
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,100
We couldn't do the new tracks, but we could do the new characters.

1747
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,940
So it's kind of like something similar with that.

1748
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,940
So, yeah.

1749
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,940
Alright.

1750
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,940
Good times.

1751
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,940
Good times.

1752
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,540
So that is Evolve and DLC.

1753
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,460
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at bognetwork.com,

1754
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,940
use the passphrase, pumpkin.

1755
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,780
Alright, we are going to now travel around the world and check out some release dates

1756
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:24,740
and see what is coming to a gaming store near you.

1757
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:28,900
Ah, well after last week, you would think that there would be a ton.

1758
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,900
But no.

1759
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,860
Actually, it's died down to nothing again.

1760
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,340
We're back in the drought, thankfully.

1761
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,660
So this week, we have Akiba's trip undead and undressed for PlayStation 4, which I'm

1762
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,900
actually thinking about picking up, because, I don't know, I need more PlayStation 4 games.

1763
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,140
Maybe I should get Far Cry instead.

1764
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:53,820
Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth on 3DS, and that's literally it.

1765
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,820
Just those two games.

1766
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,460
I guess it's slowing down a little bit now.

1767
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,460
Quite a bit, yeah.

1768
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,540
Once we get into December, it's going to be dead.

1769
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,540
Yeah.

1770
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,620
Geometry Wars is the big thing I'm looking forward to this week, but that's all online.

1771
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,620
Yeah.

1772
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,620
Right.

1773
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,660
Which, if we go over to Europe, I'll do this out of order here a little bit.

1774
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,280
We'll go to Europe and look at the releases there.

1775
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,740
In fact, Geometry Wars is out this week on the 26th on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox

1776
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,540
360, and PlayStation 3.

1777
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:22,420
LittleBigPlanet gets its release overseas in the UK, also on the 26th of November.

1778
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:27,940
On the 27th of November, Raven's Cry hits the Mac and PC platforms, and the delayed

1779
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:34,580
for Europe, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Pokemon Omega Ruby make their way on the 28th of November.

1780
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:39,660
That was the slap on the hand to the entire country for leaking X and Y earlier.

1781
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,220
Remember that?

1782
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:46,540
X and Y got leaked early in Europe, and it was a Europe store that had put it, so Nintendo

1783
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,860
punished the whole country by putting it out a week later there.

1784
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:52,940
So that'll teach you to leak a game early.

1785
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,820
Do not fuck with them, man.

1786
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:56,820
They're a force to be reckoned with.

1787
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:00,420
I know a lot of players overseas eagerly awaiting that.

1788
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,300
Let's talk about Japan.

1789
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,880
Dragon Age Inquisition gets its Japanese release on the PlayStation 4.

1790
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,200
I don't know if that's localized or if that's with, like, subtitles or something.

1791
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
It doesn't really say.

1792
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,200
I would imagine this is a subtitled version, but it is available for the PlayStation 4

1793
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,600
in regular and deluxe edition on November 27th.

1794
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,320
Simply Series G4U Volume 1, the Mahjong, is also out on November 27th, because I know

1795
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,160
y'all love Mahjong.

1796
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,520
Little Big Planet 3, oops, sorry, that is somehow a Europe date snuck its way on my

1797
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,640
list there.

1798
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:37,040
But NBA 2K15 is something you can check out in Japan also on November 27th.

1799
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,380
Many of those same games on the Xbox One this week, including Dragon Age Inquisition

1800
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,160
and NBA 2K15.

1801
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,820
Microsoft Xbox One's edition comes out on a disc version in Japan this week.

1802
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:52,020
There's also some new game pads, some black and blue Hori pads if you want to check those

1803
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,320
out in Japan.

1804
01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:00,200
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard HD Remaster, which of course is Resident Evil,

1805
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,000
that is releasing this week.

1806
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,160
There's also a collector's package and something called an eCapcom Complete Edition.

1807
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,320
Dragon Age Inquisition also on the PlayStation 3.

1808
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,160
I had no idea that Inquisition was also on last generation's consoles.

1809
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,800
That blew me away.

1810
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:21,120
If it's buggy on the new ones, I can only imagine what the old ones look like, sorry.

1811
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,800
Buyer beware.

1812
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:30,740
Let's see, on the Xbox 360, Dragon Age Inquisition, as well as Sakura Flamingo Archives.

1813
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:35,240
Your guess is as good as mine as to what that's on, like Flamingo Festival, I don't know.

1814
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:42,900
On the Wii U this week, Gotouchi Setsudo, Gotouchi Chara no Nihon Zenkoku no Tabi comes

1815
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:49,040
out this week, which is, I'm trying to see if this is a series I recognize.

1816
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:55,640
This looks like a Mario Party-esque kind of game, but these are not characters I recognize,

1817
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,960
so it might be tied into like a Japanese TV show or something like that.

1818
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,720
Oh, they have a little trailer, I did not realize that.

1819
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Let's take a look.

1820
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,720
Yeah, it's...

1821
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:16,440
It's always better when you yell it, that's right.

1822
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,040
There's like trains in Japan.

1823
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:24,360
Yeah, it's Mario Party, that's what it is basically.

1824
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:29,400
All right, so that is what you have to look forward to on the Wii U this week.

1825
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,000
So there you go with the releases.

1826
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,640
We're going to get into a few more stories here in the classic game of the week, but

1827
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,240
I thought I would say hello to, just walked into the studio here.

1828
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,640
Hello Jonas, welcome back.

1829
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,640
Hello.

1830
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,640
You're here again.

1831
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,200
I'm going to start charging, I'm just kidding.

1832
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
How you doing?

1833
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,480
I actually did fine, sorry, I came in a little later than expected.

1834
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,640
That's fine, it happens.

1835
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,040
Big game release week, right?

1836
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,040
Oh yeah, that would be busy.

1837
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,920
So I'm thinking you've probably had a chance to check out Super Smash Brothers on the Wii

1838
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,920
U?

1839
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,920
Yep.

1840
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,920
What'd you think?

1841
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,480
So far so good, I mean, I like it so far.

1842
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,360
Are you getting excited about implementing this at anime conventions, because, you know,

1843
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
for those that...

1844
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,600
That's pretty much my whole email bucket.

1845
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Oh really?

1846
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,600
Yes.

1847
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,720
So when you check the emails for the teabaggers, the big anime game room, when's the Smash

1848
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,120
Tournament?

1849
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,920
They're asking about that.

1850
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,360
It's still to be announced, we'll probably announce it in a week or two, when we get

1851
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,560
all the schedules finalized for SacAnime.

1852
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,640
Have you played around with the, oh that's right, because SacAnime is, what, the first

1853
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,640
weekend of January, right?

1854
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,080
January 2nd to the 4th.

1855
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,080
Wow.

1856
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,080
Oh my gosh.

1857
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,080
No time after the holidays.

1858
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,080
No time.

1859
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,200
You're gonna hit the ground running, it's time for an anime con.

1860
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,200
Amiibos.

1861
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,280
Have you had a chance to play around with that at all?

1862
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,200
I haven't had the time to test out Amiibos, unfortunately.

1863
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,200
Yeah?

1864
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:49,040
Well you know, like, people can level up characters that learn their own stuff.

1865
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,840
So my question is, are you gonna have a contest where it's just Amiibo versus Amiibo?

1866
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
That would be pretty cool.

1867
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,400
That might be kinda interesting.

1868
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,040
Amiibo versus Amiibo.

1869
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,800
Right now we're thinking about it, but we wanna test the waters first.

1870
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Okay.

1871
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,000
Because we don't wanna overwhelm, like let's say, for instance, oh we're gonna throw an

1872
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,480
Amiibo contest, and guess what, 128 people show up and you know how long that will take.

1873
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,720
Yeah, that's true, that's a good point.

1874
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,040
We wanna play a little safer.

1875
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,920
8 player smash, if that's the case.

1876
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,920
8 player smash.

1877
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,120
You better be here 5 minutes before your timer, you're out, buddy.

1878
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,840
And from what I've heard, you might as well get those 4 player adapters, or at least two

1879
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,800
of them, if you want 8 players as soon as possible, because those prices are gonna skyrocket.

1880
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,720
If you have not already bought the GameCube adapters, you better be prepared to put out

1881
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,980
on eBay.

1882
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,980
To buy one.

1883
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:34,980
Or just put out.

1884
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,880
Or just put out, because they're gone.

1885
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,960
They are gone.

1886
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,040
Unless Nintendo, kind and benevolent, does a reprinting.

1887
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,520
Oh no, they'll do a reprinting.

1888
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,120
For the adapter that works with one fucking game.

1889
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,260
Oh no, they'll do a reprinting of course.

1890
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,800
And guess who we'll be exclusive to.

1891
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,800
Don't you dare.

1892
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,080
Bite your tongue.

1893
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,000
Just in time for GameCube games coming to Virtual Console.

1894
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
That would be-

1895
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That would triple the cost too, by the way.

1896
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
That would be, yeah, that would be why.

1897
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,120
Then they'll release a bundle where it's like, you get this, and a code to get Super Mario

1898
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,120
Sunshine.

1899
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,120
Adapter, get.

1900
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:16,280
But, I think those adapters are not like 100 bucks, it went from like 20 dollars to 100.

1901
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,280
It's crazy.

1902
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,280
Yeah.

1903
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,560
Please don't, please don't pay those prices on eBay, you don't need a GameCube controller

1904
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,560
that bad.

1905
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,560
You do not.

1906
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,600
If you can't fucking play Smash with the fucking giant control, you know what, then maybe you're

1907
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,600
just bad at Smash.

1908
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Like, I'm just gonna say it.

1909
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600
I'm just gonna say it.

1910
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,400
If you're that reliant on a GameCube controller, maybe your skills aren't that good.

1911
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
I'm sorry.

1912
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,400
I'm sorry.

1913
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,400
Come at me.

1914
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,800
Come at me.

1915
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,640
And also, if you really, if you don't want to spend 100 bucks, you have to find the places

1916
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,920
that actually still have it.

1917
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,920
Yeah.

1918
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,920
Which you won't.

1919
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,920
Good luck with that.

1920
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,920
Yeah, exactly.

1921
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,920
You won't.

1922
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,920
Alright.

1923
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,480
Of course, of course, Pokemon's also taking my time too, unfortunately.

1924
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:58,520
Alright, ST-100 Matt saying, don't say it, Loki.

1925
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,520
Don't say it.

1926
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
Do not.

1927
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,520
Don't you dare.

1928
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,960
Alright, Jonas, we'll be checking in with you again as we move on with the show here,

1929
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,200
and feel free to chime in if you have anything to say on the news as we move on with some

1930
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,200
more news.

1931
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,200
Loki.

1932
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:15,360
Yes, because it wouldn't be the GameCube without an evil G in there.

1933
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,360
Alright, anyways.

1934
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,200
So, let's talk about the Game Wars, because hey, that's right around the corner, isn't

1935
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,200
it?

1936
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,600
Remember the whole independent game?

1937
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,240
Well, it's not on Spike anymore, but there's a surprise for having an awards ceremony next

1938
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,240
month.

1939
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:36,320
Yes, and they have nominees from each category, and here's the full list, so we'll just go

1940
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,400
over some brief ones here.

1941
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,120
Best online experience.

1942
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:46,280
Call of Duty, Dark Souls 2, Destiny, Hearthstone, or Titanfall.

1943
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,000
Hearthstone's going to be a tough one, considering how the launch was.

1944
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But whatever.

1945
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,360
You're thinking World of Warcraft.

1946
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,360
Hearthstone's fine.

1947
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,360
Hearthstone doesn't have any bugs.

1948
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1949
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,360
Yes, you're right.

1950
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,360
I'm thinking World of Warcraft.

1951
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,360
Yeah, Hearthstone's fine.

1952
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,360
Best family game.

1953
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:04,680
Disney Infinity 2.0, Fantasia, Mario Kart 8, Skylanders, or Tomodachi Life.

1954
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,520
I think Mario Kart 8's got that in the bag.

1955
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,080
Best sports slash racing game, FIFA 15, Forza Horizon 2, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart 8 again,

1956
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
NBA 2K15, and Trials Fusion.

1957
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,560
Get to the big stuff.

1958
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,200
No one cares about these piddly categories.

1959
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,720
All right, let's see here.

1960
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,720
Game of the Year.

1961
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
There we go.

1962
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:31,440
Bayonetta 2, Dark Souls 2, Dragon Age Inquisition, Hearthstone, or Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor.

1963
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,400
That's kind of a weird culmination, I have to say.

1964
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,720
And of course, the entire internet piping up on where's this?

1965
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,380
Where's Smash Brothers?

1966
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,280
Where's Shovel Knight?

1967
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,400
Nobody's happy with this final result.

1968
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,800
But I think it does beg a good question.

1969
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,180
How did they come up with this list?

1970
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,600
And there's a jury or something, right?

1971
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,760
That's all these random men, because I don't think there was a single woman on it.

1972
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,480
There's all these men, maybe one.

1973
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,440
Is there ever a one on these panels?

1974
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,440
Good question.

1975
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,840
But anyway, on the jury.

1976
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:12,720
And then there also was a page that showed all the, I don't know if they were sponsors

1977
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,720
or partners or something like that.

1978
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,520
Like Ubisoft's one of them.

1979
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,760
And so the one that struck me as really interesting, do you have the nominees for Studio of the

1980
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,760
Year?

1981
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,520
I'm sorry, I have to say something on this.

1982
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,480
Is it Developer of the Year?

1983
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,720
Yeah, Developer of the Year.

1984
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,240
Blizzard Entertainment, Monolith.

1985
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,800
Okay, let's stop and go over each one as we go.

1986
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:40,000
So Blizzard Entertainment, which obviously the behemoth of Hearthstone, Heroes of the

1987
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,400
Storm doing great for them, World of Warcraft, everybody's playing WoW games.

1988
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:49,280
Maybe not so great with the launch, but they're having a good year otherwise.

1989
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,120
Monolith Productions.

1990
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:58,040
Monolith Productions, they made, what am I thinking?

1991
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,640
They do Wii games, right?

1992
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:04,180
Didn't they do Xenoblade, but Xenoblade wasn't this year.

1993
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,120
That's why I'm like, wait a minute, that can't be the game they were nominated for.

1994
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,840
What's the big game that they did this year?

1995
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,840
They didn't do Bayonetta.

1996
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,920
I don't know.

1997
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,920
Nintendo.

1998
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,840
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1999
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,000
No, no, no, somebody's got to answer this question.

2000
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,400
Why is Monolith on the list?

2001
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,160
Nobody knows.

2002
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,960
I guess all the hype for Xenoblade for next year.

2003
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,280
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2004
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,160
No, there's Monolith and there's Monolith Soft.

2005
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,160
And we're thinking Monolith Soft, right?

2006
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,680
No, this is Monolith Productions.

2007
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,680
That's why.

2008
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,680
Monolith Productions.

2009
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,680
Okay, that's why.

2010
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,680
Because, okay.

2011
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,240
I'm like, what the hell did they do?

2012
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,680
Okay, Monolith Productions did Shadows of Mordor.

2013
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,680
So that's why they're on the list.

2014
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,680
Okay.

2015
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,680
Nintendo.

2016
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,560
Okay, which, you know, Nintendo did Mario Kart and Nintendo games.

2017
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,400
Telltale games.

2018
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:01,400
Which I was like, wait a minute, Tales from the Borderlands isn't out yet, but the Fable

2019
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,040
game, Wolf Among Us has been very well received.

2020
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,120
So I can see that.

2021
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,800
In Ubisoft Montreal.

2022
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,800
And they're one of the sponsors?

2023
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,800
Hold on.

2024
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,800
Hold on.

2025
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:19,800
Not only is Ubisoft one of the sponsors, what games did Ubisoft make this year, specifically

2026
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,800
Assassin's Creed Unity?

2027
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,280
Assassin's Creed Unity.

2028
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,960
Which now, to be fair, I talked earlier in the show about how, wait a minute, wait a

2029
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,960
minute.

2030
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,960
If we're going to razz Assassin's Creed Unity, we got to do a little razzing on Dragon Age

2031
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:40,800
Inquisition as well, but still, the studio that was infamous this year for a comment

2032
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,760
about what they can and they can't render, you know, that whole thing, I'm just, I'm

2033
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:50,760
very surprised that they're on the list when, you know, maybe, I don't, maybe Yacht Club

2034
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:57,560
Games who made Shovel Knight, who's basically kind of, you know, the Kickstarter phenomenon,

2035
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:00,280
they kind of personify, I don't, maybe would be.

2036
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,520
They also made Far Cry 4, but then again, they also made Watch Dogs, so.

2037
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:10,520
Oh, oh, oh, the studio that had the E3 footage that didn't match the final game.

2038
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,320
I'm not sure if that's, I don't think that studio did all three of those games.

2039
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,600
I think that they're just kind of lumping all this stuff together, because it wasn't

2040
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,680
all Ubisoft, Ubisoft Montreal was in every fucking game that came out from Ubisoft this

2041
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,680
year.

2042
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,680
There's no way that that was the case.

2043
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:33,400
I just, unfortunately, I think the information I was looking at was lumping everything together.

2044
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:39,520
I just, I'm sorry, I just, I would like to know who on the jury actually wrote that down

2045
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:45,240
on the paper, like, because all these people that are on the jury are the same, and this

2046
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,280
is the thing, if, like, if you're an Assassin's Creed fan and you're like, Rob, stop fucking

2047
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:54,520
picking on this game, here's the thing, this is my point, this jury is made up of all these

2048
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:00,880
people that are in the industry, right, who all gave that game shit.

2049
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,080
Like the reviews across the board have been harping on the same thing, yet those same

2050
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,440
people ended up nominating for Studio of the Year?

2051
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,440
Maybe it's a joke.

2052
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,440
I don't know.

2053
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,440
Just something doesn't add up.

2054
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,440
Satire?

2055
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,440
Something doesn't add up.

2056
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,440
That's all I'm saying.

2057
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,680
Okay, and then, let's see what else here.

2058
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:23,560
Best independent games, Broken Age Act 1, Monument Valley, Shovel Knight, Transistor,

2059
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,680
and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

2060
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,680
And Assassin's Creed Unity.

2061
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:37,240
Now, Dungeon Buster points out that Ubisoft Montreal also did Child of Light, and that

2062
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,840
was, that was a pretty good game.

2063
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,160
Like, I don't know, I don't know if I would look back on, like, that was, wow, that was

2064
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,280
one of the year's best, but that was a good game.

2065
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,120
Okay, come on, come on, this is a little ridiculous.

2066
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,120
Best fighting game.

2067
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,200
All right, Killer Instinct Season 2.

2068
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,200
Okay.

2069
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,840
War Arena Ultimax.

2070
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,840
Okay.

2071
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,840
Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.

2072
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,400
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Ultra Street Fighter IV.

2073
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,040
That's a little...

2074
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,240
Was it a slim year for fighting games?

2075
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,240
I mean...

2076
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,240
Apparently.

2077
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,240
What came out this...

2078
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,000
Yeah, that's pretty much all, pretty much all that came out, really, because a lot of

2079
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,400
the games are being delayed for next year.

2080
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,800
So it's been a really slow year for fighting games.

2081
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,800
Well, then, here's a thought.

2082
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,320
You know, just throw this out there.

2083
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,920
So Smash Bros. did get nominated.

2084
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,920
It just...

2085
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,920
I'm just throwing this out there.

2086
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,920
Here's the thought.

2087
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,120
If you don't have enough entries for a category, don't do that category.

2088
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,520
Or you cut the number of nominees.

2089
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,520
That's what the Oscars does.

2090
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,320
If there's not enough nominees for, like, best animated picture, then they only have

2091
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,320
three nominees.

2092
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,320
Right.

2093
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,320
Anyway.

2094
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,320
I'm just...

2095
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,480
There's a lot of question marks with this, and no award show's gonna be perfect.

2096
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,080
And I suppose here we are buying into it, because we're talking about, you know, that's

2097
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,080
what it is.

2098
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,080
It's buzzed or whatever.

2099
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,960
But I'm kind of looking at this already going, this thing's got problems, and I don't think

2100
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,960
I'm gonna be watching.

2101
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:50,960
Right.

2102
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's a little sloppy.

2103
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Best action adventure game.

2104
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah.

2105
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Fighting game of the year.

2106
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,880
Yeah, they can't really say much, because there's only five games around that really

2107
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,880
just came out.

2108
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,320
Everything else either came out years before, or coming out next year.

2109
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,320
That's the thing.

2110
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:09,080
Also, some of these games that just came out, like, literally Friday, it's like, oh, game

2111
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,080
of the year already.

2112
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,080
It's like, okay.

2113
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,080
Right.

2114
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,920
I'll cut them slack on that, because press would have access to early copies of the games

2115
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,560
so they can write their reviews.

2116
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:22,340
So I would imagine that the people on this jury were pretty well seasoned in the games

2117
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:24,920
coming out this month because of their review copies.

2118
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,120
And also, not to be a dick about this, but why the hell are people doing game of the

2119
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:34,640
years when the year is still going on, even if you get the early copies?

2120
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:39,580
To be fair, the Grammys do a similar thing.

2121
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:44,000
And everybody respects the Grammys for some reason, which, if there's one award show that's

2122
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,480
worse than any of this, it's the Grammys.

2123
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,480
Seriously.

2124
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,040
I'm just calling people out tonight.

2125
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,000
The Grammys are awful.

2126
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,840
If you really think about it, the Grammys are horrible.

2127
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,320
They are the worst of all the award shows.

2128
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,320
They really are.

2129
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,280
Do they ever pick a good song to win for the year?

2130
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,280
Ever?

2131
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,280
I don't watch them.

2132
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,280
It is what it is, okay?

2133
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,480
It's a giant circle jerk.

2134
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,480
That's all this is.

2135
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,120
I mean, who cares?

2136
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:15,360
Who cares if someone says Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Unity is the game of the year?

2137
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,280
If you don't think that, then who cares?

2138
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,840
It doesn't fucking matter.

2139
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,840
It doesn't matter.

2140
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,720
It's another sticker or label that goes on the cover of their game of the year edition.

2141
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,720
I'll come out next year.

2142
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,720
Oh, right.

2143
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,440
Vitpower in our chat says, I'll be at the game awards in the audience.

2144
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:34,400
Well, sir, I want a man on the street report from you.

2145
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,640
I want to hear about it all.

2146
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:39,160
I want to hear how it goes, how your experience is, and all that.

2147
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,720
Because if you have a great time, that's all that really matters, right?

2148
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,040
These awards are da-da-da-da-da.

2149
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,600
They have really good performances.

2150
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:50,120
If they have some games maybe available in the lobby for you to play, some other fun

2151
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,280
things, then all this is for naught, right?

2152
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,140
So I hope you do have a fun time at the show.

2153
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:59,320
But it's still a stupid award show, is what Rob is trying to tell you.

2154
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:04,120
I hope Kevin Spacey wins her best performance, because he was fucking awesome calling the

2155
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,120
duty.

2156
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,120
Yeah, game of the year.

2157
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,120
Because it's Kevin Spacey.

2158
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,120
Too early.

2159
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,120
Right.

2160
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,880
Especially with, again, back to the game of the year things, because if you do a game

2161
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,840
of the year, what if a patch came out that fixes, let's say it says it's a great unity,

2162
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:22,120
ooh, it kicks ass, it fixes all the bugs, everyone wants to play it now, kind of thing.

2163
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,120
Good point.

2164
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,120
Yeah.

2165
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,120
Good point.

2166
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,520
And then all my hating is for naught, but all those other people do.

2167
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,200
Let's say the patch was released December 31st, it fixes every problem that you said

2168
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,280
in the radio show, and you play as like, oh my God, now this is game of the year.

2169
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,680
Well, it was ineligible.

2170
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,720
Like the Grammys run, I think it's October through October.

2171
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,760
Like the Grammys aren't really the year.

2172
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,040
The Grammys only run to October.

2173
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,600
That's why weird shit wins.

2174
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,760
Like you'll be hearing about who won the Grammys and you're like, that fucking thing came out

2175
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,400
like last October.

2176
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,560
Why is it winning now?

2177
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,520
And it's because of the weird eligibility window.

2178
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,520
Yeah.

2179
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,840
The reason why I bring that up, because the game of the year is not over, there's still

2180
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,040
things and updates as will still go on.

2181
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,880
Once it hits January 1st, okay, now you can say, oh, now game of the year.

2182
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,060
Because at that time we're in the new year and okay, we're expecting new stuff.

2183
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,860
So anything that gets released like 2015, that now belongs in the 2015 categories.

2184
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:20,580
Sg100matt saying, oh snap, Rob is going after the award show, Loki Rants style.

2185
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:22,900
And Kaijuto says the Grammys pick real artists.

2186
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,540
They don't always pick mainstream.

2187
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:27,140
Grammys are legit.

2188
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:31,260
Three words for you, best new artist.

2189
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,940
Look up the history of that category.

2190
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:36,260
And I'm not just talking about who wins, but who gets nominated because you look at that

2191
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:40,260
category and you go, the fuck?

2192
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:45,460
Anyway, and, and, and, which is honestly an award they shouldn't even give out.

2193
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,620
This is not a show about music, it's a show about games, but I'm just saying the Grammys,

2194
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,620
they're awful.

2195
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,620
Let's be honest.

2196
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,620
Okay.

2197
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,540
The real reason that you would watch this show, at least in the past, the reason I watched

2198
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,580
this show is because of the trailers that for the new games that aren't even out yet.

2199
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:02,900
New trailers is really why I want to watch the show and I hope they have new trailers.

2200
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:07,780
I hope we have another trailer for No Man's Sky because that's a game I really want.

2201
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,180
Some announcements would be really cool too.

2202
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,500
Like maybe Nintendo will drop an announcement of something that's going to be in the first

2203
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,460
part of next year that we don't know about yet.

2204
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,460
It's plausible.

2205
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,460
Why not?

2206
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,460
So we'll see.

2207
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:23,180
Reggie Reggie's face was on the site somewhere when he's one of the guys contributing.

2208
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,180
I don't know.

2209
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:27,460
Speaking of Nintendo, uh, this is a pretty cool, uh, turn of events here.

2210
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:30,980
And I don't know if there's a lot, a lot of details on this because it, I think it happened

2211
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,620
out of an event in Japan, uh, that's being reported on.

2212
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:40,660
However, a word on the wire is that Satoru Iwata, a president of Nintendo said that fans

2213
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:47,260
can now use company's properties for a number of different things such as let's play videos,

2214
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,820
which I, that's where I start to go.

2215
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,820
Wait a minute.

2216
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,820
Did they really say that?

2217
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:53,740
Uh, fan art and much more.

2218
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:59,540
They will be joining the creative endorsement program, which rewards folks that get work

2219
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,820
that is popular and well received in Japan.

2220
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:07,060
Uh, they will be sponsoring the Toki, Toki, I don't know how to pronounce that.

2221
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,060
I'm sorry.

2222
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,060
Game party.

2223
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,060
Yeah.

2224
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,060
Thank you.

2225
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,060
Which takes place early next year.

2226
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,060
Yeah.

2227
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,060
A little bit clarification though.

2228
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,060
Okay.

2229
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,980
Apparently I knew there had to be something with it.

2230
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,980
Yeah.

2231
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,900
There's, there's a new, new bit of information.

2232
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:27,940
So apparently not everything is allowed and this only applies to Japan.

2233
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:32,220
So they're saying that, um, you know, they announced on the stream of videos featuring

2234
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:36,980
their games properties upload to Nico video that JP is allowed.

2235
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:42,260
Um, it says, uh, so far they've acknowledged it for let's plays game music covers and fan

2236
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:47,680
art, nothing else under the creative endorsement program from Nico video.

2237
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,300
So it's only for that one site.

2238
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,300
It's only for Japan.

2239
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:51,300
Okay.

2240
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,300
Okay.

2241
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,740
So I knew there had to be a little twist in here somewhere.

2242
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,380
So good to know.

2243
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,460
Thank you.

2244
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:01,020
So yeah, unfortunately that's not the case.

2245
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:05,100
So you can't go and profit off all their stuff on, you can't, you can't go make that fan

2246
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:10,460
Mario game that you're planning on doing or making, you know, whatever.

2247
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,460
Yeah.

2248
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,460
Oh yeah.

2249
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,460
Project project M is still illegal.

2250
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,280
Sorry.

2251
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,280
That's a good point.

2252
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,380
All right.

2253
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:22,020
Let's try, let's go back in time to a more classic time in games.

2254
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,020
Let's go back.

2255
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,900
You didn't have like fricking patches that, that changed the game completely.

2256
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,100
Well, unless it was like the translation patch for second dead sets at two, three, like maybe

2257
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,100
that was the thing.

2258
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,040
But anyway, uh, we go back to a simple time.

2259
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:40,500
Actually tonight's pick goes way, way, way, way, way back further than that.

2260
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,820
Tonight's pick goes back to 1984.

2261
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:48,460
It is the classic game of the week where usually dark Sakura jumps into the gaming ball and

2262
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,580
picks the game that she thinks, Hey, you should be playing this game this week.

2263
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:56,140
And since dark Sakura isn't here, guess who's picking the game?

2264
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,140
Me.

2265
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,140
Wow.

2266
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:03,260
So tonight I have picked a game that was on a multitude of different platforms, but of

2267
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:07,980
course I remember it most fondly from the Commodore 64.

2268
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,940
And it's because of those sweet, sweet chip tunes.

2269
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:18,940
And I think all I have to do is play the intro song for you guys to know this game.

2270
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:22,060
Looks like they said the name of it in the intro or something.

2271
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,060
Exactly.

2272
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,060
That's right.

2273
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,820
Tonight I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters, specifically the 1984 edition.

2274
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:31,620
Let me skip ahead to some actual gameplay here in the video.

2275
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:32,620
Okay.

2276
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:37,300
So I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters from 1984 because there were several different

2277
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:43,060
additions of Ghostbusters games, but this is the, really the classic one that I remember

2278
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:48,420
from being a kid like this, this was the stuff that like I went to the store and I saw this

2279
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:53,580
on like the demo computer and like, I lost my mind because this game looks so awesome.

2280
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,620
And did you, Irene, you grew up on Commodore 64.

2281
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,620
Did you ever play this?

2282
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,620
I played this.

2283
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,620
Yeah.

2284
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,620
Yeah.

2285
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,620
It was so fun.

2286
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,620
Fucking awesome.

2287
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,620
Like there really wasn't anything like it.

2288
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,620
Now they did.

2289
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,620
They did port it to other platforms.

2290
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,420
It wasn't just on the Commodore 64.

2291
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,220
It was on the Atari 2600.

2292
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:11,900
It was also on the Sega master system, but it was kind of a crappy port and it was also

2293
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,980
on the NES.

2294
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:14,160
Also a crappy port.

2295
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,980
That's why I picked the Commodore 64 version, which is a little more true to the original.

2296
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,060
This is a game by the infamous David Crane, and that's also part of what made this game

2297
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,060
special.

2298
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:27,340
And if you don't know that name, like all the great Atari classics were David Crane.

2299
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:34,580
He made Pitfall, Pitfall 2, Kaboom, like back when Activision was like almost like an indie

2300
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,580
developer studio.

2301
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:36,580
Is that music too loud?

2302
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:37,580
I'm sorry.

2303
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:38,580
Let me turn it down a little bit.

2304
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,620
Although the chip tune is so awesome, right?

2305
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,180
It's totally fine if it is.

2306
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,180
I know exactly.

2307
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:44,180
It's like part of the game right there.

2308
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:45,740
So anyway, he made all those games.

2309
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,060
He also made this game.

2310
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:55,020
Now Crane wrote the game in six weeks and it was the Commodore 64 version that he wrote

2311
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:58,560
and I believe the Atari 800 game he also wrote as well.

2312
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,600
He had made the game based off a concept he had called Car Wars, where you had automobiles

2313
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:09,740
in a city which led to the driving sequences that were present in the game, where as you

2314
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:14,260
were driving from building to building, you could suck up ghosts in the ghost vacuum that

2315
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,340
you would attach to your car.

2316
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:16,340
Yes, this is all a thing.

2317
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:17,340
Okay.

2318
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,340
It was the 80s.

2319
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,260
And if you ever saw the Ghostbusters movie, some of this stuff was in the movie as well.

2320
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:24,580
So you could suck up the ghosts and so forth.

2321
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:30,380
Now Activision had the license to Ghostbusters to do a movie there and then Crane watched

2322
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:33,460
the film after doing the game.

2323
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:37,020
So he was already done with the game before he even saw the film.

2324
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:41,060
So he wished he could have done a better victory screen and so forth, but he wasn't able to

2325
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,060
do that.

2326
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,540
I'm assuming he had to know some things about the game though, because the Marshmallow Man's

2327
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,540
in it.

2328
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,540
Yeah.

2329
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,540
You wouldn't know about the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man once you've seen the movie.

2330
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:49,540
Anyway.

2331
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:50,540
Of course.

2332
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:54,580
The game was also ported to the Spectrum, the Amstrad, the MSX, and oh my gosh.

2333
01:41:54,580 --> 01:42:00,140
So in the game, you pick from one of four cars with your bank money that you have, but

2334
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:03,220
the funny thing is you can't afford the fourth car with the money you start with, and there's

2335
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,220
a reason why.

2336
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,220
We'll get into that later.

2337
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:09,560
So you have to stock up your car and then you drive around the city and buildings will

2338
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:15,960
get attacked by ghosts and you use the streams, but don't cross them, you use the streams

2339
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,920
to try and lure the ghost into the trap and then you fire the trap and get the ghost.

2340
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:25,720
And then that is how you basically get money that you save up and I think you also affect

2341
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,600
the energy meter and you don't want the energy meter to get past a certain point or you won't

2342
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,060
be able to get past the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who comes out late in the game.

2343
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,240
And then at the very, very end of the game, you have to sneak by the Stay Puft Marshmallow

2344
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:42,720
Man to get to the top of the building where the game comes to a conclusion.

2345
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,880
Now other versions of the game, the NES version and I believe the Sega Master System game

2346
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,320
had like a level where you actually climbed up the building when you got to the very end

2347
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,320
of the game.

2348
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,160
I don't believe that was in the original version.

2349
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,160
So yeah.

2350
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,400
And also this game is infamous.

2351
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:03,800
The NES version was actually ported by a Japanese developer and they had some really bad Engrish

2352
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:10,400
at the end of the game because the ending screen says, congratulation, you have completed

2353
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:15,800
a great game and proved with two O's the justice of our culture.

2354
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,360
Now go and rest our heroes.

2355
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:23,000
That was literally the end game screen in Ghostbusters on the NES.

2356
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,640
You see this text in a later Ghostbusters video game as an Easter egg.

2357
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,800
It's like in the background hiding somewhere.

2358
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,800
So yeah.

2359
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,360
Anyway, this game was huge.

2360
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,360
In fact, it was so huge.

2361
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:37,960
It was one of the most pirated Commodore 64 games of its day.

2362
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,040
This and the print shop were two of the most pirated titles.

2363
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,040
I swear to God.

2364
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,040
I'm reading it right here.

2365
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:48,920
The print shop and Ghostbusters were two of the biggest pirated Commodore 64 programs

2366
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,680
in 1985.

2367
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,080
So there it is.

2368
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:57,280
So yeah, apparently an enhanced remake of the spectrum version was released as freeware

2369
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,960
for the PC in 2006.

2370
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,960
I did not realize this.

2371
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,960
I'll have to check that out at some point.

2372
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,560
So yeah, that's Ghostbusters 1984.

2373
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:07,160
My pick for classic game of the week.

2374
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:10,360
Irene, any memories with this game?

2375
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,360
Not really.

2376
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,360
I didn't play it very much.

2377
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:17,200
But you know what else David Crane made that should be featured as a classic game of the

2378
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,200
week?

2379
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,720
I will write that down and send it to Dark Soccer for consideration.

2380
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:27,120
It's on the NES and it involves a certain person feeding another person a certain kind

2381
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:28,120
of candy.

2382
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,120
Oh, yes.

2383
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,840
You know what I'm talking about.

2384
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,840
That's right.

2385
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,720
All right.

2386
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,720
Okay.

2387
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,720
Feeding the jelly beans.

2388
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,720
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

2389
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,720
Yes, exactly.

2390
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,840
That was a David Crane game.

2391
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:43,040
That was because it always said David Crane's title of the game.

2392
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,040
That guy was in this.

2393
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,040
All right.

2394
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,040
Yeah.

2395
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,040
Anyway, good game.

2396
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,040
Good game.

2397
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,040
Yeah.

2398
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,560
Oh, and I didn't mention this, but at the end of the game, once you beat it, you get

2399
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,480
a passcode that you use the same name the next time and you start with as much money

2400
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,560
as you finish the game with at the end.

2401
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:01,000
This allows you to buy the more powerful car and some of the more powerful enhancements

2402
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,360
for the vehicle later, so you can, I guess, do speed runs and shit.

2403
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,360
I don't know.

2404
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,360
So there it is.

2405
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,360
Loki, did you ever play this?

2406
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,000
This seems like the type of thing you would have lost a few hours on.

2407
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I'm pretty sure.

2408
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I've played it.

2409
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,880
I don't remember which version I've played, but I've played it.

2410
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,120
I know I've played it.

2411
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,120
Probably the Atari 2600 version looked a lot like this, except the buildings were just

2412
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,120
solid colors.

2413
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,120
Right.

2414
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,960
Because you have a green square that would flash red.

2415
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,000
I may have played the NES version.

2416
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yeah?

2417
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Conglaturation.

2418
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Can you prove that?

2419
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
All right.

2420
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Dungeon Buster says the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is insanely tough to sneak past in that

2421
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
version as well.

2422
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Talking about the remake.

2423
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Apparently it's hard to find because the main page hosting it was abandoned there.

2424
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So very interesting.

2425
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Dungeon Buster says you usually had to start with a Volkswagen Bug as your first Ecto.

2426
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
That's right.

2427
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
That's right.

2428
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Or there was that big, the big white car.

2429
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Is it a hearse?

2430
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I don't know.

2431
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I use that a lot too.

2432
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think so.

2433
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yeah.

2434
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So there it is.

2435
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Classic Game of the Week.

2436
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64 and a host of other platforms as well.

2437
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Good times.

2438
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Did you like that pick?

2439
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah, absolutely.

2440
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I liked that pick.

2441
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
It was a good pick.

2442
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Solid pick.

2443
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
There it is.

2444
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Classic Game of the Week.

2445
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Dark Soccer will be back next week to pick a new game for you guys.

2446
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I'm sure she'll still be on her.

2447
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
What's her kick that she's on now?

2448
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Capcom arcade games?

2449
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Or Sega arcade games?

2450
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
One of the two.

2451
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I don't remember.

2452
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
One of the two.

2453
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But there you go.

2454
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I have to break her streak.

2455
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
She's never going to pick Commodore 64 games.

2456
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Why?

2457
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Because she didn't really grow up with it the way I did.

2458
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
She's just picking CPS3 games now?

2459
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I think she's on CPS3 games or something.

2460
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
But anyway.

2461
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
She does pick a lot of obscure stuff though.

2462
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I think we complement each other well because she picks games that I've never played.

2463
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And I'm sure she...

2464
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Well, she probably played the Ghostbusters game to be fair.

2465
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
That was kind of everywhere.

2466
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It is a popular game.

2467
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
She probably did play that one.

2468
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
But some of the other ones.

2469
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I almost did Last Ninja tonight.

2470
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
She probably never played that.

2471
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Really?

2472
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Yeah.

2473
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
If you didn't own a Commodore 64 you didn't really have a way to play it.

2474
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
That's true.

2475
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Yeah.

2476
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I appreciate that you're showing Commodore 64 some love.

2477
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I'm trying.

2478
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'm trying.

2479
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Here.

2480
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Jonas approves Commodore 64 love.

2481
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Did you grow up on Commodore 64?

2482
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
No.

2483
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
You kind of missed that.

2484
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I don't think I was born.

2485
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
1984 I was like one years old.

2486
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Yeah.

2487
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
You're a little young.

2488
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Here's the thing.

2489
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I didn't grow up on a Commodore 64.

2490
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I had a Commodore 64 when I was like 14.

2491
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,760
So it was like in the 90s because we were poor and we're like, hey, let's get the Commodore

2492
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,760
64.

2493
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,000
It's like $20 from our neighbor.

2494
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,840
I still think it was an underrated gaming console because you could do a lot of games

2495
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:36,840
on it.

2496
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,840
But anyway.

2497
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,840
All right.

2498
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,140
We got to take a break guys because we're running long tonight.

2499
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:43,040
We want to come back and make sure we get your calls on our Skype line at Orange Lawn

2500
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,040
Radio.

2501
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,040
All one word.

2502
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,040
I want to talk about that giveaway.

2503
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,900
We're going to be giving away a copy of the Jackbox Party Pack and I'm going to tell you

2504
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,100
how to do that at the start of the next segment and we're going to get into rapid fire news

2505
01:47:52,100 --> 01:48:05,860
and so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2506
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:09,500
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

2507
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:14,100
Live tonight on this Sunday evening, November the 23rd of 2014.

2508
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:17,740
Episode number 576 of our show in progress.

2509
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,740
Mark Stocker.

2510
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,920
She is not here tonight.

2511
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:23,340
She's at a party for her husband who's having a birthday.

2512
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:27,460
But here in studio with me, Tech Master Loki, of course, as well as Princess Irene joining

2513
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,780
us for the multi-tap podcast.

2514
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:31,940
You missed a fun little part A if you're just joining us.

2515
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:35,500
Irene and I had some real in-depth talk on World of Warcraft.

2516
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,820
It'll make you miss this week's Hoard House.

2517
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:40,980
And then also we talked about Ghostbusters.

2518
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:45,100
We did a little bit.

2519
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,100
What else?

2520
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,100
And the news and all this stuff.

2521
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:53,020
Also in the studio, of course, Jonas from the big anime game room, Teabagger, talking

2522
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:56,860
a little bit about Smash and all the games that came out last week.

2523
01:48:56,860 --> 01:49:00,420
Have you had time to play anything else this week, Jonas, or just Smash?

2524
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:06,020
Nope, unfortunately, because the day before I actually finished all the pump videos.

2525
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:09,340
Oh, can we finally see your second place pump finish?

2526
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,340
Is that available?

2527
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:11,340
Yes, it's available online.

2528
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,340
Oh, I need it.

2529
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:13,740
I somehow missed it when it popped through on Facebook.

2530
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:14,740
I didn't see it.

2531
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,340
1080p at 60 frames a second.

2532
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:18,540
Fucking Facebook not showing me.

2533
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,900
You know how Facebook does that?

2534
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:23,780
It won't show everything that a page posts on your feed.

2535
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:27,540
Is it too hard to ask for a social network where I control what I see?

2536
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:30,900
Yeah, Facebook's acting a little finicky over those matters.

2537
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,780
Well, God, you should see.

2538
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:36,620
We actually have had a lot of great content on vognetwork.com this week.

2539
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:41,540
I will admit, we've had a bit of a drought in content, not podcasts, just the written

2540
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:44,460
content that's on the site because it's an all volunteer group.

2541
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:49,420
Unfortunately, we can't afford to pay people right now, but if you want writing experience

2542
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:55,340
and want to try to get more exposure and write stuff, please contact me, rob at vognetwork.com.

2543
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:58,020
We're always looking for more writers, not just on game content.

2544
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:01,900
Actually, I'm really looking for people for movies and some other.

2545
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:06,620
We have TV pretty well covered, but movies, books is another big venture I would love

2546
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:08,100
to get into.

2547
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,420
What about poetry?

2548
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:12,460
If it has a geek angle, why not?

2549
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:13,460
No.

2550
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:17,940
So we've had a great amount of content in the past week and so forth at VOG, and I'll

2551
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:21,300
post about it on Facebook and it's like 30 people reached.

2552
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:24,260
And I'm like, wait a minute, we have way more people in that who like VOG network, but they

2553
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:27,380
don't push it because we don't pay for it.

2554
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:31,060
And because it's a link to our site, they're like, oh, this is spam.

2555
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:32,060
This is spam.

2556
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:33,060
I'm like, fuck you.

2557
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,060
Yeah.

2558
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,380
Facebook X is weird on these matters, the reach counts matter.

2559
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:39,900
Yeah, it's weird.

2560
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:44,680
But anyway, please do check out all the great content this week at vognetwork.com.

2561
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:48,980
We have Eric from the RP Grinders podcast is reviewing games.

2562
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:54,140
He just did one for Tales of R on the PlayStation Vita.

2563
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:57,940
And then just today we pushed a review, John from Critical Myth reviewed Assassin's Creed

2564
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:03,100
Rogue, the other Assassin's Creed game that people weren't talking about as much as the

2565
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:04,100
now.

2566
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,100
Okay.

2567
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,100
Oh, let's talk about Rogue for a little bit.

2568
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,700
So John did that as well.

2569
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:11,460
Henry also on the Critical Myth team pushed a review of Interstellar, the movie.

2570
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:17,660
And remember, it's where everybody has a voice and you can relieve a response review.

2571
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:22,220
So if you read Henry's Interstellar review and you're like, I disagree, this movie I

2572
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,940
felt so you can leave a response review and it shows right there on the page right next

2573
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:26,940
to Henry's review.

2574
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:28,300
So very cool.

2575
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:31,060
So check that out all at vognetwork.com.

2576
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:36,780
Before we get into rapid fire news, the folks over at Jackbox Games, very kind to give us

2577
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:40,780
a code for the Jackbox Party Pack.

2578
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:46,060
Now I can give you this code either on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

2579
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:50,460
So whichever platform you're on, we've got a code for you if you are our big winner.

2580
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,460
So here's how it's going to work.

2581
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:54,780
We have a little contest now because this is like a $25 game.

2582
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,580
We are going to make it work a little bit for it.

2583
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:59,620
This is something a little more than previous.

2584
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:05,340
So what we want you to do, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack, and again, thank

2585
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:09,220
you to Jackbox Games for providing the codes, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack

2586
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,820
is Drawful.

2587
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:16,220
And in this game, you have to draw what is otherwise like a nonsensical phrase.

2588
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:20,860
And all you really have is your finger and the freaking tablet.

2589
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:28,300
So we would like you to submit your best drawing for Orange Lounge Radio.

2590
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:31,260
Whatever it is that you associate Orange Lounge Radio with.

2591
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,180
Maybe you're going to draw a picture of a ferret.

2592
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:35,820
Maybe you're going to draw a picture of Loki screaming something.

2593
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:40,700
Maybe you're going to draw, I don't know, but we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge

2594
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:41,700
Radio.

2595
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:43,340
Oh, but there's a twist.

2596
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:49,380
Because you can only use your finger and the thing, it has to be ugly on purpose.

2597
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:55,860
So we are requesting that you only use MS Paint.

2598
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:01,700
So you will be deducted points if your drawing is too good.

2599
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,580
So we want you to submit those and you can only use MS Paint.

2600
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,260
I'm sure the Mac users are like, what about me?

2601
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:08,500
Whatever the equivalent is on the Mac.

2602
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:12,260
Isn't there like a paint thing built into the Mac?

2603
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,020
You know what the equivalent is over there.

2604
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:17,300
You can only use that.

2605
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,540
You can use a brush and a text tool maybe.

2606
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:20,540
I don't know.

2607
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:22,220
If you use a text tool, you still don't get to use that on the phone.

2608
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:24,020
You get to use a brush and one color.

2609
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,020
That's it.

2610
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,900
So we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.

2611
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:33,500
You're going to send those to participate at orangeloungeradio.com and make sure in

2612
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,900
the subject so we don't miss it, it says Jackbox.

2613
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,860
So something about the Jackbox contest.

2614
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:42,380
So Jackbox in the title and submit your best drawful.

2615
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,720
Here's the beautiful part.

2616
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,260
Dark Sakura is not here tonight.

2617
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,060
She has no idea this is happening.

2618
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:49,900
So when she opens up the mailbag next week, she's going to see these submissions.

2619
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:54,940
So we will ask Dark Sakura to pick her favorite knowing these rules and that will be the

2620
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:55,940
winner.

2621
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:59,780
And again, please include in the email if you would prefer a copy on PlayStation 4 or

2622
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,780
Xbox One.

2623
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:05,340
So we make sure we get you the right code from our friends over at Jackbox Games.

2624
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,820
So to summarize.

2625
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,820
What?

2626
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:08,820
What the hell?

2627
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,820
Sorry.

2628
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:10,820
I was pulling up his video.

2629
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:12,780
Oh, you're looking at his pump video over there?

2630
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:13,780
All right.

2631
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:16,500
Look, he's looking at something over there.

2632
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,980
So to summarize, you are going to submit your best drawful using a very simple paint program

2633
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:23,020
that has a brush only.

2634
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:26,980
You are going to send that to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you're going

2635
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:29,780
to make sure the subject says Jackbox in it.

2636
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:32,460
Now these are due by the next show.

2637
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:36,220
So we want everybody to be able to participate, both the live listeners and the people on

2638
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,220
the podcast feed.

2639
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:43,420
So these are due by the 30th at we'll say noon Pacific time or three Eastern time that

2640
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:47,020
gives us a time to go through and make sure we got a winner before the show starts.

2641
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:49,900
So those are due on the 30th at noon.

2642
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,700
So if you're listening to this after the cause I, I'm still getting contest entries

2643
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,620
for something we gave away like two weeks ago.

2644
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:00,020
Why did that guy with the really high power, you know, powered camera come up and take

2645
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:02,220
a picture of your ass with it?

2646
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,220
I don't know.

2647
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:08,980
And he's just like kind of shrugs and shows like, okay, I'm doing that.

2648
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:11,780
I don't know about that part.

2649
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:16,100
You better watch it or I'm going to ask people to submit pictures of Jonas's ass for the

2650
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,100
Jackbox competition.

2651
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,100
Just kidding.

2652
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,100
I'm kidding.

2653
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:20,300
I wouldn't do that to you, buddy.

2654
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,300
All right.

2655
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,300
So there it is.

2656
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Uh, have fun.

2657
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,300
Enter the competition.

2658
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:25,300
It'll be fun.

2659
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,300
All right.

2660
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,300
Good time.

2661
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:28,300
Are you going to submit Irene?

2662
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,300
Yes.

2663
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,300
You're not eligible.

2664
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,300
All right.

2665
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,300
I'm going to do it anyway.

2666
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,300
All right.

2667
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,700
Robert M is asking, is there a PS three version of the game?

2668
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:36,820
I'm sorry there.

2669
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:41,700
I believe there is a P does the PS four version work on the PS three.

2670
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:42,700
Oh shit.

2671
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:43,780
I'm being put on the spot.

2672
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:51,060
I believe the code he gave me works for both because it's crossed by Loki.

2673
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:54,700
Will you do some research for me real fast and figure out if live radio folks figure

2674
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:57,860
out if the Jackbox party pack is crossed by on PlayStation three and four.

2675
01:55:57,860 --> 01:55:59,460
I think it is.

2676
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,180
And if that's the case, then yes, the code will work on PS three.

2677
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:10,680
So you didn't mention that also for droffle, you can't erase, maybe that's something that's

2678
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,520
going to be a little harder to figure out if somebody did that or not.

2679
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,400
So I guess we'll let you slide on that.

2680
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,400
Okay.

2681
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,400
Hmm.

2682
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,400
What the draw?

2683
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,240
He said it could be anything related.

2684
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:24,680
Just if, if the clue was orange lounge radio, how would you draw that for somebody else

2685
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:25,680
to guess?

2686
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:32,400
I hope that someone draws like world of Warcraft stuff because we've been talking about tonight's

2687
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,400
world of Warcraft.

2688
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,400
Yeah.

2689
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,040
Except then I'd be like, what a great picture for hort house.

2690
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:39,120
It doesn't say, I don't think it is.

2691
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,120
It might be, I don't know.

2692
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:45,440
I thought he said something about PlayStation three and four being crossed by, uh, my advice

2693
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:49,120
to you, if you only are on PlayStation three, enter anyway.

2694
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:50,120
I will.

2695
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:54,120
And if you can't use the code, I'll do my best to get you a PlayStation three one.

2696
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:55,600
I bet I can get it.

2697
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,800
So, uh, but I don't believe I can get Xbox three 60.

2698
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,800
Sorry.

2699
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:00,800
So, uh, yeah.

2700
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,800
Sorry about that.

2701
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,100
I should have researched that in advance, but, uh, the code I believe will work on PS

2702
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,640
three or PS four.

2703
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:09,240
So, all right.

2704
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,840
That's a really good question.

2705
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,360
Oh, you know what?

2706
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,080
Stay tuned to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as soon as I know the answer, I'll

2707
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,720
send a tweet about that.

2708
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,720
Okay.

2709
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:25,040
Uh, let's do some rapid fire news and, uh, travel around and check out some quick news.

2710
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,040
What's been going on?

2711
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,040
Loki.

2712
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:31,760
So now with the Xbox three 60 version now free to play as well.

2713
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,640
Defiance as a whole has finally got a free to play Defiance.

2714
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:40,160
If you may not remember was the MMO that they launched was last year, maybe, no, maybe

2715
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:47,640
even the year before last, um, basically tying in with a scifi TV show by the same name.

2716
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,040
I actually played a little bit of it.

2717
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,360
It was kind of, kind of lame, but it was all right.

2718
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,360
I don't know.

2719
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:56,880
It's worth checking out, I guess, but now that it's free, might as well check it out.

2720
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:02,720
Um, I guess if you did happen to buy the game, you do get some additional goodies, including,

2721
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:10,080
uh, they say a 30 day patron pass for, um, character slots and a thousand arc forge,

2722
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:14,160
which since it's been so long since I played that, I don't remember what the hell any of

2723
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:15,160
that means.

2724
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:20,520
Um, and I guess it's all the content of through the aftermath of season two.

2725
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,840
So it'd be worth to check out on me if it's free.

2726
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,840
So why not?

2727
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:30,480
Um, no, this is kind of funny coming out with a Kiva's trip later this week.

2728
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,520
If you happen to stream the PlayStation four version, there's going to be some integration

2729
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:37,920
with Twitch, some funny integration with Twitch.

2730
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,680
They have chat commands that you can type in and things will happen.

2731
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:49,120
For example, if you type in tourists or Gaijin, you'll summon, um, some tourists into the

2732
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,120
game.

2733
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:55,360
If you type in Gothic Lolita, you'll get a Gothic Lolita or, um, there's sounds like

2734
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,880
scribble knots all of a sudden.

2735
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,880
Yeah.

2736
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,880
Like if you type in anti, yes, someone's anti will show up.

2737
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:04,920
They're also saying that like, um, I guess you can do like panty jump and they'll blow

2738
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:08,000
all the panties and stuff in the air.

2739
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,080
Crazy stuff.

2740
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:12,160
So I don't know, that's kind of, that sounds funny.

2741
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:16,360
So um, yeah, that game's coming out of this week on PlayStation four.

2742
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:19,720
So that's interesting to you.

2743
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:27,080
And then, um, I guess, um, more amiibos, of course, right around the corner and more exclusive

2744
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,140
amiibos to different locations.

2745
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:32,240
So if you want to collect them all, you're going to have to go to a few different locations

2746
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,340
and pick them up.

2747
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:39,420
For example, um, they're saying that Meta Knight is going to be exclusively at Best

2748
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:40,420
Buy.

2749
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:48,100
Lucaro is going to be, um, in Toys R Us and Shulk of course going to GameStop.

2750
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:50,220
So that's kind of lame.

2751
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:52,420
Um, I don't know.

2752
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:56,780
I don't like that whole idea, you know, with having the travel on.

2753
01:59:56,820 --> 02:00:02,980
I don't like the whole exclusivity thing, but at least they spread it around so that

2754
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,140
not one store had one.

2755
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:09,540
It could be timed exclusives because there was that issue with, I know Disney infinity

2756
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:14,140
had like, you know, uh, Jack Skellington knows that GameStop for like four weeks or something

2757
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,660
before it came out everywhere else.

2758
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:16,940
So I don't know.

2759
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:20,660
Um, the other thing I read was apparently the next batch of amiibos is supposed to launch

2760
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:22,600
on the 14th of December.

2761
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:27,240
So all those like, uh, Mega Man and that kind of stuff is supposed to be December.

2762
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,240
All right.

2763
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:34,000
Uh, just to follow up in our chat, they are saying, um, that the cross by, uh, does not

2764
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,880
work on Jackbox party packet is not crossed by between PlayStation three and PlayStation

2765
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:38,880
four.

2766
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:41,560
I'm still pretty confident that I can get you a PlayStation three code if that's the

2767
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,560
only thing you have.

2768
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,560
So you know what?

2769
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,640
I'm just gonna throw it out there.

2770
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,040
I go enter.

2771
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:50,840
And if you want it on PlayStation three, even if I can't get a code, I'll put my mind, I'll

2772
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,840
buy it.

2773
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,900
If you, if you win in your PlayStation three only, I'll buy it.

2774
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:59,720
So I want everybody that, that has one of the systems to be able to participate.

2775
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:02,300
So there you go, all those systems.

2776
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:05,160
So be sure to specify in your entry.

2777
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,800
All right.

2778
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,880
Um, let's move on, uh, with some other rapid fire news here.

2779
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:16,660
Uh, Mario Kart eight, some minor tweaks going in, uh, with, you know, a lot of people talking

2780
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:21,800
about the DLC, but some of the lightweight racers like toad and shy guy actually

2781
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:23,480
had a little bit of a tweak.

2782
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:29,380
Uh, some balancing came to the 3.0 version update to lessen the collision impact with

2783
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:34,640
heavier racers, because I guess when you would slam into a big fatty like Bowser or Donkey

2784
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:37,520
Kong or what have you, your character would go flying.

2785
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:41,940
Um, so if this didn't, is something you didn't really care for, try it again, since they

2786
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:46,760
did the update, uh, a quote from the Mario Kart eight director for this update, we made

2787
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:50,320
just a minor tweak to the way two players deflect when they collide with each other

2788
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:53,760
up until now, when two players collided, the more lightweight racers would get knocked

2789
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,100
too far away.

2790
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,980
That combined with other overall elements we considered made us conclude that the lighter

2791
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:01,200
racers were at a bit of a disadvantage.

2792
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:05,240
If you like toad or shy guy and feel you can't win at all, go ahead and give them another

2793
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:07,280
try after applying the update.

2794
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:12,400
Also note that this tweak doesn't have any effect on time trials when playing solo.

2795
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,400
All right.

2796
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:23,200
Uh, let's see, Microsoft has, uh, celebrated one year of Xbox one by sending out prizes.

2797
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:24,200
That's right.

2798
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:29,080
Uh, they have sent out prizes, quote, selected at random to receive a special gift from us.

2799
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:33,120
These various console owners, uh, some of the things you can win, uh, you can actually

2800
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:37,440
win console bundles for call of duty, advanced warfare and sunset overdrive.

2801
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,920
Guessing not too many people got those.

2802
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:44,120
Uh, you can also get a one year subscription to Xbox live gold, uh, free copies of limbo

2803
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:49,040
apparently are one as well, or, uh, from our call with Bobby Blackwell for, I heard it

2804
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:54,040
on his show earlier tonight, you might get money for grand theft auto on the Xbox one.

2805
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:56,440
So, uh, there's a variety of different things you can get in there.

2806
02:02:56,440 --> 02:03:00,640
I saw, yeah, I read some of the people, a lot of people got just like a free digital

2807
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:02,680
poster, which is like worth nothing.

2808
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,680
Yeah.

2809
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,680
Or a gamer.

2810
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:06,400
Thanks for nothing.

2811
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,400
Microsoft.

2812
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:08,400
Yeah.

2813
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,480
It's almost as good as like when they gave you was a 25 cents worth of Microsoft points

2814
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,480
for your birthday.

2815
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,680
It's like, ah, fuck you.

2816
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:23,840
Well now something to point out here is that, uh, if you are 17 or older, you've used your

2817
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,000
console for more than 10 hours.

2818
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,320
You're in one of the original markets for Xbox one and you made your purchase, uh, before

2819
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,480
November 11th of this year, you're going to get the year one celebration box, which gives

2820
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:41,120
you a special gamer pick and desktop background and free rentals of halo four forward until

2821
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,680
Dawn and Dragon Ball Z battle of the gods.

2822
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:48,480
Uh, you also get a sampler pack of Dragon Ball Z episodes.

2823
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:53,720
So no word if you know, there's over 9,000 episodes given away or, or whatever.

2824
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:54,720
All right.

2825
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:55,720
I had to work in a joke.

2826
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:56,720
All right.

2827
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:02,300
Um, also free on the Xbox Atari game over that documentary we've talked about way too

2828
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,300
much on this show.

2829
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:07,300
Uh, the hour long feature is now available for viewing and it talks about the video game

2830
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:08,620
crash of 1983.

2831
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:14,860
Uh, and, uh, of course, Atari throwing away all of the et video game copies, which somebody

2832
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:18,060
thought it would be fun to dig them up and sell them on eBay to people who like to buy

2833
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,300
other people's garbage.

2834
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:21,220
Uh, there you go.

2835
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:22,940
So now that documentary is available for viewing.

2836
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:24,060
I haven't watched it yet.

2837
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:27,460
I think I need to, I'd like to check that out.

2838
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,460
I was old enough to remember.

2839
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:33,020
I mean, not to be like old grandpa, but I am old enough to kind of remember when the

2840
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:39,140
shit hit the fan with the, uh, Atari's and they just, you've had just bins of games

2841
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,500
that they couldn't give away.

2842
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,500
It was crazy.

2843
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:42,500
Yeah.

2844
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:45,780
I remember those big bins of games going into the game stores and seeing that stuff.

2845
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:46,780
Yeah.

2846
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:47,780
Right.

2847
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:50,980
Speaking of Atari, cause they remind me of the flashback stuff.

2848
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:54,340
The clique of vision flashback is not in stores around here and online.

2849
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:56,380
They're trying to sell it for like twice the retail.

2850
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:58,820
So what the fuck is up with that?

2851
02:04:58,820 --> 02:05:02,180
Oh no.

2852
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:04,360
Let's go to our foogle question of the week.

2853
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:08,620
Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and Google plus communities.

2854
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:22,580
You throw those words together, you get foogle Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or

2855
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:29,020
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is where you can find us.

2856
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:33,020
And we're going to get to the question that we asked our communities, which was, we asked

2857
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:35,340
a very simple question in the communities this week.

2858
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:37,780
We just wanted to know how was your gaming week?

2859
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:41,540
You know, we always ask ourselves that at the top of each show to establish a frame

2860
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:45,460
of reference and what types of games we've been into and you know what we kind of talk

2861
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:46,460
about for the week.

2862
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:50,580
Uh, but the reason why we asked it this week is because with so much that has come out

2863
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:54,100
in the game stores this week, we know there's a lot to pick from.

2864
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:58,700
So we want to know what is it that you've been playing or maybe you really just, you

2865
02:05:58,700 --> 02:05:59,700
know, life happens.

2866
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,420
You can't afford to get anything right now.

2867
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:05,500
So what plastics are you revisiting or, or what games do maybe the rest of us forget

2868
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,500
about?

2869
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,500
We ought to be going back and playing this week.

2870
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:11,800
So checking out some of the answers on Google plus, I'm going to have to abbreviate a lot

2871
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:12,800
of these.

2872
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,800
I'm sorry.

2873
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,320
We're just running way over tonight and I want to make sure we ended at least an hour.

2874
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,320
So bros.

2875
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,780
Amay says, uh, freedom wars, super smash for evil within and Lords of the fallen.

2876
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:26,500
Uh, the first two are amazing and the latter are buggy on PC.

2877
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:28,340
Uh, let's see.

2878
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:34,860
Redder tainment replied and said, um, WWE two K 15 came out and there are complaints

2879
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,860
about it.

2880
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:40,580
Uh, the week I started playing or this week I started playing WWE two K 15.

2881
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:44,300
Some features are missing, but as far as major complaints, I only have one.

2882
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:47,980
When I preordered the game, I was promised that I would get the wrestler sting as a download

2883
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:48,980
character.

2884
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:53,100
And then I picked up the code at, uh, I was given a code on my receipt from GameStop to

2885
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:57,500
download the DLC, but it isn't good until December 16th.

2886
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:01,740
Uh, he tried to redeem the code and it didn't work.

2887
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:05,620
He tried to call Microsoft support and that's when he finally found out that's why it wouldn't

2888
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:06,620
work.

2889
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:10,420
So, uh, maybe a little more communication, maybe on the box or on the receipt or from

2890
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:12,380
GameStop would be helpful.

2891
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:14,620
I have heard that that game is a little bit buggy.

2892
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:18,340
I'm not super into the wrestling games myself, but, uh, I've heard some things about them

2893
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:19,340
being buggy.

2894
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:26,540
Uh, Prince Peach Fuzz, I like that name, Prince Peach Fuzz replied and said, uh, I have dusted

2895
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:31,100
off my Vita and I've been playing SteamWorld dig and hotline Miami been loving both games

2896
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:32,100
so far.

2897
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:33,100
That's right.

2898
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:34,280
Both of those were free on PlayStation plus as well.

2899
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,740
So a free is always a good way.

2900
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:39,980
I mean, well, I guess you're paying for PlayStation plus, so it's not that free, but freeze a

2901
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:44,680
good way to check out some of those classics, uh, act depth says I'm playing some animal

2902
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:47,620
cross new leaf for the first time in months.

2903
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:49,140
My village is still intact.

2904
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:55,460
I also played Spelunky and team fortress two and smash brothers for Wii U most of the weekend.

2905
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:59,700
Those are some answers from Google plus let's go over to Facebook where there's a ton of

2906
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:00,700
answers.

2907
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:02,020
I'm gonna have to really kind of run through this.

2908
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:07,940
Um, of course I closed the tab on accident, so I'm bringing it up again right now.

2909
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:08,940
Way to go, Rob.

2910
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:13,020
Way to go me.

2911
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,340
Maybe I'll get it someday here.

2912
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:17,220
This is because I complained about Facebook earlier.

2913
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:18,220
I'm now being punished.

2914
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:23,680
Oh, Hey, dark Tetsuya responded and said Mario Kart eight, Mario 64 and stuff on connect

2915
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,260
like rhythm party.

2916
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:26,260
It needs more songs.

2917
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:27,260
Uh, Kane.

2918
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:30,940
I am says final fantasy 14 has eaten my soul.

2919
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:32,780
Yeah, mine too.

2920
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:38,660
Uh, Andy R says little big planet three story just finished, uh, outside of that Vita love

2921
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:42,980
freedom Wars, Hatsune Miku project diva F second, which I can't believe that's the first

2922
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:45,620
time that's come up tonight, but that was another big release.

2923
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:50,220
Uh, tales of hearts are, and Andy R says tales of hearts are as awesome.

2924
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:51,220
I highly recommend it.

2925
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,940
You should go leave a response review on eric's review at vog network.com.

2926
02:08:54,940 --> 02:09:00,980
Uh, silent Tom says super smash brothers and Mario Kart eight rocking my link amiibo.

2927
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:06,180
See Al says border lands, the pre-sequel final fantasy tactics, advanced Minecraft star bound

2928
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:12,540
and Pokemon Omega Ruby, which again, another huge game that came out this week that none

2929
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,140
of us have gotten around to playing yet.

2930
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:18,620
But uh, I'm sure at some point Shane will invade the show and tell us all about what

2931
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:22,100
we're missing with Pokemon because I know he wasn't into it at first.

2932
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:25,980
And then he said, Oh, but they do this thing in the grass and it's so cool now.

2933
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:28,020
And I completely changed my mind.

2934
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:33,300
Um, a surfing Slurpee said I've been binge playing halo master chief collection, halo

2935
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:38,300
CE through halo four, uh, logged into legal legends to check out the new champion Kalista

2936
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:42,220
and started a free trial wow account to check out the new character models.

2937
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:46,220
They're nice, but not enough to break my one year long wow sobriety Lords of the fallen

2938
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,220
dragon agent.

2939
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:50,300
Grand Theft Auto five are unopened and gathering dust.

2940
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:51,300
You hear that?

2941
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:55,260
Or is it being Slurpee has a copy of grand theft auto five gathering dust Loki.

2942
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:01,620
He's just shaking his head, shaking his head, a low cat frog responds and says, did my yearly

2943
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:05,500
tradition of the most current assassin's creed and playing through grand theft auto five

2944
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:06,500
on Xbox one.

2945
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:07,500
Well, there you go.

2946
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,060
The next answer redeemed it a little bit there.

2947
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:13,620
Fred the Hayes saying, enjoying old DS games on my brand new $60 3DS XL that was price

2948
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:18,580
matched to Walmart freedom Wars on Vita and got some old Skylanders for cheap on PS three

2949
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:24,200
and 3DS Elliott B says, I haven't bought new games in ages, but I spent a jet lag recovery

2950
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,820
day getting reacquainted with rock band.

2951
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:30,020
Uh, it's still so good.

2952
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:34,780
One of my favorite names, William murder face said, I'm getting into dragon age origins,

2953
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:36,060
not inquisition origins.

2954
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:39,420
And I'm playing payday two and Guild Wars two for the umpteenth time.

2955
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:43,060
Winston H says, bust a move one and two.

2956
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:47,960
Uh, once my finals are over, I'll go back to persona for arena Ultimax.

2957
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:51,260
That was a game we used to play the crap out of all the time was buzz to move.

2958
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,260
Yes.

2959
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,260
Oh my God.

2960
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:54,260
So they're busted groove or whatever.

2961
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,260
I wasn't saying I wasn't.

2962
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:56,260
Yeah.

2963
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:57,260
Yeah.

2964
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:58,260
Must've groove.

2965
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,260
Same thing.

2966
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:00,260
Cause it was bust to move in Japan.

2967
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:04,740
And in here somehow bust to move was pub puzzle bobble somehow, which had the most interesting

2968
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:08,140
PlayStation two box art I've ever seen in my life.

2969
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:12,780
I don't recall it, but, uh, get him to Google it or use your tablet.

2970
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:13,780
Look it up.

2971
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:14,780
Bust a move on PlayStation two.

2972
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,780
It's like what?

2973
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:22,860
Uh, our pal Tiara responds and says so much dragon age inquisition so much tiara.

2974
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:24,540
You need to leave the hinterlands.

2975
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:28,480
You need to stop and then you need to leave the hinterlands.

2976
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:29,480
Get out of there.

2977
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:32,820
Uh, I'm thinking about picking up that game.

2978
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:33,820
Yeah.

2979
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:40,300
Break code man says dragon age, dragon age, and oh yeah, transistor, uh, Haseo Sumeru

2980
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:45,220
Gawa says, uh, bought a DS to catch up on the games I miss so much right now.

2981
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:51,140
Uh, FONF has he 12 revenant wings and Pokemon black for the Vita I'm cracking out on borderlands

2982
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,180
too.

2983
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:57,300
We played super smash brothers brawl and finally the PlayStation three far cry four, which

2984
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:58,300
is amazing.

2985
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,580
Not going to lie.

2986
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:05,100
Fifth dream says so much dragon age inquisition and tales of hearts are, I've also been playing

2987
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:08,180
a lot of Pokemon alpha Sapphire and a little project diva F second.

2988
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:11,700
I have a bunch of games from the last month I've put on hold this week with more games

2989
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:14,140
coming on Tuesday.

2990
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:19,700
Critical myths says mostly assassin's creed rogue and final fantasy 10 HD remaster.

2991
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:25,120
And last but not least, Veronica Isabel saying Tomodachi life and solitaire by mobility wears

2992
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:26,780
daily challenges.

2993
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:31,060
I keep putting off downloading star Trek online and beating Pokemon X.

2994
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:32,060
There you go.

2995
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,540
Those are the answers there to our foogle question of the week.

2996
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:36,380
I'm really surprised in there.

2997
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:37,380
How much of that content?

2998
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:42,260
I know there was a lot that I read, but I'm really surprised how much of that was not

2999
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:44,200
stuff that came out this week.

3000
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:48,860
In fact, there seemed to be like two or three people that were like, I just got a DS and

3001
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:51,260
so now I'm catching up on all this stuff.

3002
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:54,520
So Irene, you know, you kind of mentioned earlier in the show, that's where you're at

3003
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:56,280
right now is, is playing a lot of DS stuff.

3004
02:12:56,280 --> 02:12:57,640
So you are not alone.

3005
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:02,000
It's my people, the poor people of the world.

3006
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,160
Well, you need to talk to the guy who got a $60 price match DS.

3007
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:07,160
That's right.

3008
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:08,160
Yeah.

3009
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:09,160
Right.

3010
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:10,160
Lucky.

3011
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,400
Well, what about those people that were, you know, I don't think we're talking about, but

3012
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,000
the people that were exploiting the price matching?

3013
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,840
Well, that's exploit essentially that's stealing.

3014
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:19,880
I mean, you can, you can call it whatever you want.

3015
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:20,880
That's stealing.

3016
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,520
I'm assuming the $60 price match thing was legit.

3017
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,680
They did have though one time it was a, it was a glitch on the website where they actually

3018
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,960
had like, you know, we use and places you force down the Sears.

3019
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:32,960
Yeah.

3020
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:38,200
Sears had the down really cheap and so people were price matching off the website glitch.

3021
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:42,040
So from what I understand, that was actually, I think a former employee issue.

3022
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:43,040
No, no.

3023
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,040
I was like, Oh boy.

3024
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:48,360
Uh, well then that's, that's yeah, let's go.

3025
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:51,160
But anyway, yeah, let's just leave it at that.

3026
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,760
All right, let's move on.

3027
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:55,600
We got some more news to get into and we want to make sure we have some time to get into

3028
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,600
your calls.

3029
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,600
We've got the email bag too.

3030
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:59,040
So we're going to try to jam through these stories.

3031
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,040
Loki.

3032
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:06,240
So you may remember that Activision, Vivendi were together at one point and now, you know,

3033
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:08,640
there was a whole buyout thing.

3034
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:18,600
Um, basically some lawsuit that's now resulting in a Vivendi paying, um, 275 million to Activision

3035
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:21,000
to settle the litigation.

3036
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,160
And I guess this happened, was it starting last year?

3037
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:28,520
I sort of remember part of it, but I don't remember exactly the details of why one was

3038
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:29,520
suing the other.

3039
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:33,520
Um, I'm assuming over probably payments or something like that.

3040
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:37,040
Um, but yeah, well I guess at least that's settled.

3041
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,200
Um, I don't know.

3042
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:41,160
Oh, here we go.

3043
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:47,480
Uh, the lawsuit alleged, I guess, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets

3044
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,720
and unjust enrichment.

3045
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:54,120
I have no fucking clue what any of that means.

3046
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:59,520
Bad business stuff that CEOs and corrupt people participate in.

3047
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:00,520
I don't know.

3048
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:01,520
It's almost.

3049
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,520
All right.

3050
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:08,240
Uh, if you've downloaded anything on the iTunes store lately for your iOS platform,

3051
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:14,720
such as the iPhone or the iPad, you may have noticed that the term free has changed to

3052
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:15,720
get.

3053
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:19,920
Uh, this is because, uh, there's been pressure from the European commission that a lot of

3054
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,440
these free games are not really free, uh, because they have in app purchases.

3055
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:30,600
So for example, the newly released candy crush soda saga, I can't say it without verping

3056
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:31,600
a little bit.

3057
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,600
I'm sorry.

3058
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:35,120
I shouldn't judge a game I haven't played, but I'm going to judge this game a little

3059
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,120
bit.

3060
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:37,120
I'm sorry.

3061
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:38,120
Uh, you can now see that on the store.

3062
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:43,960
It says get because you know, to buy your snozzberries or whatever it is that will do

3063
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:46,760
the magic on the board to buy your Bert machines.

3064
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:47,760
I don't know.

3065
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:52,880
What do you, what do you buy in candy crush soda saga, bunch of bullshit, an Alka Seltzer.

3066
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:53,880
I don't know.

3067
02:15:53,880 --> 02:16:00,100
Uh, you're, it's not really going to be free because those are all microtransactions, right?

3068
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,100
So there you go.

3069
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:06,600
Uh, which, you know, somebody's got to put out a game named shine so I can go shine.

3070
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:11,440
Get, that's the second time I've made a Mario sunshine joke tonight.

3071
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:15,800
I think you've hit your, your, as we're done for the year, no more Mario sunshine jokes

3072
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:16,800
for the whole year.

3073
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,800
We're done.

3074
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,800
Right.

3075
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,800
All right.

3076
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:20,800
Loki.

3077
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:25,520
I don't know how to follow that, but I'm going to, let's talk about steam sale.

3078
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,520
Yes.

3079
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:32,440
Your wallets are already shivering in fear, but apparently the steam sale will commence

3080
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:37,360
the day before Thanksgiving and it'll run up through December 1st.

3081
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:44,200
Um, apparently they're saying an email was sent out by PayPal encouraging people to stock

3082
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,880
up on steam wallet codes.

3083
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:50,240
Um, Hmm.

3084
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:55,840
No confirmation yet from valve, but I, that sounds like it could make sense.

3085
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:58,280
Um, I know they normally do a sale.

3086
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:03,520
I'm not sure it's necessarily the fall sale right at black Friday, but usually around

3087
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,280
that early December time.

3088
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:09,880
So I guess we'll just have to look out for all the sale.

3089
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:11,880
This is also the precursor to the winter sale.

3090
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:12,880
Really?

3091
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:15,360
I mean, this is, this is just like wetting your whistle a little bit for games.

3092
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:18,240
It'll be even more deeply discounted during the winter.

3093
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:21,760
So when's the winter sale usually is that in like next year?

3094
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,760
Yes.

3095
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:23,760
Well, yeah.

3096
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:29,960
I mean, it's usually about, um, I want to say it starts around the 27th to 28th, like

3097
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:34,160
it's after Christmas and then runs through like the new year's, but I could be wrong.

3098
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:38,260
Somebody like rage nator or somebody who's a little more tuned into steam might know

3099
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:40,120
a little more about when those sales start.

3100
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:43,480
But then the other exciting thing is that, you know, uh, there's more stores out there

3101
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:47,880
than just steam and all those stores will start having huge sales as well to kind of

3102
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:48,880
compete with that.

3103
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,240
In fact, a good old games just finished a big sale that they were having.

3104
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:56,440
So I used to get a lot of stuff on the Amazon digital store because they would have steam

3105
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:57,440
codes.

3106
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:01,200
So just say I keep an eye out for that stuff or if you don't want to worry about aggregating

3107
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:06,360
that stuff yourself, cheap ass gamer, you know, uh, let's see.

3108
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,680
Kaijuto says, I think I'm burned out on steam sales.

3109
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:09,680
They don't have much of anything anymore.

3110
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:14,800
I don't want to bother with any more early access games, uh, as I agree, there is a lot

3111
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:18,300
of that going on where there's a lot more of that coming onto the store where it's like

3112
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:19,920
by my half finished game.

3113
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:24,400
And I mean, it really depends on the developer and on the game if I'm going to buy into something

3114
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:25,400
like that or not.

3115
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:33,040
Uh, let's see, SSG100 Matt says week before Christmas, uh, I think an active says around

3116
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:34,320
Christmas and ends after new year's.

3117
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:38,160
I don't know why I thought it started after Christmas and it could be wrong.

3118
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:40,400
All I know is that my wallet can't take it this year.

3119
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,400
All right.

3120
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:46,040
Uh, there is a new MMO coming to PlayStation four, uh, but this one's going to be a little

3121
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:47,040
different.

3122
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,800
It's a game called wander.

3123
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:53,320
And uh, in a note to the PlayStation blog this week that was written, uh, they talked

3124
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:57,800
about this game and how it is a non combat MMO.

3125
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:02,880
You explore an environment in several different forms, a giant tree, a soaring Griffin, a

3126
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,780
sea creature and more.

3127
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:08,640
So this is a game about exploration, but you don't fight.

3128
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:14,280
Uh, you can, uh, you find clues by examining your surroundings and you might find other

3129
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:17,760
people who help you and share information.

3130
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:22,520
And uh, you may hear like opera singers and that leads you to something else.

3131
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:26,320
I there's a, in some way this kind of sounds like what, what if they made like an MMO

3132
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:27,320
out of journey?

3133
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,320
That's almost what this sounds like.

3134
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:30,040
It sounds really fascinating though.

3135
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:35,280
Like I like this idea of like, this is a game about exploration and that's it.

3136
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,900
I kind of, I'm like that one indie game.

3137
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:37,900
I don't remember.

3138
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:39,440
I'm trying to remember what game it was now.

3139
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:40,440
I have it.

3140
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:44,040
I'm just, ah, the hell's it called?

3141
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:51,560
Um, it was very like low, like pixely and just kind of wandered around and stuff happened.

3142
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:55,960
So missed, yeah, missed on was, uh, reminds me of this a little bit cause I don't remember

3143
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:58,220
there really being comment missed on proteus.

3144
02:19:58,220 --> 02:19:59,560
It reminds me of proteus.

3145
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:00,560
That's the game.

3146
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:05,440
Well, anyway, wander will be playable at the PlayStation experience in Las Vegas.

3147
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:09,840
So I'm sure we'll be hearing more, uh, out of this is our Vegas guy vid powers.

3148
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,560
He going to the PlayStation thing too.

3149
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,560
I bet.

3150
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:13,560
All right.

3151
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:15,640
Uh, let's go to the mailbag.

3152
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:20,900
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com and a dark soccer dives

3153
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:23,500
into the mailbag and find some emails to read.

3154
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:24,980
But Oh, she's not here.

3155
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:30,340
So I guess I'll put on her gloves and dive in the mailbag.

3156
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:39,180
Again, that's participate at orange lounge, radio.com if you want to send us emails.

3157
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:41,140
And I was very bad and not logged in already.

3158
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:42,340
So I'm logging in right now.

3159
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,340
Sorry guys.

3160
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:45,220
I remember there being, Oh my God.

3161
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:48,500
It just, Oh, I was like the mailbox exploded.

3162
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:51,700
Oh, cause we're already getting entries for the jack box contest.

3163
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:52,700
Hooray.

3164
02:20:52,700 --> 02:20:53,700
Uh, let's see.

3165
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:56,580
Would it be wrong to peek at some of them?

3166
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:57,580
No, I'm not going to pee.

3167
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:58,580
Okay.

3168
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,580
Maybe I'll peek at one.

3169
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:00,580
All right.

3170
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:02,380
The surfing Slurpee says, hi, Rob, Jamie and Loki.

3171
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:08,140
I was wondering if you guys do anything special when picking up a hotly anticipated game on

3172
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:11,900
release day, I skipped the gym Tuesday is leg day.

3173
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:15,740
Anyway, get a six pack of Dortmunder gold.

3174
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:18,220
I don't know that, but it sounds like alcohol.

3175
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:25,900
Uh, go to Penn station subs for an eight inch Italian Giggity with large fries.

3176
02:21:25,900 --> 02:21:26,900
I see what you did.

3177
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:33,380
It took me a minute and he's Italian with large fries and a sweet tea game pig out and

3178
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:34,380
regret it later.

3179
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:35,380
There's some Ursa B Slurpee.

3180
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:38,100
Do you have any rituals for new game releases?

3181
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:39,100
That's a good question.

3182
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:43,540
I have to, I honestly, I don't, I love your idea that you pick up a sandwich and go to

3183
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:44,540
town.

3184
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,540
That sounds really good.

3185
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:47,740
Considering how terrible my family does.

3186
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:48,740
You're making us hungry.

3187
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:52,580
Um, no, but I, I really don't have a ritual.

3188
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:54,500
I don't really go to midnight releases anymore.

3189
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:57,340
I would say my ritual is sitting by the door.

3190
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:58,340
Is ups here yet?

3191
02:21:58,340 --> 02:21:59,340
Is ups here yet?

3192
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:00,340
Cause I kind of buy my game.

3193
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:01,340
Seriously.

3194
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,340
Fuck the midnight releases.

3195
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:03,340
Okay.

3196
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:07,780
Now I'm not sure if this was a special exception with, um, grand theft auto, but that shit

3197
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:10,580
fucking unlocked at 9 PM the day before.

3198
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:11,580
Yeah.

3199
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:12,980
But then you have to buy digital.

3200
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:13,980
Who gives a shit?

3201
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:16,420
I was going to pay $60 anyways.

3202
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:22,780
Oh, I'm going to sell grand theft auto one of the greatest games to ever grace the consoles.

3203
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:25,940
Or you convince someone to go to the midnight releases for you.

3204
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:27,220
And that's what I did with dragon age inquisition.

3205
02:22:27,220 --> 02:22:29,300
I was like, Shane, you're going to get the game.

3206
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:33,340
Or it's like a game like call of duty where they give you a copy on PS3 and PlayStation

3207
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:35,220
four for the same price.

3208
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:38,500
Actually interesting enough, since I brought that up, the dragon age inquisition thing,

3209
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:40,900
they GameStop started selling it at nine o'clock here.

3210
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:42,460
Um, they didn't do a midnight sale.

3211
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:46,020
They did a nine o'clock sale, uh, and I think it's because of digital.

3212
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:49,380
I think GameStop has finally started saying, look, if you guys release it digitally at

3213
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:52,180
nine o'clock, we're going to start selling it because they make their own fucking rules.

3214
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:54,940
They, you know, basically, Oh, the street date is this.

3215
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:55,940
Yeah.

3216
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:56,940
Well, fuck you.

3217
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:57,940
We're going to do what we want.

3218
02:22:57,940 --> 02:22:58,940
What are you going to do?

3219
02:22:58,940 --> 02:22:59,940
Not sell at GameStop.

3220
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:00,940
Yeah.

3221
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:01,940
Right.

3222
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:02,940
I'm kind of not surprised that they're playing hard ball like that actually.

3223
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:03,940
So sorry.

3224
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:04,940
I didn't mean to derail a little bit.

3225
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:08,620
There has to be certainly your question, but, um, just glad to not have to deal with that

3226
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,620
drama anymore.

3227
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:12,780
I just, I just tried to make the time.

3228
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,620
I don't for MMOs.

3229
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:20,900
I've taken the day off of work talking about productive life playing with MMOs.

3230
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:24,100
I've taken days off work to play that, but I've done that too.

3231
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:29,140
I remember when Final Fantasy 11 first came out, I had like two days off work when that

3232
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:30,740
it came out so I could play Final Fantasy 11.

3233
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:31,740
Love.

3234
02:23:31,740 --> 02:23:32,740
It was amazing.

3235
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:33,740
It was amazing.

3236
02:23:33,740 --> 02:23:34,740
Those is good.

3237
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:35,740
Good times.

3238
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,740
When the fuck is that going to free play?

3239
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:39,060
You know, way after Final Fantasy 11.

3240
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:41,460
Come on, come on.

3241
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:42,460
Come on.

3242
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:43,460
All right.

3243
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:44,460
Let's see.

3244
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:48,720
Uh, Raging Nader has emailed us saying, Hey, peeps, it's your favorite person in the world.

3245
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:49,720
Raging Nader.

3246
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,780
I just thought I'd pose some questions this week.

3247
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:52,780
Actually.

3248
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:53,780
I want to go back to the chat real quick.

3249
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:56,940
Cause I want to see if anybody else said what they're what they do.

3250
02:23:56,940 --> 02:23:59,660
Cause I liked the question about the rituals.

3251
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:00,660
Let's see.

3252
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,440
Uh, Borat says, I want a big greasy hamburger.

3253
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:05,060
I'm jealous of California for in and out burger.

3254
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:08,020
Um, to be honest, you should be really fries.

3255
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:09,020
Well done.

3256
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:10,020
Marvelous.

3257
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:11,020
Anyway.

3258
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:15,580
Uh, but we don't have Dunkin Donuts and I love the coffee.

3259
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:17,200
So there is a trade off there.

3260
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:21,860
Now I would, I would give up Dunkin Donuts coffee to keep in an upper, but I'm just saying

3261
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,860
there is a trade off.

3262
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:23,860
Anyway.

3263
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:27,620
Um, Kai's judo saying pre-order killed the midnight release as a Joe and under Matt saying

3264
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:30,420
console midnight releases could be fun with friends again.

3265
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:34,980
Uh, last time I did a console midnight release, uh, extra for waiting in line for me, it was

3266
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:35,980
awesome.

3267
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:40,140
I think we should do one Rob for a game that's not hotly anticipated.

3268
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,340
Well, I guess they don't really do that.

3269
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:44,980
Do they do midnight releases for popular games?

3270
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:50,700
Well, you can go and then show up and be like, well, I'm here to get, you know, Barbie fun

3271
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:53,460
pack, you know, hello kitty Island adventure or whatever.

3272
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:54,460
Right.

3273
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:55,460
All right.

3274
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,460
Sorry.

3275
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:57,460
We don't have that delivered yet.

3276
02:24:57,460 --> 02:24:58,460
Back to regionators email.

3277
02:24:58,460 --> 02:24:59,460
Sorry.

3278
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:00,460
I just thought I'd post some questions this week.

3279
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:01,460
Yes.

3280
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:02,460
I'd mentioned on Bobby's show tonight.

3281
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:03,460
Steam is an upcoming sale this week.

3282
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:06,260
Is there any games that you folks are looking to pick up during the sale?

3283
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:07,660
God, I don't know.

3284
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:11,780
See, here's the thing is I can't buy any modern games anymore cause my laptop cannot run that

3285
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:12,780
shit.

3286
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,940
I mean it barely, it was, it was Titanfall melted my last laptop.

3287
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:23,880
So this one, you know, it runs Titanfall sort of, I mean it, I can't really pick up anything

3288
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:28,380
that's non indie and even some of those indie games I can't, and there's really not anything

3289
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:30,960
out there that's like, shit, I don't have this yet.

3290
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:34,860
I can't really remember off the top of my head, but I know I have a wishlist on steam

3291
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:38,280
and I'm sure if something on there gets low enough, I'll buy it.

3292
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:42,960
Sometimes I have a tendency to buy like indie games that just look cool, especially if they

3293
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,960
get really cheap.

3294
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:47,320
Like they're just like between like under five bucks because you know, I have money

3295
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:51,080
in my steam wallet, so if something gets cheap enough, I might just be like, eh, why not?

3296
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:52,120
Let's buy it.

3297
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:54,040
Super hexagon for 39 cents.

3298
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,040
What the fuck?

3299
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:56,040
Why not?

3300
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:57,040
Of course.

3301
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,040
Let's see.

3302
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:01,640
Uh, on a semi related note, I imagine that you all have a fairly decent sized gaming

3303
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:04,920
pile of shame in regards to unplayed steam games.

3304
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:09,920
If you were to make a rough guesstimate, how many games or what percentage of your games

3305
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:18,720
remain unplayed for me of my 457 steam games, roughly 43% of my games remain untouched.

3306
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:22,000
Oh, this is, this is a dick question.

3307
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,500
This is, this is shame.

3308
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:25,460
This is shame right here.

3309
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:26,460
What is it?

3310
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:31,020
What percentage of your library, it's loading, it's, it's taking its sweet time loading.

3311
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:32,020
All right.

3312
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,020
Rob's is 100%.

3313
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:39,860
No, I, I, in all, I'm going to be honest, I'm going to guess it's like 60.

3314
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:40,940
Only 60?

3315
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:41,940
Only 60.

3316
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:42,940
Are you lying to me?

3317
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:48,380
Uh, if you combine Alan and I's library, it's probably more like 80, but it's, I would say,

3318
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:49,380
I would say 60.

3319
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:54,020
Does it count just if you play it for like an hour or two and then set it aside?

3320
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,660
I mean, what are we talking about?

3321
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:59,820
I think that counts, but like if I loaded it to see the title screen and that's it,

3322
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:00,820
then it doesn't count.

3323
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:01,820
Okay.

3324
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:07,440
But the reason why is, is humble bundles and bundled games and things like I bought an

3325
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:10,740
X com bundle and I played maybe one game in the bundle.

3326
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,640
So I mean, keep in mind, there's things like that.

3327
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:15,740
Like it's not like I buy all these games just to never play them.

3328
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:16,900
I get a lot of games.

3329
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:22,720
I just wasn't really looking for, and I just remember just saw an update and I just remembered

3330
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:26,840
something that, um, a new story I'm going to talk about later, but that's fine.

3331
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:33,080
But no, to go back to what I have, 301 games, I guarantee I've probably played about 3%

3332
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:40,540
of those if, if, if, if not less than that, I think I literally, I don't even remember

3333
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:43,760
how many games I played, but I've played like less than 5%.

3334
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:48,120
Your answer to Ray's question is 97% of your library is unplayed.

3335
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:54,200
That's probably, that's probably a very conservative estimate that I, I betting it's a lot higher

3336
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:58,840
than that, that I have not played that I would have to go and look at all my, I'm sure they've

3337
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:01,840
got some sort of record somewhere of what you've actually played.

3338
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,840
All right.

3339
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:05,560
Lastly, enrage nators email finally on an unrelated note.

3340
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:09,040
Is there any chance that we can get another Rob diva fit?

3341
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:13,220
It's been a few years since the infamous one and in my humble opinion, we're kind of overdue

3342
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:15,080
for one.

3343
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,440
No.

3344
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,480
You cannot have another diva fit.

3345
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,480
I don't get paid enough on this show to have a diva fit on demand.

3346
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:23,480
I'm not your fucking switch.

3347
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:26,080
That's the best I could do.

3348
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:27,080
All right.

3349
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:28,080
Uh, let's see.

3350
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:34,640
Uh, we have a few emails here from Robert M and I think one of them was a follow up.

3351
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,640
Oh yes.

3352
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:39,720
Uh, let me get to this main email here that he had sent.

3353
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:45,360
Not to be quote that guy, but I believe battle toads was a joint project between rare and

3354
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:46,600
trade west.

3355
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:51,440
The latter of whom was owned after bankruptcy, at least in name by midway according to my

3356
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:52,880
limited research.

3357
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:56,680
Who knows if a new game would require Warner brothers involvement?

3358
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:57,680
That's a very good question.

3359
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,400
I'm straight and you're not being that guy.

3360
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:02,840
I'm, I'm okay with being wrong.

3361
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:08,480
You guys like nobody out there knows every single trade was because they remember they

3362
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,480
had the didn't.

3363
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:10,480
Yeah.

3364
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:11,480
There's battle toads versus double dragon.

3365
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:12,480
Dragon.

3366
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:13,480
Yeah.

3367
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:14,480
Yeah.

3368
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:17,720
It was just, I don't claim to know every single nook and cranny about gaming.

3369
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:21,800
Um, probably captain spike a game, but we probably does know everything about gaming

3370
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:22,800
on it.

3371
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:24,080
He's probably the closest person I've met.

3372
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:28,680
Um, but yeah, I mean like that's why I love doing live radio because you guys kind of

3373
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:32,660
give that instant feedback and you know, if you're not listening live, you can email us.

3374
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:37,160
So don't be afraid to email us and say, Hey, you got something wrong on the show.

3375
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:40,000
As long as you know, there's the presentation is everything.

3376
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,560
Cause if you email us going, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'll just be like, Oh, the delete

3377
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:44,560
key.

3378
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,560
How'd that get hit?

3379
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:50,400
Um, but if you email us as you did saying, Hey, I think this might actually be the case.

3380
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:54,280
Then I go, Oh, that's, that sounds like an informed opinion.

3381
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,600
Gold star for user.

3382
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:00,720
Also, I recently restored and rebuilt my iPod touch to try to fix some play counts, sinking

3383
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:05,800
and memory issues, losing my game saves and other data in the process I had just purchased

3384
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:10,100
and finished the forgotten shores expansion to monument Valley, which was despite negativity

3385
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:11,700
and reviews for the DLC cost.

3386
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,620
Absolutely worth the asking price.

3387
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:17,380
However, the app does not currently have a restores purchases option.

3388
02:30:17,380 --> 02:30:21,380
I did send the developer feedback and I'm waiting for a reply, by the way, he did get

3389
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:22,380
that feedback.

3390
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:24,260
He said there is a restore purchases option.

3391
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:25,660
He heard back from the developer there.

3392
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:27,660
So there you go.

3393
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:31,420
Um, thank you for the email.

3394
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:32,420
Appreciate that.

3395
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:38,280
Uh, I think there's no, that was the email on, uh, the sandwiches, the eight inch Italian.

3396
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:39,540
So that's it.

3397
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:43,560
So if you want to email us, participate at orange laundry.com, don't forget the Jackbox

3398
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,060
contest going on as well.

3399
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:50,100
Make sure Jackbox is in the subject there and you can win a copy of a five in one game

3400
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:51,100
pack.

3401
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:52,100
It's an instant party.

3402
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:53,100
You want this.

3403
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:54,100
Yeah, it's good.

3404
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:55,100
It's in.

3405
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:56,860
And if you're on PlayStation four, you can share play and you're gonna have a party in

3406
02:30:56,860 --> 02:30:57,860
two homes.

3407
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,860
Mm hmm.

3408
02:30:58,860 --> 02:30:59,860
Lice water has like a hundred players.

3409
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:00,860
Right?

3410
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:03,940
You have a party in an auditorium if you wanted to.

3411
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:04,940
All right.

3412
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:09,500
Uh, let's get to the F use of the week cause every week we get angsty.

3413
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:10,500
Why?

3414
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:29,020
I guess gamers have a lot of angst on them.

3415
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:30,740
Loki wants to start us off.

3416
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:39,140
Uh, F you goes to Jack in the box who don't know how to make fucking sandwich is nasty.

3417
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:43,620
Uh, Irene, do you have some F use of the week?

3418
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:54,460
Uh, F you to flaky ass people who are just a bunch of dicks and my cat Jonas F you to

3419
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:58,740
best buy for forgetting my, um, pre-order for smash brothers.

3420
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:00,980
You're not the only one they screwed over, by the way.

3421
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,500
I'm hearing a lot of that on Facebook.

3422
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:05,900
The best buy really fucked it up with those pre-orders just so you know.

3423
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:07,580
So that's a big F you right there.

3424
02:32:07,580 --> 02:32:11,420
Um, another F he goes to the people playing Pokemon.

3425
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:16,660
Some of the people in Pokemon Omega Ruby alpha server saying, Oh my God, Salamence is broken.

3426
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:22,500
God, for fuck's sake, play the game long enough to before saying something is broken.

3427
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,500
The same.

3428
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:28,100
And of course, another big F you to some of the members of project M. Yes, I'm calling

3429
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:29,860
your asses out.

3430
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:34,660
If you don't like Super Smash Brothers 4, stick to your, um, Smash Brothers melee or

3431
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:39,480
your project or the worst part project M. I'm tired of hearing your God damn complaints

3432
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:46,540
about Oh, put project M in the game room when we have Smash 4 enough said, or you can all

3433
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:55,140
suck my balls, but seriously though, stop complaining and adapt to the new, um, new

3434
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:56,140
games and stuff.

3435
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:57,460
You guys want to play the old games?

3436
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,460
Go for it.

3437
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,460
Don't, but don't go wrong.

3438
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:02,980
Dictating other people what they should and shouldn't play.

3439
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,780
Or you can suck his balls.

3440
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:09,380
Uh, going to, um, my F you of the week.

3441
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:15,180
I did not really look at this, act depth, found some website that will actually analyze

3442
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:17,940
your steam library for you.

3443
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:26,400
And apparently I have 238 games, 144 of which I have not played.

3444
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:27,400
That is 61%.

3445
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:28,400
Wow.

3446
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,220
Did I call out?

3447
02:33:30,220 --> 02:33:31,220
That's that's pretty good.

3448
02:33:31,220 --> 02:33:32,220
That's pretty good.

3449
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:33,220
That's pretty good.

3450
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:34,220
I'm impressed.

3451
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:35,220
All right.

3452
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:36,220
Shock.

3453
02:33:36,220 --> 02:33:37,220
Fear.

3454
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:38,220
My meat.

3455
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:39,220
My meat.

3456
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:40,220
Laughs.

3457
02:33:40,220 --> 02:33:45,580
Well, and my terrible English skills.

3458
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:47,380
I don't want to fear your meat, Rob.

3459
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:49,860
That's my meat lab skills.

3460
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:53,020
Well, there you go.

3461
02:33:53,020 --> 02:33:54,420
Look at that.

3462
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,980
I was quite conservative in my guests.

3463
02:33:56,980 --> 02:34:02,580
It says I have not played 89% of my library, not 97%.

3464
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:03,820
You know what?

3465
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:05,060
Just F you to that whole bit.

3466
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:10,460
Well, I guess I'll just have to buy more games so that that number gets up to 97%.

3467
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:11,460
I know.

3468
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:14,220
Now I'm going to go in tonight and just launch each one of those games just to spite you

3469
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:15,220
people.

3470
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:16,220
Install them first.

3471
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:19,900
Then I'll give you some meat to fear.

3472
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:21,900
All right.

3473
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:27,140
Let's do a couple more news stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one

3474
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:35,820
eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype, Roaring Ounge ADO.

3475
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:37,460
All one word.

3476
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:38,460
Low key.

3477
02:34:38,460 --> 02:34:39,460
Congratulation.

3478
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:40,460
Congratulation.

3479
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:46,820
You got to move on over to the Skype line.

3480
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:48,060
OK.

3481
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:54,860
So Assassin's Creed Unity is getting a third patch, which will hopefully fix the whole

3482
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:57,780
face off glitches.

3483
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:05,780
So yes, apparently they've still got their I want to say it's like a weekly blog or daily

3484
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:06,780
blog.

3485
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:09,340
I don't know what some sort of blog that they have or they're keeping track of everything.

3486
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:13,980
The third update will be larger in scope and it says they're going to patch bugs like

3487
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:18,060
are getting stuck in certain areas of the map or glitching in and getting in and out

3488
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:21,660
of cover problems.

3489
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:22,660
So yeah.

3490
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:28,060
So apparently the patch will dramatically improve the experience.

3491
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:29,060
So more faces off.

3492
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:30,060
I don't know.

3493
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:31,060
We'll see.

3494
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:32,060
All right.

3495
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:33,700
They'll be patching in fun.

3496
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:34,700
But next patch.

3497
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:40,300
And of course I like I like this little like you know this under promise over deliver type

3498
02:35:40,300 --> 02:35:47,780
of phrasing here but it is noted though that this patch won't solve every problem.

3499
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:50,220
Some of them.

3500
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:51,220
All right.

3501
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:56,380
Well you know folks have been asking when will Final Fantasy 7 be remade for the PlayStation

3502
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,860
3 or the PlayStation 4.

3503
02:35:57,860 --> 02:35:59,820
When is that going to happen people?

3504
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:02,900
And the answer is it's happened.

3505
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:03,900
That's right.

3506
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:04,900
It was remade.

3507
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,900
Final Fantasy 7.

3508
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:06,900
Oh wait.

3509
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:07,900
There's a twist though.

3510
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:08,900
It was remade in LittleBigPlanet.

3511
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,900
Whoa Rob.

3512
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:14,700
You had me going there for a minute.

3513
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:16,900
Was your heart palapatating a little bit there?

3514
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:17,900
Absolutely.

3515
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:18,900
I knew it.

3516
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:19,900
I knew it.

3517
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:20,900
All right.

3518
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,780
Fear the meat of this game.

3519
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:27,340
Final Fantasy 7 remade in LittleBigPlanet 2.

3520
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,340
Apparently it's on YouTube.

3521
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:30,940
You can watch one hundred and seven videos on YouTube.

3522
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:33,460
The entire story in Final Fantasy 7.

3523
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,700
Apparently this took this guy like years to build.

3524
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:41,860
It was in LittleBigPlanet 2's engine and there's a whole website being created for this.

3525
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:50,340
It's Final Fantasy VII LittleBigPlanet2.weebly.com and that's where you can follow more updates

3526
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,780
on this and you can watch it on YouTube.

3527
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:52,780
It's something else.

3528
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:54,860
I want to know can I download and play it?

3529
02:36:54,860 --> 02:37:00,060
Because apparently the LittleBigPlanet 2 levels are supposed to be playable in 3 so I can

3530
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:01,740
play my Final Fantasy 7 remake.

3531
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:05,660
You can and I've watched video of it and it's derpy as fuck but okay.

3532
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:07,660
Okay but still come on.

3533
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:09,180
It's quite the accomplishment.

3534
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:16,940
It's quite the accomplishment but it's quite the derpy fucking accomplishment.

3535
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:17,940
Here's the thing though.

3536
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:22,660
Nothing will ever beat that level I played in the original LittleBigPlanet that was the

3537
02:37:22,660 --> 02:37:24,060
Parker Posey level.

3538
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:26,060
I remember that.

3539
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:33,380
It was like a fucking creepy ass stalker thing and you would unlock pictures of Parker Posey

3540
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:37,740
as you played the levels and it was like a tribute to Parker Posey level.

3541
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:39,100
It was like a long lengthy level.

3542
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:42,700
That was my favorite LittleBigPlanet level I ever played was the Parker Posey tribute.

3543
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:43,700
So that's still in the game.

3544
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:45,100
You should check that out.

3545
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:47,740
Anyhow, there it is.

3546
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:48,980
All the news we have on deck for tonight.

3547
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:53,820
So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype

I'm sorry say it again I said I'm doing good I just cooked an amazing dinner an amazing

3564
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:20,700
dinner you probably could have made a better sandwich than the one Loki got well I'll tell

3565
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:23,860
you what next time I come out there's always you have a crock pot I'll put together a mean

3566
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:28,500
little dinner for all y'all oh you better bet we have a crock pot we're a couple of guys living

3567
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:34,860
here in this house we love crock pots that's what I'm talking about it's great for a dinner

3568
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:40,820
and booze what's on your mind my friend a couple of things everyone you were talking about your

3569
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:47,220
Steam library and how many games you have and how many games you get to play and I'm like right

3570
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:56,060
now I'm staring at my ps2 ps3 Xbox Xbox 360 collection and I'm just like out of all these

3571
02:39:56,060 --> 02:40:00,540
games I can probably count on both hands how many games I have sat here and played it's gotten to

3572
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:04,660
the point where I'm just buying them just to say that I have it because I know if I don't buy it

3573
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:10,500
now I will not be able to get my hands on it later so you buy games just in fear that they're

3574
02:40:11,060 --> 02:40:17,420
disappear off the shelf too quick kind of sort of like project diva I kind of had to sell my soul

3575
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:21,740
to the devil and go to the shame stop to pick up the cop because it was only available there

3576
02:40:21,740 --> 02:40:27,380
honestly that's fair I understand that sometimes sometimes you have to do what you have to do

3577
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:34,660
mm-hmm pretty much sounds like Xenoblade let's not go there that pissed me off oh you think that's

3578
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:38,980
something I was looking at shame stops Black Friday said they put Metroid Prime trilogy up

3579
02:40:38,980 --> 02:40:44,340
there for 50 bucks oh gee what a steal it's gonna be more like how many people are gonna

3580
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:50,420
be going from store to store to store to store to find it oh I do want to get my hands on that

3581
02:40:50,420 --> 02:40:55,740
though at some point I mean you know it's just I refuse to pay all that money for it I mean 50

3582
02:40:55,740 --> 02:40:59,980
bucks is not bad I mean I will go looking for you but to be perfectly honest their Black Friday

3583
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:05,900
sales are kind of shitty to share yeah I know I understand what else you said there were a few

3584
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:12,660
things another thing is um if you don't remember but I'm also staffing a convention coming up in

3585
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:17,260
about two weeks called derpy con I Jamie's been talking about that on the show so yeah I thought

3586
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:21,180
for some reason that was like this weekend so it's a couple weeks out yeah this weekend was like the

3587
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:26,580
final meeting for everybody to get together and had the bag party got it got it so give us the

3588
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:31,780
details on the con cuz I I don't know much about it besides that it's called derpy con well derpy

3589
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:39,060
con is a multi-genre con so it's anime fantasy sci-fi all of it so it's gonna be panels about

3590
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:45,340
various things and on behalf of our network anime jam session we'll be doing a live podcast and I

3591
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:53,540
will also be hosting the karaoke contest oh nice mm-hmm where where is it in New York City actually

3592
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:59,380
no it's in the Hyatt Moore's the Hyatt at Morristown New Jersey it's basically three blocks

3593
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:03,660
from the train station there are plenty of food places around and is a movie theater built in

3594
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:08,500
like not built inside the hotel but next to the hotel is a convention center and if you go around

3595
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:14,940
the corner within there there's a movie theater is that why you're calling it derpy con cuz it's in

3596
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:25,180
New Jersey you would think come on that was too easy come on too easy oh New Jersey is I love I

3597
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:30,020
love your return stepbrother we all know that you know but I love New Jersey for the record I had a

3598
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:35,660
great I have great I great memories with Rama in New Jersey one good thing about Jersey gas it's

3599
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:40,300
like two dollars and fifty three cents a gallon and you can't pump it yourself yeah because

3600
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:47,140
somebody tried it once burnt down a gas station that's all right or organs the same way anyway

3601
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:53,860
anyway but but what's cool is that the way we're doing our game room we're going old school oh

3602
02:42:54,260 --> 02:43:00,220
really yes we're doing we're looking at Nintendo Super Nintendo and 64 Dreamcast nice maybe even

3603
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:05,480
Xbox ps1 ps2 we're just we're just keeping it old school what you didn't invite the teabaggers to

3604
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:15,060
get out the u-haul and drive out to Jersey realize that the teabaggers came out here there is quantum

3605
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:20,220
game there are other gaming groups that are like it will probably run them out of the area oh oh

3606
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:30,260
is this turning into West Side Story when you're a teabag you know you're a tub anyway actually

3607
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:34,420
might know some people there I was I'm not sure like what groups are actually curious which groups

3608
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:40,340
are actually gonna be at the gaming section actually work we're doing our own work we're

3609
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:44,780
doing with some cars that we're just gonna purchase older consoles or a couple of staffers

3610
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:49,540
gonna bring in their older consoles for play so in pretty much in-house pretty much yeah I like

3611
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:58,220
the big conventions like anime next Otacon they will they'll have their own consoles conventions

3612
02:43:58,220 --> 02:44:04,740
like Zenkai a USA they'll get a third party and they'll usually be affiliated with a gaming con

3613
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:11,980
such as too many games such as as an example of one of the bigger local smaller local gaming cons

3614
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:17,620
in the area well you said Otacon correct you said Otacon has their own in-house funding for game

3615
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:23,820
room I thought that was being funded by um or at least covered by um what's that group up save point

3616
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:31,300
save point not my knowledge if it's changed it's might have been recently because I have not gone

3617
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:37,700
to Otacon in like about a year or so so if that's changed I I had no idea but when you go in there

3618
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:44,220
you'll see like the boxes with the consoles it'll say property of Otacorp well be sure to share your

3619
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:48,540
plans with Jonas he can tell you everything you're doing wrong I'm kidding I'm kidding okay you know

3620
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:54,180
what he can do that I'll send him directly to the department of gate of video games and if you like

3621
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:59,980
dealing with the rock that's all you I just sit here I deal with the karaoke and then when the

3622
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:07,180
contest is over I break out the flask turn on open mic and Lego dear Lord that's it you know I wish

3623
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:11,140
I'd had some warning I would have loved to come out to derpy con and if you say karaoke I'm sure

3624
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:18,460
I could have gotten Irene out there too are doing a midnight thing for midnight karaoke so yeah you

3625
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:25,180
know it's nice well our staffers are rocky horror oh it's all I will plan now for derpy con to

3626
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:29,500
electric boogaloo you don't say it too loud because you know Jamie would jump right into

3627
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:36,180
your arm luggage for that one she is staff so yeah I know I know she's been talking about some

3628
02:45:36,180 --> 02:45:41,660
of the design work she's been doing for it so okay so so that'll be fun to have that take a

3629
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:45,860
lot of pictures since I can't be there I guess now is this good of a time to any to announce

3630
02:45:45,860 --> 02:45:55,460
this we're speaking about cons and East Coast um I am coming to Boston which convention I'm coming

3631
02:45:55,460 --> 02:46:08,700
to PAX East trolling me right now bro I'm not I'm not telling you I'm seriously coming out

3632
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:21,300
to PAX East so yeah I will be out there what is it like the plane tickets are bought I have the

3633
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:36,860

3634
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:42,140
that you're not gonna come to PAX East then oh did you did you oh you probably weren't there

3635
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:48,180
here's the thing I subscribe to all of their social media so I know exactly when the tickets

3636
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:55,860
were going on sale when the hotels were going up right they waited 20 minutes after they opened it

3637
02:46:55,860 --> 02:47:00,900
up and made announcements on social media that tickets were available in the hotel were available

3638
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:08,940
oh my god I jumped on it three a badges were gone oh my god by the end of the day at 6 p.m.

3639
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:17,380
when I was leaving work the entire conventions was sold out and I'm like I refuse to drop $800

3640
02:47:17,380 --> 02:47:22,980
on a scalper for this and I refuse to I'm not doing it that's not stressing myself over this

3641
02:47:22,980 --> 02:47:28,700
forget it that's what you need to do is wait for that second wave that they'll put up from the

3642
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:35,020
scalper tickets they recover they won't they won't they will no they didn't do it for New York Comic

3643
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:40,460
Con well that let's not get into that but let's just say they were they said they were doing it

3644
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:45,180
for New York Comic Con I was following a few of the scalpers let's just say the eBay auctions were

3645
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:53,140
still up there so frustrating I it's scalpers suck awful but what I will do maybe if Mako

3646
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:58,100
Chan is up to it maybe we will day trip up there we can hang out or something there you know we'll

3647
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:02,300
figure something out there you go it'll be a party all right I gotta let you go so we get more calls

3648
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:08,980
but wow I just dropped a bombshell in the chat room apparently because I did I posted on Twitter

3649
02:48:08,980 --> 02:48:13,820
I'm like by the way I'm coming to Boston March something to something so he missed that tweet

3650
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:18,540
alright well maybe Twitter's hiding things now too with Facebook all right take care buddy are

3651
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:22,820
you taking a bro all right bye bye time difference doesn't help either you know cuz if I post

3652
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:26,300
something at midnight then it's like 3 a.m. for the East Coast so maybe that's how they missed it

3653
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:31,540
I don't know anyhow one eight seven seven game olr or a username on Skype orange lounge radio if

3654
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:34,420
you'd like to give us a call let's get some more calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

3655
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:42,900
hello Paul here hey pal what's up kind of tired doing packing and stuff like that but everything

3656
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:49,900
okay going on a trip and no we're probably moving so he tried to do slowly no waiting

3657
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:56,380
until last minute oh probably well moving is like punishment for shoplifting in some countries I'm

3658
02:48:56,380 --> 02:49:02,060
pretty sure yeah yeah I think of some countries illegal or something it's just thorough what's

3659
02:49:02,060 --> 02:49:09,780
up buddy I was caught I was going just for my opinion regarding the amiibo um I bought some

3660
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:17,140
and it worked different I expected but not so certain necessarily a bad thing I was convinced

3661
02:49:17,140 --> 02:49:22,540
that we're not gonna be something like kind of more casual but it's strange and strangely enough

3662
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:28,940
I feel like it worked more for a hardcore gamer than for a casual gamer which I find it really

3663
02:49:28,940 --> 02:49:35,460
strange if you compare it with the skylander or or business infinity how so what what made you

3664
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:43,340
decide that it was more of a hardcore thing because I don't see a kid for example buying

3665
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:52,300
one and saying oh I really want to figure that we're learn to fight the same way I fight I just

3666
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:58,260
don't see a kid saying oh that's a great idea but if you're really really good in a smash which I'm

3667
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:04,780
not but if you're really really good and you train it they really end up fighting then what you do

3668
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:12,300
like for example I jump a lot and I always forget to block because I just forget then they figured

3669
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:18,940
out after it reaches a high level like 40 or 50 it really played the way I play like I forget to

3670
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:25,020
cover all the time and it a jump all the time and it was kind of annoying it was hard to play like

3671
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:29,820
a fighting against a ghost of myself or something you know I need to know if they're gonna put out

3672
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:34,900
an amiibo for the master hand because that's the only time I remember to block is on that stupid

3673
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:42,140
hand I never remember to block and I never remember to grab and when someone does online

3674
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:52,620
I'm like what it was oh yeah it's growing but I think it's it can I like it but I think it has

3675
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:57,340
some kind of a strange identity crisis because that kind of toys is probably really appealing

3676
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:03,620
for kids but the usefulness in this match it feels like it's way more if you're really into this

3677
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:08,020
match and you want to like train yourself or something like that because it's a really an

3678
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:14,540
AI that adapts to your gameplay which I don't see that is really kids friendly so I like it

3679
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:20,460
but it's a strange is definitely not the way I expected but which amiibos did you pick up I got

3680
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:32,740
the really classic ones like Mario Donkey Kong I got the ones that I was worried and maybe in a

3681
02:51:32,740 --> 02:51:37,780
year from now two years from now when Nintendo decides to do amiibo amiibo world or something

3682
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:43,380
party with you and then suddenly will be all remember those amiibos I even buy well now you

3683
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:47,980
can use in this game but nobody can find that figure in I hear some of those figures are already

3684
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:53,100
going up in price and getting harder to find because yay scalpers but apparently Marth is

3685
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:57,220
one of the harder to find figures that just came out and some people are seeing it on eBay already

3686
02:51:57,220 --> 02:52:04,180
for 30 bucks so it's like and we all knew this stupid shit would happen so I'm whatever yeah I

3687
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:09,180
wish sometimes they put some limit to people I'm not never gonna do that but I know it was

3688
02:52:09,180 --> 02:52:16,140
ridiculous like 24 hours later just checking eBay it was just that the reselling was insane

3689
02:52:16,380 --> 02:52:20,740
like I'm sure just people go around Walmart just buying all of them or something oh yeah

3690
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:25,340
it's a whole thing there's probably seedy websites they gather Intel on and what's going to be

3691
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:31,540
popular and how to get them but anyway all right yeah they sell pre-sales all right well pal I'm

3692
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:34,300
gonna let you go so we can get more calls but I'm glad to hear you have a good time with amiibos

3693
02:52:34,300 --> 02:52:39,540
thank you and also I follow your other program I discovered the other a and even though I don't

3694
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:45,300
play Wow I don't play Final Fantasy 14 I really enjoy it well thank you grandpa and next for will

3695
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:52,020
appreciate the plug all right all right bye it's good to hear from pal and look at this the

3696
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:55,980
skyline lighting up oh my gosh just call after call try to get at least one more in hi you're

3697
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:59,380
on orange ons radio who's this yeah what's up this guy judo hey guys you know what's on your

3698
02:52:59,380 --> 02:53:05,900
mind buddy I'm gonna tell you in one second I just wanted to to tell that last caller what he

3699
02:53:05,900 --> 02:53:12,020
could do is if he's not really that good at smash have his amiibo fight with him instead of against

3700
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:16,980
him and it'll pick up from like what the computer is doing and it'll get a lot better than what he

3701
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:22,700
can teach it and also amiibo versus amiibo is a lot is like 10 times better than um you fighting

3702
02:53:22,700 --> 02:53:26,740
your amiibo so in other words you could just put the amiibo in there with a bunch of CPU characters

3703
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:32,380
at level 9 and why don't you just learn from the best yeah exactly even though those level

3704
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:37,580
nines aren't really that great it's like they tell you to I just fight amiibo versus amiibo

3705
02:53:37,580 --> 02:53:43,940
interest like you know yeah is it is I think it's really cool I think um I kind of disagree I think

3706
02:53:43,940 --> 02:53:48,620
I think kids don't enjoy it it's kind of like you know it's like a kid has a little a little

3707
02:53:48,620 --> 02:53:53,540
little buddy to take along with him and play if he doesn't have you know if his friends don't have

3708
02:53:53,540 --> 02:53:57,820
the game or is late at night and he can't have friends over just pop that little sucker in there

3709
02:53:57,820 --> 02:54:02,540
and you have a little sparring partner it's better set a fight in the computer I think kids will be

3710
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:07,420
in it probably more for just the figures themselves but I think pow had a decent point that like

3711
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:12,700
kids may not be thinking on that secondary level where adults are like oh I gotta get this cuz

3712
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:17,260
it's gonna unlock here and it'll be easy here and dah dah dah but I don't know I then again I thought

3713
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:22,460
that like game the nine years old I subscribe I could I could I could remember being a kid and

3714
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:28,020
when I was a kid there was never a time where I wanted a action figure based off a video game like

3715
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:33,180
a video game already feels like a toy already yeah so I don't really see kids using their imagination

3716
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:38,540
like getting excited over a freaking Mario figure or Princess Peach figure you like you know they

3717
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:43,460
see them for what they are you know they'll they'll be looking for some other cool toy that's out

3718
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:46,800
there I don't think they're necessarily gonna use these things as toys I know I wouldn't I got

3719
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:55,100
excited for the princess it's like I wish that they would just have like them actually be action

3720
02:54:55,100 --> 02:55:00,020
figures like have it be an action figure and have the base attached to it and yeah so what if it

3721
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:03,780
comes off the base at least if you have the base and you can play the game I still think these

3722
02:55:03,780 --> 02:55:07,700
things are gonna do better than people I don't think they're gonna like top Skylanders but I

3723
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:11,460
think they're gonna do better than people are expecting and this is gonna be Nintendo's way

3724
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:17,220
of saying see we didn't have to do a mobile phone game we can do this so yeah I had the I have the

3725
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:21,980
Star Fox amigo and like just like look he said it's like I'm tempted to bend his arm like it

3726
02:55:21,980 --> 02:55:27,140
looks like an arm and bend down like he looks like a poseable action figure but you can't but

3727
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:31,900
it's a really cool-looking uh whatever the hell you want to call it but what I'm here to call

3728
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:35,620
about was you're talking about Ghostbusters earlier yeah and I'm have a game recommendation

3729
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:41,780
for you you need to get ghost control ink on Steam it's almost it's not exactly the Ghostbusters

3730
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:46,100
from the you know that you were talking about but it's kind of like kind of like a combination

3731
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:53,540
of Ghostbusters and what's the other thing xcom and basically it's like it's turn-based you

3732
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:57,860
travel around the city where actually you're traveling around London and you're busting

3733
02:55:57,860 --> 02:56:01,380
ghosts it's a lot of fun the graphics suck so if you're really in the graphics you're not probably

3734
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:05,780
not gonna like it but I'm like we don't mind like the 8-bit looking graphics because I mean that's

3735
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:09,980
real it looks like it's something out of Nintendo I just googled it to get a little more information

3736
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:13,060
on it while you're talking about it and it looks like this is something that they got on Kickstarter

3737
02:56:13,060 --> 02:56:17,980
and one of these links goes to Kickstarter the graphics look like game dev tycoon or something

3738
02:56:17,980 --> 02:56:21,940
like that yeah yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's basically one of those I forgot what they call

3739
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:27,300
them they're like like a financial simulator or a business simulator so you know you have to

3740
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:33,380
balance your money you know you you upgrade your equipment it's a lot of fun it's a lot like like

3741
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:37,460
I said it's not a lot like xcom but it has that ghostbusters theme to it and it's really silly

3742
02:56:37,460 --> 02:56:42,580
like the game doesn't take yourself serious like there's times where you pick up your um your cell

3743
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:46,260
phone because you get calls while you're like you know driving around and it's just mumbles

3744
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:54,980
like they talk like sims yeah yeah yeah it's completely bonkers and um it's a never-ending

3745
02:56:54,980 --> 02:57:00,980
game I love my sandbox and open world never-ending game so as once you beat it you can still continue

3746
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:04,580
to play it for as long as you want so that's my favorite part about it there you go there's

3747
02:57:04,580 --> 02:57:08,340
something I'll have to keep an eye out for on the steam sale so yep all right now I'm gonna let

3748

02:57:38,820 --> 02:57:43,460
going to talk a little bit more about goat simulator please mmo or you know go mmo simulator

3756
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:48,340
so apparently there's a spot in the game where there's a hole in the wall you jump into the wall

3757
02:57:48,340 --> 02:57:54,260
you find out it's a concrete room full of servers and it being goat simulator you can smash those

3758
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:59,700
servers and eventually as you smash the servers more and more stuff breaks eventually the textures

3759
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:04,180
stop drying and eventually the wire frames break and eventually you get logged out

3760
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:12,340
brilliant absolutely brilliant and that's all free once you buy the game I think I'm gonna

3761
02:58:12,340 --> 02:58:15,700
need to try to get these guys on the show for Loki because I think he's a bit of a fan they're

3762
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:23,540
not they're in Europe oh well we had the geometry wars guys years and years and years ago they were

3763
02:58:23,540 --> 02:58:28,340
in Europe you never know you never know all right uh anyhow uh let's go around and wrap up and get

3764
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:32,980
final thoughts um Jonas thank you for being here and uh best of luck with everything with the tea

3765
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:37,060
bagger on through the holidays hope you have a good thanksgiving oh thank you and all that uh

3766
02:58:37,060 --> 02:58:42,020
what cons next for you guys sack anime in January I know just sack anime right now gotcha all right

3767
02:58:42,020 --> 02:58:47,060
uh people can follow you guys on Facebook though yeah we got a couple of new followers ever since

3768
02:58:47,060 --> 02:58:52,260
the championships as well as Smash Brothers and and Pokemon nice coming out because I

3769
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:57,300
guess people want to know when the tournament starts and if there's gonna be a player smash

3770
02:58:57,300 --> 02:59:01,940
in the actual game room which most likely has to be yes because there's gonna be so

3771
02:59:01,940 --> 02:59:08,260
many people playing smash right so get eight people through and next eight people come up next

3772
02:59:08,260 --> 02:59:12,820
all right well uh let me know if you do the robo amiibo competition there and I'll uh I'll uh

3773
02:59:12,820 --> 02:59:18,740
I'll probably buy into that my my trained at home amiibo amiibo versus amiibo mecha amiibo

3774
02:59:19,540 --> 02:59:23,620
anything yeah I actually can bring up a question to the people see if it's if it's if the interest

3775
02:59:23,620 --> 02:59:27,380
is good enough yeah we could probably pull something up maybe for SAC on like next year

3776
02:59:27,380 --> 02:59:31,540
since we might be doing SAC on but that's still in the works all right well good luck to you

3789
03:00:34,820 --> 03:00:43,540
thought uh don't forget to fear Rob's meat super meat boy

3790
03:00:46,660 --> 03:00:52,100
oh that's it okay yeah yeah all right fair enough uh let's see Loki your final thought tonight

3791
03:00:52,100 --> 03:00:56,420
uh I need to work more of a game yes you do we didn't get an update this week that means you

3792
03:00:56,420 --> 03:01:02,500
didn't work on it uh not necessarily I worked on like just concept stuff because I'm trying to

3793
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:10,980
figure out how to redo uh the engine again just to make it faster with doing um geometry checking

3794
03:01:10,980 --> 03:01:16,900
and stuff like that so that I can remove extra geometry because I got to the point where I run

3795
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:25,060
out of space really fast in each 3d objects on that to make a chunk system and try to find a

3796
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:30,180
way to check it because before once I get like you know so many objects on the screen it would lock up

3797
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:35,620
for a few seconds when you add a new one so I can't have that that doesn't work so I have to

3798
03:01:35,620 --> 03:01:42,820
figure out how Minecraft does it or the other other voxel games do it because that's unfortunately

3799
03:01:42,820 --> 03:01:47,380
I didn't want to have to do it that way but that's the way I got to do it all right and uh

3800
03:01:47,380 --> 03:01:51,780
