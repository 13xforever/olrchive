00:00.000 --> 00:17.480
This week, excitement in online gaming as Blizzard struggles to maintain World of Warcraft's

00:17.480 --> 00:20.720
uptime after Draenor's release and another Sony Network cracking scare.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.440
Even if they're down, we'll tell you about some interesting alternatives along with your

00:23.440 --> 00:30.440
comments, calls, and emails right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.280
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.560
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.560 --> 00:45.760
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 576, November the 23rd of 2014,

00:45.760 --> 00:49.840
joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

00:49.840 --> 00:51.080
gamer lifestyle.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.760
Here in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.600
Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.160
She is out tonight.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.840
I believe it is her husband's birthday tomorrow, today, tomorrow today?

01:04.840 --> 01:09.960
Somewhere around there, but the celebration is today, so she's out to go celebrate with

01:09.960 --> 01:14.400
her man, so I hope she's having a good time, and happy birthday, Dan, whenever it happens

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
to be.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.600
But here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Hello.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.600
Hi, Loki, how are you doing?

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
I'm doing okay.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.640
Except for my dinner sucked.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.120
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.600
You know, for those that are playing the home game, the ever popular listening to OLR, betting

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
pool.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.200
What did Loki eat for dinner tonight game?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
You went to Jack in the Box.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
I went to Jack in the Box.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.040
Which these coasters wouldn't think of right away.

01:35.040 --> 01:41.040
Yeah, so I went to Jack in the Box, and they got a turkey bacon cheddar sandwich.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.240
It is the season.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.520
Which is fine, I mean, you know, because sandwiches have a, I normally get the bacon ultimate

01:46.520 --> 01:50.520
cheeseburger, and I'm just, you know, after a while it gets, you know.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
It's the same thing.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
You have to shake it up a little bit.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
Variety.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.440
And their sandwich is nasty.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.680
I don't know, they put some sort of sauce on it, it's just gross, so.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
Was it like cranberry?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
Because it's turkey?

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
It's not cranberry.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.440
No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, it just tasted sour.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.320
And seeing with the fries, the fries are good until that last fry, the very last fry I had

02:11.320 --> 02:12.320
was just off.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.960
It was just like something, and it's like this sour taste, I had like literally spit

02:16.960 --> 02:17.960
it out of my mouth.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.960
And now that is the fry that is representative of the whole.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.760
The fry that's like stuck permeating in my mouth, like thanks, you know.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.160
Every time you think about your horrible Jack in the Box night, you're going to remember

02:27.160 --> 02:28.160
that fry.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.840
Well, it was just like, you know, I had, left late because I was putting away laundry, and

02:32.840 --> 02:38.240
they had the bleach to sink, and just annoying stuff, and so I got late, you know, I didn't

02:38.240 --> 02:41.560
get to order a pizza or anything like that, and I was like, you know, driving, I'm like,

02:41.560 --> 02:45.200
well I can stop here, well I might not be on time if I stop here, so.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.640
I'm like, well it's either going to be McDonald's or Jack in the Box, I, McDonald's is kind

02:49.640 --> 02:58.440
of meh at this time of day, so I'll do Jack in the Box, and yeah, I was just kind of like,

02:58.440 --> 03:02.000
I guess I'll have that, and then it was just terrible.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.840
I do want to talk about games of course, because this is a video game podcast, but quickly

03:05.840 --> 03:09.700
I thought I'd ask you since you're on the topic of food, it is the week of the Thanksgiving

03:09.700 --> 03:11.920
holiday here in the States.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.800
Happy Thanksgiving to you out there, for those of you that are celebrating it this week.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.360
If you aren't celebrating Thanksgiving this week, well enjoy in your country from the

03:19.360 --> 03:24.000
comfort of your living room, watching the crazies in this country on Black Friday.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.400
Enjoy watching everybody on television at the local Walmart fighting over a $5 crock

03:28.400 --> 03:33.300
pot, you know, pulling out weaves, threatening people, somebody will get shot, some shopping

03:33.300 --> 03:34.520
mall somewhere.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.200
Have fun from the comfort of your home wherever you may be.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
No, no, no, no.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.440
No one will get shot, someone will get trampled to death, that's the new shot.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.600
You know what, I'm going to stay home and play video games, that was the way Black Friday

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
was meant to be.

03:46.600 --> 03:54.520
You'll stay home and you go on certain online, you know, purchasing websites to...

03:54.520 --> 03:58.480
You make it sound shady, like am I going on XTube, where am I going?

03:58.480 --> 04:05.440
You don't purchase anything on XTube, seriously, all the content there is lone.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.760
That's Cyber Monday, Loki, get with your buzzword lingo.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.360
But it's all the pre-Black Friday stuff.

04:14.360 --> 04:18.520
Now it's pre-Black, oh that's right, what do they call it, Gray Thursday?

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
No, it's Thanksgiving.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
It's Thanksgiving.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.520
It's not Gray Thursday.

04:21.520 --> 04:22.520
It's Thanksgiving.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.200
It might happen to be gray outside, because we're having that kind of weather, but it's

04:26.200 --> 04:27.200
Thanksgiving.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.200
Gray Thursday.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.640
I heard that term on the news the other day, and I'm like, it's fucking Thanksgiving.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.360
They're dumb, they're just trying to be buzz-worthy.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.400
I know, I know, and then they have a graphic to go with it.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.400
Gray Thursday.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.740
Alright, anyhow, hey, look, when we're feeling sad and gray, we always have this gal here

04:41.740 --> 04:43.080
to cheer us up.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.960
Joining us in studio tonight, welcome back to the show for the Multitap podcast.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.760
Hey, hold on, hold on, I gotta, sorry, I gotta, I-

04:49.760 --> 04:53.000
Way to wreck the intro, this better be good.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.160
Ron must suggest he and I go to Subway.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.200
No, now see, now I've been to Subway, and I even thought about that, but Subway also

04:59.200 --> 05:01.720
tends to be pretty crappy this time of night.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.480
Did you, did you literally interrupt the guest's introduction to talk about a fucking sandwich?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
Did you?

05:07.480 --> 05:08.480
Yes.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.840
To be fair, Subway's horrible, I agree.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.600
It's true.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.480
Welcome to the show, Princess Irene.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Huddle.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.520
How are you?

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
Would you like a sandwich?

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
Fuck no.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.520
I already had one earlier.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
How are you doing, Princess Irene?

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
I'm okay, I'm good.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
Yeah?

05:25.520 --> 05:26.520
How are you?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.960
Good, thanks for jumping in to fill in tonight.

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
Sure.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
How are things for you?

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
How's life been treating you lately?

05:31.960 --> 05:32.960
It's exactly the same.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
Exactly the same.

05:33.960 --> 05:34.960
Yeah.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.600
I would ask you, well, what, you know, usually I go, oh, well, what's new on the Multitap

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
podcast?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.240
But like, you were just here like six weeks ago, so I mean, did you do anything in the

05:41.240 --> 05:43.600
past six weeks that we all know about?

05:43.600 --> 05:47.120
I think we released like a couple of episodes.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
Go check them out.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
Yeah.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
Whoa.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.120
Hey.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
Where can folks hear the Multitap podcast?

05:52.120 --> 05:55.960
Just briefly, for those new listeners who might have gotten the past couple of weeks,

05:55.960 --> 05:59.720
where is the Multitap podcast and what can folks expect to hear on it?

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
Sure.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.360
You can find it on FFOP.net.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.880
That stands for Fistful of Potions, and that's kind of our umbrella place that we kind of

06:10.880 --> 06:11.880
Sure, sure.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.880
Yeah.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.880
I'm sorry.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.960
But I and I mean this with all complete respect, but I can't get out of my head that it's Fistful

06:17.960 --> 06:18.960
of Poop.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
Like a monkey.

06:19.960 --> 06:20.960
Neither can I, Rob.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.960
Fistful of Poop.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.960
FFOP.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
All right.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.960
So that's a good way to remember it.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
Yeah, I know.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
Whatever works, right?

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
Right.

06:28.960 --> 06:29.960
Right.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
Right.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.560
And you can probably expect to hear just a lot of crap.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
Way to talk up your show.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
I know.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.560
Woo!

06:37.560 --> 06:38.560
Fistful of Poop.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.560
That's right.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.240
To the boom.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
Rimshot.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.240
FFOP.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
Right.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
No, it's a fun show.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.640
It's a bummer we couldn't get any of your co-hosts back tonight, but you're plenty.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.640
Yeah.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.640
Everyone's out of town.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.640
Oh.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.640
Well, that happens during Thanksgiving.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
Go figure.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
That's right.

06:53.640 --> 06:54.640
Yeah.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.640
Go figure.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
Let's see.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.720
What else do I want to ask you about?

06:57.720 --> 07:04.560
This week was 20 November, which was another holiday of sorts for the DDR and music game

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
nerds.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.940
I guess it's totally dead in my mind now.

07:06.940 --> 07:11.500
The two day celebration of 19 November and 20 November happened this past week, which

07:11.500 --> 07:15.660
if you don't know what that means, there was a song in the, I believe it was in the original

07:15.660 --> 07:16.660
DDR.

07:16.660 --> 07:18.960
No, I don't think it showed up until third mix.

07:18.960 --> 07:19.960
You know where it was?

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
It was in Beatmania.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.680
It was in Beatmania, the five key game.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.660
There was a song called 20 November.

07:24.660 --> 07:29.100
So that has kind of been adapted as the unofficial Bamani holiday.

07:29.100 --> 07:35.060
So and you and I didn't necessarily meet playing DDR as I met a lot like that's how I met Loki.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.480
It's how I met Dark Sakura.

07:36.480 --> 07:40.600
You and I knew each other before that, thanks to Rocky Horror and other things.

07:40.600 --> 07:46.320
But Bamani was a huge part of your life as well as mine.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.800
How did you kind of get into music games way back in the day and what did that do for you?

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
Me?

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
Yeah.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.700
Well, I think the first time we played DDR was when we went to Las Vegas.

07:57.700 --> 08:01.440
We went to like a Rocky con or something like that and we just saw it and you're like, oh,

08:01.440 --> 08:02.440
this looks really cool.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.440
And I'm like, that's stupid.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
I don't want to dance in front of people.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
I'm like, dumb.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.920
And then you played it and I think I played a game, but then I just, I kept following

08:10.920 --> 08:14.640
you to places like arcades and stuff and you kept playing DDR and I was like, oh, I'll

08:14.640 --> 08:15.640
play it too.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.640
And it was really fun.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
Yeah, it was.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.640
It was the music.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.640
Right.

08:19.640 --> 08:20.640
It's all about the music.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.520
I don't remember the second part of your question.

08:22.520 --> 08:28.620
Oh, what are some memorable experiences you got out of the whole thing from being a part

08:28.620 --> 08:32.280
of the Bamani community for a few years?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.200
I guess I got like friends and stuff from it.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.600
That was pretty cool.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.600
Right on.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.600
Is that how you met Fafop?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.600
Not even remotely.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.600
I met Fafop.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
I met them through school.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Gotcha.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
Yeah.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.680
I will remember a favorite memory that involved you.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.600
And that was, we went to a tournament in Los Angeles, you and me, it was called the cyber

08:56.600 --> 08:58.280
beat nation tournament.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.600
This tournament was at Koreatown was what was like little Korea.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.560
And I don't remember the name of the place, but this is a really big tournament.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.260
This is one of the biggest tournaments they probably had.

09:08.260 --> 09:11.240
And there was a lot of freestyle and there was perfect attack.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.520
And pretty much throughout the entire weekend in the back of the arcade, there was Irene

09:15.520 --> 09:23.740
and I in a tiny little booth singing karaoke for hours and hours and hours.

09:23.740 --> 09:27.280
We played the fuck out of that machine.

09:27.280 --> 09:32.880
This was before karaoke revolution or rock band or any of that shit.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.840
There was this little thing, and the thing about it was not only could you sit there

09:36.840 --> 09:42.000
and sing the songs, which there was a lot of American songs in there, even though some

09:42.000 --> 09:46.960
of them had been translation, translation back again, like Google translate one way

09:46.960 --> 09:47.960
in the back again.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.720
There was a lot of Japanese songs and Korean songs and things in it too.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.320
So we would go through the catalog and when you would sing the songs, you got scored at

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
the end.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.560
And the whole thing became about like getting a high score.

09:58.560 --> 10:05.120
And I remember I got a 100 on some song and then you did a song and got like a 21.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.160
I'm pretty sure it was the lower score, the better.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.760
I seem to distinctly recall.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.760
It was like golf.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.760
It was like golf.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.760
Yes, exactly.

10:12.760 --> 10:13.760
Yeah, I was on par.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
Yeah.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
So there you go.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.260
There's a memory involving Irene for you guys was going to a DDR tournament to play karaoke

10:19.260 --> 10:20.260
all weekend.

10:20.260 --> 10:21.260
Right.

10:21.260 --> 10:24.520
Like you guys don't even know we were in that booth the entire weekend.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.760
I don't even know who won the damn tournament.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
I really don't.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
Yeah.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
I don't think we gave a shot.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
Like really.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.040
And I think when people would come close to the booth to try to play the game, we would

10:34.040 --> 10:36.120
like bark at them or something like, fuck off.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.120
This is our game.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.360
This is our territory.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.480
You know what is really too bad about that whole thing too.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.640
And I guess I can talk about this now.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.380
It's been years and years, but they never did the sequel.

10:45.380 --> 10:49.400
And they actually had asked me to MC the second tournament if they did one.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.880
And I was always like, fuck yeah, I'll do it.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
Yeah.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
That sounds really exciting.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
It's a huge tournament.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.800
They didn't have the opportunity for OLR, which was still blooming at the time and everything,

10:56.800 --> 10:58.240
but they didn't end up having the tournament.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
And I don't remember why.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
I don't know.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.240
I don't think the arcade went under or anything, but it's just, they didn't get the interest

11:03.240 --> 11:04.240
or something happened.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.420
They couldn't financially pull it off.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.960
So that was always too bad.

11:06.960 --> 11:11.520
And you, I mean, I think the prize that you wanted that one was a DDR machine, right?

11:11.520 --> 11:12.520
I think so.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.120
And how do you fucking top that?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.400
It's kind of downhill from there.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
It was like a solo 2000 or something.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.400
It was still pretty awesome.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
Yeah.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
Yeah.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.920
Considering it was like 2002 or something.

11:22.960 --> 11:28.240
So, uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

11:28.240 --> 11:32.520
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

11:32.520 --> 11:34.040
voice of geeks network.

11:34.040 --> 11:39.280
That's vognetwork.com and our chat room of course, at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Raginator

11:39.280 --> 11:46.040
in our chat asking, is there any chance that Irene could change fafop.com to fafap.com?

11:46.040 --> 11:48.880
I think we talked about that last time you were here that like, you might have to get

11:48.880 --> 11:50.760
that domain as well as forward.

11:50.760 --> 11:51.760
Yeah.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.560
I'm currently working on that as of five seconds ago.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
Okay.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.800
You have your people working on it right now.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
Yes.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
Yes.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
All right.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.800
That's happening.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
That's happening.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
Uh, let's see.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.440
Rama pointing out that November 20th was also DDR's 16th anniversary.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.360
Oh my gosh.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.360
Shut the front door.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.360
16 years.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
That's true.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.360
1998 was the year it launched.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.360
Right.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.360
Oh my gosh.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.360
And we first played it in 2000.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.360
You and I.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.360
Was it 2000?

12:19.360 --> 12:21.360
Cause it was at the Rocky 25th convention in Vegas.

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
Yeah.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
Yeah.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.840
It was you, me, iguana girl and somebody else was there with us, I thought.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
All playing.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
Yeah.

12:30.840 --> 12:31.840
I don't remember.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.840
I don't remember.

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
Somebody else was with us.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
It was so long ago.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.840
I know.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
As our memories are fading.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
I have Alzheimer's.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
Um, let's see.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.720
Act F pointing out the 20 November is also Mexican revolution day.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.720
Whoa.

12:42.720 --> 12:47.000
Well, maybe that's why it's dance, dance revolution.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.440
So wouldn't it be like by Llamas by Llamas, I don't know Spanish.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.440
I'm sorry.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.200
I just ruined that joke, but I have a Luciano.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.880
If I titled these episodes, tonight's episode would be by Llamas revolution.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
Yeah.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
There you go.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.480
Uh, well, you know, in Europe it was called dancing stage.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.800
I do know that because I guess, you know, you can't say revolution over there.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.480
It's a bad word.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.480
So it's dancing.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
That's true.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
It really is called dancing stage.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
Right.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.480
Call.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.600
It's one of those things where like, they finally released it as DDR years later.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.040
They just knew that it was going to be a fad, so you're going to go through this dancing

13:24.040 --> 13:25.040
stage.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.920
Well, it's like, it was like us and dragon quest for some reason it was dragon warrior.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.600
And then finally at some point they were like, all right, it's dragon quest.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Yeah.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.520
Make up your fucking minds guys.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.160
Oh my gosh.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
All right.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.720
Um, let's see.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.400
Also in this part of November around Thanksgiving and because of the black Friday and the $5

13:43.400 --> 13:48.280
crock pots I talked about a minute ago, this is the time of year where all the games are

13:48.280 --> 13:52.600
coming out because you got to get your game on the shelf before black Friday, the official

13:52.600 --> 13:57.160
start of the holiday season, because you know, that's when people are going to go out and

13:57.160 --> 13:58.880
get the gifts that are going to show up under the tree.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.080
The games sell the most during this time of year.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.840
So we just have an avalanche of games to pick from this week.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.340
Um, I do want to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been

14:08.340 --> 14:09.700
playing this week.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.800
But before we get into that completely, I kind of want to ask you, how do you pick the

14:14.800 --> 14:16.420
games that you're going to play this week?

14:16.420 --> 14:18.060
And this might be a really tough question.

14:18.060 --> 14:21.780
I'm going to pose this in our chat room too over at live.vognetwork.com.

14:21.780 --> 14:24.320
How are you picking out of all these games?

14:24.320 --> 14:27.220
You know, not everybody can afford to buy all 10 games they want.

14:27.220 --> 14:31.120
Some people can't really afford to buy one of the games they want, but how are you able

14:31.120 --> 14:35.460
to pick which game it is that you are going to play this week?

14:35.460 --> 14:37.620
Loki, I'll start with you.

14:37.620 --> 14:38.620
How did I pick which game?

14:38.620 --> 14:39.620
How did you pick?

14:39.620 --> 14:45.820
I bought, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, and so I played that for a bit, at least a few

14:45.820 --> 14:53.340
days out of the week, and then the other few days I played Lego Marvel Super Heroes, mainly

14:53.340 --> 14:58.540
because one of the days I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto 5, it was downloading a patch,

14:58.540 --> 14:59.860
and so it took a long time.

14:59.860 --> 15:03.900
It was going to be like another hour before I could play it, and I was like, eh, I'm just

15:03.900 --> 15:04.900
going to play something else.

15:04.900 --> 15:11.020
And so I played that, and I kept playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

15:11.020 --> 15:15.700
I did want to get Far Cry, maybe Dragon Age Inquisition.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.700
Why?

15:16.700 --> 15:17.700
Why?

15:17.700 --> 15:21.940
Far Cry 3, I loved that game, and it looks like a pretty incredible game, and Inquisition,

15:21.940 --> 15:23.680
everybody's kind of doing it.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
So it's like, got to get it.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.060
Peer pressure is, okay, I mean, this is the thing people don't usually want to admit,

15:29.060 --> 15:30.780
but is peer pressure a factor?

15:30.780 --> 15:31.780
I'll kind of openly admit.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.780
I mean, I want to get games that I can play with friends with, and unfortunately not everybody's

15:35.780 --> 15:38.700
on the Grand Theft Auto bandwagon, because I don't know what's wrong with you people,

15:38.700 --> 15:43.680
but seriously, not everybody's on that bandwagon, and so...

15:43.680 --> 15:46.980
If it had come out like a month sooner, I probably would have bought it, but now it

15:46.980 --> 15:50.660
has to compete with all this other stuff, and it's like, okay, I spent like $200 on

15:50.660 --> 15:51.660
video games this week.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.660
That's a lot of money.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.660
No more.

15:54.660 --> 15:55.660
You know?

15:55.660 --> 15:56.660
I don't know.

15:56.660 --> 15:57.660
I don't have to get Inquisition.

15:57.660 --> 16:03.420
See, the thing is, I'm waiting for the Black Friday sales to see what's going to be discounted,

16:03.420 --> 16:06.580
because there's even like, you know, I've been seeing some of the early stuff, and like

16:06.580 --> 16:12.100
they have, was it Middle Earth Shadows of Mordor for like 25 bucks?

16:12.100 --> 16:14.420
I mean, that just came out.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.580
Why is it discounted so much?

16:15.580 --> 16:17.300
It was supposed to be a pretty good game.

16:17.300 --> 16:22.220
I mean, that might be worth picking up, or Wolfenstein down to $25, although I'm not

16:22.220 --> 16:25.660
sure if I want to buy, because I'm already sitting on like a few games on my PlayStation

16:25.660 --> 16:27.500
4 that I haven't played yet.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.780
Like I have Watch Dogs and Destiny that haven't been touched yet.

16:31.780 --> 16:34.860
And I know it's coming up later in the show, but it's no secret that this time of year

16:34.860 --> 16:37.540
means a Steam sale is going to be coming at some point.

16:37.540 --> 16:38.940
Speaking of things I haven't touched yet.

16:38.940 --> 16:39.940
Right?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.380
And that's just going to be the problem worse.

16:41.380 --> 16:44.020
Then it'll be like, oh, I just picked up $2 games.

16:44.020 --> 16:47.380
Here's the thing though, I'm getting to the point now, even with like the Humblebundles,

16:47.380 --> 16:50.800
and I tend to buy most of the Humblebundles, I'm getting to the point where I'm not picking

16:50.800 --> 16:53.220
up because I own most of the games already.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.220
Right.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.820
And it's getting to the point where they're repeating enough stuff where it's like, well

16:56.820 --> 16:57.820
shit.

16:57.820 --> 17:02.060
You know, like this last Humblebundle I bought, I bought the highest tier so I could change

17:02.060 --> 17:03.500
to a four so I can give the Rob.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.460
But uh, thank you by the way, it was very nice of you to have no time to play it.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.460
Exactly.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.300
It's like, you know, all these other games, like I looked at my list of unredeemed keys

17:11.300 --> 17:12.820
on the Humblebundle and I'm like, well shit.

17:12.820 --> 17:13.820
Yeah.

17:13.820 --> 17:14.820
Cause I have all these already.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.300
How many copies of Fez do I have?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.420
Like way too many damn copies of Fez.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.420
More than anyone needs.

17:19.420 --> 17:24.420
You know, it's just, it's ridiculous like, oh hey, cool grid unlocked in grid two.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.020
I'm never going to play these games.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.660
Why am I buying these things?

17:28.660 --> 17:29.660
All right.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.620
I'll come back to you later and ask you more specifics about how Grand Theft Auto five

17:32.620 --> 17:33.620
is going and all that.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.980
Uh, look at our chat room though.

17:34.980 --> 17:38.820
Cause I asked you guys in chat what, uh, you know, what you are weighing and what to play

17:38.820 --> 17:39.820
this week.

17:39.820 --> 17:43.180
Uh, act dev says I pick the game I'm most excited about and probably the one I'll play

17:43.180 --> 17:44.420
the longest too.

17:44.420 --> 17:47.540
Hence why I pick smash and vid power says, same here.

17:47.540 --> 17:50.460
I picked the one I was eagerly anticipating, which was smash guys.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.980
You know, it says it's easy to pick games because most of the crap they have out now

17:53.980 --> 17:55.180
isn't worth buying.

17:55.180 --> 17:59.260
I'm only looking to get grand theft auto five and smash Pokemon grand theft auto five and

17:59.260 --> 18:01.380
smash were the only games I was waiting for.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.180
Oh, and Sims four and civilization beyond earth.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.180
That's about it for me.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.500
That's still sounds like a pretty good big list guys, you know, that's still a lot of

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
games in the list.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.500
I don't know.

18:09.500 --> 18:15.340
Uh, but uh, Irene, what, what do you factor in this week and like, what am I going to

18:15.340 --> 18:16.340
play?

18:16.340 --> 18:21.140
Um, I think about what's already on my 3ds.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.000
So it's more like I'm on a budget.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.960
I don't have time for $60 game week.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.960
Yes.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.880
And also a time budget.

18:28.880 --> 18:33.880
So what's going to take five to 15 minutes, which is usually the me Plaza.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
I see.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.080
So you have to kind of weigh in because you have the school and the other stuff that gets

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
in the way.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.400
What can I play quickly?

18:40.400 --> 18:41.400
Right.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.440
So you don't have time to play dragon age inquisition, even if that was something that

18:44.440 --> 18:46.200
was up your alley, which I don't think it is.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.200
Nope.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.200
Yeah.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
You don't have to, ain't nobody got time for that.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
Nobody got time for that.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.200
Nobody got time for that.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.200
Right.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.240
So what are the retro titles and kind of what you like, if I kind of look at a list of what

18:56.240 --> 18:59.280
are Irene's favorite games, a lot of them tend to be like retro stuff.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.160
Is that because it's more bite-sized or, um, not real.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.560
I mean, that's all just stuff that I have played because I don't have time to play current

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
games anymore.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.960
I, you know, I haven't played them, but I've played a lot of older games.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.640
So that's usually why all of my favorite games are older games because I haven't played any

19:15.640 --> 19:16.640
new games.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
I'm too busy.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.200
Well, and you can always, and you can always come over here and play the stuff that I got

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
suckered into buying.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.000
Well, like you did with Smash this week, right?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Totally did that.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
That was fun.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.520
Uh, we'll talk about your thoughts on Smash in a minute here.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.520
Uh, for me, I think, you know, and the thing I didn't really get to get into as Loki was

19:32.520 --> 19:35.700
talking, I think peer pressure does play into it just a little bit.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.720
Like I kind of think that's what finally broke me on Dragon Age Inquisition.

19:38.720 --> 19:44.520
Like I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really, like I didn't get it super into Dragon

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
Age Origins.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.340
Like I tried, but it just, I don't know if it was too slow or if it's just the engine

19:49.340 --> 19:52.540
wasn't like Mass Effect, so it didn't really pull me in the same way or the store.

19:52.540 --> 19:53.540
I don't know what it was.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.500
I couldn't get into Dragon Age Origins.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
I don't like hate it.

19:56.500 --> 20:00.780
I just really couldn't get into it, but I bought Dragon Age Inquisition because I knew

20:00.780 --> 20:02.220
Alan was a big fan of it.

20:02.220 --> 20:05.680
I knew my roommate was a big fan of it and there would be a lot of chatter about the

20:05.680 --> 20:07.500
game in this household.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.100
And I was like, oh, it has a multiplayer mode and multiplayer is supposed to be kind of

20:11.100 --> 20:12.100
like Mass Effect.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.740
And I really liked Mass Effect's multiplayer mode way more than I ever thought I would.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.740
Uh, so I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going to do it.

20:18.740 --> 20:20.380
Here's the 60 bucks.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.100
And I really enjoyed Dragon Age Inquisition.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.520
I'll talk about that more in a minute, but I, I'm really glad I bought it.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.780
Like the game pulled me in, in a way that Origins didn't do.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.380
So I'm like super into the game.

20:32.380 --> 20:35.660
So it's a, it's a place where peer pressure actually paid off.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.180
I actually think you're onto something.

20:37.180 --> 20:39.380
There's always this fear of missing out.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.460
I think that a lot of people are susceptible to that.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.580
And I mean, I don't know, we're probably gonna talk about this later, but the whole Warlords

20:44.580 --> 20:49.100
of Draenor thing, like how the sub, you know, has risen.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.100
Yeah, we'll get into that.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.100
Yeah.

20:51.100 --> 20:54.220
So I kind of think that's part of playing part of that too.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.220
That's okay.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.840
Let's talk about Draenor for a minute and we will get into that and, you know, and have

20:58.840 --> 21:03.420
a more lengthy discussion about, you know, what Blizzard's doing amongst all the chaos

21:03.420 --> 21:06.540
happened this past week, but you are a former World of Warcraft player.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.860
In fact, you're the one that kind of got me into it.

21:08.860 --> 21:09.860
One of a couple people.

21:09.860 --> 21:10.860
Yeah, I know.

21:10.860 --> 21:11.860
Right.

21:11.860 --> 21:12.860
So you got me into it.

21:12.860 --> 21:13.860
I don't play anymore.

21:14.540 --> 21:21.940
But I found it really hard to resist the temptation to go back this week because everybody is

21:21.940 --> 21:23.540
up that expansion's ass.

21:23.540 --> 21:24.540
Right.

21:24.540 --> 21:25.740
Like, and I'm not hating with that comment.

21:25.740 --> 21:26.740
I'm not hating with that comment.

21:26.740 --> 21:30.260
I'm really happy for Blizzard and I'm happy that that expansion apparently has turned

21:30.260 --> 21:36.340
out as good as it has because I really lost interest halfway through Pandaria when basically

21:36.340 --> 21:40.100
Blizzard had thrown five mans out the window, which is the thing I enjoyed most in the game

21:40.100 --> 21:42.220
and I couldn't stand LFR and stuff anymore.

21:42.220 --> 21:45.140
But it seems like people are really loving this expansion, the story, and a lot of the

21:45.140 --> 21:46.260
other things about it.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.900
I know people that haven't played in a very long time that are super into it and that

21:49.900 --> 21:53.620
peer pressure is kind of making me go, I, I got to do it.

21:53.620 --> 21:54.620
I got to try it.

21:54.620 --> 21:58.700
Like even though I'm paying for 14 and I got, I've got to, everybody's loving wow.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.280
I've got to try wow at some point.

22:01.280 --> 22:06.060
But luckily this week I've been able to tell myself, okay, Rob, you just bought three,

22:06.060 --> 22:08.620
no four, because I bought the Jackbox game too.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.240
I bought four games this week.

22:11.280 --> 22:15.640
I do not need fucking wow to make me not play any of it.

22:15.640 --> 22:16.640
Right.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.640
Right.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.000
And you know, it's such a weird dynamic with wow.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.720
You kind of have to strike while the iron's hot because maybe a few months down the line

22:24.720 --> 22:26.600
it's not going to be as appealing.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.400
You know, people will drop off and it just won't be, so it has to be the right conditions

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
too.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.720
So right now is when everyone's jumping back on board and everything's still fresh and

22:34.720 --> 22:36.940
no one, you know, all the contents new and stuff like that.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.960
So it would be the ideal time to do it.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.080
And I will tell you, I despise wow, I do.

22:43.080 --> 22:49.400
But even I was tempted for a millisecond, like, man, I really miss PVP and just, I miss

22:49.400 --> 22:54.320
wow and I just, I would love to go back, but it's just like, no, I mean, I'm done with

22:54.320 --> 22:55.320
that.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.280
So, but yeah, there's just this confluence of just factors that make it sound appealing

22:59.280 --> 23:00.880
and I don't know.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.360
Without getting too dark, I hope I'm not going down too much of a dark road here, but you

23:04.360 --> 23:07.880
used to be really into wow and now you say I despise wow.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.640
That's a very strong term.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.560
What flipped for you?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Wow killed my brother.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.560
I'm just kidding.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.560
I shouldn't laugh.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.560
It's a horrible thing to say.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
No, it's not.

23:18.560 --> 23:23.400
No, it just, you know, thinking about all of the money I spent on wow and all the time

23:23.400 --> 23:26.720
I spent on wow and how much more I could have been doing with my life rather than playing

23:26.720 --> 23:27.720
wow.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.740
And you know, some of the friendships and the fake friendships that I created with wow.

23:32.740 --> 23:37.120
And I say that earnestly, like fake friendships, because sometimes you got to play that game

23:37.160 --> 23:39.240
in the game to do anything.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.640
Like, you know, if someone finds out you're a girl in the game, wow, it just turns around

23:43.640 --> 23:44.640
180 for you.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.920
Like they will, there's just this intricate game you have to play with them.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.360
And it's, it's not anything I really wanted to be a part of, but that's just, it was kind

23:52.360 --> 23:57.240
of the expectation, I guess it was created in the environment of wow.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.040
Anyway, that's a whole different topic.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.560
But that was fascinating.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.840
You could do an entire movie on that.

24:03.840 --> 24:04.840
Whoa.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.840
No.

24:05.840 --> 24:10.440
But I mean, it was just, you know, there were some great things about it.

24:10.440 --> 24:15.400
I loved PVPing, you know, I loved interacting with my friends and stuff, but it was just,

24:15.400 --> 24:17.960
you know, it was affecting my real life too much.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.880
And I just, you know, the more I think about it, the more resentful I get about it.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.880
So

24:22.880 --> 24:26.080
You know, what's interesting is, you know, I have Hoard House, which was a World of Warcraft

24:26.080 --> 24:30.480
podcast for a few years, and I'm pretty tuned into the Warcraft podcasting community of

24:30.480 --> 24:32.240
which there's a lot of podcasts.

24:32.240 --> 24:37.000
I'm not sure I've ever heard in the years of, of, of doing those podcasts, I've ever

24:37.000 --> 24:41.860
heard somebody talk about the real social game the way you just did.

24:41.860 --> 24:46.600
That's very, that's, I mean, and I can't really argue with you and what you're saying, but

24:46.600 --> 24:51.640
it's a very interesting layer of wow that nobody who's into it really talks about, which

24:51.640 --> 24:52.760
I find very interesting.

24:52.760 --> 24:53.760
Yeah.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.980
I mean, nobody, I think, you know, no one wants to acknowledge that that happens and

24:56.980 --> 25:00.480
it's not just wow, it's, it's every MMO that you play or any sort of

25:00.480 --> 25:01.480
Or any multiplayer game.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.480
Right.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.480
It can be League of Legends.

25:03.480 --> 25:04.480
Right.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.480
Exactly.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.480
Yeah.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.520
You know, but I mean, everyone knows that it happens.

25:07.520 --> 25:13.340
It's just, nobody really acknowledged or they're just kind of, you know, they're blind to it.

25:13.340 --> 25:14.340
They just think that that's

25:14.340 --> 25:19.440
And just to be clear, you're not only talking about the whole like IRL girl angle.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.440
Right.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.440
Right.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.100
You're talking about, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is what I'm hearing.

25:25.100 --> 25:30.660
You have faked friendships in an MMO to advance your MMO game.

25:30.660 --> 25:31.660
Yes.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.660
Even though you didn't particularly necessarily care for the person who, who might've been

25:34.660 --> 25:35.660
helping you out.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.660
Right.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.660
Yeah.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.660
And people have done that with me too.

25:38.660 --> 25:39.660
So it's not, and that's okay.

25:39.660 --> 25:42.380
I mean, that's just how the game is played.

25:42.380 --> 25:45.820
It stings the first time, but you know, you just get used to it.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.380
It's par for the course.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.380
Wow.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.380
Yeah.

25:49.380 --> 25:52.220
Loki, when are you going to start playing MMOs?

25:52.220 --> 25:54.100
Want to be my friend in WoW?

25:54.100 --> 25:56.540
I'll be your friend.

25:56.540 --> 25:59.220
Help me get a two player amount.

25:59.220 --> 26:00.220
Right.

26:00.220 --> 26:01.220
Wow.

26:01.220 --> 26:06.040
Uh, let's see, uh, Kaijuto in chat says, wow, screwed up MMOs.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.500
It went with mediocre and now every MMO just follows suit.

26:09.500 --> 26:13.260
Kaijuto also saying she realized how mediocre WoW is.

26:13.260 --> 26:19.020
It is very, you know, I can't hate on the mediocrity of WoW because it went from, I

26:19.020 --> 26:24.060
mean, if you think of all of WoW's predecessors, what came, what MMOs came before WoW?

26:24.060 --> 26:28.700
I mean, there was request Ultima online, how difficult were these games?

26:28.700 --> 26:33.580
How hard were, were they to access for the quote unquote, I guess, casual gamer or, you

26:33.580 --> 26:36.140
know, not super experienced gamer.

26:36.140 --> 26:40.900
You know, I can credit WoW with, with being very accessible, you know, and I appreciate

26:40.900 --> 26:45.540
that because I'm, I'm, I, I, I like games, but I'm not amazing at them.

26:45.540 --> 26:51.500
So Blizzard has become a PC gaming powerhouse and now also console, you know, they're, they

26:51.500 --> 26:56.460
dabble in the console stuff too, but Blizzard's become a PC gaming powerhouse by dumbing

26:56.460 --> 26:57.780
down.

26:57.780 --> 27:01.540
And I don't mean that in a harsh way, but just like, I love Blizzard games too because

27:01.540 --> 27:08.020
they dumb down what can oftentimes be very difficult genres so that everybody can play

27:08.020 --> 27:09.020
them.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.020
Right.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.500
And they, and they're, they did it with, um, Starcraft.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.860
They did it with Diablo is a simple dungeon crawler.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.340
They did heroes of the storm big time.

27:18.340 --> 27:22.100
The only mobile I can wrap my head around is heroes of the storm.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.020
And now they're going to do it again with the shooter.

27:24.020 --> 27:27.420
And you've got all these people, and I don't know if it's just this whole effect that Blizzard

27:27.420 --> 27:34.300
has that I don't want to say Blizzard creates a cult, but like going, but going to Blizzcon

27:34.300 --> 27:37.660
was a very interesting experience because there's so many people that are like, I hate

27:37.660 --> 27:40.220
first person shooters, but I'll play Overwatch.

27:40.220 --> 27:44.180
I'll play it because it's Blizzard bow down, bow down, I'm going to play this.

27:44.180 --> 27:47.140
And I got to admit, even I played Overwatch and the first time I didn't totally get it,

27:47.220 --> 27:50.260
but the second time I was like, God, this character development is really good.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.940
And I could see myself getting really into this.

27:51.940 --> 27:52.940
Yeah.

27:52.940 --> 27:53.940
And that's what it is too.

27:53.940 --> 27:59.300
They might sacrifice, you know, um, very involved gameplay or, you know, whatever, but they'll

27:59.300 --> 28:00.940
enrich something else in the game.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.460
They'll make a really good, you know, storyline or, you know, whatever.

28:04.460 --> 28:09.380
So I think that's probably what the draw of wow was, was, you know, they're sacrificing

28:09.380 --> 28:12.340
that, but they're making in, in making it more accessible to gamers.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.460
They improve other aspects of the game to make up for it.

28:15.900 --> 28:20.500
And to be fair, I don't think I would use the word mediocre with wow, because I really

28:20.500 --> 28:25.380
think wow set the bar in some ways, but I do think there are games that have taken some

28:25.380 --> 28:26.860
things in wow and done it better.

28:26.860 --> 28:29.140
Y'all know I'm addicted to Final Fantasy 14.

28:29.140 --> 28:32.680
I think there's some elements that 14 does better, but I'm not necessarily saying that

28:32.680 --> 28:33.740
all of it's better.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.780
It has its drawbacks as well.

28:35.780 --> 28:40.580
But um, you know, it's just, there's these other MMOs that are all worth checking out,

28:40.580 --> 28:44.700
but nobody does it because they're too tied up in the social game of wow.

28:44.700 --> 28:49.260
You know, I would acknowledge that wow has devolved since its origins.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.260
Absolutely.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.860
And I think girl, you were coming out swinging tonight.

28:52.860 --> 28:53.860
It's true though.

28:53.860 --> 28:54.860
It has.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.140
I mean, if you, let's talk about this.

28:56.140 --> 28:59.380
I mean, you think about, you know, vanilla wow.

28:59.380 --> 29:05.700
If you want to argue with princess Irene, uh, by all means, uh, tweet us at OLR or you

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
want a bump?

29:06.700 --> 29:07.700
Let's go.

29:07.700 --> 29:08.700
You want a bump?

29:08.700 --> 29:09.700
Let's go.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.700
No, no, I'm just saying, okay.

29:10.700 --> 29:11.700
Ah, you know, I really love the game.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.700
I loved vanilla.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.700
Wow.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.020
Um, burning crusade, you know, wrath kind of sucked.

29:17.020 --> 29:22.260
Um, but I mean, once you start looking at when they took all of the pop culture references

29:22.260 --> 29:26.920
and the memes and stuff overboard, when it kind of broke the verisimilitude of the game

29:26.920 --> 29:31.560
and it went from a fantasy game to a pop culture game and they just were not even subtle about

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
anything anymore.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.940
They were getting too ironic with their stuff.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.220
Are you saying there was one too many poop quests?

29:36.220 --> 29:37.220
Yes.

29:37.220 --> 29:41.300
I'm saying that there were one too many poop quests.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.300
Yes.

29:42.300 --> 29:47.340
You know, and I just, it was, it was fun at first, but then it just became too overt and

29:47.340 --> 29:48.460
too much.

29:48.460 --> 29:52.500
And I think that really just, you know, it devolved into something for, you know, it

29:52.500 --> 29:56.900
was like fucking 12 year old dick and fart jokes, which you know, I normally love, but

29:56.900 --> 29:58.420
I also loved original wow.

29:58.420 --> 30:00.420
And it really just ruined it for me.

30:00.420 --> 30:04.500
Well, some of the people that are talking about warless arena or say it's, it's a return

30:04.500 --> 30:09.380
closest thing to vanilla and burning crusade and that period right in between that we've

30:09.380 --> 30:10.380
seen since.

30:10.380 --> 30:14.540
And see, that's so depressing because I don't want to go back to wow, because I know life

30:14.540 --> 30:16.720
after wow and it's beautiful and it's sweet.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.820
And then if I go back into wow, it's sucking me back in.

30:18.820 --> 30:21.640
But I know people that play wow that are completely like functional, happy people.

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
You know, I don't want to.

30:22.640 --> 30:23.640
I'm not one of those people.

30:23.640 --> 30:24.940
I don't do that when I play wow.

30:24.940 --> 30:28.340
I sit for 12 hours on a Saturday and PVP all day.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.340
That's okay.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.900
So as long as we're clear, people react differently and that's how you did it.

30:32.900 --> 30:33.900
Exactly.

30:33.900 --> 30:34.900
Yeah.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.900
I want to get through school.

30:35.900 --> 30:36.900
So.

30:36.900 --> 30:37.900
All right.

30:37.900 --> 30:38.900
Let's see.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.020
We've got from Alan alchemy, who I believe is talking about the social elements of, of

30:41.020 --> 30:42.020
wow.

30:42.020 --> 30:45.540
The social game quote, everyone in my raid group ain't shit and are actually kind of

30:45.540 --> 30:48.580
racist, but we progress hard modes easily and they fit my schedule.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.580
So, Oh, well.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.580
Wow.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.620
See, see, you have to pretend to like these fuckers.

30:53.620 --> 30:54.620
Like yeah.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.620
Oh, racism.

30:55.620 --> 30:56.620
Good times.

30:56.620 --> 30:57.620
All right.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.620
Let's go raid.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.020
You know, like I just, I, I don't want to do that.

31:01.020 --> 31:06.480
I don't want to put up with bullshit just to do things with people, but not that everyone

31:06.480 --> 31:15.960
that plays wow is racist, but most of them, definitely grandpa, but I'm not hating on

31:15.960 --> 31:16.960
it.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.240
I just, you know, it's, it's kind of a slippery slope for me.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
It's all right.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.240
Wow.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.200
I did not know this was going to delve into the dark side of MMO chat, but that was, that

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
was great.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.600
No therapy time for a read.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.840
You're actually like lying back in Jamie's chair.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
Just kicking it.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
Just talking about, wow.

31:32.840 --> 31:36.000
If you were the smoking kind of as you'd have a cigarette in your hand, just, you know,

31:36.000 --> 31:40.040
looking back on it, like a grizzled veteran, let's talk about, wow.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.040
All right.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.720
Well, I do want to move on with the show and talk a little bit about what have we been

31:44.720 --> 31:48.160
playing this week specifically, I guess we've touched on it a little bit, but now let's

31:48.160 --> 31:51.040
get into some of the details and maybe some of the stuff that got missed.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.040
Loki.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.040
How was your gaming week?

31:53.040 --> 32:00.360
Um, I played Grand Theft Auto and, um, it's awesome.

32:00.360 --> 32:04.780
You know, I, I downloaded it digitally cause I had, you know, pre-ordered, so unlocked

32:04.780 --> 32:10.620
on Monday and, um, I started playing through the story, no story campaign.

32:10.620 --> 32:15.100
I actually tried streaming some of it and that worked out okay, I guess.

32:15.100 --> 32:21.420
Um, and then also I did play a little bit of Infamous Second Son, still kind of bored

32:21.420 --> 32:22.420
with that game.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.420
I don't know.

32:23.420 --> 32:27.260
It's just kind of okay, I guess.

32:27.260 --> 32:30.900
But at the time you don't want us picking out games to get from my PlayStation four.

32:30.900 --> 32:35.140
I was just like, eh, it looked pretty good, but it's all right.

32:35.140 --> 32:36.140
I don't know.

32:36.140 --> 32:39.660
I probably, if they made another Infamous game, I probably would not pick it up.

32:39.660 --> 32:43.200
Um, but Grand Theft Auto, yes, Grand Theft Auto is amazing.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.620
And I did play through a lot of it in first person mode, although I've now gone back to

32:47.620 --> 32:51.700
third person mode again, cause I don't know, I kind of got over it.

32:51.700 --> 32:57.100
It is hard to like, you know, see around yourself and, um, it might be fun to like play, you

32:57.100 --> 33:00.860
know, Grand Theft Auto online that way, if you're playing in online mode, that was only

33:00.860 --> 33:06.580
people playing in that mode, but, uh, I don't know, it looks really good.

33:06.580 --> 33:12.560
It's very pretty and I love all the new animals, you know, cats and stuff wandering around

33:12.560 --> 33:13.560
a lot.

33:13.560 --> 33:19.020
And, um, I don't know, it's, I did watch a little bit of your live stream and I saw the

33:19.020 --> 33:22.660
cat and now, yes, I got very distracted, you know, I was supposed to be stealing a car.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.660
I'm like, okay.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.660
Yeah.

33:25.220 --> 33:29.620
So, now there's a lot of cats and they're not, not rare at all, so you see them quite

33:29.620 --> 33:30.620
a bit.

33:30.620 --> 33:35.620
Um, so I did that and I think the other day I was occupying myself playing with Chop,

33:35.620 --> 33:37.900
so I was throwing a ball at people.

33:37.900 --> 33:41.140
As I take his ball, throw it at a person, they get pissed off and when they get pissed

33:41.140 --> 33:43.160
off, he goes and attacks them and kills them.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.500
So that's kind of fun.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.740
Um, so I was doing that.

33:46.740 --> 33:49.500
And then, um, what else?

33:49.500 --> 33:51.300
Uh, Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

33:51.340 --> 33:56.060
So I had originally got this to play with my son and it's just hard to play with him

33:56.060 --> 33:58.820
because he doesn't really understand how to use the controller too well.

33:58.820 --> 34:04.140
I mean, he can mash some of the, you know, buttons in it and he wanted to play as Hulk

34:04.140 --> 34:07.900
and stuff and then he got frustrated once he passed the Hulk stage that now it's Captain

34:07.900 --> 34:12.220
America and, um, oh, who else was it?

34:12.220 --> 34:14.460
Captain America and Mr. Fantastic.

34:14.460 --> 34:20.180
So I was playing through the campaign to get to, you know, the free mode part of the whole

34:20.220 --> 34:22.780
thing where you can kind of run around New York.

34:22.780 --> 34:25.740
And so I was playing through that and I finally got that unlocked, but then I kept playing

34:25.740 --> 34:27.420
it because, you know, it's okay.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.420
I don't know.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.420
I was trying to unlock all the characters.

34:29.420 --> 34:32.020
I'm still not sure how to switch characters.

34:32.020 --> 34:35.940
I think I'll figure that out later on, but I guess there's supposed to be some sort of

34:35.940 --> 34:38.580
secret room with Deadpool, but Deadpool's everywhere.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.540
He like has so many cameos and everything.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.540
It's hilarious.

34:41.540 --> 34:46.980
Um, so I just have to play through it, I guess some more to find Deadpool.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.580
That's who I'm really trying to unlock.

34:49.580 --> 34:59.740
Um, the story's okay, I guess, uh, ran across, um, oh, what's his name, um, I don't know.

34:59.740 --> 35:03.820
It's mostly the Avengers stuff right now, uh, them run through and damn, they have like

35:03.820 --> 35:07.980
a ton of Spider-Man content and like the first like four or five villains were all Spider-Man

35:07.980 --> 35:08.980
villains.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.540
I'm like, okay, Spider-Man's in this level and this level and this level.

35:12.540 --> 35:15.700
Is Doctor Octopus the first one you run into, like the very first one?

35:15.700 --> 35:16.900
Sandman's the very first one.

35:17.540 --> 35:24.540
Sandman and then Doctor Octopus and then, then it's what, Green Goblin and then Venom

35:24.540 --> 35:29.940
and it's like, okay, you've gone through all of the Spider-Man villains, stop.

35:29.940 --> 35:33.460
And then, um, who would it end up being?

35:33.460 --> 35:40.980
Then you finally run into Magneto and, um, uh, Sabretooth and you fight, uh, oh, what's

35:40.980 --> 35:41.980
his name?

35:41.980 --> 35:43.820
Uh, Abomination again.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.820
I don't know.

35:44.820 --> 35:45.980
There's a lot of characters in it.

35:45.980 --> 35:47.460
It's kind of cool.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.740
So I played through that and it's fun.

35:49.740 --> 35:52.740
I probably will still play through it again because the only thing, granted, I thought

35:52.740 --> 35:56.620
it was, I've, I've already beat the campaign a hundred percent in the Xbox 360.

35:56.620 --> 36:01.620
So it's like, and I remember how much of a pain in the ass that was to do that.

36:01.620 --> 36:06.340
That took a long time and I'm just kind of regretting having to do that again because

36:06.340 --> 36:11.700
I want to get in on that whole, you know, Mount Chiliad mystery Easter egg thing, but

36:11.700 --> 36:13.260
you have to have a hundred percent to do that.

36:13.260 --> 36:16.100
And then it's kind of like, oh, I don't want to do that again.

36:16.100 --> 36:21.700
It took so much time, so I'm just hoping someone releases like a save game cheat or something

36:21.700 --> 36:22.700
like that.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.700
Cause I really don't want to have to go through the whole campaign yet.

36:24.700 --> 36:25.700
It was good.

36:25.700 --> 36:31.380
It's just, it's a long time, a lot of time dedicated to that, but maybe, maybe I'll do

36:31.380 --> 36:32.380
it.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.380
You know, who knows?

36:33.380 --> 36:38.520
I do want to pick up far cry four at some point, but all these games take a long time.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.220
That's why Lego Marvel superheroes.

36:41.220 --> 36:45.340
It's just kind of linear for the most part, although the open world stuff's really huge

36:45.340 --> 36:46.340
too.

36:46.340 --> 36:47.580
I was like, holy crap, this map is huge.

36:47.580 --> 36:53.780
I mean, it's kind of empty, but it's very, there's a lot of stuff and I'm still not really

36:53.780 --> 36:57.440
sure what collecting all those studs do if I can like buy things with that.

36:57.440 --> 37:01.620
So I've been just collecting them anyways, but there's a ton of collecting this.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.620
I don't know.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.620
Cause it's shiny and I'm like, I don't know them getting points.

37:05.620 --> 37:06.620
I guess.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.620
Are these points?

37:07.620 --> 37:08.620
Are they money?

37:08.620 --> 37:09.620
What, what are these things?

37:09.620 --> 37:10.620
I don't know.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.540
So maybe I'll just look it up on the internet.

37:12.540 --> 37:16.340
But uh, so yeah, that's what I've been doing this week is just really those games.

37:16.340 --> 37:17.340
All right.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.620
Well I'm going to try to cover this quickly.

37:18.620 --> 37:19.620
I know.

37:19.620 --> 37:20.620
I'm sorry.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
Real quick.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.620
Real quick.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.100
I also played more of the, um, well you want to talk about a sandwich play, no play room.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.420
I didn't play any sandwiches.

37:26.420 --> 37:28.420
No, actually my son was playing play room.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.300
Um, he was playing the alien.

37:30.300 --> 37:36.740
My was like some alien one, um, brave, like a toy alien and you destroyed, like it almost

37:36.740 --> 37:37.740
looks like a little bit playing.

37:37.740 --> 37:39.820
Destroyed a bunch of like cardboard things.

37:39.820 --> 37:40.820
And so he loves it.

37:40.820 --> 37:45.180
Like he literally spent like two or three hours playing that the other day all by himself.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.180
I was like, Hey, cool.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.180
All right.

37:47.180 --> 37:48.180
That's it.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.180
All right.

37:49.180 --> 37:53.060
Uh, I will try to be quick cause I, I had, I covered a lot of ground in gaming this week

37:53.060 --> 37:54.820
and so I'm going to try to be quick.

37:54.820 --> 37:59.420
So I played a lot of my usual stuff like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo three because, and the

37:59.420 --> 38:01.880
reason why I played a lot of Diablo three and probably more of that than anything else

38:01.880 --> 38:06.500
this week is that Alan decided to make this his week that I'm just, I don't know why,

38:06.500 --> 38:09.060
but I've decided I'm going to beat Diablo three finally.

38:09.060 --> 38:12.620
Maybe watching me play all that time finally rubbed off on him and he was like, I want

38:12.620 --> 38:15.060
to do riffs and all the cool things that Rob talks about.

38:15.060 --> 38:20.580
So he finally beat the game and he's level like 69 he's really close to that 70 cap right

38:20.580 --> 38:21.580
now.

38:21.580 --> 38:24.720
Um, so he's been playing Diablo three, so I've been helping him out and I've just been

38:24.720 --> 38:26.620
playing a lot of it because of that.

38:26.620 --> 38:29.540
Looking forward to the new patch, trying to finish out what I want to do in season one

38:29.540 --> 38:30.900
before it hits.

38:30.900 --> 38:36.220
Um, so a lot of that old, the old stuff I've been playing, but new stuff, lots of new stuff.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.580
Dragon Age Inquisition, which I mentioned a little bit ago.

38:38.580 --> 38:43.420
Um, I, I got really sucked into the game because the game really hits the ground running with

38:43.420 --> 38:44.420
the story.

38:44.420 --> 38:45.500
I found the story very interesting.

38:45.500 --> 38:50.860
I think the characters are really interesting and this is something BioWare does very well.

38:50.860 --> 38:54.220
Uh, they did it in Mass Effect and I know they did this in the other Dragon Age games.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.660
I just think the characters are really, really interesting.

38:56.660 --> 39:00.380
You know, I know Dragon Age gets a lot at a lot for its diversity.

39:00.380 --> 39:06.700
I think that just goes to enhance the, the stories, the backgrounds that all these different

39:06.700 --> 39:11.180
characters have that you can really go down a rabbit hole of exploring these people's

39:11.180 --> 39:13.500
paths, where they come from and their stories.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.860
This is, it's great.

39:14.860 --> 39:16.580
And so many different party members.

39:16.580 --> 39:22.580
Um, I also, a lot of folks comparing Dragon Age Inquisition to Skyrim in some ways, and

39:22.580 --> 39:24.980
I definitely feel the Skyrim influence in the game.

39:24.980 --> 39:25.980
And the reason why...

39:25.980 --> 39:28.180
No, don't say that.

39:28.180 --> 39:29.180
Don't say that.

39:29.180 --> 39:30.180
You have to buy it now.

39:30.180 --> 39:35.060
And the reason why Irene's making a face, like, I don't like Skyrim face.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.780
What is wrong with you?

39:36.780 --> 39:38.220
Absolutely nothing.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.820
I have my own opinion, Matt.

39:39.820 --> 39:40.820
What is your quick opinion?

39:40.820 --> 39:43.620
Clearly, it's clearly because you haven't played a little PC mods.

39:43.620 --> 39:44.620
You can make that game.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.620
Clearly.

39:45.620 --> 39:46.620
Clearly.

39:46.620 --> 39:47.620
What is clearly your problem with Skyrim?

39:47.620 --> 39:50.100
It is clearly fucking boring as shit.

39:50.100 --> 39:51.100
Okay.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.100
So you know what?

39:52.100 --> 39:54.940
I can see why people get bored with Skyrim.

39:54.940 --> 39:55.940
I really can.

39:55.940 --> 39:56.940
Yeah.

39:56.940 --> 39:57.940
Because it is, it is a slow burn.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
Yes.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.300
And it isn't necessarily a game that kind of, I mean, I don't know, it does kind of make

40:02.300 --> 40:03.300
your own excitement.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.300
Yeah.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.780
I don't even think it's on fire.

40:05.780 --> 40:06.860
It's not a slow burn.

40:06.860 --> 40:07.860
It's just sitting there.

40:07.860 --> 40:08.860
Like a candle.

40:08.860 --> 40:09.860
Right.

40:09.860 --> 40:10.860
That isn't lit.

40:10.860 --> 40:13.580
The thing about Dragon Age Inquisition, if you've read up on the game, everybody heard

40:13.580 --> 40:14.580
about this.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.580
The very first area you go in, the Hinterlands, you're doing the quest and suddenly you're

40:17.580 --> 40:18.580
going down the map.

40:18.580 --> 40:19.580
Oh, there's a side quest over there.

40:19.580 --> 40:20.780
Oh, there's a side quest over there.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.700
Oh, there's a camp I need to mark over there.

40:22.700 --> 40:23.700
Oh, there's, there's...

40:23.700 --> 40:24.700
Can't fucking deal with that.

40:24.700 --> 40:25.700
I can't.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.060
Side quest, side quest, side quest, and then you go do one side quest.

40:28.060 --> 40:29.660
There's five more side quests to do.

40:29.660 --> 40:34.220
So it's like, you get stuck in this one fucking zone because you can't stop doing the side

40:34.220 --> 40:38.620
quests that are all showing up on your map with very similar icons to Skyrim, might I

40:38.620 --> 40:39.620
add.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.620
I just kind of noticed that.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.620
It was very interesting.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.620
Uh, it just, yeah.

40:42.620 --> 40:47.980
So, but, but I kinda, I like that, that you go down this and then there's, there's more

40:47.980 --> 40:49.500
and you go keep further down.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
There's even more and more.

40:50.500 --> 40:54.300
And I kind of liked that there's so many things to do, but I really stress if you are playing

40:54.300 --> 40:58.900
Dragon Age Inquisition, leave the fucking Hinterlands when you can.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.520
Go progress the story because you'll get more characters.

41:02.520 --> 41:08.140
I don't want to do spoilers, but there are more characters, pretty, at least two to three,

41:08.140 --> 41:12.460
three new characters you can get pretty quickly after you get out of the fucking Hinterlands,

41:12.460 --> 41:14.220
you can always go back.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.220
And that's what I did.

41:15.220 --> 41:17.260
I went and I got three new characters and then I went back.

41:17.260 --> 41:19.580
So now I'm, I'm doing the burn in the Hinterlands again.

41:19.580 --> 41:24.220
And then I got to another area, the Storm Coast, which is another open world area that

41:24.220 --> 41:25.900
has five more things to explore.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.700
It's just like, Oh my God, there's so much to do.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.860
So a lot to do in Dragon Age Inquisition.

41:30.860 --> 41:33.580
Now it's not a perfect game.

41:33.580 --> 41:38.580
And the other reason why I compare it to Skyrim is that Dragon Age Inquisition has some pretty

41:38.580 --> 41:45.980
hilarious glitches and we have to be fair for a minute because all of the internet sat

41:45.980 --> 41:51.620
here and gave Assassin's Creed Unity a hell of a time last week over some of the bugs.

41:51.620 --> 41:57.460
Yet, come on, there's some pretty derpy things that happen in Dragon Age Inquisition and

41:57.460 --> 41:59.500
people aren't talking about that.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.340
So that needs to be called out.

42:01.340 --> 42:05.580
There are definitely some choppy frame rate things that happen.

42:05.580 --> 42:09.660
The thing that gets me is dancing characters, like characters that will start to move in

42:09.660 --> 42:12.080
these really erratic patterns for no reason.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.780
And I'm like, why stop doing that?

42:13.780 --> 42:17.420
Now we don't have anything as bad as say somebody's face is fucking missing.

42:17.420 --> 42:22.700
Like there's nothing that bad, but there are definitely still some technical glitches that

42:22.700 --> 42:26.100
take you out of the experience for a little bit.

42:26.100 --> 42:30.100
I do consider that minor in the big picture because those minor things aside, the game

42:30.100 --> 42:31.740
is really beautiful.

42:31.740 --> 42:35.900
And you know, when glitches aren't happening, there's a lot of gorgeous things to look at.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.740
Cutscenes are rendered very well.

42:37.740 --> 42:42.380
The way your custom design character is woven into the experiences is really, really something.

42:42.380 --> 42:44.980
So there's a lot of good stuff in Dragon Age Inquisition.

42:44.980 --> 42:48.520
I think if you are into RPGs, it's worth checking out.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.520
I did not really play the first two games.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.920
I don't think you have to have either to get fulfillment out of this game.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.180
So just throwing that out there.

42:56.180 --> 42:59.920
Multiplayer is kind of, I don't want to say it's thrown on.

42:59.920 --> 43:03.980
There's definitely a rich experience in there, but it is completely disjointed from the single

43:03.980 --> 43:04.980
player game.

43:04.980 --> 43:05.980
They are two separate games.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.500
They have nothing in common.

43:08.500 --> 43:14.140
So I, well, sorry, when I say nothing in common, I mean what you do in one does not impact

43:14.140 --> 43:15.620
the other and vice versa.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.700
The battle system is very similar.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.020
That's what they do have in common.

43:20.020 --> 43:25.500
But yeah, I was actually a little disappointed that multiplayer is so separated from the

43:25.500 --> 43:30.260
single player experience because there's A, no reason to play it, meaning B, it's hard

43:30.260 --> 43:32.460
to find people to play it with.

43:32.460 --> 43:36.980
And if I grind and grind and grind in multiplayer, I don't even get PlayStation trophies to show

43:36.980 --> 43:37.980
for it.

43:37.980 --> 43:42.260
Because unfortunately I think there's some people out there that are so opposed to multiplayer,

43:42.260 --> 43:45.000
they're like, oh, well I'm not going to pick up Dragon Age if they have multiplayer trophies

43:45.000 --> 43:48.780
because I don't do multiplayer and PvP, ew, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

43:48.780 --> 43:51.280
Well A, the multiplayer Dragon Age isn't PvP.

43:51.280 --> 43:53.960
It's all dungeon crawling, four man stuff.

43:53.960 --> 43:58.620
And I see trophies as achievements and they are optional.

43:58.620 --> 44:03.060
And if you, I mean, if you decide not to do the content, that's kind of your own damn

44:03.060 --> 44:04.060
problem.

44:04.060 --> 44:05.060
Like, I don't know.

44:05.060 --> 44:10.620
I don't understand why they couldn't do just some things for multiplayer to make it a little

44:10.620 --> 44:12.420
more tied to the experience.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.220
It was a little silly.

44:14.220 --> 44:15.740
Yeah, that's kind of stupid.

44:15.740 --> 44:16.900
It's like, what's the point then?

44:16.900 --> 44:21.520
I mean, there are a lot of people who are just achievement whores and they just want

44:21.520 --> 44:23.100
to get every single achievement.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.640
And that's why I assume they didn't put it for multiplayer, but you're just kind of making

44:26.640 --> 44:27.640
it useless then.

44:27.640 --> 44:31.620
It's like, we spent all this time developing multiplayer, but no one's going to play it.

44:31.660 --> 44:35.740
And for me, at the end of the day, it's not as fluid as Mass Effect's multiplayer was.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.520
And that kind of takes me out of the experience a little bit.

44:38.520 --> 44:40.860
Like I don't, I don't, I think that's the best word I can think of to describe it.

44:40.860 --> 44:42.500
It's just not, it's just not very fluid.

44:42.500 --> 44:46.380
It's kind of like you go through a dungeon, you kill a few mobs and then it's like, oh,

44:46.380 --> 44:47.380
I look around here.

44:47.380 --> 44:49.500
I look around here and then, oh, now we're going to wave two.

44:49.500 --> 44:54.900
And it's just, I don't know, it just, it doesn't really feel as strong as the single player

44:54.900 --> 44:55.900
game itself.

44:55.900 --> 45:00.780
And I don't think it, it doesn't, I think a good multiplayer experience compliments

45:00.820 --> 45:02.300
the single player experience.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.380
And this does not compliment anything.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.780
This is a spinoff.

45:06.780 --> 45:10.260
This is like playing the Dragon Age game on Facebook or something.

45:10.260 --> 45:11.260
It's that kind of spinoff.

45:11.260 --> 45:16.020
I mean, ultimately, like I hate to sound so damning of it because I do think, I think

45:16.020 --> 45:18.960
you could have a little fun playing multiplayer a few times, especially if you had some friends

45:18.960 --> 45:21.660
to play it with, but then you'll be like, why am I playing this?

45:21.660 --> 45:24.500
I need to go back into single player mode and actually progress my game.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
Right.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
Right.

45:26.500 --> 45:27.500
Okay.

45:27.500 --> 45:31.420
So we're going to do a Jackbox Party Pack, which by the way, we have a code we're going

45:31.420 --> 45:32.420
to give away.

45:32.420 --> 45:35.900
We're going to give away a copy of Jackbox Party Pack for the Xbox One or PlayStation

45:35.900 --> 45:36.900
Four.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.900
We're going to give it away.

45:37.900 --> 45:38.900
You can be live listener or podcast listener.

45:38.900 --> 45:43.260
We're going to do a contest and I'll talk about that at the start of part B. And obviously,

45:43.260 --> 45:45.180
you know, we've had them on the show before.

45:45.180 --> 45:49.980
So just that whole disclosure in case you think that's going to taint my review.

45:49.980 --> 45:53.780
But I had, I had a great time with Jackbox Party Pack.

45:53.780 --> 45:55.540
It is that, it is a party pack.

45:55.580 --> 45:59.980
It's a bunch of little like board games virtually.

45:59.980 --> 46:02.820
And you might remember when we had them on the show, we talked a little bit about that

46:02.820 --> 46:08.900
experience of doing the tablets and cell phones as controllers.

46:08.900 --> 46:11.660
And it works very, very, very well for games like Fibbage.

46:11.660 --> 46:17.220
And I think a standout in the pack is Drawful, which you play, you played it too.

46:17.220 --> 46:18.780
You, you'd enjoy Drawful, right?

46:18.780 --> 46:19.780
It was fantastic.

46:19.780 --> 46:24.500
Drawful was a hell of a lot of fun for such a simple concept, but the way that it's all

46:24.500 --> 46:28.180
weaved together with being able to draw it on the phone and everything is, is really

46:28.180 --> 46:29.180
cool.

46:29.180 --> 46:32.820
And because it was on PlayStation 4, we were share playing with Extifer.

46:32.820 --> 46:34.020
And so there's no lag.

46:34.020 --> 46:36.940
He can see the screen like he's sitting in the room and he's on his phone and he can

46:36.940 --> 46:37.940
play with us.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.060
And we're talking through the TV.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.940
Like it's just technology.

46:40.940 --> 46:42.340
It's so fucking great.

46:42.340 --> 46:43.340
Right?

46:43.340 --> 46:44.340
Dun, dun, dun.

46:44.340 --> 46:45.340
Oh my God.

46:45.340 --> 46:46.340
So that was really cool.

46:46.340 --> 46:50.540
The only part, like if you play, you don't know Jack, for some reason they decided to

46:50.540 --> 46:53.500
put the tablet controls in that too.

46:53.500 --> 46:57.700
And I don't understand why they went down that, well I do and I don't, like not everybody

46:57.700 --> 47:02.860
has four $40 controllers for PlayStation 4 or whatever, but I still kind of think controllers

47:02.860 --> 47:06.820
should have been an option because I think in some of the more precise things you have

47:06.820 --> 47:11.900
to do and you don't know Jack, such as, um, the, the very last round, the Jack attack

47:11.900 --> 47:15.260
where you have to be like the first person to push the button when you, like that is

47:15.260 --> 47:16.620
skills and reflexes.

47:16.620 --> 47:21.300
And unfortunately when you add the lag of cell phone browser into that, it really detracts

47:21.300 --> 47:22.300
from the experience.

47:22.300 --> 47:26.460
So I think, you know, one feedback I would have for the developers is that I don't think

47:26.460 --> 47:30.540
you made the right call in saying tablets only in multiplayer in that.

47:30.540 --> 47:33.940
I would love to see controllers or tablets.

47:33.940 --> 47:37.460
I mean, that's great for the people who don't have four controllers, but I know what I used

47:37.460 --> 47:41.220
to do is I would tell my friends when they came over to play, you don't know Jack, bring

47:41.220 --> 47:44.180
your controller and then we don't have that problem.

47:44.180 --> 47:46.100
So I just, I would like to see them bring that back.

47:46.100 --> 47:50.180
But otherwise I think, I think, uh, I mean, it was what, 25 bucks and you get five games

47:50.180 --> 47:53.420
and I think Fibbage and Drawful are definitely the standouts.

47:53.420 --> 47:55.900
Word Spud is okay.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.300
I didn't, I know you weren't really super into it.

47:58.300 --> 48:00.060
It's a very simple idea.

48:00.060 --> 48:04.140
It's basically like just chain one word to another and then everybody votes if they like

48:04.140 --> 48:05.140
it or not.

48:05.140 --> 48:06.660
You know, it's a very simple concept.

48:06.660 --> 48:11.660
Um, I just didn't get, not something I think you'll play a bunch, but the other games kind

48:11.660 --> 48:14.380
of lifted up where it's like, Oh, this is just a bonus.

48:14.380 --> 48:15.380
Absolutely.

48:15.380 --> 48:18.380
Um, other games I've played this week, Super Smash Brothers on the Wii U.

48:18.580 --> 48:22.980
Um, Oh my God, why did I even buy the 3DS version at this point?

48:22.980 --> 48:26.620
Like it's like the three, this is going to sound really harsh and I'm going to get some

48:26.620 --> 48:31.700
hate from some fans, but like after playing the Wii U version, the 3DS version is garbage.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.920
I'm sorry.

48:32.920 --> 48:33.980
That is how I feel.

48:33.980 --> 48:38.720
It's like, I cannot go back and play the 3DS version because it's just like, you have this

48:38.720 --> 48:43.220
huge experience on the Wii U that looks beautiful.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.860
It plays smooth.

48:44.860 --> 48:47.340
It is so beautiful to look at and fun.

48:47.340 --> 48:49.860
I cannot go back and play it on the 3DS.

48:49.860 --> 48:53.380
That just felt like an appetizer for the main course.

48:53.380 --> 48:59.900
And just to think, if they had not made the 3DS version, we'd have the ice climbers.

48:59.900 --> 49:00.900
Yeah.

49:00.900 --> 49:01.900
I don't know.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.300
And some will argue with me, well, the 3DS version serves its purpose.

49:04.300 --> 49:05.420
It has separate modes.

49:05.420 --> 49:08.060
It serves its purpose.

49:08.060 --> 49:10.500
You can play a portably.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.660
I get all that.

49:11.660 --> 49:12.780
That's all fine and good.

49:12.780 --> 49:14.660
Yay for you Smash Brothers fans.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.640
I'm glad you have a portable version.

49:17.640 --> 49:21.140
It's not for the more casual fans.

49:21.140 --> 49:22.140
It's not worth it.

49:22.140 --> 49:26.820
That's awesome that you have a portable version of your console game experience, or if you

49:26.820 --> 49:31.300
know you had made a more powerful handheld system, you might be able to stream it to

49:31.300 --> 49:32.300
that console.

49:32.300 --> 49:35.180
Like I don't know, the Vita does.

49:35.180 --> 49:38.220
Maybe it's for people who don't have Wii U's.

49:38.220 --> 49:39.220
Sure.

49:39.220 --> 49:40.220
Why not?

49:40.220 --> 49:41.220
Are you saying you?

49:41.220 --> 49:42.220
Pretty much.

49:42.220 --> 49:43.220
I'm their target.

49:43.220 --> 49:45.140
You've played the Wii U version.

49:45.140 --> 49:49.940
Are you like, I love Smash 3DS, or are you like, hmm, this is a subpar experience?

49:49.940 --> 49:54.020
Honestly, when we were playing on Friday, it didn't seem that different.

49:54.020 --> 49:56.300
I mean, like we played the new levels.

49:56.300 --> 49:59.540
That was fun, I guess, you know, and then the eight player Smash was just, it was a

49:59.540 --> 50:00.540
little cray.

50:00.540 --> 50:01.900
Like I couldn't see anything.

50:01.900 --> 50:02.900
Yeah.

50:02.900 --> 50:04.900
The eight player Smash is a little crazy.

50:04.900 --> 50:05.900
Level editor.

50:05.900 --> 50:06.900
Yeah.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.900
There's level.

50:07.900 --> 50:08.900
I didn't play around a lot with a level editor yet.

50:08.900 --> 50:11.180
I just haven't had the choice, but because there's so much in the game and I realized

50:11.180 --> 50:14.380
there's some things that like were in melee that weren't in this, like the whole like

50:14.380 --> 50:18.500
story modes and things, which kind of sucks because I did really like that in melee and

50:18.500 --> 50:20.980
I don't really care for the board game they put into this.

50:20.980 --> 50:25.700
It's not really as rewarding, but there's still like, like to say it's a huge detraction

50:25.700 --> 50:26.700
from the game.

50:26.700 --> 50:28.820
There's so much other shit in there.

50:28.820 --> 50:35.780
Like the home run challenges, the Mii battles, the classic mode where you fight the master

50:35.780 --> 50:39.940
hand at the end and all that and all these other, you know, meta games they have in it.

50:39.940 --> 50:45.620
You know, it's still a very rich experience, but I was perfectly content just playing the

50:45.620 --> 50:48.380
main Smash mode over and over and over again as we were doing on Friday night.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.380
I had a lot of fun.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.380
Right.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.380
Right.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.020
And that's why I think it's not, I'm not so sad that I don't have the Wii U version because

50:54.020 --> 50:59.260
it's like, you know, this is cool, but it's not like, I'm not sad that I don't have it

50:59.260 --> 51:00.260
or anything.

51:00.260 --> 51:04.020
So that's, well, that's, that's probably Nintendo wants you to be a little sad because they

51:04.020 --> 51:05.540
do want to sell more Wii U's.

51:05.540 --> 51:06.540
So sure.

51:06.540 --> 51:07.540
But I mean, it wasn't enough.

51:07.540 --> 51:08.540
I mean, I don't know.

51:08.540 --> 51:09.540
That's fair.

51:10.140 --> 51:13.220
All right, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

51:13.220 --> 51:17.780
Act F says the 3DS version is great for what it is, but the Wii U version definitely blows

51:17.780 --> 51:19.260
it off the water.

51:19.260 --> 51:20.260
Uh, let's see.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.220
Black Wolf points out the 3DS can be used as a controller for the Wii U version and

51:24.220 --> 51:26.900
you need the 3DS game to do so.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.540
That part was awfully convenient.

51:28.540 --> 51:33.360
Well, that's at least one way to play the better version on the 3DS.

51:33.360 --> 51:37.780
But that actually did end up being very convenient because like all I have here are Wiimotes.

51:37.820 --> 51:41.900
You know, we have like the Wii U game pad is it, but I was like, Irene, Nathan, bring

51:41.900 --> 51:45.820
your 3DS's and then you guys have controllers and that actually worked out pretty well.

51:45.820 --> 51:46.820
Yeah.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.380
And I was already used to controlling with it.

51:48.380 --> 51:49.380
So it's perfect.

51:49.380 --> 51:50.380
Yeah.

51:50.380 --> 51:53.140
And Nathan was able to get his custom scheme or whatever he has that he does.

51:53.140 --> 51:54.660
You were telling me not to let him do that.

51:54.660 --> 51:55.660
And I did.

51:55.660 --> 51:56.660
And then he beat our ass.

51:56.660 --> 51:57.660
Yeah.

51:57.660 --> 51:58.660
Oh, well.

51:58.660 --> 51:59.660
Told you.

51:59.660 --> 52:00.660
Uh, amiibo integration.

52:00.660 --> 52:04.080
Um, I did buy three that I bought my three amiibos.

52:04.080 --> 52:08.760
I have, uh, Mario, Peach and Samus, which good, good, good choices.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.560
Although I kind of wish I bought link kind of wish I bought link instead of Mario, but

52:12.560 --> 52:13.560
that's all right.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
Yeah.

52:14.560 --> 52:21.640
Um, I, the figures are well-crafted and I think the figures sit well on a display as

52:21.640 --> 52:24.400
for the way they're integrated into the games.

52:24.400 --> 52:25.400
Yeah.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.480
I kind of take it or leave it.

52:27.480 --> 52:32.080
Like if you haven't seen it yet, you, what you do, you take your amiibo and you can tap

52:32.080 --> 52:36.980
it to the Wii U game pad and it enters the game as basically a computer controlled character.

52:36.980 --> 52:41.760
But it's a special character that levels up the more you beat up on it and it learns from

52:41.760 --> 52:43.480
you the way you beat up on it.

52:43.480 --> 52:46.160
If you tend to block attacks, they'll learn to block attacks.

52:46.160 --> 52:49.520
If you tend to do more of X than Y, they'll do more of X than Y.

52:49.520 --> 52:53.160
So they start to take after you and they get a mind of their own and you can level them

52:53.160 --> 52:54.960
all the way up to level 50.

52:54.960 --> 52:59.320
Why you would do that, I'm not, that's the part I'm not understanding.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.320
Why?

53:00.560 --> 53:04.240
Ultimately the goal of leveling them to 50, and I'm sure some of the Smashaholics out

53:04.240 --> 53:08.680
there will be like, well, you can do a mode where it's you and your amiibo versus a friend

53:08.680 --> 53:10.320
and your friend's amiibo.

53:10.320 --> 53:14.840
And you know, you could have the amiibos fight each other to have like an amiibo style tournament.

53:14.840 --> 53:19.660
And I'm kind of sitting here going, I, I think, I think you're stretching a little bit with

53:19.660 --> 53:21.200
those functionalities.

53:21.200 --> 53:26.200
Those are a bit of a stretch from what the game is really about, which is beating up

53:26.200 --> 53:28.040
on your friends.

53:28.080 --> 53:32.920
But the figures are nice and I sort of go, okay, if they get you little perks in games,

53:32.920 --> 53:34.160
then that's kind of neat too.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.480
I get a little extra outfit in Mario Kart, all right, cool.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.360
I get some extra weapons in Hyrule Warriors, cute.

53:40.360 --> 53:44.680
You know, I like that they at least function in more than one game, but I really think

53:44.680 --> 53:49.540
if you're going to obsessively collect these amiibo, I hope you like the figures because

53:49.540 --> 53:55.800
what they're going to do for you in the game, I, you could get one amiibo and kind of get

53:55.800 --> 53:58.320
a good enough taste of what they're going to do in the various games.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.320
You know what I mean?

53:59.320 --> 54:04.480
So are, do they have any plans to make any amiibos-centric games where you need to have

54:04.480 --> 54:06.800
the amiibos to play?

54:06.800 --> 54:09.040
Wait for Pokemon Wii U, I'm sure.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.160
Yeah, probably.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.600
I'm sure that is coming.

54:11.600 --> 54:13.880
I just don't know what it is.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.080
I would be very curious.

54:16.080 --> 54:18.800
Here's something not a lot of people have been asking this question, but I'm going to,

54:18.800 --> 54:20.600
I'm going to ask it out here.

54:20.600 --> 54:25.600
What is the amiibo implementation going to look like in Splatoon?

54:25.600 --> 54:30.520
Because I could see that game really doing something with this, where you start to put

54:30.520 --> 54:36.360
the characters in Splatoon and maybe they are again doing some type of level up or something.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.480
I would like to see something, I don't know if Nintendo is ever going to build this, I'd

54:39.480 --> 54:44.600
like to see something where I level up my character in Mario, or excuse me, I level

54:44.600 --> 54:49.700
up my character in Smash, and now when I use that amiibo in Splatoon, because it's leveled

54:49.700 --> 54:52.740
up in Smash, it can do this.

54:53.020 --> 54:57.900
And something where the amiibos kind of become this personal achievement gallery, if that

54:57.900 --> 55:01.380
makes sense, and the more I've played these other games and leveled up in other games,

55:01.380 --> 55:02.740
the more it's going to do for me elsewhere.

55:02.740 --> 55:06.420
I would really love to see Nintendo to go down a path like that.

55:06.420 --> 55:10.500
Not going to hold my breath, but that would be my, you know, how could they make this

55:10.500 --> 55:13.540
even more exciting?

55:13.540 --> 55:15.820
Give me more of a reason to level my amiibos to 50.

55:15.820 --> 55:19.060
Right, I was actually just going to say that, because were you the one that was mentioning

55:19.060 --> 55:23.300
that if you get your amiibo to level 50, it's as strong as a level 9 CPU?

55:23.300 --> 55:24.300
I think stronger.

55:24.300 --> 55:25.300
Stronger than a level 9.

55:25.300 --> 55:31.380
So I can see doing that, you know, but aside from that in other games, your amiibo is not

55:31.380 --> 55:37.300
going to really grant you any more power than other players, is it?

55:37.300 --> 55:41.100
It's just giving you extra perks, like fun, like you said, extra outfits and stuff like

55:41.100 --> 55:42.100
that.

55:42.100 --> 55:44.780
It's like a little custom character that, it's like a pet.

55:44.780 --> 55:47.080
It's a pet rock.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.320
It takes after some of your features, you know what I mean?

55:49.320 --> 55:51.000
And they're how much each?

55:51.000 --> 55:52.120
$12.

55:52.120 --> 55:56.320
And how many are they planning to release total?

55:56.320 --> 56:00.260
Don't quote me on this, but it looks like one for every character in Smash Brothers.

56:00.260 --> 56:01.800
That's the way it's going right now.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.200
So every character in Smash Brothers will have one.

56:04.200 --> 56:08.240
So do you think this is more of like a hardcore collector kind of a thing or do you think

56:08.240 --> 56:10.960
this is ever going to appeal to like the general market?

56:10.960 --> 56:11.960
I think it's both.

56:11.960 --> 56:15.600
I think it's a hardcore collector thing and it's the general market because mommy, mommy,

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
I want the Mario.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
Mommy, mommy, I want the peach.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.600
Mommy, mommy.

56:18.600 --> 56:19.600
I think that's...

56:19.600 --> 56:23.200
Oh, you think the mommy, mommy stuffs, you know, are bad with, you know, I've been hearing

56:23.200 --> 56:24.200
all these stories of these.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.200
Well, and daddy, daddy too.

56:25.200 --> 56:28.880
Well, no, I've been hearing all these stories of like, these are sold out at all these stores

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
and stuff.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.760
I'm like, it boggles my mind why?

56:32.760 --> 56:34.920
I mean, yes, I understand that it's Mario.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
Cool.

56:35.920 --> 56:36.920
Okay.

56:36.920 --> 56:37.920
It's Mario.

56:37.920 --> 56:41.160
But the functionality with the games that support it right now is kind of, eh, I mean,

56:41.160 --> 56:45.840
it's just, it's very, it's not like Skylanders or something where at least those characters

56:45.840 --> 56:48.840
can actually fucking play them.

56:48.840 --> 56:52.480
It's a unique experience where it's like, Ooh, AI character, who gives a shit?

56:52.480 --> 56:59.480
Did you read that fucking fan wank on a news site that I will not name, but it was a shapely

56:59.480 --> 57:06.120
article on why Disney should buy Nintendo.

57:06.120 --> 57:11.400
And it read like, like fucking fanfic that I was reading on this site because I'm like,

57:11.400 --> 57:14.520
Disney's never going to buy Nintendo and Nintendo's gonna never let themselves be bought by Disney.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.380
But anyway, I'm getting beside the point.

57:16.380 --> 57:22.520
The only thing in it that made sense was Disney would want Nintendo because Nintendo has strong

57:22.520 --> 57:31.640
characters that 20 and 30 year olds are very attached to, which, you know, Disney has a

57:31.640 --> 57:36.960
lot of characters that people are attached to as well, but some could argue that they

57:36.960 --> 57:40.120
target a different generation than Nintendo gets.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.240
Well, no, I mean, you're right.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.840
20 and 30 year olds are very strongly attached to it, but also children of this era.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
Oh yeah.

57:46.840 --> 57:47.840
Absolutely.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.080
Because the 20 and 30 year olds pass them on to their kids.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
Exactly.

57:51.080 --> 57:52.080
Absolutely.

57:52.080 --> 57:57.080
So that was my long winded answer to your question was that, uh, it's the characters,

57:57.080 --> 57:58.520
the characters are so strong.

57:58.520 --> 57:59.520
It's the same.

57:59.520 --> 58:04.200
How do people want toys from the latest Disney or Pixar movie that they see that don't do

58:04.200 --> 58:07.360
anything but have a swinging arm, you know, or something like that?

58:07.360 --> 58:09.360
The arm swing?

58:09.360 --> 58:10.360
Sometimes.

58:10.360 --> 58:11.360
Depends.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.360
Anyway.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.360
All right.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
Uh, wow.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.360
Sorry.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.080
I have talked a lot about my gaming, but it was just a lot to play.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.640
I didn't even get in a little big planet three.

58:19.640 --> 58:22.440
I played little big planet three.

58:22.440 --> 58:27.600
They have some new mechanics like the, uh, the gun that sucks and blows.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.720
Can I think of that scene from Wayne's world?

58:29.720 --> 58:31.800
She's gone from suck to blow.

58:31.800 --> 58:32.800
That's not from Wayne's world.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.080
That's from space ball.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.640
Oh, what's from space balls?

58:35.640 --> 58:36.640
Why did I know?

58:36.640 --> 58:39.640
Uh, what was this haircut?

58:39.640 --> 58:43.400
Yeah, it certainly does suck or I don't know, whatever, whatever.

58:43.400 --> 58:44.400
Anyway.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.280
So that whole thing.

58:46.280 --> 58:47.280
Yeah.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.520
The new guns and the new elements that they do, they have that and they have like the

58:49.520 --> 58:55.040
portal esque kind of gun that fires a ball and if you fire it into a certain shape, uh,

58:55.040 --> 58:56.720
it will port you there.

58:56.720 --> 58:59.080
And so, okay, that's all good, but what does this all end up being?

58:59.080 --> 59:03.800
This is stuff to put on the canvas for the level creators where the really strong content

59:03.800 --> 59:04.800
is going to come out.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.640
So I'm really excited to see what people develop with this.

59:06.640 --> 59:10.360
I'm enjoying little big planet so far, but holy shit, we're an hour into the show.

59:10.360 --> 59:14.280
We haven't even touched the news yet, so, uh, let me get to Irene quickly and your gaming

59:14.280 --> 59:16.800
week and anything you want to share with listeners tonight on what you've been playing.

59:16.800 --> 59:17.960
We already talked about it.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.280
Jackbox and Smash Brothers.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.280
Okay.

59:20.280 --> 59:21.280
Yeah.

59:21.280 --> 59:22.280
There you go.

59:22.280 --> 59:23.280
Well, thank you.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.280
You're, you're giving up your segment essentially to help us save on time.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.800
I think we already talked about it, so.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
That's true.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.800
We did.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.800
All right.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
Uh, let's see.

59:30.800 --> 59:31.800
Let's see.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.760
Uh, Alan Alchemy says it's sucking my will to live was the Wayne's World thing.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
That's it.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
Sucking my will to live.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.760
That's it.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.760
All right.

59:39.760 --> 59:43.440
Um, let's get into, uh, some housekeeping real quick.

59:43.440 --> 59:49.200
Uh, if you missed the announcement last week, we will be doing our show on December 7th.

59:49.200 --> 59:51.640
That's in two weeks at a special time.

59:51.640 --> 59:57.280
That show will be broadcasting at noon Pacific time, three Eastern time, eight o'clock for

59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.160
those of you guys in the UK, uh, for what is that called UTC or whatever that is.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.640
Um, so we're doing that because Jamie and I have an event we want to attend, uh, personal

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.320
later in the evening, but we thought it's a good, Oh, two for one shot because our overseas

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.840
listeners sometimes say, when are you going to do a show that we can participate with

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840
and we can call into?

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840
So here's your chance.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.640
December 7th, that will be broadcast, uh, much earlier in the day.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.240
Um, but certainly I'm not saying only UK people can participate.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.240
Absolutely not.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.640
Uh, if you happen to be around at noon or three o'clock or whatever, then by all means

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.500
listen and give us call and all that good stuff.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.560
So we will be doing that, uh, in a couple of weeks or if you're not, it'll be rebroadcast

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.560
of the regular time.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560
That's right.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.040
It'll be rebroadcast to the regular time, right after Bobby black Wolf.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.960
So however, however you or, and it will be on the podcast feed for those of you guys

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.440
that are like, I don't do live shows.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.040
I don't, I don't do live pod.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.600
I need you on Monday to get me through workday, then we'll be there for you too.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600
All right.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.480
Uh, let's get into some news already.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480
Holy moly.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480
Busy, busy week.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480
Loki.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480
Yes.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.640
So busy week also for, um, Activision and blizzard world of Warcraft, um, has been having

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.080
a little bit of issues, especially right after the release of warlords of Draenor.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.520
They had people DDOS in their servers.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.760
They had, you know, just Q problems.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.720
So they finally decided, Hey, you know what, we're going to address this.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.640
Um, you know, basically saying, you know, the quality of the content does not excuse

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.440
the subpar launch experience we delivered.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.960
And I apologize for that.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.020
And that's J Allen Brack, the executive producer of world of Warcraft.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.880
And basically saying, you know what, uh, we're making things better.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:38.040
We're working on reducing, you know, the cues and the compensate people for their troubles.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.760
We're going to give you a five days a game time.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.160
So that's pretty nice.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.760
At least they're fixing that and, uh, apparently doing pretty well, especially, um, back up

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.320
to 10 million subscribers after the launch of the newest expansion.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.520
So, so how about that?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.700
3.3 million copies day one.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.120
So they're back up to 10 million.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.880
They were down to like seven, four, seven, six somewhere I heard was the last number.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.860
And now they're up to 10 million.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.440
So that whole peer pressure thing we talked about earlier and the feeling of it's, it's

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440
working a lot.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.800
I'd be curious though, you know, I granted there are 10 million right now, but how quickly

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.600
are they going to get through all that content and just, you know, is it going to be three

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.820
months from now that they're back down to, you know, they're going to see that drop again?

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:28.120
I think that's a very fair question to ask because Blizzard has really said nothing about

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.760
patches and what else is to be looking forward to.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.720
I think they're going to save a lot of that this time for just when people are starting

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.000
to feel burned out a little bit and they're obviously they're slowly rolling out content.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.160
That's what they do now.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.720
Like the raid isn't out yet.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.860
The raid launches, I think next week, don't quote me on these dates, but I think the raid

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:52.240
launches next week for the normal raid and then the mythic, which is their new heroic

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.200
or however it all breaks down, that is out in two weeks and the LFR happens then too,

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.820
but you can only do one part of the raid in LFR.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.760
The rest of LFR opens up over the course of like four more weeks or something like that,

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.640
which it makes sense the way they're doing it.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.000
I can't really fault them for the way they're slowly rolling out.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And I think it does take a lot of that pressure off.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.240
Like I got to level up to on her tonight.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.000
I've got to do it tonight so I can raid with the people or I'm going to get left out in

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
the cold.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Right.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Like thankfully they don't do that anymore.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.080
Uh, so I'm okay with that.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.640
But yeah, I mean, Loki, what is it going to look like in three months once a lot of people

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640
have gone through the raid?

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640
I don't know.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.640
Well, and also the fact that a lot of the time, um, that was, you know, cause they have

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.600
that token to level you up.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.120
Remember to, I forget what it was now.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.480
The boost to 60 or the boost to 90, excuse me, boost to 90 or something.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.740
So that's going to take a lot of the grinding time out.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.560
So it's going to kind of quickly, you know, it's going to make the game go a little bit

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560
quicker for you.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.920
So I don't know if that's, you know, a great thing.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.560
So many of those people have so many alts already at 90 because of Pandaria's drought.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.040
I think they're probably not as worried about it.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.580
I think it's interesting though that out of 10 million subscribers, only 3.3 million bought

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.840
the expansion.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.960
But one thing to consider that number is from the first 24 hours or something like that.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.360
And it doesn't include China, which you probably can figure half those subscribers in the 10

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.000
million are China, Asia, and other regions that don't have that expansion yet.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.360
So 3.3 out of 5 million makes a lot more sense because I know not everybody jumps on board

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360
with the expansion.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.020
And also not everyone's going to jump aboard the first 24 hours and people got to wait

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
for paychecks.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020
Exactly, exactly.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020
So that makes a lot more sense.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.020
And you consider that.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.540
But when I first heard there's numbers, I was like, why did only a third of the players

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.540
buy the expansion?

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.800
Oh, it didn't come out in China at the same time.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Got it.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:43.840
So yeah, wow, it looks like the expansion is doing very well for them.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.400
If you really want to push me over the edge, Blizzard, because here I am looking, all my

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.940
friends are playing, wow, maybe I should play some wow.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.880
Tell me what the patches are going to look like and what there is to look forward to

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.240
and what my money's really going to end up buying.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.220
Because if you can kind of get that one, I don't know what it is that would be that key

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.600
thing that would bring me back.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.560
Maybe that level syncing I've always talked about.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.640
I don't know why they don't do it.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.280
Or maybe more five man dungeons will get me really excited.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.760
That's probably going to send me over the edge and I'll do it.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.640
I'll go back to wow.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.760
I don't know what exactly is happening with Warlords of Draenor.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.400
I haven't watched any trailers.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.880
I haven't really heard anybody talk about it to me because I'm not interested in wow.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.320
But have they talked about some of the ways that this expansion is going to be different

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.600
from the last couple of expansions that they've had?

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600
Last few?

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:37.720
They've been pushing like the garrisons, which is, you know, the new, it's their new profession

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:43.540
basically, but they don't frame it as a profession, but you know, the garrisons and it's a return.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.000
It's let's do the time warp again, because they're going back to Burning Crusade to fix

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.800
a timeline or something like that.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:55.280
So it's, you know, a whole time travel thing that they're doing.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.200
And then they simply took a lot of talents out is my understanding.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.980
Now Blizzard had to simplify their own MMO to make it more accessible.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980
But you know what?

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980
That's good.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.040
They were just getting too disparate with their stuff.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.200
And that's kind of what I mean is not in terms of what they're adding, but like how they're

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.680
making the gameplay experience different from what were very mediocre expansions.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.120
And they did the squish, the item squish.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120
Yeah.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120
That happened.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.640
So now, you know, the math and all that isn't so obscene with how much stats everything

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.280
was.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.880
But I haven't heard a lot about PvP.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.300
I didn't hear about any new Battlegrounds or anything like that.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.040
But one thing Pandaria did have like two or three new Battlegrounds.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.760
There's a lot of Battlegrounds in WoW.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.100
I kind of miss them.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:45.680
Like I actually really enjoyed the PvP game in WoW, which is weird because I don't usually

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.260
super get into PvP, but some of those Battlegrounds are really fun.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.680
Like I know you hated it, but I loved Isle of Conquest, which is a lot of fun.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.240
That new one they put in really wasn't bad.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240
I don't remember the name of it.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.440
It was the very last one they did.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.960
The Goblin Mines or something.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.240
No, there was a Goblin Mine.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240
That was one.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240
Then there was like another one.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240
Anyway.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.240
Sorry.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240
It's been a while.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.440
But yeah, there's a lot of fun PvP in there.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440
Right.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.440
I mean, they don't need to change anything really with their Battlegrounds.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.440
I feel like.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.360
I mean, they can stop making new ones.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.080
I mean, the people that like for me, when I was PvPing, I did Gulch all the time.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.400
I sometimes did Basin.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.640
I don't need them to reinvent the wheel for me.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.400
I'm playing them because I like it how it is.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.120
And it doesn't get old for me because it's playing against other people that's making

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.200
it new every time.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.480
So I don't know.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.480
Yeah.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.400
And like as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, it really doesn't have a strong PvP game right

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.400
now.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.640
They have like one arena and they have something called Cartno Flats or Frontlines, which is

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.960
sort of Arathi Basin, sort of.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:48.520
But the weird twist on Final Fantasy 14 is that it's three factions, not two.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.680
So it's everything is now is like 3v3 or whatever you call it.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680
Right.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680
Kind of puts a new twist on it.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680
Interesting.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680
Very interesting.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.480
So, I mean, a lot of the PvPers are just they're playing the MOBAs now, so they don't really

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.360
need that from WoW.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.400
Rama in our chat is asking, wait, when did this become WoW Lounge Radio?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.080
Hey, you know what?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.040
Because 10 million people are playing World of Warcraft right now.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.040
It's kind of big news.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.040
What happens when you miss an episode of...

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Take an episode of Warhouse off.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040
All right.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040
All right.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040
Look, you want to hear consoles?

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040
I'll tell you consoles.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Here's the thing.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.240
Your Sony information is safe.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240
That's the news.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.080
There was news out there that apparently about 2,000 PlayStation Network logins had been

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.080
hacked.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.360
But Sony has responded saying, we've investigated the claims that our network was breached and

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.560
have found no evidence that there was any intrusion into our network.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.440
Unfortunately, Internet fraud, including phishing and password matching, are realities that

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.180
consumers and online networks face on a regular basis.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.280
We take these reports very seriously and continue to monitor our network closely.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.640
Apparently, a group did take responsibility finally for, speaking of World of Warcraft,

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.160
the denial of service attacks that were happening on Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV were also

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.480
claiming to have obtained this information.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.160
But Sony saying there is no...

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.160
Move along.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160
Nothing to see here.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.280
That's what Sony is saying.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.160
I still think this is just a good reminder.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.520
Use a different password on these technical sites than you would use in other places.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.880
Because this Sony, Blizzard, Square Enix now, apparently, Microsoft, all of them are

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
targets.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.720
And two-step authentication when you can.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.940
When you can have two-step authentication, absolutely.

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.400
Your email is a must.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.160
Because if somebody gets control of your email, that's it.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.160
You're done.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.400
They can get anything else.

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.080
Your banking, whatever else.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.320
Get two-step authentication on your email if nothing else.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.560
So just a friendly little reminder from us here at Orange Launch Radio, because we don't

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.320
want dickbags to steal your information.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.040
Your information is important to us.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Thanks, Rob.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040
You're welcome.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.040
Anytime.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040
That's what we're here.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040
We're your friends.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040
Loki.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.040
So this is pretty sweet.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040
There's a new Kickstarter.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.040
Yeah, I know.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.040
Another Kickstarter for another game.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.920
But this is awesome because it's Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.860
They're doing a brand new Maniac Mansion-style adventure game, and it looks straight up like

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.860
Maniac Mansion.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:15.120
I mean, the old-school LucasArts point-and-click adventure game.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:23.400
It's called Thimbleweed Park, and it's Brainiac Branchin'.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.700
It looks awesome.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.160
So go check it out.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.600
They're going to pretty much hit their funding.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:36.300
They're already at $355,000 of their $375,000 goal, and they have 24 days to go, so there's

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.600
pretty much no chance that they're not going to.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600
It's going to happen.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.600
Interesting.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.640
People really longing for those 2D adventure games.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.400
I remember at some point people tried to say that genre was dead, and then Telltale

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.600
puts out all these award-winning games, and fans are doing these 2D.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.760
This genre is not dead.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.400
People still love this stuff.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.780
Just the art style and everything looks just like...

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:03.920
It's straight up out of the 90s.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.600
They even have a little animated image here.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:15.120
It looks like they'll use balloon animal with corpse.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.760
You can try all those things, and it's awesome.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.600
And who wouldn't try to use a balloon animal with a corpse, really?

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.920
This is getting into awkward time.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.920
It's pretty awesome, and some of the rewards.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.520
Let's see here what they're giving away.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.720
$20 gets you the game.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.680
If you want to spend more than $20, it looks like $30, or $25.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.560
$25 is the I-pirated maniac mansion in Monkey Island when I was a kid, and I feel bad.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.320
This reward tier instantly absolves you of all guilt, including the theming part game.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.800
That's kind of funny.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.200
Subsequent tiers also include guilt absolution.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.360
That's awesome.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360
That's awesome.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.280
Looking at our chat, Dungeon Buster says, CinnaWear is also doing a Kickstarter for

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.400
an HD version of Rocket Ranger with new gameplay bits.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.840
Just tell me when they start Kickstarting a new Legend of Chirandia, all right?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.120
Seriously, that would be awesome.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.160
Game Guru says, donate to this game or the hamster gets microwaved.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.480
That was my favorite part.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480
Yep.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480
Oh boy.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480
That's awesome.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.480
That's a dark place.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480
Let's see.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.200
SSJ100Matt says, I think people just desire the old days where that quote, not the greatest

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.160
game of all time, Super Metroid ruled.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.680
Why did you put that in quotes that it's not the greatest game of all time?

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.600
Because it is the greatest game of all time.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.960
Who would dare argue with that sound logic?

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:44.400
It's because games like Maniac Mansion and Secret of Monkey Island and stuff are just

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.400
timeless.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.120
They're just greatly written games.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.760
And also, even though that one bullet point was supposed to be funny about the piracy,

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.280
it really unveiled it there.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.280
Absolve yourself of the guilt from being a kid.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.920
Hey, kid.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.200
Now that you have a job to make money, give me your money.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.200
Right.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.200
Right.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.200
I mean, that's a big part of it.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.200
It's stuff we remember.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.080
Hey, back in those days, it was difficult to pirate games.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.200
You had to rip apart those disks.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.040
And I'm not talking about the actual floppy disks.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.840
I'm talking about the code disks that you had to turn and match up the phrases in order

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.320
to photocopy this.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.840
Or I had to call my friend and be like, all right, get out the box.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
Turn to page 24.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
All right.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.600
What's the third word in the second paragraph?

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.080
You know what we're talking about, though?

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080
Come on.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080
I do.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.080
I do.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080
That's why I say it.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.040
Or one of my favorites was covert action, where it was like, you had the page of the

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.080
mugshots and you had to be like, which one is this operative?

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.800
And if you get it wrong, the game would be like super hard.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.000
You can do anything in it and make good times with copy protection.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Good times.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Do you have any copy protection memories?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
No.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.720
Moving right along.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.720
Space Quest 4, I remember.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.440
And because I actually did buy the game and I had the manual and sometimes I'd still get

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.880
it wrong.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.560
Mine was Leisure Suit Larry, the remake that they did, because you had to answer trivia

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.160
questions to get into the game.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160
And they were quite...

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.640
It wasn't really copy protection, but it was making sure you were of age.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.040
And so it would ask you questions that only somebody in their 20s or 30s know the answers

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040
to.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
But we got them all right.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.040
We'd be like 13.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080
We get them all right.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.320
It's like, yeah, we're going to see some pixelated titties.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.640
Why were you excited?

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.520
I don't know, because everybody likes titties.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520
Yeah, pixel tits.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.480
That'll be the sequel.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:44.800
At the top of part B, by the way, I've got to ask you about last week's show and this

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.600
whole pixel shit phenomenon, but we'll save that for later.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.320
Anyway, let's get into another story, and this one is about the game Evolve, which a

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.040
lot of people are looking forward to.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.360
This is that whole four versus one game.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.960
Lots of people looking forward to this.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.360
And some folks are going to be very happy to hear that DLC maps in Evolve, they will

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.560
be available for free.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.640
And this is to ensure that you don't have one person who doesn't have the maps.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.320
They're not able to play multiplayer matches with other people or getting kicked out of

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.600
public rooms because they don't have a certain map.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.660
So they just decided, you know what, we're going to make the maps free.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.000
So that's always nice to hear about free DLC.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.680
But just so you know, Evolve will have some other pay DLC.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.760
For example, you're going to have characters and monsters that are pay DLC.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.380
But the good news is, even if you didn't buy them, if your friend did, you'll be able to

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.780
play against them.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780
And that's alright.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.340
I mean, we were playing Mario Kart 8, I didn't even talk about it during the game, we were

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.620
playing Mario Kart 8 with Extrovert online, right?

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.020
He has not bought the DLC pack.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:55.900
We were able to still pick Tanooki, Mario, and Zelda, and Link from Zelda, and he was

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.460
able to see them in the race.

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:01.100
We couldn't do the new tracks, but we could do the new characters.

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.940
So it's kind of like something similar with that.

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:03.940
So, yeah.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.940
Alright.

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940
Good times.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.940
Good times.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.540
So that is Evolve and DLC.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.460
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at bognetwork.com,

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.940
use the passphrase, pumpkin.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.780
Alright, we are going to now travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.740
and see what is coming to a gaming store near you.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.900
Ah, well after last week, you would think that there would be a ton.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:29.900
But no.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.860
Actually, it's died down to nothing again.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.340
We're back in the drought, thankfully.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.660
So this week, we have Akiba's trip undead and undressed for PlayStation 4, which I'm

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.900
actually thinking about picking up, because, I don't know, I need more PlayStation 4 games.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.140
Maybe I should get Far Cry instead.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:53.820
Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth on 3DS, and that's literally it.

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.820
Just those two games.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.460
I guess it's slowing down a little bit now.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.460
Quite a bit, yeah.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.540
Once we get into December, it's going to be dead.

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.540
Yeah.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.620
Geometry Wars is the big thing I'm looking forward to this week, but that's all online.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.620
Yeah.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.620
Right.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.660
Which, if we go over to Europe, I'll do this out of order here a little bit.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.280
We'll go to Europe and look at the releases there.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.740
In fact, Geometry Wars is out this week on the 26th on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.540
360, and PlayStation 3.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.420
LittleBigPlanet gets its release overseas in the UK, also on the 26th of November.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:27.940
On the 27th of November, Raven's Cry hits the Mac and PC platforms, and the delayed

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:34.580
for Europe, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Pokemon Omega Ruby make their way on the 28th of November.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.660
That was the slap on the hand to the entire country for leaking X and Y earlier.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.220
Remember that?

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:46.540
X and Y got leaked early in Europe, and it was a Europe store that had put it, so Nintendo

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.860
punished the whole country by putting it out a week later there.

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.940
So that'll teach you to leak a game early.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.820
Do not fuck with them, man.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.820
They're a force to be reckoned with.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:00.420
I know a lot of players overseas eagerly awaiting that.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.300
Let's talk about Japan.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.880
Dragon Age Inquisition gets its Japanese release on the PlayStation 4.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.200
I don't know if that's localized or if that's with, like, subtitles or something.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200
It doesn't really say.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.200
I would imagine this is a subtitled version, but it is available for the PlayStation 4

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.600
in regular and deluxe edition on November 27th.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.320
Simply Series G4U Volume 1, the Mahjong, is also out on November 27th, because I know

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.160
y'all love Mahjong.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.520
Little Big Planet 3, oops, sorry, that is somehow a Europe date snuck its way on my

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.640
list there.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:37.040
But NBA 2K15 is something you can check out in Japan also on November 27th.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.380
Many of those same games on the Xbox One this week, including Dragon Age Inquisition

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.160
and NBA 2K15.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.820
Microsoft Xbox One's edition comes out on a disc version in Japan this week.

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:52.020
There's also some new game pads, some black and blue Hori pads if you want to check those

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.320
out in Japan.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.200
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Biohazard HD Remaster, which of course is Resident Evil,

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.000
that is releasing this week.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.160
There's also a collector's package and something called an eCapcom Complete Edition.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.320
Dragon Age Inquisition also on the PlayStation 3.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.160
I had no idea that Inquisition was also on last generation's consoles.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.800
That blew me away.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.120
If it's buggy on the new ones, I can only imagine what the old ones look like, sorry.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.800
Buyer beware.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:30.740
Let's see, on the Xbox 360, Dragon Age Inquisition, as well as Sakura Flamingo Archives.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.240
Your guess is as good as mine as to what that's on, like Flamingo Festival, I don't know.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:42.900
On the Wii U this week, Gotouchi Setsudo, Gotouchi Chara no Nihon Zenkoku no Tabi comes

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:49.040
out this week, which is, I'm trying to see if this is a series I recognize.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:55.640
This looks like a Mario Party-esque kind of game, but these are not characters I recognize,

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.960
so it might be tied into like a Japanese TV show or something like that.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:03.720
Oh, they have a little trailer, I did not realize that.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720
Let's take a look.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Yeah, it's...

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:16.440
It's always better when you yell it, that's right.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.040
There's like trains in Japan.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.360
Yeah, it's Mario Party, that's what it is basically.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.400
All right, so that is what you have to look forward to on the Wii U this week.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.000
So there you go with the releases.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.640
We're going to get into a few more stories here in the classic game of the week, but

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.240
I thought I would say hello to, just walked into the studio here.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.640
Hello Jonas, welcome back.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640
Hello.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640
You're here again.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.200
I'm going to start charging, I'm just kidding.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.200
How you doing?

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.480
I actually did fine, sorry, I came in a little later than expected.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.640
That's fine, it happens.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.040
Big game release week, right?

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.040
Oh yeah, that would be busy.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.920
So I'm thinking you've probably had a chance to check out Super Smash Brothers on the Wii

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920
U?

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920
Yep.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920
What'd you think?

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.480
So far so good, I mean, I like it so far.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.360
Are you getting excited about implementing this at anime conventions, because, you know,

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
for those that...

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.600
That's pretty much my whole email bucket.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600
Oh really?

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.600
Yes.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.720
So when you check the emails for the teabaggers, the big anime game room, when's the Smash

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.120
Tournament?

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.920
They're asking about that.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.360
It's still to be announced, we'll probably announce it in a week or two, when we get

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.560
all the schedules finalized for SacAnime.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.640
Have you played around with the, oh that's right, because SacAnime is, what, the first

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640
weekend of January, right?

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.080
January 2nd to the 4th.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.080
Wow.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.080
Oh my gosh.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.080
No time after the holidays.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.080
No time.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.200
You're gonna hit the ground running, it's time for an anime con.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.200
Amiibos.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.280
Have you had a chance to play around with that at all?

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.200
I haven't had the time to test out Amiibos, unfortunately.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200
Yeah?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.040
Well you know, like, people can level up characters that learn their own stuff.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.840
So my question is, are you gonna have a contest where it's just Amiibo versus Amiibo?

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840
That would be pretty cool.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.400
That might be kinda interesting.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.040
Amiibo versus Amiibo.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.800
Right now we're thinking about it, but we wanna test the waters first.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800
Okay.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:06.000
Because we don't wanna overwhelm, like let's say, for instance, oh we're gonna throw an

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.480
Amiibo contest, and guess what, 128 people show up and you know how long that will take.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.720
Yeah, that's true, that's a good point.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.040
We wanna play a little safer.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.920
8 player smash, if that's the case.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.920
8 player smash.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.120
You better be here 5 minutes before your timer, you're out, buddy.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.840
And from what I've heard, you might as well get those 4 player adapters, or at least two

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:26.800
of them, if you want 8 players as soon as possible, because those prices are gonna skyrocket.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.720
If you have not already bought the GameCube adapters, you better be prepared to put out

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.980
on eBay.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.980
To buy one.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.980
Or just put out.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.880
Or just put out, because they're gone.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.960
They are gone.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.040
Unless Nintendo, kind and benevolent, does a reprinting.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.520
Oh no, they'll do a reprinting.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.120
For the adapter that works with one fucking game.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.260
Oh no, they'll do a reprinting of course.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.800
And guess who we'll be exclusive to.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Don't you dare.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.080
Bite your tongue.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.000
Just in time for GameCube games coming to Virtual Console.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
That would be-

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
That would triple the cost too, by the way.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
That would be, yeah, that would be why.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.120
Then they'll release a bundle where it's like, you get this, and a code to get Super Mario

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.120
Sunshine.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.120
Adapter, get.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:16.280
But, I think those adapters are not like 100 bucks, it went from like 20 dollars to 100.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.280
It's crazy.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280
Yeah.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.560
Please don't, please don't pay those prices on eBay, you don't need a GameCube controller

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.560
that bad.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:22.560
You do not.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:27.600
If you can't fucking play Smash with the fucking giant control, you know what, then maybe you're

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600
just bad at Smash.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600
Like, I'm just gonna say it.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600
I'm just gonna say it.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.400
If you're that reliant on a GameCube controller, maybe your skills aren't that good.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.400
I'm sorry.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400
I'm sorry.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400
Come at me.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.800
Come at me.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.640
And also, if you really, if you don't want to spend 100 bucks, you have to find the places

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:43.920
that actually still have it.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.920
Yeah.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.920
Which you won't.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:46.920
Good luck with that.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.920
You won't.

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.920
Alright.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:54.480
Of course, of course, Pokemon's also taking my time too, unfortunately.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.520
Alright, ST-100 Matt saying, don't say it, Loki.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520
Don't say it.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.520
Do not.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520
Don't you dare.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.960
Alright, Jonas, we'll be checking in with you again as we move on with the show here,

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.200
and feel free to chime in if you have anything to say on the news as we move on with some

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.200
more news.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.200
Loki.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:15.360
Yes, because it wouldn't be the GameCube without an evil G in there.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.360
Alright, anyways.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.200
So, let's talk about the Game Wars, because hey, that's right around the corner, isn't

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200
it?

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.600
Remember the whole independent game?

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.240
Well, it's not on Spike anymore, but there's a surprise for having an awards ceremony next

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.240
month.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.320
Yes, and they have nominees from each category, and here's the full list, so we'll just go

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.400
over some brief ones here.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.120
Best online experience.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.280
Call of Duty, Dark Souls 2, Destiny, Hearthstone, or Titanfall.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.000
Hearthstone's going to be a tough one, considering how the launch was.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
But whatever.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.360
You're thinking World of Warcraft.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360
Hearthstone's fine.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360
Hearthstone doesn't have any bugs.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360
Yes, you're right.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360
I'm thinking World of Warcraft.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Yeah, Hearthstone's fine.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360
Best family game.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.680
Disney Infinity 2.0, Fantasia, Mario Kart 8, Skylanders, or Tomodachi Life.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:08.520
I think Mario Kart 8's got that in the bag.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:14.080
Best sports slash racing game, FIFA 15, Forza Horizon 2, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart 8 again,

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.280
NBA 2K15, and Trials Fusion.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.560
Get to the big stuff.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.200
No one cares about these piddly categories.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.720
All right, let's see here.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720
Game of the Year.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720
There we go.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:31.440
Bayonetta 2, Dark Souls 2, Dragon Age Inquisition, Hearthstone, or Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.400
That's kind of a weird culmination, I have to say.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.720
And of course, the entire internet piping up on where's this?

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.380
Where's Smash Brothers?

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.280
Where's Shovel Knight?

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.400
Nobody's happy with this final result.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.800
But I think it does beg a good question.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.180
How did they come up with this list?

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.600
And there's a jury or something, right?

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.760
That's all these random men, because I don't think there was a single woman on it.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.480
There's all these men, maybe one.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.440
Is there ever a one on these panels?

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.440
Good question.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.840
But anyway, on the jury.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:12.720
And then there also was a page that showed all the, I don't know if they were sponsors

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.720
or partners or something like that.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.520
Like Ubisoft's one of them.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.760
And so the one that struck me as really interesting, do you have the nominees for Studio of the

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.760
Year?

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.520
I'm sorry, I have to say something on this.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.480
Is it Developer of the Year?

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.720
Yeah, Developer of the Year.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.240
Blizzard Entertainment, Monolith.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.800
Okay, let's stop and go over each one as we go.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.000
So Blizzard Entertainment, which obviously the behemoth of Hearthstone, Heroes of the

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.400
Storm doing great for them, World of Warcraft, everybody's playing WoW games.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.280
Maybe not so great with the launch, but they're having a good year otherwise.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.120
Monolith Productions.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:58.040
Monolith Productions, they made, what am I thinking?

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.640
They do Wii games, right?

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.180
Didn't they do Xenoblade, but Xenoblade wasn't this year.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.120
That's why I'm like, wait a minute, that can't be the game they were nominated for.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.840
What's the big game that they did this year?

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.840
They didn't do Bayonetta.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.920
I don't know.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.920
Nintendo.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.840
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.000
No, no, no, somebody's got to answer this question.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.400
Why is Monolith on the list?

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.160
Nobody knows.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.960
I guess all the hype for Xenoblade for next year.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.280
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.160
No, there's Monolith and there's Monolith Soft.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.160
And we're thinking Monolith Soft, right?

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.680
No, this is Monolith Productions.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680
That's why.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.680
Monolith Productions.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.680
Okay, that's why.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.680
Because, okay.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.240
I'm like, what the hell did they do?

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.680
Okay, Monolith Productions did Shadows of Mordor.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.680
So that's why they're on the list.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680
Okay.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680
Nintendo.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.560
Okay, which, you know, Nintendo did Mario Kart and Nintendo games.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.400
Telltale games.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.400
Which I was like, wait a minute, Tales from the Borderlands isn't out yet, but the Fable

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.040
game, Wolf Among Us has been very well received.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.120
So I can see that.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.800
In Ubisoft Montreal.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800
And they're one of the sponsors?

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800
Hold on.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800
Hold on.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:19.800
Not only is Ubisoft one of the sponsors, what games did Ubisoft make this year, specifically

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.800
Assassin's Creed Unity?

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.280
Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.960
Which now, to be fair, I talked earlier in the show about how, wait a minute, wait a

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960
minute.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.960
If we're going to razz Assassin's Creed Unity, we got to do a little razzing on Dragon Age

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:40.800
Inquisition as well, but still, the studio that was infamous this year for a comment

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.760
about what they can and they can't render, you know, that whole thing, I'm just, I'm

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.760
very surprised that they're on the list when, you know, maybe, I don't, maybe Yacht Club

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:57.560
Games who made Shovel Knight, who's basically kind of, you know, the Kickstarter phenomenon,

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.280
they kind of personify, I don't, maybe would be.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.520
They also made Far Cry 4, but then again, they also made Watch Dogs, so.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:10.520
Oh, oh, oh, the studio that had the E3 footage that didn't match the final game.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:14.320
I'm not sure if that's, I don't think that studio did all three of those games.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.600
I think that they're just kind of lumping all this stuff together, because it wasn't

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:21.680
all Ubisoft, Ubisoft Montreal was in every fucking game that came out from Ubisoft this

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:22.680
year.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:26.680
There's no way that that was the case.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:33.400
I just, unfortunately, I think the information I was looking at was lumping everything together.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:39.520
I just, I'm sorry, I just, I would like to know who on the jury actually wrote that down

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.240
on the paper, like, because all these people that are on the jury are the same, and this

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.280
is the thing, if, like, if you're an Assassin's Creed fan and you're like, Rob, stop fucking

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.520
picking on this game, here's the thing, this is my point, this jury is made up of all these

01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:00.880
people that are in the industry, right, who all gave that game shit.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:05.080
Like the reviews across the board have been harping on the same thing, yet those same

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.440
people ended up nominating for Studio of the Year?

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.440
Maybe it's a joke.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.440
I don't know.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440
Just something doesn't add up.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440
Satire?

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.440
Something doesn't add up.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440
That's all I'm saying.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.680
Okay, and then, let's see what else here.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.560
Best independent games, Broken Age Act 1, Monument Valley, Shovel Knight, Transistor,

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.680
and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.680
And Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:37.240
Now, Dungeon Buster points out that Ubisoft Montreal also did Child of Light, and that

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.840
was, that was a pretty good game.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.160
Like, I don't know, I don't know if I would look back on, like, that was, wow, that was

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.280
one of the year's best, but that was a good game.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.120
Okay, come on, come on, this is a little ridiculous.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.120
Best fighting game.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.200
All right, Killer Instinct Season 2.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.200
Okay.

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.840
War Arena Ultimax.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.840
Okay.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.840
Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.400
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Ultra Street Fighter IV.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.040
That's a little...

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.240
Was it a slim year for fighting games?

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240
I mean...

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.240
Apparently.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.240
What came out this...

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.000
Yeah, that's pretty much all, pretty much all that came out, really, because a lot of

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.400
the games are being delayed for next year.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.800
So it's been a really slow year for fighting games.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.800
Well, then, here's a thought.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.320
You know, just throw this out there.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.920
So Smash Bros. did get nominated.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920
It just...

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.920
I'm just throwing this out there.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920
Here's the thought.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.120
If you don't have enough entries for a category, don't do that category.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.520
Or you cut the number of nominees.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520
That's what the Oscars does.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.320
If there's not enough nominees for, like, best animated picture, then they only have

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.320
three nominees.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.320
Right.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.320
Anyway.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320
I'm just...

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.480
There's a lot of question marks with this, and no award show's gonna be perfect.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.080
And I suppose here we are buying into it, because we're talking about, you know, that's

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.080
what it is.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.080
It's buzzed or whatever.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.960
But I'm kind of looking at this already going, this thing's got problems, and I don't think

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:49.960
I'm gonna be watching.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:50.960
Right.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It's a little sloppy.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Best action adventure game.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Yeah.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Fighting game of the year.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.880
Yeah, they can't really say much, because there's only five games around that really

01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.880
just came out.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.320
Everything else either came out years before, or coming out next year.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320
That's the thing.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:09.080
Also, some of these games that just came out, like, literally Friday, it's like, oh, game

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080
of the year already.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.080
It's like, okay.

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.080
Right.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.920
I'll cut them slack on that, because press would have access to early copies of the games

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.560
so they can write their reviews.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:22.340
So I would imagine that the people on this jury were pretty well seasoned in the games

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.920
coming out this month because of their review copies.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.120
And also, not to be a dick about this, but why the hell are people doing game of the

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:34.640
years when the year is still going on, even if you get the early copies?

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.580
To be fair, the Grammys do a similar thing.

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:44.000
And everybody respects the Grammys for some reason, which, if there's one award show that's

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.480
worse than any of this, it's the Grammys.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.480
Seriously.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.040
I'm just calling people out tonight.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.000
The Grammys are awful.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.840
If you really think about it, the Grammys are horrible.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.320
They are the worst of all the award shows.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320
They really are.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.280
Do they ever pick a good song to win for the year?

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.280
Ever?

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.280
I don't watch them.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280
It is what it is, okay?

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.480
It's a giant circle jerk.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.480
That's all this is.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.120
I mean, who cares?

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:15.360
Who cares if someone says Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Unity is the game of the year?

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.280
If you don't think that, then who cares?

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.840
It doesn't fucking matter.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840
It doesn't matter.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.720
It's another sticker or label that goes on the cover of their game of the year edition.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720
I'll come out next year.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.720
Oh, right.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.440
Vitpower in our chat says, I'll be at the game awards in the audience.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:34.400
Well, sir, I want a man on the street report from you.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.640
I want to hear about it all.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.160
I want to hear how it goes, how your experience is, and all that.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.720
Because if you have a great time, that's all that really matters, right?

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.040
These awards are da-da-da-da-da.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.600
They have really good performances.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.120
If they have some games maybe available in the lobby for you to play, some other fun

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.280
things, then all this is for naught, right?

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.140
So I hope you do have a fun time at the show.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:59.320
But it's still a stupid award show, is what Rob is trying to tell you.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:04.120
I hope Kevin Spacey wins her best performance, because he was fucking awesome calling the

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.120
duty.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.120
Yeah, game of the year.

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.120
Because it's Kevin Spacey.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.120
Too early.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.120
Right.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.880
Especially with, again, back to the game of the year things, because if you do a game

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.840
of the year, what if a patch came out that fixes, let's say it says it's a great unity,

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:22.120
ooh, it kicks ass, it fixes all the bugs, everyone wants to play it now, kind of thing.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.120
Good point.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.120
Yeah.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.120
Good point.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.520
And then all my hating is for naught, but all those other people do.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.200
Let's say the patch was released December 31st, it fixes every problem that you said

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.280
in the radio show, and you play as like, oh my God, now this is game of the year.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.680
Well, it was ineligible.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.720
Like the Grammys run, I think it's October through October.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.760
Like the Grammys aren't really the year.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.040
The Grammys only run to October.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.600
That's why weird shit wins.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.760
Like you'll be hearing about who won the Grammys and you're like, that fucking thing came out

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.400
like last October.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.560
Why is it winning now?

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.520
And it's because of the weird eligibility window.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.520
Yeah.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.840
The reason why I bring that up, because the game of the year is not over, there's still

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.040
things and updates as will still go on.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.880
Once it hits January 1st, okay, now you can say, oh, now game of the year.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.060
Because at that time we're in the new year and okay, we're expecting new stuff.

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:13.860
So anything that gets released like 2015, that now belongs in the 2015 categories.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:20.580
Sg100matt saying, oh snap, Rob is going after the award show, Loki Rants style.

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.900
And Kaijuto says the Grammys pick real artists.

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.540
They don't always pick mainstream.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:27.140
Grammys are legit.

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.260
Three words for you, best new artist.

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.940
Look up the history of that category.

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:36.260
And I'm not just talking about who wins, but who gets nominated because you look at that

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:40.260
category and you go, the fuck?

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:45.460
Anyway, and, and, and, which is honestly an award they shouldn't even give out.

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:48.620
This is not a show about music, it's a show about games, but I'm just saying the Grammys,

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620
they're awful.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.620
Let's be honest.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.620
Okay.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.540
The real reason that you would watch this show, at least in the past, the reason I watched

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:57.580
this show is because of the trailers that for the new games that aren't even out yet.

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.900
New trailers is really why I want to watch the show and I hope they have new trailers.

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:07.780
I hope we have another trailer for No Man's Sky because that's a game I really want.

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.180
Some announcements would be really cool too.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.500
Like maybe Nintendo will drop an announcement of something that's going to be in the first

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.460
part of next year that we don't know about yet.

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.460
It's plausible.

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.460
Why not?

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.460
So we'll see.

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:23.180
Reggie Reggie's face was on the site somewhere when he's one of the guys contributing.

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.180
I don't know.

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:27.460
Speaking of Nintendo, uh, this is a pretty cool, uh, turn of events here.

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:30.980
And I don't know if there's a lot, a lot of details on this because it, I think it happened

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.620
out of an event in Japan, uh, that's being reported on.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:40.660
However, a word on the wire is that Satoru Iwata, a president of Nintendo said that fans

01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:47.260
can now use company's properties for a number of different things such as let's play videos,

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.820
which I, that's where I start to go.

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:50.820
Wait a minute.

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.820
Did they really say that?

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.740
Uh, fan art and much more.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:59.540
They will be joining the creative endorsement program, which rewards folks that get work

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.820
that is popular and well received in Japan.

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:07.060
Uh, they will be sponsoring the Toki, Toki, I don't know how to pronounce that.

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.060
I'm sorry.

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060
Game party.

01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.060
Yeah.

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.060
Thank you.

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.060
Which takes place early next year.

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.060
Yeah.

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.060
A little bit clarification though.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.060
Okay.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.980
Apparently I knew there had to be something with it.

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.980
Yeah.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.900
There's, there's a new, new bit of information.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:27.940
So apparently not everything is allowed and this only applies to Japan.

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:32.220
So they're saying that, um, you know, they announced on the stream of videos featuring

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:36.980
their games properties upload to Nico video that JP is allowed.

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:42.260
Um, it says, uh, so far they've acknowledged it for let's plays game music covers and fan

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:47.680
art, nothing else under the creative endorsement program from Nico video.

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.300
So it's only for that one site.

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.300
It's only for Japan.

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.300
Okay.

01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:52.300
Okay.

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.740
So I knew there had to be a little twist in here somewhere.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:55.380
So good to know.

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.460
Thank you.

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:01.020
So yeah, unfortunately that's not the case.

01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.100
So you can't go and profit off all their stuff on, you can't, you can't go make that fan

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:10.460
Mario game that you're planning on doing or making, you know, whatever.

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.460
Yeah.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.460
Oh yeah.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.460
Project project M is still illegal.

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.280
Sorry.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.280
That's a good point.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.380
All right.

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:22.020
Let's try, let's go back in time to a more classic time in games.

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.020
Let's go back.

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.900
You didn't have like fricking patches that, that changed the game completely.

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.100
Well, unless it was like the translation patch for second dead sets at two, three, like maybe

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.100
that was the thing.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:36.040
But anyway, uh, we go back to a simple time.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.500
Actually tonight's pick goes way, way, way, way, way back further than that.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.820
Tonight's pick goes back to 1984.

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.460
It is the classic game of the week where usually dark Sakura jumps into the gaming ball and

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:51.580
picks the game that she thinks, Hey, you should be playing this game this week.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.140
And since dark Sakura isn't here, guess who's picking the game?

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.140
Me.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.140
Wow.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.260
So tonight I have picked a game that was on a multitude of different platforms, but of

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.980
course I remember it most fondly from the Commodore 64.

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:10.940
And it's because of those sweet, sweet chip tunes.

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:18.940
And I think all I have to do is play the intro song for you guys to know this game.

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.060
Looks like they said the name of it in the intro or something.

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.060
Exactly.

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.060
That's right.

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.820
Tonight I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters, specifically the 1984 edition.

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.620
Let me skip ahead to some actual gameplay here in the video.

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:32.620
Okay.

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:37.300
So I'm going to talk about Ghostbusters from 1984 because there were several different

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:43.060
additions of Ghostbusters games, but this is the, really the classic one that I remember

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:48.420
from being a kid like this, this was the stuff that like I went to the store and I saw this

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.580
on like the demo computer and like, I lost my mind because this game looks so awesome.

01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.620
And did you, Irene, you grew up on Commodore 64.

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.620
Did you ever play this?

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:57.620
I played this.

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.620
Yeah.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620
Yeah.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620
It was so fun.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620
Fucking awesome.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.620
Like there really wasn't anything like it.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:03.620
Now they did.

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.620
They did port it to other platforms.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.420
It wasn't just on the Commodore 64.

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.220
It was on the Atari 2600.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:11.900
It was also on the Sega master system, but it was kind of a crappy port and it was also

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:12.980
on the NES.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.160
Also a crappy port.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.980
That's why I picked the Commodore 64 version, which is a little more true to the original.

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:22.060
This is a game by the infamous David Crane, and that's also part of what made this game

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.060
special.

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.340
And if you don't know that name, like all the great Atari classics were David Crane.

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:34.580
He made Pitfall, Pitfall 2, Kaboom, like back when Activision was like almost like an indie

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.580
developer studio.

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.580
Is that music too loud?

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.580
I'm sorry.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.580
Let me turn it down a little bit.

01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.620
Although the chip tune is so awesome, right?

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.180
It's totally fine if it is.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.180
I know exactly.

01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:44.180
It's like part of the game right there.

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:45.740
So anyway, he made all those games.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:49.060
He also made this game.

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:55.020
Now Crane wrote the game in six weeks and it was the Commodore 64 version that he wrote

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:58.560
and I believe the Atari 800 game he also wrote as well.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.600
He had made the game based off a concept he had called Car Wars, where you had automobiles

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.740
in a city which led to the driving sequences that were present in the game, where as you

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:14.260
were driving from building to building, you could suck up ghosts in the ghost vacuum that

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.340
you would attach to your car.

01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.340
Yes, this is all a thing.

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:17.340
Okay.

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.340
It was the 80s.

01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.260
And if you ever saw the Ghostbusters movie, some of this stuff was in the movie as well.

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:24.580
So you could suck up the ghosts and so forth.

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:30.380
Now Activision had the license to Ghostbusters to do a movie there and then Crane watched

01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:33.460
the film after doing the game.

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.020
So he was already done with the game before he even saw the film.

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:41.060
So he wished he could have done a better victory screen and so forth, but he wasn't able to

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.060
do that.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.540
I'm assuming he had to know some things about the game though, because the Marshmallow Man's

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.540
in it.

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.540
Yeah.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:48.540
You wouldn't know about the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man once you've seen the movie.

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:49.540
Anyway.

01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:50.540
Of course.

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:54.580
The game was also ported to the Spectrum, the Amstrad, the MSX, and oh my gosh.

01:41:54.580 --> 01:42:00.140
So in the game, you pick from one of four cars with your bank money that you have, but

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.220
the funny thing is you can't afford the fourth car with the money you start with, and there's

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.220
a reason why.

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.220
We'll get into that later.

01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:09.560
So you have to stock up your car and then you drive around the city and buildings will

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:15.960
get attacked by ghosts and you use the streams, but don't cross them, you use the streams

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.920
to try and lure the ghost into the trap and then you fire the trap and get the ghost.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:25.720
And then that is how you basically get money that you save up and I think you also affect

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.600
the energy meter and you don't want the energy meter to get past a certain point or you won't

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.060
be able to get past the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who comes out late in the game.

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:37.240
And then at the very, very end of the game, you have to sneak by the Stay Puft Marshmallow

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.720
Man to get to the top of the building where the game comes to a conclusion.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.880
Now other versions of the game, the NES version and I believe the Sega Master System game

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.320
had like a level where you actually climbed up the building when you got to the very end

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320
of the game.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:56.160
I don't believe that was in the original version.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.160
So yeah.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.400
And also this game is infamous.

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:03.800
The NES version was actually ported by a Japanese developer and they had some really bad Engrish

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:10.400
at the end of the game because the ending screen says, congratulation, you have completed

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:15.800
a great game and proved with two O's the justice of our culture.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.360
Now go and rest our heroes.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.000
That was literally the end game screen in Ghostbusters on the NES.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.640
You see this text in a later Ghostbusters video game as an Easter egg.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.800
It's like in the background hiding somewhere.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.800
So yeah.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.360
Anyway, this game was huge.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.360
In fact, it was so huge.

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.960
It was one of the most pirated Commodore 64 games of its day.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.040
This and the print shop were two of the most pirated titles.

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.040
I swear to God.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040
I'm reading it right here.

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:48.920
The print shop and Ghostbusters were two of the biggest pirated Commodore 64 programs

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.680
in 1985.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.080
So there it is.

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.280
So yeah, apparently an enhanced remake of the spectrum version was released as freeware

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.960
for the PC in 2006.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960
I did not realize this.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960
I'll have to check that out at some point.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:05.560
So yeah, that's Ghostbusters 1984.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.160
My pick for classic game of the week.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.360
Irene, any memories with this game?

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.360
Not really.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360
I didn't play it very much.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:17.200
But you know what else David Crane made that should be featured as a classic game of the

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200
week?

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.720
I will write that down and send it to Dark Soccer for consideration.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:27.120
It's on the NES and it involves a certain person feeding another person a certain kind

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.120
of candy.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.120
Oh, yes.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.840
You know what I'm talking about.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.840
That's right.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.720
All right.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.720
Okay.

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:35.720
Feeding the jelly beans.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.720
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:37.720
Yes, exactly.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.840
That was a David Crane game.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.040
That was because it always said David Crane's title of the game.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.040
That guy was in this.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.040
All right.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040
Yeah.

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.040
Anyway, good game.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.040
Good game.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.040
Yeah.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.560
Oh, and I didn't mention this, but at the end of the game, once you beat it, you get

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.480
a passcode that you use the same name the next time and you start with as much money

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.560
as you finish the game with at the end.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.000
This allows you to buy the more powerful car and some of the more powerful enhancements

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:04.360
for the vehicle later, so you can, I guess, do speed runs and shit.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360
I don't know.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360
So there it is.

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:07.360
Loki, did you ever play this?

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.000
This seems like the type of thing you would have lost a few hours on.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I'm pretty sure.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I've played it.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.880
I don't remember which version I've played, but I've played it.

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.120
I know I've played it.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.120
Probably the Atari 2600 version looked a lot like this, except the buildings were just

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.120
solid colors.

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.120
Right.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.960
Because you have a green square that would flash red.

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:28.000
I may have played the NES version.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yeah?

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Conglaturation.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Can you prove that?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
All right.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Dungeon Buster says the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is insanely tough to sneak past in that

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
version as well.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Talking about the remake.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Apparently it's hard to find because the main page hosting it was abandoned there.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So very interesting.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Dungeon Buster says you usually had to start with a Volkswagen Bug as your first Ecto.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
That's right.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
That's right.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Or there was that big, the big white car.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Is it a hearse?

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I don't know.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I use that a lot too.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I think so.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Yeah.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So there it is.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Classic Game of the Week.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64 and a host of other platforms as well.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Good times.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Did you like that pick?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I liked that pick.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
It was a good pick.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Solid pick.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
There it is.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Classic Game of the Week.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Dark Soccer will be back next week to pick a new game for you guys.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I'm sure she'll still be on her.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
What's her kick that she's on now?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Capcom arcade games?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Or Sega arcade games?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
One of the two.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I don't remember.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
One of the two.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
But there you go.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I have to break her streak.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
She's never going to pick Commodore 64 games.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Why?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Because she didn't really grow up with it the way I did.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
She's just picking CPS3 games now?

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I think she's on CPS3 games or something.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
But anyway.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
She does pick a lot of obscure stuff though.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I think we complement each other well because she picks games that I've never played.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
And I'm sure she...

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Well, she probably played the Ghostbusters game to be fair.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
That was kind of everywhere.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
It is a popular game.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
She probably did play that one.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
But some of the other ones.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I almost did Last Ninja tonight.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
She probably never played that.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Really?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Yeah.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
If you didn't own a Commodore 64 you didn't really have a way to play it.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
That's true.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Yeah.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I appreciate that you're showing Commodore 64 some love.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I'm trying.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I'm trying.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Here.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Jonas approves Commodore 64 love.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Did you grow up on Commodore 64?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
No.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
You kind of missed that.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I don't think I was born.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
1984 I was like one years old.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Yeah.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You're a little young.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Here's the thing.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I didn't grow up on a Commodore 64.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I had a Commodore 64 when I was like 14.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.760
So it was like in the 90s because we were poor and we're like, hey, let's get the Commodore

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.760
64.

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.000
It's like $20 from our neighbor.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.840
I still think it was an underrated gaming console because you could do a lot of games

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.840
on it.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:37.840
But anyway.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.840
All right.

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.140
We got to take a break guys because we're running long tonight.

01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:43.040
We want to come back and make sure we get your calls on our Skype line at Orange Lawn

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.040
Radio.

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.040
All one word.

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.040
I want to talk about that giveaway.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.900
We're going to be giving away a copy of the Jackbox Party Pack and I'm going to tell you

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.100
how to do that at the start of the next segment and we're going to get into rapid fire news

01:47:52.100 --> 01:48:05.860
and so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:09.500
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:14.100
Live tonight on this Sunday evening, November the 23rd of 2014.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.740
Episode number 576 of our show in progress.

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740
Mark Stocker.

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.920
She is not here tonight.

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.340
She's at a party for her husband who's having a birthday.

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:27.460
But here in studio with me, Tech Master Loki, of course, as well as Princess Irene joining

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:29.780
us for the multi-tap podcast.

01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.940
You missed a fun little part A if you're just joining us.

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:35.500
Irene and I had some real in-depth talk on World of Warcraft.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.820
It'll make you miss this week's Hoard House.

01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:40.980
And then also we talked about Ghostbusters.

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:45.100
We did a little bit.

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.100
What else?

01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:47.100
And the news and all this stuff.

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:53.020
Also in the studio, of course, Jonas from the big anime game room, Teabagger, talking

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:56.860
a little bit about Smash and all the games that came out last week.

01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:00.420
Have you had time to play anything else this week, Jonas, or just Smash?

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:06.020
Nope, unfortunately, because the day before I actually finished all the pump videos.

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.340
Oh, can we finally see your second place pump finish?

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.340
Is that available?

01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.340
Yes, it's available online.

01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:12.340
Oh, I need it.

01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.740
I somehow missed it when it popped through on Facebook.

01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:14.740
I didn't see it.

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:16.340
1080p at 60 frames a second.

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.540
Fucking Facebook not showing me.

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:19.900
You know how Facebook does that?

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.780
It won't show everything that a page posts on your feed.

01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:27.540
Is it too hard to ask for a social network where I control what I see?

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:30.900
Yeah, Facebook's acting a little finicky over those matters.

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.780
Well, God, you should see.

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:36.620
We actually have had a lot of great content on vognetwork.com this week.

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.540
I will admit, we've had a bit of a drought in content, not podcasts, just the written

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.460
content that's on the site because it's an all volunteer group.

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:49.420
Unfortunately, we can't afford to pay people right now, but if you want writing experience

01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:55.340
and want to try to get more exposure and write stuff, please contact me, rob at vognetwork.com.

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:58.020
We're always looking for more writers, not just on game content.

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:01.900
Actually, I'm really looking for people for movies and some other.

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.620
We have TV pretty well covered, but movies, books is another big venture I would love

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.100
to get into.

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.420
What about poetry?

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.460
If it has a geek angle, why not?

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:13.460
No.

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:17.940
So we've had a great amount of content in the past week and so forth at VOG, and I'll

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:21.300
post about it on Facebook and it's like 30 people reached.

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.260
And I'm like, wait a minute, we have way more people in that who like VOG network, but they

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:27.380
don't push it because we don't pay for it.

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:31.060
And because it's a link to our site, they're like, oh, this is spam.

01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.060
This is spam.

01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.060
I'm like, fuck you.

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:34.060
Yeah.

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:38.380
Facebook X is weird on these matters, the reach counts matter.

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.900
Yeah, it's weird.

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:44.680
But anyway, please do check out all the great content this week at vognetwork.com.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.980
We have Eric from the RP Grinders podcast is reviewing games.

01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:54.140
He just did one for Tales of R on the PlayStation Vita.

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:57.940
And then just today we pushed a review, John from Critical Myth reviewed Assassin's Creed

01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:03.100
Rogue, the other Assassin's Creed game that people weren't talking about as much as the

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:04.100
now.

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:05.100
Okay.

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.100
Oh, let's talk about Rogue for a little bit.

01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.700
So John did that as well.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.460
Henry also on the Critical Myth team pushed a review of Interstellar, the movie.

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:17.660
And remember, it's where everybody has a voice and you can relieve a response review.

01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.220
So if you read Henry's Interstellar review and you're like, I disagree, this movie I

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.940
felt so you can leave a response review and it shows right there on the page right next

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:26.940
to Henry's review.

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.300
So very cool.

01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:31.060
So check that out all at vognetwork.com.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:36.780
Before we get into rapid fire news, the folks over at Jackbox Games, very kind to give us

01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:40.780
a code for the Jackbox Party Pack.

01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:46.060
Now I can give you this code either on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:50.460
So whichever platform you're on, we've got a code for you if you are our big winner.

01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.460
So here's how it's going to work.

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.780
We have a little contest now because this is like a $25 game.

01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.580
We are going to make it work a little bit for it.

01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:59.620
This is something a little more than previous.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:05.340
So what we want you to do, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack, and again, thank

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:09.220
you to Jackbox Games for providing the codes, one of the games in the Jackbox Party Pack

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.820
is Drawful.

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:16.220
And in this game, you have to draw what is otherwise like a nonsensical phrase.

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:20.860
And all you really have is your finger and the freaking tablet.

01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:28.300
So we would like you to submit your best drawing for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.260
Whatever it is that you associate Orange Lounge Radio with.

01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:33.180
Maybe you're going to draw a picture of a ferret.

01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:35.820
Maybe you're going to draw a picture of Loki screaming something.

01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:40.700
Maybe you're going to draw, I don't know, but we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:41.700
Radio.

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.340
Oh, but there's a twist.

01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:49.380
Because you can only use your finger and the thing, it has to be ugly on purpose.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:55.860
So we are requesting that you only use MS Paint.

01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:01.700
So you will be deducted points if your drawing is too good.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.580
So we want you to submit those and you can only use MS Paint.

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.260
I'm sure the Mac users are like, what about me?

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:08.500
Whatever the equivalent is on the Mac.

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:12.260
Isn't there like a paint thing built into the Mac?

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:14.020
You know what the equivalent is over there.

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:17.300
You can only use that.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.540
You can use a brush and a text tool maybe.

01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:20.540
I don't know.

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.220
If you use a text tool, you still don't get to use that on the phone.

01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.020
You get to use a brush and one color.

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.020
That's it.

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.900
So we want your best drawful for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:33.500
You're going to send those to participate at orangeloungeradio.com and make sure in

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.900
the subject so we don't miss it, it says Jackbox.

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.860
So something about the Jackbox contest.

01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:42.380
So Jackbox in the title and submit your best drawful.

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.720
Here's the beautiful part.

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:45.260
Dark Sakura is not here tonight.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.060
She has no idea this is happening.

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.900
So when she opens up the mailbag next week, she's going to see these submissions.

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:54.940
So we will ask Dark Sakura to pick her favorite knowing these rules and that will be the

01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:55.940
winner.

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:59.780
And again, please include in the email if you would prefer a copy on PlayStation 4 or

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:00.780
Xbox One.

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:05.340
So we make sure we get you the right code from our friends over at Jackbox Games.

01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:06.820
So to summarize.

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:07.820
What?

01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:08.820
What the hell?

01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:09.820
Sorry.

01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:10.820
I was pulling up his video.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.780
Oh, you're looking at his pump video over there?

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:13.780
All right.

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:16.500
Look, he's looking at something over there.

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.980
So to summarize, you are going to submit your best drawful using a very simple paint program

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.020
that has a brush only.

01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:26.980
You are going to send that to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you're going

01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:29.780
to make sure the subject says Jackbox in it.

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:32.460
Now these are due by the next show.

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:36.220
So we want everybody to be able to participate, both the live listeners and the people on

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.220
the podcast feed.

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:43.420
So these are due by the 30th at we'll say noon Pacific time or three Eastern time that

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.020
gives us a time to go through and make sure we got a winner before the show starts.

01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:49.900
So those are due on the 30th at noon.

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.700
So if you're listening to this after the cause I, I'm still getting contest entries

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:55.620
for something we gave away like two weeks ago.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:00.020
Why did that guy with the really high power, you know, powered camera come up and take

01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:02.220
a picture of your ass with it?

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:03.220
I don't know.

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:08.980
And he's just like kind of shrugs and shows like, okay, I'm doing that.

01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:11.780
I don't know about that part.

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:16.100
You better watch it or I'm going to ask people to submit pictures of Jonas's ass for the

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.100
Jackbox competition.

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.100
Just kidding.

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.100
I'm kidding.

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.300
I wouldn't do that to you, buddy.

01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:21.300
All right.

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.300
So there it is.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.300
Uh, have fun.

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.300
Enter the competition.

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.300
It'll be fun.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.300
All right.

01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:27.300
Good time.

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:28.300
Are you going to submit Irene?

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.300
Yes.

01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.300
You're not eligible.

01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:31.300
All right.

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.300
I'm going to do it anyway.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:33.300
All right.

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.700
Robert M is asking, is there a PS three version of the game?

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:36.820
I'm sorry there.

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:41.700
I believe there is a P does the PS four version work on the PS three.

01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700
Oh shit.

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.780
I'm being put on the spot.

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:51.060
I believe the code he gave me works for both because it's crossed by Loki.

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:54.700
Will you do some research for me real fast and figure out if live radio folks figure

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:57.860
out if the Jackbox party pack is crossed by on PlayStation three and four.

01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:59.460
I think it is.

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.180
And if that's the case, then yes, the code will work on PS three.

01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:10.680
So you didn't mention that also for droffle, you can't erase, maybe that's something that's

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:13.520
going to be a little harder to figure out if somebody did that or not.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.400
So I guess we'll let you slide on that.

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.400
Okay.

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.400
Hmm.

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400
What the draw?

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.240
He said it could be anything related.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.680
Just if, if the clue was orange lounge radio, how would you draw that for somebody else

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.680
to guess?

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:32.400
I hope that someone draws like world of Warcraft stuff because we've been talking about tonight's

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400
world of Warcraft.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.400
Yeah.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.040
Except then I'd be like, what a great picture for hort house.

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.120
It doesn't say, I don't think it is.

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:40.120
It might be, I don't know.

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:45.440
I thought he said something about PlayStation three and four being crossed by, uh, my advice

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.120
to you, if you only are on PlayStation three, enter anyway.

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.120
I will.

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:54.120
And if you can't use the code, I'll do my best to get you a PlayStation three one.

01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:55.600
I bet I can get it.

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.800
So, uh, but I don't believe I can get Xbox three 60.

01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.800
Sorry.

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800
So, uh, yeah.

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.800
Sorry about that.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.100
I should have researched that in advance, but, uh, the code I believe will work on PS

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.640
three or PS four.

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:09.240
So, all right.

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:11.840
That's a really good question.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.360
Oh, you know what?

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.080
Stay tuned to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And as soon as I know the answer, I'll

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.720
send a tweet about that.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:19.720
Okay.

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:25.040
Uh, let's do some rapid fire news and, uh, travel around and check out some quick news.

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.040
What's been going on?

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.040
Loki.

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.760
So now with the Xbox three 60 version now free to play as well.

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.640
Defiance as a whole has finally got a free to play Defiance.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:40.160
If you may not remember was the MMO that they launched was last year, maybe, no, maybe

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.640
even the year before last, um, basically tying in with a scifi TV show by the same name.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.040
I actually played a little bit of it.

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.360
It was kind of, kind of lame, but it was all right.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.360
I don't know.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:56.880
It's worth checking out, I guess, but now that it's free, might as well check it out.

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:02.720
Um, I guess if you did happen to buy the game, you do get some additional goodies, including,

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:10.080
uh, they say a 30 day patron pass for, um, character slots and a thousand arc forge,

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.160
which since it's been so long since I played that, I don't remember what the hell any of

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:15.160
that means.

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:20.520
Um, and I guess it's all the content of through the aftermath of season two.

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.840
So it'd be worth to check out on me if it's free.

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:24.840
So why not?

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:30.480
Um, no, this is kind of funny coming out with a Kiva's trip later this week.

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.520
If you happen to stream the PlayStation four version, there's going to be some integration

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.920
with Twitch, some funny integration with Twitch.

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:42.680
They have chat commands that you can type in and things will happen.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:49.120
For example, if you type in tourists or Gaijin, you'll summon, um, some tourists into the

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.120
game.

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:55.360
If you type in Gothic Lolita, you'll get a Gothic Lolita or, um, there's sounds like

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.880
scribble knots all of a sudden.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:57.880
Yeah.

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.880
Like if you type in anti, yes, someone's anti will show up.

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:04.920
They're also saying that like, um, I guess you can do like panty jump and they'll blow

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.000
all the panties and stuff in the air.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.080
Crazy stuff.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:12.160
So I don't know, that's kind of, that sounds funny.

01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.360
So um, yeah, that game's coming out of this week on PlayStation four.

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.720
So that's interesting to you.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:27.080
And then, um, I guess, um, more amiibos, of course, right around the corner and more exclusive

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.140
amiibos to different locations.

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.240
So if you want to collect them all, you're going to have to go to a few different locations

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.340
and pick them up.

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:39.420
For example, um, they're saying that Meta Knight is going to be exclusively at Best

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:40.420
Buy.

01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:48.100
Lucaro is going to be, um, in Toys R Us and Shulk of course going to GameStop.

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.220
So that's kind of lame.

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:52.420
Um, I don't know.

01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:56.780
I don't like that whole idea, you know, with having the travel on.

01:59:56.820 --> 02:00:02.980
I don't like the whole exclusivity thing, but at least they spread it around so that

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.140
not one store had one.

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:09.540
It could be timed exclusives because there was that issue with, I know Disney infinity

02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:14.140
had like, you know, uh, Jack Skellington knows that GameStop for like four weeks or something

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:15.660
before it came out everywhere else.

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:16.940
So I don't know.

02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:20.660
Um, the other thing I read was apparently the next batch of amiibos is supposed to launch

02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.600
on the 14th of December.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:27.240
So all those like, uh, Mega Man and that kind of stuff is supposed to be December.

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.240
All right.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:34.000
Uh, just to follow up in our chat, they are saying, um, that the cross by, uh, does not

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.880
work on Jackbox party packet is not crossed by between PlayStation three and PlayStation

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.880
four.

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.560
I'm still pretty confident that I can get you a PlayStation three code if that's the

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.560
only thing you have.

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.560
So you know what?

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:44.640
I'm just gonna throw it out there.

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.040
I go enter.

02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:50.840
And if you want it on PlayStation three, even if I can't get a code, I'll put my mind, I'll

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:51.840
buy it.

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.900
If you, if you win in your PlayStation three only, I'll buy it.

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:59.720
So I want everybody that, that has one of the systems to be able to participate.

02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:02.300
So there you go, all those systems.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:05.160
So be sure to specify in your entry.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:06.800
All right.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.880
Um, let's move on, uh, with some other rapid fire news here.

02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:16.660
Uh, Mario Kart eight, some minor tweaks going in, uh, with, you know, a lot of people talking

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:21.800
about the DLC, but some of the lightweight racers like toad and shy guy actually

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.480
had a little bit of a tweak.

02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:29.380
Uh, some balancing came to the 3.0 version update to lessen the collision impact with

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:34.640
heavier racers, because I guess when you would slam into a big fatty like Bowser or Donkey

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.520
Kong or what have you, your character would go flying.

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.940
Um, so if this didn't, is something you didn't really care for, try it again, since they

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:46.760
did the update, uh, a quote from the Mario Kart eight director for this update, we made

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:50.320
just a minor tweak to the way two players deflect when they collide with each other

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.760
up until now, when two players collided, the more lightweight racers would get knocked

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.100
too far away.

02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:58.980
That combined with other overall elements we considered made us conclude that the lighter

02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:01.200
racers were at a bit of a disadvantage.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.240
If you like toad or shy guy and feel you can't win at all, go ahead and give them another

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.280
try after applying the update.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.400
Also note that this tweak doesn't have any effect on time trials when playing solo.

02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.400
All right.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:23.200
Uh, let's see, Microsoft has, uh, celebrated one year of Xbox one by sending out prizes.

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:24.200
That's right.

02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:29.080
Uh, they have sent out prizes, quote, selected at random to receive a special gift from us.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:33.120
These various console owners, uh, some of the things you can win, uh, you can actually

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.440
win console bundles for call of duty, advanced warfare and sunset overdrive.

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.920
Guessing not too many people got those.

02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:44.120
Uh, you can also get a one year subscription to Xbox live gold, uh, free copies of limbo

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.040
apparently are one as well, or, uh, from our call with Bobby Blackwell for, I heard it

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:54.040
on his show earlier tonight, you might get money for grand theft auto on the Xbox one.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.440
So, uh, there's a variety of different things you can get in there.

02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:00.640
I saw, yeah, I read some of the people, a lot of people got just like a free digital

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.680
poster, which is like worth nothing.

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.680
Yeah.

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.680
Or a gamer.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:06.400
Thanks for nothing.

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.400
Microsoft.

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.400
Yeah.

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.480
It's almost as good as like when they gave you was a 25 cents worth of Microsoft points

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.480
for your birthday.

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:18.680
It's like, ah, fuck you.

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:23.840
Well now something to point out here is that, uh, if you are 17 or older, you've used your

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.000
console for more than 10 hours.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.320
You're in one of the original markets for Xbox one and you made your purchase, uh, before

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.480
November 11th of this year, you're going to get the year one celebration box, which gives

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:41.120
you a special gamer pick and desktop background and free rentals of halo four forward until

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.680
Dawn and Dragon Ball Z battle of the gods.

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.480
Uh, you also get a sampler pack of Dragon Ball Z episodes.

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.720
So no word if you know, there's over 9,000 episodes given away or, or whatever.

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:54.720
All right.

02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:55.720
I had to work in a joke.

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:56.720
All right.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:02.300
Um, also free on the Xbox Atari game over that documentary we've talked about way too

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.300
much on this show.

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.300
Uh, the hour long feature is now available for viewing and it talks about the video game

02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:08.620
crash of 1983.

02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:14.860
Uh, and, uh, of course, Atari throwing away all of the et video game copies, which somebody

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:18.060
thought it would be fun to dig them up and sell them on eBay to people who like to buy

02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.300
other people's garbage.

02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.220
Uh, there you go.

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.940
So now that documentary is available for viewing.

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:24.060
I haven't watched it yet.

02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.460
I think I need to, I'd like to check that out.

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:28.460
I was old enough to remember.

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:33.020
I mean, not to be like old grandpa, but I am old enough to kind of remember when the

02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:39.140
shit hit the fan with the, uh, Atari's and they just, you've had just bins of games

02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.500
that they couldn't give away.

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:41.500
It was crazy.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:42.500
Yeah.

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.780
I remember those big bins of games going into the game stores and seeing that stuff.

02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.780
Yeah.

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.780
Right.

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:50.980
Speaking of Atari, cause they remind me of the flashback stuff.

02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:54.340
The clique of vision flashback is not in stores around here and online.

02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:56.380
They're trying to sell it for like twice the retail.

02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:58.820
So what the fuck is up with that?

02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:02.180
Oh no.

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.360
Let's go to our foogle question of the week.

02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:08.620
Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and Google plus communities.

02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:22.580
You throw those words together, you get foogle Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:29.020
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio is where you can find us.

02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:33.020
And we're going to get to the question that we asked our communities, which was, we asked

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:35.340
a very simple question in the communities this week.

02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:37.780
We just wanted to know how was your gaming week?

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:41.540
You know, we always ask ourselves that at the top of each show to establish a frame

02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:45.460
of reference and what types of games we've been into and you know what we kind of talk

02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:46.460
about for the week.

02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:50.580
Uh, but the reason why we asked it this week is because with so much that has come out

02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:54.100
in the game stores this week, we know there's a lot to pick from.

02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:58.700
So we want to know what is it that you've been playing or maybe you really just, you

02:05:58.700 --> 02:05:59.700
know, life happens.

02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:01.420
You can't afford to get anything right now.

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:05.500
So what plastics are you revisiting or, or what games do maybe the rest of us forget

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:06.500
about?

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.500
We ought to be going back and playing this week.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.800
So checking out some of the answers on Google plus, I'm going to have to abbreviate a lot

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:12.800
of these.

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:13.800
I'm sorry.

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.320
We're just running way over tonight and I want to make sure we ended at least an hour.

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:17.320
So bros.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:21.780
Amay says, uh, freedom wars, super smash for evil within and Lords of the fallen.

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:26.500
Uh, the first two are amazing and the latter are buggy on PC.

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.340
Uh, let's see.

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:34.860
Redder tainment replied and said, um, WWE two K 15 came out and there are complaints

02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:35.860
about it.

02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:40.580
Uh, the week I started playing or this week I started playing WWE two K 15.

02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:44.300
Some features are missing, but as far as major complaints, I only have one.

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:47.980
When I preordered the game, I was promised that I would get the wrestler sting as a download

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:48.980
character.

02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:53.100
And then I picked up the code at, uh, I was given a code on my receipt from GameStop to

02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:57.500
download the DLC, but it isn't good until December 16th.

02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:01.740
Uh, he tried to redeem the code and it didn't work.

02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.620
He tried to call Microsoft support and that's when he finally found out that's why it wouldn't

02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:06.620
work.

02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:10.420
So, uh, maybe a little more communication, maybe on the box or on the receipt or from

02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:12.380
GameStop would be helpful.

02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:14.620
I have heard that that game is a little bit buggy.

02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:18.340
I'm not super into the wrestling games myself, but, uh, I've heard some things about them

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:19.340
being buggy.

02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:26.540
Uh, Prince Peach Fuzz, I like that name, Prince Peach Fuzz replied and said, uh, I have dusted

02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:31.100
off my Vita and I've been playing SteamWorld dig and hotline Miami been loving both games

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:32.100
so far.

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:33.100
That's right.

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:34.280
Both of those were free on PlayStation plus as well.

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:35.740
So a free is always a good way.

02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:39.980
I mean, well, I guess you're paying for PlayStation plus, so it's not that free, but freeze a

02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:44.680
good way to check out some of those classics, uh, act depth says I'm playing some animal

02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:47.620
cross new leaf for the first time in months.

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.140
My village is still intact.

02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:55.460
I also played Spelunky and team fortress two and smash brothers for Wii U most of the weekend.

02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:59.700
Those are some answers from Google plus let's go over to Facebook where there's a ton of

02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:00.700
answers.

02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:02.020
I'm gonna have to really kind of run through this.

02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:07.940
Um, of course I closed the tab on accident, so I'm bringing it up again right now.

02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:08.940
Way to go, Rob.

02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:13.020
Way to go me.

02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:15.340
Maybe I'll get it someday here.

02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.220
This is because I complained about Facebook earlier.

02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:18.220
I'm now being punished.

02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:23.680
Oh, Hey, dark Tetsuya responded and said Mario Kart eight, Mario 64 and stuff on connect

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.260
like rhythm party.

02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:26.260
It needs more songs.

02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:27.260
Uh, Kane.

02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:30.940
I am says final fantasy 14 has eaten my soul.

02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:32.780
Yeah, mine too.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:38.660
Uh, Andy R says little big planet three story just finished, uh, outside of that Vita love

02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:42.980
freedom Wars, Hatsune Miku project diva F second, which I can't believe that's the first

02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:45.620
time that's come up tonight, but that was another big release.

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:50.220
Uh, tales of hearts are, and Andy R says tales of hearts are as awesome.

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.220
I highly recommend it.

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.940
You should go leave a response review on eric's review at vog network.com.

02:08:54.940 --> 02:09:00.980
Uh, silent Tom says super smash brothers and Mario Kart eight rocking my link amiibo.

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:06.180
See Al says border lands, the pre-sequel final fantasy tactics, advanced Minecraft star bound

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:12.540
and Pokemon Omega Ruby, which again, another huge game that came out this week that none

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:14.140
of us have gotten around to playing yet.

02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.620
But uh, I'm sure at some point Shane will invade the show and tell us all about what

02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:22.100
we're missing with Pokemon because I know he wasn't into it at first.

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:25.980
And then he said, Oh, but they do this thing in the grass and it's so cool now.

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:28.020
And I completely changed my mind.

02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:33.300
Um, a surfing Slurpee said I've been binge playing halo master chief collection, halo

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:38.300
CE through halo four, uh, logged into legal legends to check out the new champion Kalista

02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:42.220
and started a free trial wow account to check out the new character models.

02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:46.220
They're nice, but not enough to break my one year long wow sobriety Lords of the fallen

02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:47.220
dragon agent.

02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:50.300
Grand Theft Auto five are unopened and gathering dust.

02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.300
You hear that?

02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:55.260
Or is it being Slurpee has a copy of grand theft auto five gathering dust Loki.

02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:01.620
He's just shaking his head, shaking his head, a low cat frog responds and says, did my yearly

02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:05.500
tradition of the most current assassin's creed and playing through grand theft auto five

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.500
on Xbox one.

02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:07.500
Well, there you go.

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.060
The next answer redeemed it a little bit there.

02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:13.620
Fred the Hayes saying, enjoying old DS games on my brand new $60 3DS XL that was price

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:18.580
matched to Walmart freedom Wars on Vita and got some old Skylanders for cheap on PS three

02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:24.200
and 3DS Elliott B says, I haven't bought new games in ages, but I spent a jet lag recovery

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:26.820
day getting reacquainted with rock band.

02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:30.020
Uh, it's still so good.

02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:34.780
One of my favorite names, William murder face said, I'm getting into dragon age origins,

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:36.060
not inquisition origins.

02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:39.420
And I'm playing payday two and Guild Wars two for the umpteenth time.

02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:43.060
Winston H says, bust a move one and two.

02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:47.960
Uh, once my finals are over, I'll go back to persona for arena Ultimax.

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:51.260
That was a game we used to play the crap out of all the time was buzz to move.

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.260
Yes.

02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:53.260
Oh my God.

02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:54.260
So they're busted groove or whatever.

02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.260
I wasn't saying I wasn't.

02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:56.260
Yeah.

02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:57.260
Yeah.

02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:58.260
Must've groove.

02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.260
Same thing.

02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:00.260
Cause it was bust to move in Japan.

02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:04.740
And in here somehow bust to move was pub puzzle bobble somehow, which had the most interesting

02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:08.140
PlayStation two box art I've ever seen in my life.

02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:12.780
I don't recall it, but, uh, get him to Google it or use your tablet.

02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:13.780
Look it up.

02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:14.780
Bust a move on PlayStation two.

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:15.780
It's like what?

02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:22.860
Uh, our pal Tiara responds and says so much dragon age inquisition so much tiara.

02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:24.540
You need to leave the hinterlands.

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:28.480
You need to stop and then you need to leave the hinterlands.

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.480
Get out of there.

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:32.820
Uh, I'm thinking about picking up that game.

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:33.820
Yeah.

02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:40.300
Break code man says dragon age, dragon age, and oh yeah, transistor, uh, Haseo Sumeru

02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:45.220
Gawa says, uh, bought a DS to catch up on the games I miss so much right now.

02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:51.140
Uh, FONF has he 12 revenant wings and Pokemon black for the Vita I'm cracking out on borderlands

02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:52.180
too.

02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:57.300
We played super smash brothers brawl and finally the PlayStation three far cry four, which

02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.300
is amazing.

02:11:58.300 --> 02:11:59.580
Not going to lie.

02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:05.100
Fifth dream says so much dragon age inquisition and tales of hearts are, I've also been playing

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:08.180
a lot of Pokemon alpha Sapphire and a little project diva F second.

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:11.700
I have a bunch of games from the last month I've put on hold this week with more games

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.140
coming on Tuesday.

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:19.700
Critical myths says mostly assassin's creed rogue and final fantasy 10 HD remaster.

02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:25.120
And last but not least, Veronica Isabel saying Tomodachi life and solitaire by mobility wears

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.780
daily challenges.

02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:31.060
I keep putting off downloading star Trek online and beating Pokemon X.

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.060
There you go.

02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:34.540
Those are the answers there to our foogle question of the week.

02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:36.380
I'm really surprised in there.

02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:37.380
How much of that content?

02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:42.260
I know there was a lot that I read, but I'm really surprised how much of that was not

02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:44.200
stuff that came out this week.

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:48.860
In fact, there seemed to be like two or three people that were like, I just got a DS and

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:51.260
so now I'm catching up on all this stuff.

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:54.520
So Irene, you know, you kind of mentioned earlier in the show, that's where you're at

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.280
right now is, is playing a lot of DS stuff.

02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:57.640
So you are not alone.

02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:02.000
It's my people, the poor people of the world.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.160
Well, you need to talk to the guy who got a $60 price match DS.

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.160
That's right.

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.160
Yeah.

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:09.160
Right.

02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:10.160
Lucky.

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:11.400
Well, what about those people that were, you know, I don't think we're talking about, but

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.000
the people that were exploiting the price matching?

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.840
Well, that's exploit essentially that's stealing.

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:19.880
I mean, you can, you can call it whatever you want.

02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.880
That's stealing.

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.520
I'm assuming the $60 price match thing was legit.

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:27.680
They did have though one time it was a, it was a glitch on the website where they actually

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.960
had like, you know, we use and places you force down the Sears.

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.960
Yeah.

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:38.200
Sears had the down really cheap and so people were price matching off the website glitch.

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:42.040
So from what I understand, that was actually, I think a former employee issue.

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:43.040
No, no.

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.040
I was like, Oh boy.

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:48.360
Uh, well then that's, that's yeah, let's go.

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.160
But anyway, yeah, let's just leave it at that.

02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.760
All right, let's move on.

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:55.600
We got some more news to get into and we want to make sure we have some time to get into

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:56.600
your calls.

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:57.600
We've got the email bag too.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.040
So we're going to try to jam through these stories.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.040
Loki.

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:06.240
So you may remember that Activision, Vivendi were together at one point and now, you know,

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:08.640
there was a whole buyout thing.

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:18.600
Um, basically some lawsuit that's now resulting in a Vivendi paying, um, 275 million to Activision

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.000
to settle the litigation.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.160
And I guess this happened, was it starting last year?

02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:28.520
I sort of remember part of it, but I don't remember exactly the details of why one was

02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.520
suing the other.

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.520
Um, I'm assuming over probably payments or something like that.

02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.040
Um, but yeah, well I guess at least that's settled.

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.200
Um, I don't know.

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.160
Oh, here we go.

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:47.480
Uh, the lawsuit alleged, I guess, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.720
and unjust enrichment.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:54.120
I have no fucking clue what any of that means.

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:59.520
Bad business stuff that CEOs and corrupt people participate in.

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.520
I don't know.

02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:01.520
It's almost.

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.520
All right.

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:08.240
Uh, if you've downloaded anything on the iTunes store lately for your iOS platform,

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:14.720
such as the iPhone or the iPad, you may have noticed that the term free has changed to

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.720
get.

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.920
Uh, this is because, uh, there's been pressure from the European commission that a lot of

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:24.440
these free games are not really free, uh, because they have in app purchases.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:30.600
So for example, the newly released candy crush soda saga, I can't say it without verping

02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:31.600
a little bit.

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:32.600
I'm sorry.

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.120
I shouldn't judge a game I haven't played, but I'm going to judge this game a little

02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.120
bit.

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:37.120
I'm sorry.

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.120
Uh, you can now see that on the store.

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:43.960
It says get because you know, to buy your snozzberries or whatever it is that will do

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:46.760
the magic on the board to buy your Bert machines.

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.760
I don't know.

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.880
What do you, what do you buy in candy crush soda saga, bunch of bullshit, an Alka Seltzer.

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:53.880
I don't know.

02:15:53.880 --> 02:16:00.100
Uh, you're, it's not really going to be free because those are all microtransactions, right?

02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:01.100
So there you go.

02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:06.600
Uh, which, you know, somebody's got to put out a game named shine so I can go shine.

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:11.440
Get, that's the second time I've made a Mario sunshine joke tonight.

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.800
I think you've hit your, your, as we're done for the year, no more Mario sunshine jokes

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:16.800
for the whole year.

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.800
We're done.

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:18.800
Right.

02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:19.800
All right.

02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:20.800
Loki.

02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:25.520
I don't know how to follow that, but I'm going to, let's talk about steam sale.

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.520
Yes.

02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:32.440
Your wallets are already shivering in fear, but apparently the steam sale will commence

02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:37.360
the day before Thanksgiving and it'll run up through December 1st.

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:44.200
Um, apparently they're saying an email was sent out by PayPal encouraging people to stock

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.880
up on steam wallet codes.

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:50.240
Um, Hmm.

02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:55.840
No confirmation yet from valve, but I, that sounds like it could make sense.

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.280
Um, I know they normally do a sale.

02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:03.520
I'm not sure it's necessarily the fall sale right at black Friday, but usually around

02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:05.280
that early December time.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:09.880
So I guess we'll just have to look out for all the sale.

02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:11.880
This is also the precursor to the winter sale.

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:12.880
Really?

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:15.360
I mean, this is, this is just like wetting your whistle a little bit for games.

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:18.240
It'll be even more deeply discounted during the winter.

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.760
So when's the winter sale usually is that in like next year?

02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:22.760
Yes.

02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:23.760
Well, yeah.

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.960
I mean, it's usually about, um, I want to say it starts around the 27th to 28th, like

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:34.160
it's after Christmas and then runs through like the new year's, but I could be wrong.

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.260
Somebody like rage nator or somebody who's a little more tuned into steam might know

02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:40.120
a little more about when those sales start.

02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.480
But then the other exciting thing is that, you know, uh, there's more stores out there

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:47.880
than just steam and all those stores will start having huge sales as well to kind of

02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:48.880
compete with that.

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:52.240
In fact, a good old games just finished a big sale that they were having.

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.440
So I used to get a lot of stuff on the Amazon digital store because they would have steam

02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.440
codes.

02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:01.200
So just say I keep an eye out for that stuff or if you don't want to worry about aggregating

02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:06.360
that stuff yourself, cheap ass gamer, you know, uh, let's see.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:08.680
Kaijuto says, I think I'm burned out on steam sales.

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:09.680
They don't have much of anything anymore.

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.800
I don't want to bother with any more early access games, uh, as I agree, there is a lot

02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.300
of that going on where there's a lot more of that coming onto the store where it's like

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:19.920
by my half finished game.

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.400
And I mean, it really depends on the developer and on the game if I'm going to buy into something

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:25.400
like that or not.

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:33.040
Uh, let's see, SSG100 Matt says week before Christmas, uh, I think an active says around

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:34.320
Christmas and ends after new year's.

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.160
I don't know why I thought it started after Christmas and it could be wrong.

02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:40.400
All I know is that my wallet can't take it this year.

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:41.400
All right.

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.040
Uh, there is a new MMO coming to PlayStation four, uh, but this one's going to be a little

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.040
different.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.800
It's a game called wander.

02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:53.320
And uh, in a note to the PlayStation blog this week that was written, uh, they talked

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.800
about this game and how it is a non combat MMO.

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.880
You explore an environment in several different forms, a giant tree, a soaring Griffin, a

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.780
sea creature and more.

02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.640
So this is a game about exploration, but you don't fight.

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:14.280
Uh, you can, uh, you find clues by examining your surroundings and you might find other

02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.760
people who help you and share information.

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.520
And uh, you may hear like opera singers and that leads you to something else.

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.320
I there's a, in some way this kind of sounds like what, what if they made like an MMO

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:27.320
out of journey?

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.320
That's almost what this sounds like.

02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.040
It sounds really fascinating though.

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.280
Like I like this idea of like, this is a game about exploration and that's it.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.900
I kind of, I'm like that one indie game.

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:37.900
I don't remember.

02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:39.440
I'm trying to remember what game it was now.

02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:40.440
I have it.

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:44.040
I'm just, ah, the hell's it called?

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:51.560
Um, it was very like low, like pixely and just kind of wandered around and stuff happened.

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.960
So missed, yeah, missed on was, uh, reminds me of this a little bit cause I don't remember

02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:58.220
there really being comment missed on proteus.

02:19:58.220 --> 02:19:59.560
It reminds me of proteus.

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:00.560
That's the game.

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:05.440
Well, anyway, wander will be playable at the PlayStation experience in Las Vegas.

02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:09.840
So I'm sure we'll be hearing more, uh, out of this is our Vegas guy vid powers.

02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:11.560
He going to the PlayStation thing too.

02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.560
I bet.

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.560
All right.

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.640
Uh, let's go to the mailbag.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:20.900
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com and a dark soccer dives

02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:23.500
into the mailbag and find some emails to read.

02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:24.980
But Oh, she's not here.

02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:30.340
So I guess I'll put on her gloves and dive in the mailbag.

02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:39.180
Again, that's participate at orange lounge, radio.com if you want to send us emails.

02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.140
And I was very bad and not logged in already.

02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.340
So I'm logging in right now.

02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:43.340
Sorry guys.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:45.220
I remember there being, Oh my God.

02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:48.500
It just, Oh, I was like the mailbox exploded.

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:51.700
Oh, cause we're already getting entries for the jack box contest.

02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:52.700
Hooray.

02:20:52.700 --> 02:20:53.700
Uh, let's see.

02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:56.580
Would it be wrong to peek at some of them?

02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:57.580
No, I'm not going to pee.

02:20:57.580 --> 02:20:58.580
Okay.

02:20:58.580 --> 02:20:59.580
Maybe I'll peek at one.

02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:00.580
All right.

02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:02.380
The surfing Slurpee says, hi, Rob, Jamie and Loki.

02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:08.140
I was wondering if you guys do anything special when picking up a hotly anticipated game on

02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:11.900
release day, I skipped the gym Tuesday is leg day.

02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:15.740
Anyway, get a six pack of Dortmunder gold.

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:18.220
I don't know that, but it sounds like alcohol.

02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:25.900
Uh, go to Penn station subs for an eight inch Italian Giggity with large fries.

02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:26.900
I see what you did.

02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:33.380
It took me a minute and he's Italian with large fries and a sweet tea game pig out and

02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:34.380
regret it later.

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:35.380
There's some Ursa B Slurpee.

02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:38.100
Do you have any rituals for new game releases?

02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:39.100
That's a good question.

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:43.540
I have to, I honestly, I don't, I love your idea that you pick up a sandwich and go to

02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:44.540
town.

02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:45.540
That sounds really good.

02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:47.740
Considering how terrible my family does.

02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:48.740
You're making us hungry.

02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:52.580
Um, no, but I, I really don't have a ritual.

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.500
I don't really go to midnight releases anymore.

02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:57.340
I would say my ritual is sitting by the door.

02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.340
Is ups here yet?

02:21:58.340 --> 02:21:59.340
Is ups here yet?

02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:00.340
Cause I kind of buy my game.

02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:01.340
Seriously.

02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.340
Fuck the midnight releases.

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:03.340
Okay.

02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:07.780
Now I'm not sure if this was a special exception with, um, grand theft auto, but that shit

02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:10.580
fucking unlocked at 9 PM the day before.

02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:11.580
Yeah.

02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.980
But then you have to buy digital.

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:13.980
Who gives a shit?

02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:16.420
I was going to pay $60 anyways.

02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:22.780
Oh, I'm going to sell grand theft auto one of the greatest games to ever grace the consoles.

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:25.940
Or you convince someone to go to the midnight releases for you.

02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:27.220
And that's what I did with dragon age inquisition.

02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:29.300
I was like, Shane, you're going to get the game.

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:33.340
Or it's like a game like call of duty where they give you a copy on PS3 and PlayStation

02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:35.220
four for the same price.

02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:38.500
Actually interesting enough, since I brought that up, the dragon age inquisition thing,

02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:40.900
they GameStop started selling it at nine o'clock here.

02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:42.460
Um, they didn't do a midnight sale.

02:22:42.460 --> 02:22:46.020
They did a nine o'clock sale, uh, and I think it's because of digital.

02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:49.380
I think GameStop has finally started saying, look, if you guys release it digitally at

02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:52.180
nine o'clock, we're going to start selling it because they make their own fucking rules.

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:54.940
They, you know, basically, Oh, the street date is this.

02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:55.940
Yeah.

02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:56.940
Well, fuck you.

02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:57.940
We're going to do what we want.

02:22:57.940 --> 02:22:58.940
What are you going to do?

02:22:58.940 --> 02:22:59.940
Not sell at GameStop.

02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:00.940
Yeah.

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:01.940
Right.

02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:02.940
I'm kind of not surprised that they're playing hard ball like that actually.

02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:03.940
So sorry.

02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:04.940
I didn't mean to derail a little bit.

02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:08.620
There has to be certainly your question, but, um, just glad to not have to deal with that

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:09.620
drama anymore.

02:23:09.620 --> 02:23:12.780
I just, I just tried to make the time.

02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:14.620
I don't for MMOs.

02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:20.900
I've taken the day off of work talking about productive life playing with MMOs.

02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:24.100
I've taken days off work to play that, but I've done that too.

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:29.140
I remember when Final Fantasy 11 first came out, I had like two days off work when that

02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:30.740
it came out so I could play Final Fantasy 11.

02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:31.740
Love.

02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:32.740
It was amazing.

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:33.740
It was amazing.

02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:34.740
Those is good.

02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:35.740
Good times.

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.740
When the fuck is that going to free play?

02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:39.060
You know, way after Final Fantasy 11.

02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:41.460
Come on, come on.

02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:42.460
Come on.

02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:43.460
All right.

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:44.460
Let's see.

02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:48.720
Uh, Raging Nader has emailed us saying, Hey, peeps, it's your favorite person in the world.

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:49.720
Raging Nader.

02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:51.780
I just thought I'd pose some questions this week.

02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:52.780
Actually.

02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.780
I want to go back to the chat real quick.

02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:56.940
Cause I want to see if anybody else said what they're what they do.

02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:59.660
Cause I liked the question about the rituals.

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:00.660
Let's see.

02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:02.440
Uh, Borat says, I want a big greasy hamburger.

02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:05.060
I'm jealous of California for in and out burger.

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:08.020
Um, to be honest, you should be really fries.

02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:09.020
Well done.

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:10.020
Marvelous.

02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:11.020
Anyway.

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:15.580
Uh, but we don't have Dunkin Donuts and I love the coffee.

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.200
So there is a trade off there.

02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.860
Now I would, I would give up Dunkin Donuts coffee to keep in an upper, but I'm just saying

02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:22.860
there is a trade off.

02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:23.860
Anyway.

02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:27.620
Um, Kai's judo saying pre-order killed the midnight release as a Joe and under Matt saying

02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:30.420
console midnight releases could be fun with friends again.

02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:34.980
Uh, last time I did a console midnight release, uh, extra for waiting in line for me, it was

02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:35.980
awesome.

02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:40.140
I think we should do one Rob for a game that's not hotly anticipated.

02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:42.340
Well, I guess they don't really do that.

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.980
Do they do midnight releases for popular games?

02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:50.700
Well, you can go and then show up and be like, well, I'm here to get, you know, Barbie fun

02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:53.460
pack, you know, hello kitty Island adventure or whatever.

02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:54.460
Right.

02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:55.460
All right.

02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:56.460
Sorry.

02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:57.460
We don't have that delivered yet.

02:24:57.460 --> 02:24:58.460
Back to regionators email.

02:24:58.460 --> 02:24:59.460
Sorry.

02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:00.460
I just thought I'd post some questions this week.

02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:01.460
Yes.

02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:02.460
I'd mentioned on Bobby's show tonight.

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.460
Steam is an upcoming sale this week.

02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:06.260
Is there any games that you folks are looking to pick up during the sale?

02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:07.660
God, I don't know.

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:11.780
See, here's the thing is I can't buy any modern games anymore cause my laptop cannot run that

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:12.780
shit.

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:16.940
I mean it barely, it was, it was Titanfall melted my last laptop.

02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:23.880
So this one, you know, it runs Titanfall sort of, I mean it, I can't really pick up anything

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:28.380
that's non indie and even some of those indie games I can't, and there's really not anything

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:30.960
out there that's like, shit, I don't have this yet.

02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.860
I can't really remember off the top of my head, but I know I have a wishlist on steam

02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:38.280
and I'm sure if something on there gets low enough, I'll buy it.

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.960
Sometimes I have a tendency to buy like indie games that just look cool, especially if they

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:43.960
get really cheap.

02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.320
Like they're just like between like under five bucks because you know, I have money

02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:51.080
in my steam wallet, so if something gets cheap enough, I might just be like, eh, why not?

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.120
Let's buy it.

02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:54.040
Super hexagon for 39 cents.

02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:55.040
What the fuck?

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.040
Why not?

02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:57.040
Of course.

02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.040
Let's see.

02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.640
Uh, on a semi related note, I imagine that you all have a fairly decent sized gaming

02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:04.920
pile of shame in regards to unplayed steam games.

02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:09.920
If you were to make a rough guesstimate, how many games or what percentage of your games

02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:18.720
remain unplayed for me of my 457 steam games, roughly 43% of my games remain untouched.

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.000
Oh, this is, this is a dick question.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.500
This is, this is shame.

02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.460
This is shame right here.

02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:26.460
What is it?

02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:31.020
What percentage of your library, it's loading, it's, it's taking its sweet time loading.

02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:32.020
All right.

02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.020
Rob's is 100%.

02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:39.860
No, I, I, in all, I'm going to be honest, I'm going to guess it's like 60.

02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:40.940
Only 60?

02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:41.940
Only 60.

02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:42.940
Are you lying to me?

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:48.380
Uh, if you combine Alan and I's library, it's probably more like 80, but it's, I would say,

02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:49.380
I would say 60.

02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:54.020
Does it count just if you play it for like an hour or two and then set it aside?

02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:55.660
I mean, what are we talking about?

02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:59.820
I think that counts, but like if I loaded it to see the title screen and that's it,

02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:00.820
then it doesn't count.

02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:01.820
Okay.

02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:07.440
But the reason why is, is humble bundles and bundled games and things like I bought an

02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:10.740
X com bundle and I played maybe one game in the bundle.

02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.640
So I mean, keep in mind, there's things like that.

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.740
Like it's not like I buy all these games just to never play them.

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:16.900
I get a lot of games.

02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:22.720
I just wasn't really looking for, and I just remember just saw an update and I just remembered

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:26.840
something that, um, a new story I'm going to talk about later, but that's fine.

02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:33.080
But no, to go back to what I have, 301 games, I guarantee I've probably played about 3%

02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:40.540
of those if, if, if, if not less than that, I think I literally, I don't even remember

02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:43.760
how many games I played, but I've played like less than 5%.

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:48.120
Your answer to Ray's question is 97% of your library is unplayed.

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.200
That's probably, that's probably a very conservative estimate that I, I betting it's a lot higher

02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.840
than that, that I have not played that I would have to go and look at all my, I'm sure they've

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:01.840
got some sort of record somewhere of what you've actually played.

02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.840
All right.

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:05.560
Lastly, enrage nators email finally on an unrelated note.

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:09.040
Is there any chance that we can get another Rob diva fit?

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.220
It's been a few years since the infamous one and in my humble opinion, we're kind of overdue

02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:15.080
for one.

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.440
No.

02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.480
You cannot have another diva fit.

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.480
I don't get paid enough on this show to have a diva fit on demand.

02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:23.480
I'm not your fucking switch.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:26.080
That's the best I could do.

02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:27.080
All right.

02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.080
Uh, let's see.

02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:34.640
Uh, we have a few emails here from Robert M and I think one of them was a follow up.

02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:35.640
Oh yes.

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.720
Uh, let me get to this main email here that he had sent.

02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:45.360
Not to be quote that guy, but I believe battle toads was a joint project between rare and

02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:46.600
trade west.

02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:51.440
The latter of whom was owned after bankruptcy, at least in name by midway according to my

02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:52.880
limited research.

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.680
Who knows if a new game would require Warner brothers involvement?

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.680
That's a very good question.

02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.400
I'm straight and you're not being that guy.

02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.840
I'm, I'm okay with being wrong.

02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.480
You guys like nobody out there knows every single trade was because they remember they

02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:09.480
had the didn't.

02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:10.480
Yeah.

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:11.480
There's battle toads versus double dragon.

02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:12.480
Dragon.

02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:13.480
Yeah.

02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:14.480
Yeah.

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:17.720
It was just, I don't claim to know every single nook and cranny about gaming.

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.800
Um, probably captain spike a game, but we probably does know everything about gaming

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:22.800
on it.

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:24.080
He's probably the closest person I've met.

02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:28.680
Um, but yeah, I mean like that's why I love doing live radio because you guys kind of

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.660
give that instant feedback and you know, if you're not listening live, you can email us.

02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:37.160
So don't be afraid to email us and say, Hey, you got something wrong on the show.

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:40.000
As long as you know, there's the presentation is everything.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.560
Cause if you email us going, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'll just be like, Oh, the delete

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:44.560
key.

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.560
How'd that get hit?

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:50.400
Um, but if you email us as you did saying, Hey, I think this might actually be the case.

02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:54.280
Then I go, Oh, that's, that sounds like an informed opinion.

02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.600
Gold star for user.

02:29:55.600 --> 02:30:00.720
Also, I recently restored and rebuilt my iPod touch to try to fix some play counts, sinking

02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:05.800
and memory issues, losing my game saves and other data in the process I had just purchased

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:10.100
and finished the forgotten shores expansion to monument Valley, which was despite negativity

02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:11.700
and reviews for the DLC cost.

02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:13.620
Absolutely worth the asking price.

02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:17.380
However, the app does not currently have a restores purchases option.

02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:21.380
I did send the developer feedback and I'm waiting for a reply, by the way, he did get

02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:22.380
that feedback.

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.260
He said there is a restore purchases option.

02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:25.660
He heard back from the developer there.

02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:27.660
So there you go.

02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:31.420
Um, thank you for the email.

02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:32.420
Appreciate that.

02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:38.280
Uh, I think there's no, that was the email on, uh, the sandwiches, the eight inch Italian.

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:39.540
So that's it.

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:43.560
So if you want to email us, participate at orange laundry.com, don't forget the Jackbox

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:45.060
contest going on as well.

02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:50.100
Make sure Jackbox is in the subject there and you can win a copy of a five in one game

02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:51.100
pack.

02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:52.100
It's an instant party.

02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:53.100
You want this.

02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:54.100
Yeah, it's good.

02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:55.100
It's in.

02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:56.860
And if you're on PlayStation four, you can share play and you're gonna have a party in

02:30:56.860 --> 02:30:57.860
two homes.

02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:58.860
Mm hmm.

02:30:58.860 --> 02:30:59.860
Lice water has like a hundred players.

02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:00.860
Right?

02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:03.940
You have a party in an auditorium if you wanted to.

02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:04.940
All right.

02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:09.500
Uh, let's get to the F use of the week cause every week we get angsty.

02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:10.500
Why?

02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:29.020
I guess gamers have a lot of angst on them.

02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:30.740
Loki wants to start us off.

02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:39.140
Uh, F you goes to Jack in the box who don't know how to make fucking sandwich is nasty.

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:43.620
Uh, Irene, do you have some F use of the week?

02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:54.460
Uh, F you to flaky ass people who are just a bunch of dicks and my cat Jonas F you to

02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:58.740
best buy for forgetting my, um, pre-order for smash brothers.

02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:00.980
You're not the only one they screwed over, by the way.

02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:02.500
I'm hearing a lot of that on Facebook.

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:05.900
The best buy really fucked it up with those pre-orders just so you know.

02:32:05.900 --> 02:32:07.580
So that's a big F you right there.

02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:11.420
Um, another F he goes to the people playing Pokemon.

02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:16.660
Some of the people in Pokemon Omega Ruby alpha server saying, Oh my God, Salamence is broken.

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:22.500
God, for fuck's sake, play the game long enough to before saying something is broken.

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:23.500
The same.

02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:28.100
And of course, another big F you to some of the members of project M. Yes, I'm calling

02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:29.860
your asses out.

02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:34.660
If you don't like Super Smash Brothers 4, stick to your, um, Smash Brothers melee or

02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:39.480
your project or the worst part project M. I'm tired of hearing your God damn complaints

02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:46.540
about Oh, put project M in the game room when we have Smash 4 enough said, or you can all

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:55.140
suck my balls, but seriously though, stop complaining and adapt to the new, um, new

02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:56.140
games and stuff.

02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:57.460
You guys want to play the old games?

02:32:57.460 --> 02:32:58.460
Go for it.

02:32:58.460 --> 02:32:59.460
Don't, but don't go wrong.

02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:02.980
Dictating other people what they should and shouldn't play.

02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:05.780
Or you can suck his balls.

02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:09.380
Uh, going to, um, my F you of the week.

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:15.180
I did not really look at this, act depth, found some website that will actually analyze

02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:17.940
your steam library for you.

02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:26.400
And apparently I have 238 games, 144 of which I have not played.

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.400
That is 61%.

02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:28.400
Wow.

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.220
Did I call out?

02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:31.220
That's that's pretty good.

02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:32.220
That's pretty good.

02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:33.220
That's pretty good.

02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:34.220
I'm impressed.

02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:35.220
All right.

02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:36.220
Shock.

02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:37.220
Fear.

02:33:37.220 --> 02:33:38.220
My meat.

02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:39.220
My meat.

02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:40.220
Laughs.

02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:45.580
Well, and my terrible English skills.

02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:47.380
I don't want to fear your meat, Rob.

02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.860
That's my meat lab skills.

02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:53.020
Well, there you go.

02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:54.420
Look at that.

02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:56.980
I was quite conservative in my guests.

02:33:56.980 --> 02:34:02.580
It says I have not played 89% of my library, not 97%.

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.820
You know what?

02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:05.060
Just F you to that whole bit.

02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:10.460
Well, I guess I'll just have to buy more games so that that number gets up to 97%.

02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:11.460
I know.

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:14.220
Now I'm going to go in tonight and just launch each one of those games just to spite you

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:15.220
people.

02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:16.220
Install them first.

02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:19.900
Then I'll give you some meat to fear.

02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:21.900
All right.

02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:27.140
Let's do a couple more news stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one

02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:35.820
eight seven seven game O.L.R. or our username on Skype, Roaring Ounge ADO.

02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:37.460
All one word.

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:38.460
Low key.

02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:39.460
Congratulation.

02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:40.460
Congratulation.

02:34:40.460 --> 02:34:46.820
You got to move on over to the Skype line.

02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:48.060
OK.

02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:54.860
So Assassin's Creed Unity is getting a third patch, which will hopefully fix the whole

02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:57.780
face off glitches.

02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:05.780
So yes, apparently they've still got their I want to say it's like a weekly blog or daily

02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:06.780
blog.

02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:09.340
I don't know what some sort of blog that they have or they're keeping track of everything.

02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:13.980
The third update will be larger in scope and it says they're going to patch bugs like

02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:18.060
are getting stuck in certain areas of the map or glitching in and getting in and out

02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:21.660
of cover problems.

02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:22.660
So yeah.

02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:28.060
So apparently the patch will dramatically improve the experience.

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:29.060
So more faces off.

02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:30.060
I don't know.

02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.060
We'll see.

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:32.060
All right.

02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:33.700
They'll be patching in fun.

02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:34.700
But next patch.

02:35:34.700 --> 02:35:40.300
And of course I like I like this little like you know this under promise over deliver type

02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:47.780
of phrasing here but it is noted though that this patch won't solve every problem.

02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:50.220
Some of them.

02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:51.220
All right.

02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:56.380
Well you know folks have been asking when will Final Fantasy 7 be remade for the PlayStation

02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:57.860
3 or the PlayStation 4.

02:35:57.860 --> 02:35:59.820
When is that going to happen people?

02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.900
And the answer is it's happened.

02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:03.900
That's right.

02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:04.900
It was remade.

02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:05.900
Final Fantasy 7.

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:06.900
Oh wait.

02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:07.900
There's a twist though.

02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:08.900
It was remade in LittleBigPlanet.

02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:09.900
Whoa Rob.

02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:14.700
You had me going there for a minute.

02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:16.900
Was your heart palapatating a little bit there?

02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.900
Absolutely.

02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:18.900
I knew it.

02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:19.900
I knew it.

02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:20.900
All right.

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.780
Fear the meat of this game.

02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:27.340
Final Fantasy 7 remade in LittleBigPlanet 2.

02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:28.340
Apparently it's on YouTube.

02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:30.940
You can watch one hundred and seven videos on YouTube.

02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:33.460
The entire story in Final Fantasy 7.

02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.700
Apparently this took this guy like years to build.

02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:41.860
It was in LittleBigPlanet 2's engine and there's a whole website being created for this.

02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:50.340
It's Final Fantasy VII LittleBigPlanet2.weebly.com and that's where you can follow more updates

02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:51.780
on this and you can watch it on YouTube.

02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:52.780
It's something else.

02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:54.860
I want to know can I download and play it?

02:36:54.860 --> 02:37:00.060
Because apparently the LittleBigPlanet 2 levels are supposed to be playable in 3 so I can

02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:01.740
play my Final Fantasy 7 remake.

02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:05.660
You can and I've watched video of it and it's derpy as fuck but okay.

02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:07.660
Okay but still come on.

02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:09.180
It's quite the accomplishment.

02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:16.940
It's quite the accomplishment but it's quite the derpy fucking accomplishment.

02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:17.940
Here's the thing though.

02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:22.660
Nothing will ever beat that level I played in the original LittleBigPlanet that was the

02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:24.060
Parker Posey level.

02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:26.060
I remember that.

02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:33.380
It was like a fucking creepy ass stalker thing and you would unlock pictures of Parker Posey

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:37.740
as you played the levels and it was like a tribute to Parker Posey level.

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:39.100
It was like a long lengthy level.

02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:42.700
That was my favorite LittleBigPlanet level I ever played was the Parker Posey tribute.

02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:43.700
So that's still in the game.

02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:45.100
You should check that out.

02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.740
Anyhow, there it is.

02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:48.980
All the news we have on deck for tonight.

02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:53.820
So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:58.260
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we have or haven't

02:37:58.260 --> 02:38:00.060
talked about tonight.

02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:03.540
While we wait for some calls to come in, I'll ask Loki if he has any last minute stories.

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.940
I'm going to fire up Twitter here.

02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:10.900
I do and I can't believe I forgot to put this in the show roll but oh my gosh it's a free

02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:17.300

02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:35.700

just you know all right look the phone is ringing we got to get some calls hi at OrangeLoungeRadio

02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:05.260
who's this it's the only person with the fastest internet out of everyone in the chat room

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:11.340
it is Rama hey Rama how you doing I'm doing good I just finished cooking an amazing dinner

02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:16.860
I'm sorry say it again I said I'm doing good I just cooked an amazing dinner an amazing

02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:20.700
dinner you probably could have made a better sandwich than the one Loki got well I'll tell

02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:23.860
you what next time I come out there's always you have a crock pot I'll put together a mean

02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:28.500
little dinner for all y'all oh you better bet we have a crock pot we're a couple of guys living

02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:34.860
here in this house we love crock pots that's what I'm talking about it's great for a dinner

02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:40.820
and booze what's on your mind my friend a couple of things everyone you were talking about your

02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:47.220
Steam library and how many games you have and how many games you get to play and I'm like right

02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:56.060
now I'm staring at my ps2 ps3 Xbox Xbox 360 collection and I'm just like out of all these

02:39:56.060 --> 02:40:00.540
games I can probably count on both hands how many games I have sat here and played it's gotten to

02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:04.660
the point where I'm just buying them just to say that I have it because I know if I don't buy it

02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:10.500
now I will not be able to get my hands on it later so you buy games just in fear that they're

02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:17.420
disappear off the shelf too quick kind of sort of like project diva I kind of had to sell my soul

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:21.740
to the devil and go to the shame stop to pick up the cop because it was only available there

02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:27.380
honestly that's fair I understand that sometimes sometimes you have to do what you have to do

02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:34.660
mm-hmm pretty much sounds like Xenoblade let's not go there that pissed me off oh you think that's

02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:38.980
something I was looking at shame stops Black Friday said they put Metroid Prime trilogy up

02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:44.340
there for 50 bucks oh gee what a steal it's gonna be more like how many people are gonna

02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:50.420
be going from store to store to store to store to find it oh I do want to get my hands on that

02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:55.740
though at some point I mean you know it's just I refuse to pay all that money for it I mean 50

02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:59.980
bucks is not bad I mean I will go looking for you but to be perfectly honest their Black Friday

02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:05.900
sales are kind of shitty to share yeah I know I understand what else you said there were a few

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:12.660
things another thing is um if you don't remember but I'm also staffing a convention coming up in

02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:17.260
about two weeks called derpy con I Jamie's been talking about that on the show so yeah I thought

02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:21.180
for some reason that was like this weekend so it's a couple weeks out yeah this weekend was like the

02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:26.580
final meeting for everybody to get together and had the bag party got it got it so give us the

02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:31.780
details on the con cuz I I don't know much about it besides that it's called derpy con well derpy

02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:39.060
con is a multi-genre con so it's anime fantasy sci-fi all of it so it's gonna be panels about

02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:45.340
various things and on behalf of our network anime jam session we'll be doing a live podcast and I

02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:53.540
will also be hosting the karaoke contest oh nice mm-hmm where where is it in New York City actually

02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:59.380
no it's in the Hyatt Moore's the Hyatt at Morristown New Jersey it's basically three blocks

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:03.660
from the train station there are plenty of food places around and is a movie theater built in

02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:08.500
like not built inside the hotel but next to the hotel is a convention center and if you go around

02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:14.940
the corner within there there's a movie theater is that why you're calling it derpy con cuz it's in

02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:25.180
New Jersey you would think come on that was too easy come on too easy oh New Jersey is I love I

02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:30.020
love your return stepbrother we all know that you know but I love New Jersey for the record I had a

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:35.660
great I have great I great memories with Rama in New Jersey one good thing about Jersey gas it's

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:40.300
like two dollars and fifty three cents a gallon and you can't pump it yourself yeah because

02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:47.140
somebody tried it once burnt down a gas station that's all right or organs the same way anyway

02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:53.860
anyway but but what's cool is that the way we're doing our game room we're going old school oh

02:42:54.260 --> 02:43:00.220
really yes we're doing we're looking at Nintendo Super Nintendo and 64 Dreamcast nice maybe even

02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:05.480
Xbox ps1 ps2 we're just we're just keeping it old school what you didn't invite the teabaggers to

02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:15.060
get out the u-haul and drive out to Jersey realize that the teabaggers came out here there is quantum

02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:20.220
game there are other gaming groups that are like it will probably run them out of the area oh oh

02:43:20.740 --> 02:43:30.260
is this turning into West Side Story when you're a teabag you know you're a tub anyway actually

02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:34.420
might know some people there I was I'm not sure like what groups are actually curious which groups

02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:40.340
are actually gonna be at the gaming section actually work we're doing our own work we're

02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:44.780
doing with some cars that we're just gonna purchase older consoles or a couple of staffers

02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:49.540
gonna bring in their older consoles for play so in pretty much in-house pretty much yeah I like

02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:58.220
the big conventions like anime next Otacon they will they'll have their own consoles conventions

02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:04.740
like Zenkai a USA they'll get a third party and they'll usually be affiliated with a gaming con

02:44:04.740 --> 02:44:11.980
such as too many games such as as an example of one of the bigger local smaller local gaming cons

02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:17.620
in the area well you said Otacon correct you said Otacon has their own in-house funding for game

02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:23.820
room I thought that was being funded by um or at least covered by um what's that group up save point

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:31.300
save point not my knowledge if it's changed it's might have been recently because I have not gone

02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:37.700
to Otacon in like about a year or so so if that's changed I I had no idea but when you go in there

02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:44.220
you'll see like the boxes with the consoles it'll say property of Otacorp well be sure to share your

02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:48.540
plans with Jonas he can tell you everything you're doing wrong I'm kidding I'm kidding okay you know

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:54.180
what he can do that I'll send him directly to the department of gate of video games and if you like

02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:59.980
dealing with the rock that's all you I just sit here I deal with the karaoke and then when the

02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:07.180
contest is over I break out the flask turn on open mic and Lego dear Lord that's it you know I wish

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:11.140
I'd had some warning I would have loved to come out to derpy con and if you say karaoke I'm sure

02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:18.460
I could have gotten Irene out there too are doing a midnight thing for midnight karaoke so yeah you

02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:25.180
know it's nice well our staffers are rocky horror oh it's all I will plan now for derpy con to

02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:29.500
electric boogaloo you don't say it too loud because you know Jamie would jump right into

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:36.180
your arm luggage for that one she is staff so yeah I know I know she's been talking about some

02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:41.660
of the design work she's been doing for it so okay so so that'll be fun to have that take a

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:45.860
lot of pictures since I can't be there I guess now is this good of a time to any to announce

02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:55.460
this we're speaking about cons and East Coast um I am coming to Boston which convention I'm coming

02:45:55.460 --> 02:46:08.700
to PAX East trolling me right now bro I'm not I'm not telling you I'm seriously coming out

02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:21.300
to PAX East so yeah I will be out there what is it like the plane tickets are bought I have the

02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:36.860
receipts um I didn't but we have a way anyway so that's so yeah I will see you guys well I guess

02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:42.140
that you're not gonna come to PAX East then oh did you did you oh you probably weren't there

02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:48.180
here's the thing I subscribe to all of their social media so I know exactly when the tickets

02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:55.860
were going on sale when the hotels were going up right they waited 20 minutes after they opened it

02:46:55.860 --> 02:47:00.900
up and made announcements on social media that tickets were available in the hotel were available

02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:08.940
oh my god I jumped on it three a badges were gone oh my god by the end of the day at 6 p.m.

02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:17.380
when I was leaving work the entire conventions was sold out and I'm like I refuse to drop $800

02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:22.980
on a scalper for this and I refuse to I'm not doing it that's not stressing myself over this

02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:28.700
forget it that's what you need to do is wait for that second wave that they'll put up from the

02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:35.020
scalper tickets they recover they won't they won't they will no they didn't do it for New York Comic

02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:40.460
Con well that let's not get into that but let's just say they were they said they were doing it

02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:45.180
for New York Comic Con I was following a few of the scalpers let's just say the eBay auctions were

02:47:45.180 --> 02:47:53.140
still up there so frustrating I it's scalpers suck awful but what I will do maybe if Mako

02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:58.100
Chan is up to it maybe we will day trip up there we can hang out or something there you know we'll

02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:02.300
figure something out there you go it'll be a party all right I gotta let you go so we get more calls

02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:08.980
but wow I just dropped a bombshell in the chat room apparently because I did I posted on Twitter

02:48:08.980 --> 02:48:13.820
I'm like by the way I'm coming to Boston March something to something so he missed that tweet

02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:18.540
alright well maybe Twitter's hiding things now too with Facebook all right take care buddy are

02:48:18.540 --> 02:48:22.820
you taking a bro all right bye bye time difference doesn't help either you know cuz if I post

02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:26.300
something at midnight then it's like 3 a.m. for the East Coast so maybe that's how they missed it

02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:31.540
I don't know anyhow one eight seven seven game olr or a username on Skype orange lounge radio if

02:48:31.540 --> 02:48:34.420
you'd like to give us a call let's get some more calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:42.900
hello Paul here hey pal what's up kind of tired doing packing and stuff like that but everything

02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:49.900
okay going on a trip and no we're probably moving so he tried to do slowly no waiting

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:56.380
until last minute oh probably well moving is like punishment for shoplifting in some countries I'm

02:48:56.380 --> 02:49:02.060
pretty sure yeah yeah I think of some countries illegal or something it's just thorough what's

02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:09.780
up buddy I was caught I was going just for my opinion regarding the amiibo um I bought some

02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:17.140
and it worked different I expected but not so certain necessarily a bad thing I was convinced

02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:22.540
that we're not gonna be something like kind of more casual but it's strange and strangely enough

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:28.940
I feel like it worked more for a hardcore gamer than for a casual gamer which I find it really

02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:35.460
strange if you compare it with the skylander or or business infinity how so what what made you

02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:43.340
decide that it was more of a hardcore thing because I don't see a kid for example buying

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:52.300
one and saying oh I really want to figure that we're learn to fight the same way I fight I just

02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:58.260
don't see a kid saying oh that's a great idea but if you're really really good in a smash which I'm

02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:04.780
not but if you're really really good and you train it they really end up fighting then what you do

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:12.300
like for example I jump a lot and I always forget to block because I just forget then they figured

02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:18.940
out after it reaches a high level like 40 or 50 it really played the way I play like I forget to

02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:25.020
cover all the time and it a jump all the time and it was kind of annoying it was hard to play like

02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:29.820
a fighting against a ghost of myself or something you know I need to know if they're gonna put out

02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:34.900
an amiibo for the master hand because that's the only time I remember to block is on that stupid

02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:42.140
hand I never remember to block and I never remember to grab and when someone does online

02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:52.620
I'm like what it was oh yeah it's growing but I think it's it can I like it but I think it has

02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:57.340
some kind of a strange identity crisis because that kind of toys is probably really appealing

02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:03.620
for kids but the usefulness in this match it feels like it's way more if you're really into this

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:08.020
match and you want to like train yourself or something like that because it's a really an

02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:14.540
AI that adapts to your gameplay which I don't see that is really kids friendly so I like it

02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:20.460
but it's a strange is definitely not the way I expected but which amiibos did you pick up I got

02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:32.740
the really classic ones like Mario Donkey Kong I got the ones that I was worried and maybe in a

02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:37.780
year from now two years from now when Nintendo decides to do amiibo amiibo world or something

02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:43.380
party with you and then suddenly will be all remember those amiibos I even buy well now you

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:47.980
can use in this game but nobody can find that figure in I hear some of those figures are already

02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:53.100
going up in price and getting harder to find because yay scalpers but apparently Marth is

02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:57.220
one of the harder to find figures that just came out and some people are seeing it on eBay already

02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:04.180
for 30 bucks so it's like and we all knew this stupid shit would happen so I'm whatever yeah I

02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:09.180
wish sometimes they put some limit to people I'm not never gonna do that but I know it was

02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:16.140
ridiculous like 24 hours later just checking eBay it was just that the reselling was insane

02:52:16.380 --> 02:52:20.740
like I'm sure just people go around Walmart just buying all of them or something oh yeah

02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:25.340
it's a whole thing there's probably seedy websites they gather Intel on and what's going to be

02:52:25.340 --> 02:52:31.540
popular and how to get them but anyway all right yeah they sell pre-sales all right well pal I'm

02:52:31.540 --> 02:52:34.300
gonna let you go so we can get more calls but I'm glad to hear you have a good time with amiibos

02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:39.540
thank you and also I follow your other program I discovered the other a and even though I don't

02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:45.300
play Wow I don't play Final Fantasy 14 I really enjoy it well thank you grandpa and next for will

02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:52.020
appreciate the plug all right all right bye it's good to hear from pal and look at this the

02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:55.980
skyline lighting up oh my gosh just call after call try to get at least one more in hi you're

02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:59.380
on orange ons radio who's this yeah what's up this guy judo hey guys you know what's on your

02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:05.900
mind buddy I'm gonna tell you in one second I just wanted to to tell that last caller what he

02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:12.020
could do is if he's not really that good at smash have his amiibo fight with him instead of against

02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:16.980
him and it'll pick up from like what the computer is doing and it'll get a lot better than what he

02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:22.700
can teach it and also amiibo versus amiibo is a lot is like 10 times better than um you fighting

02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:26.740
your amiibo so in other words you could just put the amiibo in there with a bunch of CPU characters

02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:32.380
at level 9 and why don't you just learn from the best yeah exactly even though those level

02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:37.580
nines aren't really that great it's like they tell you to I just fight amiibo versus amiibo

02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:43.940
interest like you know yeah is it is I think it's really cool I think um I kind of disagree I think

02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:48.620
I think kids don't enjoy it it's kind of like you know it's like a kid has a little a little

02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:53.540
little buddy to take along with him and play if he doesn't have you know if his friends don't have

02:53:53.540 --> 02:53:57.820
the game or is late at night and he can't have friends over just pop that little sucker in there

02:53:57.820 --> 02:54:02.540
and you have a little sparring partner it's better set a fight in the computer I think kids will be

02:54:02.540 --> 02:54:07.420
in it probably more for just the figures themselves but I think pow had a decent point that like

02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:12.700
kids may not be thinking on that secondary level where adults are like oh I gotta get this cuz

02:54:12.700 --> 02:54:17.260
it's gonna unlock here and it'll be easy here and dah dah dah but I don't know I then again I thought

02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:22.460
that like game the nine years old I subscribe I could I could I could remember being a kid and

02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:28.020
when I was a kid there was never a time where I wanted a action figure based off a video game like

02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:33.180
a video game already feels like a toy already yeah so I don't really see kids using their imagination

02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:38.540
like getting excited over a freaking Mario figure or Princess Peach figure you like you know they

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:43.460
see them for what they are you know they'll they'll be looking for some other cool toy that's out

02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:46.800
there I don't think they're necessarily gonna use these things as toys I know I wouldn't I got

02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:55.100
excited for the princess it's like I wish that they would just have like them actually be action

02:54:55.100 --> 02:55:00.020
figures like have it be an action figure and have the base attached to it and yeah so what if it

02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:03.780
comes off the base at least if you have the base and you can play the game I still think these

02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:07.700
things are gonna do better than people I don't think they're gonna like top Skylanders but I

02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:11.460
think they're gonna do better than people are expecting and this is gonna be Nintendo's way

02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:17.220
of saying see we didn't have to do a mobile phone game we can do this so yeah I had the I have the

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:21.980
Star Fox amigo and like just like look he said it's like I'm tempted to bend his arm like it

02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:27.140
looks like an arm and bend down like he looks like a poseable action figure but you can't but

02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:31.900
it's a really cool-looking uh whatever the hell you want to call it but what I'm here to call

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:35.620
about was you're talking about Ghostbusters earlier yeah and I'm have a game recommendation

02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:41.780
for you you need to get ghost control ink on Steam it's almost it's not exactly the Ghostbusters

02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:46.100
from the you know that you were talking about but it's kind of like kind of like a combination

02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:53.540
of Ghostbusters and what's the other thing xcom and basically it's like it's turn-based you

02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:57.860
travel around the city where actually you're traveling around London and you're busting

02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:01.380
ghosts it's a lot of fun the graphics suck so if you're really in the graphics you're not probably

02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:05.780
not gonna like it but I'm like we don't mind like the 8-bit looking graphics because I mean that's

02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:09.980
real it looks like it's something out of Nintendo I just googled it to get a little more information

02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:13.060
on it while you're talking about it and it looks like this is something that they got on Kickstarter

02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:17.980
and one of these links goes to Kickstarter the graphics look like game dev tycoon or something

02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:21.940
like that yeah yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's basically one of those I forgot what they call

02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:27.300
them they're like like a financial simulator or a business simulator so you know you have to

02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:33.380
balance your money you know you you upgrade your equipment it's a lot of fun it's a lot like like

02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:37.460
I said it's not a lot like xcom but it has that ghostbusters theme to it and it's really silly

02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:42.580
like the game doesn't take yourself serious like there's times where you pick up your um your cell

02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:46.260
phone because you get calls while you're like you know driving around and it's just mumbles

02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:54.980
like they talk like sims yeah yeah yeah it's completely bonkers and um it's a never-ending

02:56:54.980 --> 02:57:00.980
game I love my sandbox and open world never-ending game so as once you beat it you can still continue

02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:04.580
to play it for as long as you want so that's my favorite part about it there you go there's

02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:08.340
something I'll have to keep an eye out for on the steam sale so yep all right now I'm gonna let

02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:12.340
another call get through great show thank you so much guys you know appreciate it all right right

02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:17.700
bye good call good call well I am going to shut down the skyline I'm very sorry to those of you

02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.620
that didn't get through but we are a little bit past nine o'clock here which is supposed to be

02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:26.660
when the show ends uh but uh I want to thank you guys for uh downloading the show tuning in and

02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:30.180

you can send us regular emails too or welcome to participate at orange laundry.com this place to

send those emails uh Loki checking in one more time for your last minute stories no but I was

02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:43.460
going to talk a little bit more about goat simulator please mmo or you know go mmo simulator

02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:48.340
so apparently there's a spot in the game where there's a hole in the wall you jump into the wall

02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:54.260
you find out it's a concrete room full of servers and it being goat simulator you can smash those

02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:59.700
servers and eventually as you smash the servers more and more stuff breaks eventually the textures

02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:04.180
stop drying and eventually the wire frames break and eventually you get logged out

02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:12.340
brilliant absolutely brilliant and that's all free once you buy the game I think I'm gonna

02:58:12.340 --> 02:58:15.700
need to try to get these guys on the show for Loki because I think he's a bit of a fan they're

02:58:16.980 --> 02:58:23.540
not they're in Europe oh well we had the geometry wars guys years and years and years ago they were

02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:28.340

02:58:47.060 --> 02:58:52.260
the championships as well as Smash Brothers and and Pokemon nice coming out because I

02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:57.300
guess people want to know when the tournament starts and if there's gonna be a player smash

02:58:57.300 --> 02:59:01.940
in the actual game room which most likely has to be yes because there's gonna be so

02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:08.260
many people playing smash right so get eight people through and next eight people come up next

02:59:08.260 --> 02:59:12.820
all right well uh let me know if you do the robo amiibo competition there and I'll uh I'll uh

02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:18.740
I'll probably buy into that my my trained at home amiibo amiibo versus amiibo mecha amiibo

02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:23.620
anything yeah I actually can bring up a question to the people see if it's if it's if the interest

02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:27.380
is good enough yeah we could probably pull something up maybe for SAC on like next year

02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:31.540
since we might be doing SAC on but that's still in the works all right well good luck to you

03:00:46.660 --> 03:00:52.100
oh that's it okay yeah yeah all right fair enough uh let's see Loki your final thought tonight

03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:56.420
uh I need to work more of a game yes you do we didn't get an update this week that means you

03:00:56.420 --> 03:01:02.500
didn't work on it uh not necessarily I worked on like just concept stuff because I'm trying to

03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:10.980
figure out how to redo uh the engine again just to make it faster with doing um geometry checking

03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:16.900
and stuff like that so that I can remove extra geometry because I got to the point where I run

03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:25.060
out of space really fast in each 3d objects on that to make a chunk system and try to find a

03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:30.180
way to check it because before once I get like you know so many objects on the screen it would lock up

03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:35.620
for a few seconds when you add a new one so I can't have that that doesn't work so I have to

03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:42.820
figure out how Minecraft does it or the other other voxel games do it because that's unfortunately

03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:47.380
I didn't want to have to do it that way but that's the way I got to do it all right and uh

03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:51.780
