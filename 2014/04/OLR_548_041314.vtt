00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
PAX East has wrapped up and the gaming news we've been yearning for has arrived.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Kicking off this week was a special Nintendo Direct.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
PAX brought us information on updates to Titanfall, the new Borderlands, and a new title from Harmonix.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Too much to cover in a mere 8 seconds, so stay tuned for the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio here on April the 13th, 2014 with episode 548 of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
How are you, DarkSakura?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
My stomach's a little upset because I ate really rich broth.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Really rich broth.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Maybe it was like really upset at something that happened over the weekend or who knows.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Actually, I gotta say this and I hope you do feel better because DarkSakura, y'all, was a real rock star for me yesterday.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
We went to IKEA because I needed some furniture and you know that every time you go to IKEA, it's IRL Tetris.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Like it's IRL Tetris trying to load those boxes in your compact car.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Right? I'm gonna blast that on speakers driving through the parking lot of IKEA.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
But we did it. We got that crap in my car. It was the first time I ever had to fold down the backseat ever.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Which, you know, it wasn't that hard, but it's just like one of those, wow, I did something new today.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That's the first time I squatted a shelf.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Right? And you lifted like a 54-pound shelf. I'm like, let me help, let me help. You're like, no, I am woman, hear me roar.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
And you picked up that.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
What was it, like 57 pounds or something like that?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, it was 57 pounds. That's the new little shelf cart thing we have in the living room.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
It really wasn't that bad though, because I've gotten, where I squat, what's my squats now, at 80?

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
So, it wasn't that bad, but I realized that when I could lift 60, 70 over my head, that I was not squatting enough.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, I would not have been able to do that by myself, so I appreciate the company yesterday.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And of course, go into our chat room over at live.vogganetwork.com

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
because we do tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vogganetwork.com.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, we do.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And in our chat room, we have Brad from Pod Culture saying, IKEA meatballs tasty.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
That is their slogan.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Hello, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Fine.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
We can't get through a conversation about IKEA, especially when it comes to food, without hearing from Tech Master Loki. How have you been?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I've been okay.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
When was the last time you had some IKEA food?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I've never had any IKEA food.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I've never been to IKEA.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
What? I called the wrong person yesterday. No offense, Dark Soccer, but if he's never been.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I needed those shelves.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
That's true.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I needed those drawers and my soap dispenser that I got.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, Loki, as I'm filling up this house with things that my apartment was not big enough for, I'm sure there will be something else.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
So next time I need to go to IKEA, I'm going to call you so you can have some meatballs and check out the store.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Which, why aren't they paying us? I'm just totally pimping the shit out of that store right now.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
For the record, I was singing the song as we went through the roundabout, as most of the chat room is right now.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I noticed, yeah, having 978 is singing the Jonathan Coulton IKEA song in chat right now.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, the Meatballs Tasty line is also from that song.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Ah, there you go. There you go.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Alright, Loki, what's new with you quickly?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I got a second week of watching the baby.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Good times?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Tiring.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Tiring?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Are you able to get the baby to drink now, okay, and feeding?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I had to syringe feed him.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That's annoying.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yikes.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
He's lazy.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Aw, poor guy.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Hopefully in a couple months.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You should get one of those boob attachment things.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
That's what I told him last week, to wear the fake boobs.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
It doesn't matter what you do. You could do all sorts of tricks with this baby.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
It's just not going to matter.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
It's because he's smarter than the average baby.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
He's smarter. Yeah, he's a smart baby.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Alright, well, we are going to shift gears a little bit here.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
We are going to go right into some gaming news here, and right at the top of the show,

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
I know PAX East is on a lot of people's minds because, you know, it happened this weekend.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I bet a lot of you guys might be tuning into the show tonight live.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
We're probably there, or if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
you probably missed the live show because, you know, you were there at PAX East.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
But us being all the way here on the West Coast, who didn't get to make it out to PAX East,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
we wanted to hear about how the show went this year.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So for our kickoff topic tonight, I want to bring on to the show tonight.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Live, joining us via the Skype line from Anime Jam Session, the one and only DJ Rama S is here.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Hey, what's going on, Rob?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Hey, not much. How you doing, Rama?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Good, good. But what is this about PAX East?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We're coming back from IkeaCon.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
There's a crap load of furniture in the back, and I'm holding a table with one hand.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
If I'm not careful, it's going to take my head off.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Don't forget the 50 packs of Allen wrenches.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Did you really go by Ikea on your way back? That's a lie.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Twice.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Are you by yourself, or you sound like you're in a car full of people?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I am in a car full of people.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Mako John here is driving the mobile studio, and behind me is Zaku.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Hey, guys. Well, hi to the whole crew in the car. How you guys doing?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Hi, hi.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Hello, hello.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
So PAX East, you guys are on your way back. In one word, Rama, how is PAX East?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Fucking phenomenal.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
That's two words. You cheated.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
It's hyphenated. I say it passes.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Walk us through your weekend at the con a little bit. How did things go?

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
You got there, and how did Friday go, and so forth. Walk us through your weekend.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Rama, you still there?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, we're here.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It might have been a dead zone as we're on 95 going back.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
That's okay. Live radio, folks, and we are doing this from a car all the way to our little studio in Sacramento.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
So I don't know if you heard the question, Rama, but Rama, I just wanted you to kind of walk us through your weekend a little bit.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay. It was really fun. The expo hall was a lot more packed.

06:26.000 --> 06:37.000
It was a little bit harder to get swag this year. Not as much cosplay, but very popular with Mario Brothers and Bioshock for obvious reasons.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Right.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
The parties were just freaking phenomenal. Seeing the Crystal Method perform live was just worth it for me.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Oh, I had no idea they were headlining the con. They were the big music guests there?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
No, for the after party.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh, okay. So there was something else going on in Boston at the same time.

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, nowadays, now what they're doing is, Friday nights and Saturday nights, they're having the Nvidia after party or the IGN after party,

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
or Enter Game Company here, World Bar Crawl 2014, get in when you fit in, you know.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Got it. So they don't do the official concerts anymore. It's more like go to all these cool after parties and get out of parties.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
They still do it, but yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm having a hard time hearing Zaku. I don't know what he's saying.

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
I said, it was, got it? I think the court's in short.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Live from the mobile studio, folks.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Alright, can you hear me now?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, barely.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Alright. I actually went to that Nvidia party, but I guess the whole crux of it is that compared to last year,

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
there's been a slight uptick in the number of after parties surrounding the con.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Some of which you have to travel outside of the convention center area, you know, to actually reach.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Some of which you have to like have it out. But yeah, I actually went to the Nvidia after party on Friday.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Aside from playing a bit of Titanfall, we were getting like, we only got up to like two free drinks,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
and then they threw in an extra one when they moved the party up to the venue above the party.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, I think the best part about any convention or the after party is, I mean, that even extends to E3,

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
which technically isn't a convention. It's a trade show. But y'all have heard about the legendary parties at E3.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And heck, I think I was just talking on the Bobby Blackwell show before we were live.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
I was talking about Gamer X and how some of the parties at that were the highlight of the show.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
So, I mean, I'm not surprised at all to hear that the after parties in some ways stole the convention in a way.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah. I mean, that's still typical, but you also have like, you know, a lot of people, from what I've been hearing,

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
a lot of people were saying that Bethesda's Wolfenstein party was pretty much the hit just on the terms of swag

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
and the fact that it was a 1960s theme that plays into the new version of Wolfenstein that they're releasing, the new order.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.000
So people were encouraged to actually dress up in 1960s attire, even though that wasn't a requirement.

09:19.000 --> 09:31.000
But from what I was gauging on social media and all other sources, people were pretty much saying that that was the best party of the weekend.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
Not to throw cold water on the ACES PC Gamer party, but in terms of what you got for just showing up,

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
those folks were able to get a lot more swag than the PC Gamer ones, unfortunately.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
Swag has been pretty much relegated to these after parties. If you actually got in and managed to get the swag, then...

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
That's really no different from E3.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Otherwise, the call center...

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
The whole swag thing is really no different from E3 or some of the other conventions that are out there,

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
because I know you got to go to the after parties if that's stuff you're looking for.

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
They give away these big bags, but there's nothing to fill them with, which I don't know if you want to blame the economy or cost saving or what have you.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
And I noticed in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, SSGO and under Matt, who I know is also at PAX East,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
agrees that swag was tough to acquire, at least for me. So, you know, it is what it is.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
But tell us about some of the things on the convention floor over at PAX East that you guys were able to get...

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, I mean, for my Nvidia swag bag, I managed to get at least three USB drives.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Oh, well, that's... Alright, hey, that's pretty awesome.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Where's mine? No, I'm just kidding. Alright, hey.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Rob. What? Hello?

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Rob, I'll say this. This is what you should call... We're right here, bro.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
PAX East should have been called this. PAX East 2014. The return of the indie motherfucker.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
The most hilarious thing about that is that Rama got cut off as he was saying that,

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
but I imagine there's a huge delay thanks to the fact that we're beaming onto highway 95 somewhere from space.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
So this is the year of the indie? The return of the indie?

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
The return of the indie motherfuckers. It was 85-90% indie development all over the place.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Yes, you did have Microsoft with the Xbox One sitting out there.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Ubisoft was there. 2K was there. Bethesda was there.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
But there was a lot more independent publishers and developers,

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
and pretty much the biggest indie developer there I would say would have to be Riot Games with League of Legends.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
And believe you me, you kind of want to keep your distance from that booth.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
League of Legends fans are crazy.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Because it was getting to where they were fighting for swag, and I ain't fighting for swag.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, I bet. I bet. And Blizzard, well Blizzard's not really indie,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
but I know Blizzard had a big weight for a lot of things they were giving away.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
They were giving away beta tests for Warlords of Draenor, which a ton of people that are huge into Warcraft,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
and when you're super into one game like that, as a lot of League players are,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
and as a lot of Warcraft players are, I mean you will cut a bitch for swag.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I remember when we were super into DDR, I got yelled at by some girl,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
because I caught a t-shirt that she wanted, and she got nasty with me,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
and no, I didn't give her the shirt, I kept it for myself.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
If you're going to act like that, hmm. Yeah, I got your shirt. Anyway.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
No, no, no. You got your shirt.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
That's right. My shirt. Anyway. I still wear that shirt, by the way.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Beatmania, yo, with my Beatmania shirt. Anyway, okay.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
Rama, what were some of the games you actually got your hands on, like some things you actually got to play?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, before I get into that, the funny thing that you mentioned is DDR.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
I don't remember the full title of the game, it was called The Order of Something.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
The Order of the Necromancer.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I think you're talking about the Crypt of the Necromancer.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
The Crypt of the Necromancer.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Keyboard, hmm? You played with controller, keyboard, and dance pads.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
That sounds like fun. What is the game? Is it just a music game, or is it an adventure, or what?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
It's an adventure, top-down, gauntlet-style crawler.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
That sounds kind of awesome, actually. Did you enjoy it?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah. I think the line was a little bit too long for me to enjoy it.

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
But, they had this one game there that's coming out, Steam, at PlayStation 4, which I may have to purchase.

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
It is a, I think it's called Gravenger Z. I have the pin somewhere in my bag.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
But, I know Jamie will enjoy this, because it is an old-school anime-style shooter.

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
With the 70s-style animation, the original old-school, late 80s arcade bootloader.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It's a Galaxie.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
The eye-catches says we'll be right back between every game level and so forth.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
That sounds kind of awesome, actually. That sounds amazing.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
Yes, it was. There were a lot of mobile games. We were busy playing.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
Me and Mark were busy playing this game called Fairway Solitaire Golf, because we were trying to win $1,000 on Xbox One.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, they were having a tournament. The top three players every day of the convention.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
First player got $1,000, second player got an Xbox One, and third player got an iPad.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
So, everybody was playing that just to try and get the prizes.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
That probably would be $2,000.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Showing up.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Pay for my trip.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
$1,000.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
$1,000 cash.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yes.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Wow.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, I'm assuming you didn't win, or you'd be talking to us from an airplane right now.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
No, you were here, and I'm on a boat by the Lonely Island. Yeah, we decided to take a yacht back to the studio.

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
All right. Rama, before we let you go, what was the highlight of the whole damn thing for you guys?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Oh.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm going to let the others talk, because I've got to think about that one.

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
All right. I mean, I guess if you ... Well, I guess mostly the highlights were just like whatever they announced.

15:28.000 --> 15:37.000
Let's see. NVIDIA basically announced Portal for the Shield, meaning that Valve for the first time is targeting Android.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Right.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
That came out of left field essentially during the panel.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
The head of one of the folks, execs from NVIDIA, was hosting it.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
He had developers play Portal on the Shield, and the thing is the PC wasn't even streaming it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Wasn't that on the show last week?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, they announced it last week.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
They did announce it, but maybe this is the first time that you really see them embracing it in public.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah, they were actually showcasing it, though.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Okay, yeah. That's cool.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
So far it looks pretty good for an Android Portal.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
All right.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It's almost like the original one. The second one is like harmonics.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
It actually woke up pretty early just to get to the first panel of the day, which was theirs.

16:19.000 --> 16:28.000
They announced Record Run, which is the first tablet game being released by them right now.

16:28.000 --> 16:38.000
It's kind of like audio surf, but not really in the same artistic style, but in the actual mechanics,

16:38.000 --> 16:47.000
where your actual iPads or iOS's library essentially drives the actual notes.

16:47.000 --> 16:56.000
It's essentially a free-to-play game, where you basically have a certain number of songs you can add into your collection in the slots.

16:56.000 --> 17:09.000
And the more you play it, the more you get what's called backstage passes, which is essentially the currency that you use within the game to spend it on more music slots to add more tracks from your library.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
And from what they were telling me, they were this close during the keynote to announcing another title,

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
but at the last minute they couldn't get clearance from one of the legal hurdles that was in the way.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
So they had a hold off on that, and they might announce something later on, hopefully by E3.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
Well, I know we'll have more information on the harmonics game coming up a little later in the show and some of these other big announcements that I know came out of PAX East.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
But yeah, getting to be there for some brand new information I'm sure is a highlight.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
It's always kind of cool to be there in the room when a big bombshell is dropped, like going to a big press conference or something like that. That's awesome.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Rama, Mako-chan, what about you guys? What was the highlight?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Alright, here you go Mako.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
I was actually playing two different games on the floor and absolutely loved them.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
One of them, they were there last year, it's called Cupcakes and Critters.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I saw that.

18:10.000 --> 18:18.000
And this year they had, the game itself was more developed and they were really trying to pimp it out.

18:18.000 --> 18:31.000
And basically you're trying to save a cupcake from a bunch of roaches, but it's mind-numbing and you just sit there and kill all of these bugs.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
But when you hit the cupcake, it actually smiles and laughs, so I thought that was hilarious.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
The other game is going to be out shortly for 3DS, PS4, and what was the other one?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Vita.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Vita.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Vita.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's called Blast'em Bunnies.

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
It's actually a shooter where you're killing really cute bunnies with carrots and pumpkins.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Onions.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Onions.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Turnips.

19:01.000 --> 19:10.000
Everything is like motion control, so with the controller you have to actually turn the controller left and right to aim or up and down.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
So it was actually really, really fun.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Huh, that sounds neat.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Alright, Rob, I guess we're to you.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Last but not least, what's your big highlight?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I got three.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Number one, number three.

19:27.000 --> 19:38.000
As you know, I'm a hardware guy, so I went over to the Cooler Master booth and they had a contest for the typing of the dead on their mechanical keyboards.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
It was fun.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I've come to the determination that I need a mechanical keyboard.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Me too, I came to that determination some time ago.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Absolutely.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Number two.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh crap, I can't believe I forgot that.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Anyway, if I remember I'll come back to it.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
But this was my highlight.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
No, no, now I remember number two.

20:01.000 --> 20:11.000
Number two was playing Skullgirls through Steam on a Windows Surface tablet.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Huh.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
That blew my mind because I didn't think a tablet like that was that powerful.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Sitting there, playing it, they had the hub connected to it, two controllers, and I'm playing through the game.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
No lag, no slow down, no nothing.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I was greatly impressed.

20:29.000 --> 20:37.000
I mean, I won't go out and get a Surface tablet, but I am impressed at the power behind this little device.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And my number one.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Uh huh.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
This is the one thing I actually got online for.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Took me about 30, 35 minutes to get into it.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
I got in, I got strapped down into an Oculus Rift.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Oh, Bobby's smiling somewhere.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Tell us about your Oculus Rift experience.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I want one.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Even though Zuckerberg owns it now?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I mean, it's okay.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
Granted that the front of the device is blue and has a giant Facebook logo on it, you'll get used to it.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
You'll learn to like them anyway, I'm sure.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
What was the Oculus experience like for you?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
What did you get to play?

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
It was a game called Couch Night, where it was two stick video type nights and you were just fighting each other on a table.

21:30.000 --> 21:38.000
But let me tell you, they sat me down in the chair and they put the headset on and they told me to look around to calibrate it.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I look around, I'm having a mini heart attack.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
For a split second this was actual reality.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm like, this is what I'm looking at.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I'm sitting in a chair, not on a couch.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You plugged into the Matrix.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
Yes. And the fact of the matter is that the goggles fits on top of my glasses.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And it works even better for me.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Nice. So now you're sold on the Oculus Rift after that, huh?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Yes.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Good times. Good times.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, Rama, Meika Chan, and Zaku, thank you guys for talking to us from the car on the way home.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Really appreciate it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I gotta let you guys go so we can get on with the show.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
But everybody listen to Anime Jam Session on Tuesday because I know at least Rama and Meika Chan will be there.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Probably, you gotta talk about PAX East, even though it's not anime.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
We will. It's a PAX East show.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
You gotta. You gotta talk a little more about some of that cosplay and some of the other sights and sounds.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Any quick last words before, any parting shots before we go?

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
Um. Sucks to be EA. Sucks to be Sony. They should have been there. They missed out.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
But you know what? Let it be. I want more PAX. I want more indie gamers. I want more fun with that.

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
There you go. You can still have fun with nothing but indies. You're 85% indies. That's absolutely true.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Alright, buddy. Have a safe drive back. Don't do anything crazy.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Alright.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
We won't.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Alright, bye.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Bye.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Alright, live interview from a moving vehicle.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
How is that for the future, you guys? Internet radio.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Thank you guys for putting up with some of those little tech hiccups there.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
But, you know, such is the beauty of live radio.

23:18.000 --> 23:31.000
Anyhow, so yes, again, Rama and Meika Chan will be on Anime Jam Session, which you can hear at the voicegeeksnetwork of voggenetwork.com, Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

23:32.000 --> 23:41.000
Alright, we're going to get on with our own show here. We have some news, including some of the other things that were announced at PAX East, amongst other gaming news that happened in the industry this week.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
But before we get there, we always like to start off with, how was your gaming week?

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
To establish a little bit of a frame of reference for where our heads are at with the gaming industry this week, especially since we weren't at PAX East.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
We usually start with DarkSakura, but she stepped away for just a moment, so we're going to go ahead and start with Loki tonight. Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
I didn't play very much. I only played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and just, you know, our multiplayer games.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
And I'm awesome.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
So, still really enjoying that.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
I don't know. I played a little bit of a Unity game that someone had made called Garbage Day.

24:21.000 --> 24:30.000
It's just kind of a silly, you know, not really a grand theft auto, it's like a sandbox game where you just, there's really no point to it yet, you just murder people.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
But it sounds like a point to me!

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
No, here's the thing though. It's like, the game is so basic right now, there's hardly anything to it, but...

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
But there is murder!

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
But the music that they have in the background is hilarious. It's just very, like, happy...

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
What game is this again?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
It's called Garbage Day.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Garbage Day.

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
It's like something some guy is making on, like, the Unity Reddit forum thing, so I got to check that out. That was kind of funny.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
No Goat Simulator stories for this week?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I don't think I played that this week, actually.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
What?

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
I haven't had a lot of time to play games, because a certain baby isn't taking naps when he's supposed to be.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Oh, right, you gotta be a dad and all that, geez.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
I know, he's totally cutting into my game time. I mean, seriously.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
You need baby mamas, that way mama will fix it.

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
But, yeah, I'm hoping to play some more stuff. I do want to get back into South Park and finish that.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
I know it's not a very long game, so I want to do that.

25:31.000 --> 25:44.000
I also have Bridge Constructor, which I got from the last Humble Bundle, and the physics in that game are absolutely fucking terrible, so that I want to play.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
You like terrible physics, though.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I love it, it's hilarious. It's hilarious to see that kind of stuff happen.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Who needs the theory of gravity?

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
Well, it's just, like, it just doesn't work quite right. There's something off, is what's the best part about it.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
I played a few video games like that. Something's just not right with the physics.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
That's about it. I was hoping to pick up Titanfall in 360 this week, but I'm kind of glad I didn't, because I wouldn't have had any chance to play it.

26:07.000 --> 26:16.000
Maybe later on, but looking forward to Wolfenstein and Watch Dogs, because they'll be the next two I want to try.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
Alright, sounds good. Dark Soccer is back. She's got coffee. She's ready to go. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It was minimal.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Minimal?

26:25.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah. I played Animal Crossing and that's about it. Although, I did pick up a game today that I will be discussing later in the show on iOS.

26:36.000 --> 26:46.000
And I really think all I played was Animal Crossing this week. It's just been really kind of a busy week for me at work and weirdness.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
That's pretty neat, though, that a game like Animal Crossing can hold your attention after all this time.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm surprised you didn't pick up the Disney game that everybody's talking about this week.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
The, ah, I can't remember the name of it. It's like Disney's version of Animal Crossing.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
What the hell is it, Loki? You know what I'm talking about.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
It's like, uh, like Magical Kingdom or something like that.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Something like that. Yeah, yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
No point. I've got other games I'd rather be playing.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Alright.

27:10.000 --> 27:19.000
But, I don't know. It was kind of nice taking a little bit of a break and just going home and I was a little sick earlier this week.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
But, um, so mostly it was just going home and going to bed.

27:25.000 --> 27:34.000
And then being, ah, going out to Pinkberry with somebody who shall remain named Rob.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Delicious.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It was.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Alright.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
It was a busy week.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Alright, fair enough.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
Um, my gaming week, sadly, I did play a lot this week, but it was a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about on this show for weeks.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
So, sadly, I don't have really anything new to review for you guys, but I will say Final Fantasy XIV is out on the Playstation 4 officially now.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Thumbs up.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
The Fat Chocobo mount for the collector's edition of the game, which you also get if you had a collector's edition for PC or Playstation 3, is amazing.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
It's the Fat Chocobo, which I think started in Final Fantasy IV, but you, hmm.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I didn't know about this and I have to redeem mine then.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
It's waiting for you in the in-game mail when you sign in.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, they all went out this morning.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Logging in.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
So when you log in, yeah, and the mount, it's so adorable.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
It's like this Fat Chocobo that you ride on the back and you have on a fishing pole a little, it's a Gishaw greens, but it looks like a cabbage.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
So it's like a cabbage that hangs out in front of the Fat Chocobo's mouth, so that's what makes him run.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And then when you stop, your character, like, pulls the thing up so the Chocobo can't see it.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Like, the attention to detail is great.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
And then when you jump, it's fat little legs go like this.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Fat little legs fly.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
It's so cute.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
I'll probably be writing that instead of my quarrel. Although I like my quarrel.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
So I've been playing that a little bit on PlayStation 4, a little bit on PC.

28:50.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm finding that the mouse sensitivity on PlayStation 4 and just the sensation of playing on my larger TV as opposed to my not-so-large monitor is really throwing me.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Like, it's really throwing me for a loop.

29:02.000 --> 29:12.000
So I have a hard time sometimes on the PlayStation, but it's gorgeous and the frames, I mean, it's just so smooth compared to my PC because I have kind of an older PC.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
But that's one of the things I'm hoping to upgrade this week because some things, we got some good news.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
Alan and I got some good news in the past week, so I'm hoping that I'm going to finally be able to get that new computer I've been wanting for like two years.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
So that'll be good.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
I was doing some live streaming as well on the PlayStation 4.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
I really wish that Twitch and Sony was archiving those streams on PS4 right now.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
I understand that's coming in an enhancement soon. I know we reported on that a couple weeks ago.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
But unfortunately, you can't go see the archives of me playing PlayStation 4 because we have fun with that.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
So, yeah. Otherwise, more Diablo 3. I think I'm up to Paragon level like 35 now.

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
I love the new adventure mode. It's so fun to just go and you can just, excuse me, you can just go into a game with randoms.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
And I usually go on like a lower difficulty. I don't get as much experience, but it's so fast.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
You just go through and you get all the rift coins and then I just kind of go explore those on my own.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
And yeah, I'm having a great time with Diablo 3.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
And that's pretty much been the two big games I've been playing this week.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
I still touched a little bit of Final Fantasy X. I think I fired that up once.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
South Park I still need to go back and beat, but you know, just a lot going on with me too.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
So that does it for my gaming week and therefore all of our gaming weeks.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
So let's quickly go over some housekeeping. Next week is Easter Sunday, right?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
That's right.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
So Loki will not be here next week because you have some family obligations, I know.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
But Dark Soccer and I will still be here next week to put on a show for you guys.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
Maybe a special guest if I can find one here locally in the next week to bring to the show.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
So that'll all be something you guys can look forward to next week on the show.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
We will still be here live. We will not take next week off.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Otherwise, I don't know any shows that we do have off.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Probably the next time we're going to have a show off is whenever Gamer X is.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Because we won't do a show that weekend because Jamie and I will be hungover.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
So there you go.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Maybe.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Maybe. Alright.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Let's see. I think that does it for housekeeping so let's get into some gaming news.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
Lots and lots of news this week actually coming out of PAX East and other events as well.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
So Loki, take us away.

31:16.000 --> 31:28.000
So there's talk about like kind of a changing opinion with the change of, I guess, the lead, you know, person at Xbox.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
You know, remember with Don Mattrick, originally he said, you know, it was quoted, you know,

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
if you're backwards compatible, you're really backwards and everybody.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
That's kind of like that whole we're all pissed at Microsoft because they're saying really dumb things, you know, part of that.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
So now, you know, now that there's a new regime sort of thing, they're kind of looking at it like Phil Spencer is saying,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
well, you know, we're looking at it right now.

31:56.000 --> 32:05.000
There's not really a way we can do it, but it's something we'd love to see on the system.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
You know, because like we've said, you know, it's hard to emulate that stuff right now.

32:10.000 --> 32:18.000
Although I got to say it is probably somewhat possible because, I mean, homebrew wise, someone's already made an emulator for the Xbox 360.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
It just doesn't work very well. But there is one out there somewhere.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
So, yeah, it's something that they're looking at.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
So if they can, you know, definitely support that, then, yeah, that support will be coming if it's feasible.

32:33.000 --> 32:42.000
I feel like there, correct me if I'm wrong, Loki, based on some detail I might have missed, but I really feel like this is a whole bunch of smoke up our ass.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
I don't think there is any intention of doing backwards compatibility whatsoever.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
I think it's all wordsmithing to try and quell people down.

32:49.000 --> 32:58.000
But I really don't see like if there was going to be backwards compatibility that would have been implemented or that would have been under like that would have started a long time ago to say,

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
boy, gee, golly, maybe that's something we should look at, you know, and we'll do that real soon.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
I don't think that's the case. I don't think it's just, I mean, granted, it's, you know, better than saying, well, we're not looking at it at all.

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
But at the same time, I think that they would want to look at something like that because it gives them an opportunity to sell the back catalog again on Xbox One,

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
just like they're doing like, you know, the PlayStation Network right now selling PlayStation 2 games and PlayStation 1 games.

33:24.000 --> 33:33.000
It does give it does give a leg up as well for what it's worth on PlayStation 4 as well, because, you know, the library is not instantly backwards compatible.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And that's something a lot of people kind of miss.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
I highly doubt that if it is ever backwards compatible, that it's not going to be backwards compatible with disks.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't think that they'll have you put your disk in the system and have it read off that.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
But it's still going to be a very long ways off. I don't even know if they're going to be able to do it.

33:50.000 --> 33:57.000
One would think, too, if they get 360 compatibility working, then by nature they'll have original Xbox working as well,

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
because they sold original Xbox games on 360. At least the chunk that they had working.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
I mean, you would literally be emulator to emulator. I mean, you'd be emulating twice.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
But assuming they get 360 at full speed, it shouldn't matter.

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
But I know they sold original Xbox games on 360 and a big chunk, like, what, three quarters of the library of Xbox games worked on Xbox 360.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
Like, you know, the Halo games. Just not the DDR games. I know games that were always missing.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
I just don't know. I don't think it's going to happen. But it's something that they're looking at.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
I don't know. I just don't think that they'll be able to do it unless they come up with some completely new way to emulate that stuff.

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
Not actually just raw emulating everything. They'd have to come up with a new way to play all that architecture and stuff.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Right. I don't know. I still can't help but feel like, just don't get your hopes up, you guys.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
Because I think by the time they were to implement something like this, they'll have stopped making 360 games.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
Yes. They're not in a big hurry to do this anyways, because they want you to buy a 360 still.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
I mean, if you want to play 360 games, buy a 360. If you want to play Xbox One games, you buy an Xbox One.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
They don't want you to just buy one system. But at some point, you know, they're not going to be making the Xbox 360 anymore.

35:15.000 --> 35:22.000
They're going to stop making the Xbox 360 games. And maybe I can see them supporting Xbox 360 games for whatever the next console is.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
You know, when the processors are that much more powerful.

35:26.000 --> 35:33.000
I do see the point, though, about being able to get a 360 emulator working just so they can resell you a copy of Halo 3.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
Or, you know, some of the big 360 titles. I do see that perspective. And maybe that'll be a ways down the line.

35:39.000 --> 35:48.000
And everybody else does it. Nintendo's done it with Virtual Console. You've bought several games several times on your 3DS and your Wii and your Wii U.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And they do that with Virtual Console.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
How many times have they sold you a Game Boy?

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
Right? Well, to be fair, the hardware at least goes through upgrades. Games don't change.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
But anyway, and then PlayStation, you know, they get you to buy PS1 games you probably already owned.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
Like, I bought Umjama Lamy so I could play it on my PlayStation 3 even though I had it on PlayStation 1 at one point.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
You know, so. And, granted, if I could find the damn disc, I could just put that in my PlayStation 3.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
But, eh, whatever. It was five bucks or something, right?

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
So, I'm sure Microsoft wants a piece of that type of pie, too. So that's the only reason I could see them doing it.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
But I don't think it's, yeah, I don't know if that necessarily means you're going to put your 360 disc in and off it goes.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
You know? We'll see.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

36:36.000 --> 36:44.000
Dungeonbuster says, sounds like he's being diplomatic about it. He's not saying no, but at the same time gives reasons why it might not even happen.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
ActDeft in chat says retro compatibility equals HD remakes, maybe?

36:49.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah, I mean, I know we have news on at least one more of those and that seems to be the popular thing to do right now is remaking games from the last gen like we saw with Tomb Raider.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Well, yeah, that's something I see happening a lot more than just this.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Nintendo sure does it, too.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
They don't actually do it a whole ton anymore. I mean, Virtual Console, maybe.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
Well, yeah, but I'm thinking like Wind Waker HD and some of the Wii control games.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Yeah, new play controlling. Well, that wasn't even an upgrade. That was just straight porting.

37:17.000 --> 37:28.000
But like, you know, I think they had some Square Enix or even Sony had a way to port like some of their games like PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3 very easily.

37:28.000 --> 37:39.000
So if they come up with something like that to port 360 games to, you know, Xbox One or something, it might be worth it if they can improve the visuals and make it worthwhile.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Right. All right.

37:41.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, we'll see if they actually put their foot forward with this. Maybe something you'd see at E3? I don't know. That might be a little soon.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
We're not going to see anything for backwards compatibility, I think ever on this, at least on the Xbox One. It's not going to happen.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
One more thought here from our chat room and then I'm going to go to another story.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
But VX Jason XV in our chat says they wouldn't build 360 compatibility to let you play an old Halo.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
They'd port the old Halo or introduce Halo 3 mode to Halo 5 or something like that.

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
Like Halo 3 campaign in future Halos and Act F follows that up with Halo 3 DLC.

38:15.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah, I could see that. I could see that. Why not, instead of giving somebody that value, you know, why not convince somebody to just buy it again?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Well, that's a few years off.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
It works. People do it.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Halo 2 anniversary later this year.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah. Well, there's no official word on that.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
It's official.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
It's either official or it's not official.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
It's official to the point where it's leaked out so many times it's official.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah, they have an officially setting.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It's officially a poorly kept secret.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I want to actually say this.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, noobs I thought was official in Mortal Kombat 2.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
But it did end up being official at some point.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah, later because of people not shutting off, whatever.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Alright, let's move on. Hey, you know what? You know what is official?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And I could not be more excited.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
A new civilization game. Yay!

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You civ whore.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Yay!

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
Okay, here's the thing. It's not Civilization 6.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Frown.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
But that's okay because Civ 5 is still awesome and I'm getting some mileage out of that.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
It's like Civ X-Com.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Or it's Civilization Alpha Centauri, essentially, is what it is.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But here's the thing.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
They don't own the Fire Access in 2K.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
They don't own the rights to the Alpha Centauri name.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
EA does.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
So what they've announced instead is they've announced a game called Civilization Beyond Earth.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
And that is the game.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
They've put out a big trailer that just talks about, you know, we've built the Earth as much as we can.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
What is next?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
And it's essentially space.

39:42.000 --> 39:48.000
And the vibe I'm getting from the game is that it's not like humans and aliens.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
It's still like Americans, Egyptians.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I don't know if it's going to be modern.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I don't know if they would include historical.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Like, would the Egyptians be in it?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Well, I don't know. We'll see.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
I guess Egypt is still a country.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Who knows? I don't know what they're going to do.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
But they'll still have human civilizations in the game.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
So like Americans and Russian and Chinese.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
You know, probably all the United Nations powers and all that will probably be civilizations you can play in the game.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Colonizing a new world.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
We don't have more details on that at this time.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
My impression I'm getting from this and what I'm hearing about the game is it's this spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

40:24.000 --> 40:34.000
But imagine now that a lot of things we got from Civ V, such as the hexagon grid, are now going to be in a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
That sounds like where civilization beyond Earth is going.

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
And Black Wolf in our chatroom says,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Egyptians no longer exist is a quote I said.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That's not what I said.

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
But when I think about the Egyptians and civilization, I think about as they're led by ancient Egypt commanders.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And that's not going to be the case anymore.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
So I think you're going to see more contemporary civilizations.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So we're not going to see Space Gandhi or anything?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
You know what? Anything is possible in the future.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Who knows? Who knows?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
But anyway.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Yeah, so it's going to be in space.

41:10.000 --> 41:20.000
The cool thing is that, and again hearing some of the talk coming out of the panel and the convention, is that there's no established roadmap that they have to follow.

41:20.000 --> 41:35.000
So if you think about it, in a game like Civilization where you have the tech tree, you know that civilizations eventually will discover the wheel, which leads to advanced cars at some point, the steam engine.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Everything kind of leads to newer technology.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
But the thing about when you're talking about the future, we don't know what that technology looks like.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
So they can kind of make it up.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
So that's going to be kind of cool.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
And they talk about how the tech tree in Civilization Beyond Earth will be a web, not a tree.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
So that's going to be very interesting.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So there you go.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
You will assemble your culture identity and craft your colony before exploring the new world.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
There's also going to be a quest system.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
And that's not something you ever saw in civilization games before.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
That's going to be pretty neat.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm very excited to it, especially if it has Sid Meier's name on it.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
I'm hoping that he is a part of the development of the game.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
That would be great.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
But yeah, they are saying it's going to happen this fall.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
So more to come on this at E3.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
Please let me get to go to E3 and see a demo of this behind closed doors, please.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I'm very excited about this.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
So there you go.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Civilization Beyond Earth.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Darkstalker, what do you have for us?

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
Well, news out of BioWare regarding Dragon Age Inquisition.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
That they are not going to be doing any DLC as far as characters are concerned.

42:41.000 --> 42:51.000
Because of what you have to do to be able to enable new characters to be provided as DLC is that you have to put part of the content on the disc.

42:51.000 --> 43:00.000
And because of people fussing about paying for something they already own, then they just said we're not doing DLC characters at all.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
What we're giving you is what you get.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
So you get nine characters.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
The ones confirmed are Cassandra, who we saw in Dragon Age 2, definitely.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
Iron Bull, Sera, Solas, Varric, I love Varric, and Vivienne.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
So that's confirmed.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
I would imagine that a decision like this could impact another series that you and I love dearly and that would be Mass Effect.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Because I think about the DLC characters for those games were largely on the disc, right?

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Like Javok in Mass Effect 3 had to be on the disc.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
Because you think about all the dialogue that goes with that and characters interacting with Javok, it's got to be on the disc.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
Just put it on the disc, but put a significant portion of it that you download.

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
That way people don't bitch because they feel like they're getting a significant portion and not just a key to unlock it.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Well, about mine digitally anyway.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
Well, in Mass Effect, the characters usually came with missions as well.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
And I don't confess to be as up to speed on Dragon Age, but did they do a similar thing where the characters at least kind of...

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You got missions and quests with it as well?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I played the first Dragon Age without any DLC.

44:05.000 --> 44:13.000
So I'm actually playing through Dragon Age 2 again now with plenty of DLC and face hacks and all kinds of stuff.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Good times.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Because Fenris.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Of course.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
There's a ship that I ship almost as hard as the Garris ship. It is the Fenris ship.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
So you must be looking forward very much to this new Dragon Age game.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
It better have Fenris in it.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Alright.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
I sail the ship of the USS Broody Elf.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
There you go.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
Along with my larger boat, the USS Spiky Alien.

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
The pagan Jew in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminds us Mass Effect 2 also had Kasumi and Zaid.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
They had no interaction with anybody practically.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I think most of that was on the disc too.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
Or they crafted it in such a way where they didn't really interact with the others.

44:54.000 --> 45:00.000
Kasumi you definitely use in one part of the suicide mission if you have her.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
She's the best person to go through that tunnel to hit all the...

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I always have Tali do that.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Okay.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
I guess there are a couple characters you can use, but I always had Kasumi do that.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I always have Kasumi escort the crew back.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Gotcha.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And shoot.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Also I just love Kasumi actually. That was some great DLC.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah she's a fun character.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
It really was.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Especially with the Citadel stuff later on.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
No she's literally one of my favorite characters in the whole series.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Oh yeah, same here.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
She's great.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
That and her strange addiction to going through people's panty drawer.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I was so happy to see her in 3. But anyway.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Yeah.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
We could do a Mass Effect Wang podcast.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
She's such a sassy bitch.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
She's great.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Well I remember her. But see. The DLC wasn't just the character.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But you had that whole quest where you went into the mansion.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
That was a fun one.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
So they didn't just come with the character.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Donovan Hawk with the weird accent.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
And I finally figured out what his accent was supposed to be.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Certain region of South Africa.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Ooh.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Since we brought up Mass Effect Wank, you and I.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And we can never get enough of it here on the show.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Squirt squirt squirt.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Sorry Loki, deal with it.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
But I hear at PAX East this weekend.

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
They did like the voice actors and face actors doing the cosplay live.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
And they had like an assemblence of like what.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
They had Ashley's voice actors was there.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Yeah.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Kaden's.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Luciano Costa.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah Luciano Costa. The face model was there.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Twerking on stage.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Drool.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
In.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Drool.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Outfit.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Drool.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Hold on. Dab dab dab dab.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Let's see. Who else was there? Samara.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
She's everywhere. She goes to all the conventions.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Rana. What's her name?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
And then they had the. I did not know they got the voice actor for Thane.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Yeah.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Oh. Many people that ship The Shepherd Thane were very happy to see that.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
I didn't think the mask was all that great. But it was pretty cool to see.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
To see him there.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
And then.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
McNamar I think is her last name.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Mm hmm.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Rana. Anyway. She's cool.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
I actually. Because you know I have Mass Effecting.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
I reposted some of her video tutorials for doing a sorry cosplay.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Nice.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
But I've been. I've been following.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
The.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Delightful Mr. Costa since he created his Tumblr.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Mm hmm.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
And.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
He was putting up lots of.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
Progress pictures about making the body dummy.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
And working on the pieces of the armor and everything.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
It was pretty cool.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah. That guy like. He didn't.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
I don't think that guy really realized the Mass Effect fandom.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Until probably after the Mass Effect 3 stuff died down a little bit.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
All that controversy.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
And then he was like.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Wait a minute. There's all these people that like.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
He reposted Caden porn week.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Oh yeah.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
There's all these people that worship Caden out there.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
And I could make money off of this.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Well and then he also went in.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I could get a free trip to Boston.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Well he also went in and.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
There was a.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Posted a.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
Kind of a mini photo shoot meeting with the voice actor.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Who's a.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Raphael Sparge who's also on Once Upon a Time.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Mm hmm.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
He's chimney cricket.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Yep.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
I actually really like him.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
But.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
All right.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
The.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
That was pretty.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
The too much Mass Effect wank alarm is going off here in studio and seven.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
So we need to move on with some news.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Loki.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
All right.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.800
So it was inevitable that there is going to be another Disney infinity game coming at

48:14.800 --> 48:16.400
some point.

48:16.400 --> 48:21.160
And with that they kind of tease their first bit of information on that.

48:21.160 --> 48:26.480
Including these that Marvel Studios is going to be adding characters to the game.

48:26.480 --> 48:32.120
And so one of the characters that of course they show in there is Captain America.

48:32.120 --> 48:37.380
And so Marvel characters will be coming into Disney Infinity 2.0 which I'm guessing is

48:37.380 --> 48:41.360
coming out later this year.

48:41.360 --> 48:45.040
So I don't know.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.600
I guess that's just inevitable.

48:47.600 --> 48:53.680
And I'm sure we'll see some stuff for like Star Wars stuff soon in fact actually kind

48:53.680 --> 48:54.680
of a little Easter egg.

48:54.680 --> 49:00.240
If you did happen to be crazy enough to buy every single character for Disney infinity

49:00.240 --> 49:04.400
one of the items that unlocks at the very end is a light saber.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.600
Oh geez.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.880
They're just they're just teasing you now.

49:07.880 --> 49:13.480
So well you would think though if they win does episode seven come out is that next year.

49:13.480 --> 49:19.880
That's 2015 I think or set was it 15 this thing is 2015 but it's holiday right.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
Yeah.

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
Because they had to bump back the Warcraft movie.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.840
It's holiday.

49:23.840 --> 49:29.400
So I think I think Disney Infinity 3.0 will bring in the Star Wars characters because

49:29.400 --> 49:31.120
that's still a big thing.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.600
But I wouldn't be surprised if you see a little bit of teasing just to you know because the

49:34.600 --> 49:37.600
hype machine is going to start rolling in later this year.

49:37.600 --> 49:42.080
The first trailer think about it the trailer for episode seven you're going to see this

49:42.080 --> 49:48.100
Christmas think about it and it'll just be like 30 seconds of just a look just a little

49:48.100 --> 49:51.760
bit of wonder if it's going to be like you know was episode one where people would actually

49:51.760 --> 49:55.320
walk and just they'd go buy a ticket to the movie just to watch the trailer.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.640
What was it like the beach or something had the preview for her who does that actually

49:59.640 --> 50:03.080
nowadays because now they have the Internet I guess yeah and they have the Internet when

50:03.080 --> 50:06.920
that's the one we had the Internet but you didn't have really high speed and high speed

50:06.920 --> 50:09.220
and it was still colleges and things like that.

50:09.220 --> 50:15.240
So to see it on the big screen you know so there's no YouTube I'm excited about not Disney

50:15.240 --> 50:19.880
Infinity though because I already I already went down that path and not for me I'm not

50:19.880 --> 50:21.000
I'm too old.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.280
Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com is referencing actually

50:26.280 --> 50:31.540
some of our coverage from E3 2013 over at vognetwork.com because remember we had the

50:31.540 --> 50:35.000
whole thing where you could submit your questions and Bobby would ask them on the show floor

50:35.000 --> 50:37.880
at E3 which we're really hoping comes back this year.

50:37.880 --> 50:42.800
But anyhow one of the questions that got asked over Disney Interactive when Bobby was there

50:42.800 --> 50:44.500
got this response.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.480
As for other properties the game was designed specifically to be able to include properties

50:48.480 --> 50:50.060
that haven't been thought of yet.

50:50.060 --> 50:53.940
So Marvel and Star Wars are definite future possibilities.

50:53.940 --> 50:58.240
Now I think that was to tease us a little bit about the last game but I think we all

50:58.240 --> 51:03.040
knew they'd have to do something to make you want to buy 2.0 because they can't exactly

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
do swap force.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
Oh no.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.140
Well they've run out of everything.

51:07.140 --> 51:10.120
Everything is on disk as far as all the assets and stuff are on disk because you have to

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
buy the actual characters.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
Right.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.220
There's no DLC with that.

51:13.220 --> 51:15.800
So they've run out of stuff.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.320
I knew that they were going to be announcing a new game soon because the last characters

51:19.320 --> 51:21.880
came out at the beginning of this month or at the end of this month.

51:21.880 --> 51:26.720
The last characters came out this month so yeah.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.720
Well we'll see.

51:27.720 --> 51:31.280
It's going to be, it'll print them more money especially if they throw Marvel characters

51:31.280 --> 51:32.280
in there.

51:32.280 --> 51:37.760
Dark Sakura is the allure of Marvel enough to get you to get on board with Disney Infinity?

51:37.760 --> 51:38.760
No.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.760
Why not?

51:41.760 --> 51:45.240
I'm saving up for MacBook Pro.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.320
So in other words you don't need cheap little plastic figures.

51:47.320 --> 51:52.200
You'd rather have a good computer that you can look up pictures of cheap little plastic

51:52.200 --> 51:53.200
figures.

51:53.200 --> 51:57.640
To be honest I hardly have time to play the games that I have now.

51:57.640 --> 52:02.960
And I have no interest in, if I'm going to play a Disney game I'd like for it to actually

52:02.960 --> 52:08.920
be a good game and not just a marketing ploy for more money.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.080
Okay.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.640
Shots fired a little bit.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.520
I have heard mixed things on Infinity.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.960
I've heard some mixed things on it but some people seem to really enjoy it.

52:17.960 --> 52:21.560
They're welcome to enjoy it all they want to.

52:21.560 --> 52:25.640
Alright well another game that I'm sure many people will be enjoying and they're going

52:25.640 --> 52:30.040
to enjoy it a little sooner I think than we originally thought.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.920
Smash Brothers.

52:31.920 --> 52:34.640
The Nintendo Direct came out for Smash Brothers.

52:34.640 --> 52:38.040
They still did not reveal the name did they?

52:38.040 --> 52:40.440
They did not say what the actual name is.

52:40.440 --> 52:41.900
We've had Melee.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.940
We've had, what was the other?

52:44.940 --> 52:48.380
Well just Smash Brothers was the original.

52:48.380 --> 52:51.460
So maybe this one's going to be Punch in the Face.

52:51.460 --> 52:52.460
I don't know.

52:52.460 --> 52:55.260
Smash Brothers Punch to the Face.

52:55.260 --> 52:56.340
Smash Brothers Boot to the Head.

52:56.340 --> 53:02.460
There is Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U that are both coming this year.

53:02.460 --> 53:05.620
The 2015 delays thankfully proved to be false.

53:05.620 --> 53:10.400
And get this, Smash Brothers 3DS will arrive in the summer.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.880
It's going to be coming out this summer.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.320
Because they want you to buy both versions.

53:14.320 --> 53:19.840
Exactly and the minute I heard that I said, oh that is so fucking smart.

53:19.840 --> 53:24.360
Because if they release the Wii U one first and then the 3DS one later, I bet a bunch

53:24.360 --> 53:28.880
of people would buy it on Wii U but I'm not sure as many people would buy it on 3DS.

53:28.880 --> 53:32.200
But now that they're doing it this way, you're going to have tons of people getting on the

53:32.200 --> 53:37.240
hype with the 3DS version and then they'll also buy that Wii U version that they can

53:37.240 --> 53:40.840
play in tournaments and stuff later on in the winter.

53:40.840 --> 53:43.800
So that was one of the big pieces of news right there.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.320
Those two games will not come out the same day.

53:46.320 --> 53:52.440
They're going to be spaced out a little bit there so interesting.

53:52.440 --> 53:55.600
Also some new characters were announced for Smash Brothers.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.900
Yoshi was confirmed but I mean, you know, come on.

53:58.900 --> 54:01.360
No actual new characters is all returning stuff.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.360
Well, no.

54:02.360 --> 54:04.720
There is one new one because there was Charizard.

54:04.720 --> 54:10.160
Which Charizard was part of the Pokemon trainer last time but he was not his own character.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.280
I don't think he is his own character.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.960
I thought they were just talking about Pokemon.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
Nope.

54:13.960 --> 54:14.960
He is his own character.

54:14.960 --> 54:19.080
Charizard is his own character as is Greninja is now his own character which is a new.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.120
It's the Pokemon X and Y representative.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.220
It's Froakie's fully evolved form.

54:23.220 --> 54:26.320
So Greninja which caught a lot of people by surprise.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.560
Some people are thinking because of Greninja's appearance this means you're not going to

54:29.560 --> 54:32.960
be seeing any Lucario or maybe some of the other Pokemon.

54:32.960 --> 54:37.480
Some people are thinking Jigglypuff has been cut at this point because you have these other

54:37.480 --> 54:39.240
playable Pokemon.

54:39.240 --> 54:45.000
What's interesting about who is showing up is who is not showing up.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.580
Because there are still some characters we don't have confirmed.

54:47.580 --> 54:49.320
We do not have Ness confirmed.

54:49.320 --> 54:52.000
We do not have Captain Falcon confirmed.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.160
Game & Watch not confirmed.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.160
Falcon is going to be there.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.160
I mean, come on.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.160
It's like a staple.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.480
But when was the last time there was an F-Zero game?

54:58.480 --> 54:59.480
It doesn't matter.

54:59.480 --> 55:02.600
It's kind of synonymous with, you know.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.480
Well and hopefully Virtual Console.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.960
You know it's also pushing Virtual Console.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.080
Did they confirm Pit?

55:07.080 --> 55:09.640
I don't know if they did confirm him either.

55:09.640 --> 55:12.840
So I don't remember.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.520
I'm sure chatters will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.

55:15.520 --> 55:19.120
I thought that they showed Pit.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.120
Maybe.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.120
I don't know.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.120
I just know I was a fan.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
But yeah.

55:23.120 --> 55:26.080
I'm curious to see what that final roster looks like because it seems like there's a

55:26.080 --> 55:27.680
lot of characters they haven't confirmed.

55:27.680 --> 55:32.000
And I kind of think there's still one more third party character to come.

55:32.040 --> 55:37.400
Because we've heard the rumblings that Namco Bandai has been assisting with this, you know,

55:37.400 --> 55:38.400
the games.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.400
Oh good.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.400
Great Pac-Man.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
How could Pac-Man not be another character?

55:42.400 --> 55:46.600
If Namco is truly involved, Pac-Man as a character seems like such a given.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.400
Like it has to be a thing.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.720
I don't know how that would work.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.920
I've never thought of Pac-Man as much of a fighter like that.

55:51.920 --> 55:55.480
They'll have him as a stupid like Pac-Man in the Ghostly Adventures character.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.480
Yeah like the cartoon.

55:56.480 --> 55:57.480
The cartoon or whatever.

55:57.480 --> 56:02.160
Well, Pac-Man also shows up in the driving as well.

56:02.160 --> 56:06.960
And you might see Inky, Binky, Pinky and Clyde making an appearance.

56:06.960 --> 56:10.960
It would be cool if they had other characters like Dig Dug or something like that.

56:10.960 --> 56:11.960
Oh!

56:11.960 --> 56:13.440
Actually Dig Dug is a really good possibility.

56:13.440 --> 56:18.560
That would be hilarious to get to pump the characters up and watch them go boom.

56:18.560 --> 56:20.240
You know what I think they should do?

56:20.240 --> 56:21.240
Ridge Racer car.

56:21.240 --> 56:24.120
I know it's so out there but you know.

56:24.120 --> 56:28.080
Ridge Racer has not been on Wii U so that would be perfect.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.600
Ok Darktits Studio confirms that Pit is back after all.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.440
My bad, my bad.

56:32.440 --> 56:34.440
So there you go.

56:34.440 --> 56:40.200
And I did like how they said that they were going to not have like some of the costume

56:40.200 --> 56:44.840
changes or whatever for characters or that they were going to be there.

56:44.840 --> 56:45.840
Yeah!

56:45.840 --> 56:51.760
The Metroid Prime or Samus Zero suit will be, which is actually Metroid Zero Mission,

56:51.760 --> 56:52.760
sorry.

56:52.760 --> 56:56.280
It will be it's own character which is basically like they're not putting Bayonetta in the

56:56.280 --> 56:58.320
game but they're putting that in the game.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.720
And then they are doing Sheik.

57:00.720 --> 57:05.480
I don't know if you say controversial but a lot of people were not expecting Sheik and

57:05.480 --> 57:09.120
Zelda to be separated into two separate characters and that is something that's happening as

57:09.120 --> 57:10.120
well.

57:10.120 --> 57:14.720
Alright so I'm getting linked to the official roster of characters that is in the game.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.560
And I guess Lucario was confirmed.

57:17.560 --> 57:24.120
I swear Shane, I swear Shane told me that he was not in the game.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.280
He lied to me.

57:26.280 --> 57:28.120
Totally lied to me.

57:28.120 --> 57:31.440
But some of the other characters of course have been confirmed for the game.

57:31.440 --> 57:37.300
The Animal Crossing villager, the Wii Fit trainers, Rosalina, Megaman, Little Mac.

57:37.300 --> 57:41.640
So there are some really cool new characters that have been confirmed for the game.

57:41.640 --> 57:43.240
So and I guess Pit has been confirmed.

57:43.240 --> 57:46.740
I want the Excitebike dude.

57:46.740 --> 57:47.740
That would be it.

57:47.740 --> 57:48.740
That would be it.

57:48.740 --> 57:50.960
He fights with his motorcycle.

57:50.960 --> 57:53.640
Or the Unir- Yeah Rob, it's Lucario.

57:53.640 --> 57:59.820
They need to totally add the Uniracer unicycle, that'd be awesome.

57:59.820 --> 58:04.700
Or like the Stunt Race FX character.

58:04.700 --> 58:05.700
So many things.

58:05.700 --> 58:07.380
Yeah they're saying it's Lucario.

58:07.380 --> 58:11.940
Excuse, sorry, sorry Pokemon character I really don't give two shits about and don't play

58:11.940 --> 58:12.940
in the game ever so.

58:12.940 --> 58:16.540
Well I know they have like lots of Pokeballs now and they have the Master Pokeballs that

58:16.540 --> 58:19.860
are in there and I just don't care.

58:19.860 --> 58:22.740
Well and also there's kind of too many Pokemon at this point.

58:22.740 --> 58:26.860
Like if you're going to make that many Pokemon playable character just have a freaking Pokemon

58:26.860 --> 58:27.860
fighting game.

58:27.860 --> 58:30.500
They tried to do that remember?

58:30.500 --> 58:31.500
Well that's right.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.980
I still have a copy of Stadium.

58:34.980 --> 58:39.480
Alright well there was another Nintendo Direct this week and not just one dedicated to Smash

58:39.480 --> 58:44.340
Brothers but Tomodachi Life also got a Nintendo Direct this week.

58:44.340 --> 58:48.940
Now this is a series that's been out in Japan for a little while but Nintendo has said they're

58:48.940 --> 58:53.460
going to bring more titles kind of you know globally than they have in the past and so

58:53.460 --> 58:59.060
we're going to get Tomodachi Life in the US and Europe on June 6th.

58:59.060 --> 59:03.880
This game was that Life Simulator game there's a little controversy about it about a year

59:03.880 --> 59:10.780
ago or so when you were able to I guess through some type of exploit in the game have a gay

59:10.780 --> 59:14.020
relationship because you get married in the game and you have a gay relationship in the

59:14.020 --> 59:19.260
game and Nintendo ended up patching it out or I don't know they basically said that wasn't

59:19.260 --> 59:24.020
supposed to happen and it kind of made them look a little bit like they didn't you know

59:24.020 --> 59:28.020
but I think a lot was lost in translation with that I don't think necessarily Nintendo

59:28.020 --> 59:33.140
is trying to be like anti whatever whatever but I think they were just like no no like

59:33.140 --> 59:36.580
this was not you know something that was supposed to be happening in the game.

59:36.580 --> 59:42.340
They could pull a DC and say no one can get married and while they're at it no completely

59:42.340 --> 59:45.700
bash their female characters and writers.

59:45.700 --> 59:49.140
I don't think Nintendo wants to do that I don't think you want a lot of points you know

59:49.140 --> 59:57.660
what Tomodachi means hmm means friend oh that's nice that looked fucking weird yeah the whole

59:57.660 --> 01:00:05.220
direct was a little bit insane wasn't it a little bit that's cool going to our chat room

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.060
over at live.vognetwork.com Akuma JP is in our chat room and he of course is from Japan

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:15.660
and he says Tomodachi life was big a while but guess we got sick.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.420
So it sounds like it was something that we're finally getting something that was big in

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.500
Japan like a few years ago but they're already over it but now we're getting their sloppy

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.380
seconds so enjoy that happened seeming happened with the wind on and then they whitewashed

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:36.780
it and Para Para you really want to think about it all right let's move on Dark Sakura.

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:42.140
Well you know we discussed about the game spy going down this was be shutting down

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:48.100
with player services on May 31st so there's lots of games that are going to have no multiplayer

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.520
and there are 800 different developers and publishers that were using it including Capcom

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:59.540
Nintendo EA Epic Ubisoft and Konami.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:06.600
So I actually a question was asked of EA if they were going to be doing anything different

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.480
for their Battlefield franchises and something came out on Twitter saying we're working on

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.280
transitioning those games after the shutdown so you'll still be able to play them and later

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.060
on put out a statement says we're working on finding a transition but we still have

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.320
technical hurdles to overcome we will make an announcement when there is news to share

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.520
so they're trying to work on a work around and redirect for servers so that they can

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.800
get their games working.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.560
So I guess that's something good EA has done.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.440
Yeah that's hopefully some good news to come from that that they're able to get those games

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:44.600
working although you know I don't know I don't know how popular but I guess if it's like

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.540
we're talking battlefield and stuff those games are still pretty popular but I would

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.840
think they'd want to shift most people to the new one but if they can get their hooks

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.660
in and get them on origin then you know they can push all those ads for the new games so

01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:01.440
I guess that's that's incentive enough to do it try to sell people on the upgrades right.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.680
Well I'm just glad that at least they're addressing it you know.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.160
All right well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates let's see

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.200
what games are coming out that they might pull online support for in a year.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200
Loki what about here in the US?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.520
Well I hope it's not pulled in a year but Trials Fusion they have a disc version of

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.600
the game coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and you may be wondering why should I

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
buy it on disc?

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.880
Well it includes a season pass with it so it's 40 bucks.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.720
2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:42.600
Conception 2 Children of the Seven Stars on 3DS and Vita and that is it.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320
That's it.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320
Slow week.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.320
All right let's go over to Japan and we're gonna check out some of the releases over

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.960
there it doesn't look like there's anything really on PlayStation 4 Xbox One this week

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.360
because I know Final Fantasy 14 was the big release on PlayStation 4 but that just happened.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.840
So that takes us over to the PlayStation 3 and actually it doesn't look like they have

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.280
anything this week on the PlayStation 3 there's no releases until the 24th when we get games

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.040
like Muv Luv Photon Flowers.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.040
Muv Luv's back.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.040
There's a new Muv Luv game coming out next week so we'll talk a little more in depth

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.600
about that next week because that's on the 24th.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.160
But at least some of the other systems Wii U doesn't have anything this week either.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.800
They don't have anything till next week.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800
How about the 3DS?

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.400
Okay the 3DS has some things.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.200
Gaikuten, Saiban, 123, Naruhodou Selection.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.920
You know that is right?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920
No I don't.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.400
That's a Capcom.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.800
That's um, um, um.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800
Oh it's Ace Attorney.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800
It's all your game.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Yeah.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.760
It's Ace Attorney.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.360
So there's a new one of those coming out?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.320
I thought they were done with that series.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320
Apparently not.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320
Hmm.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.880
Oh no it says selection so maybe it could be a best of or something I wonder if it's

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.480
like a compilation or something like that.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.800
Well that is out in regular and limited edition on the 17th of April.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.520
Also Meitante Conan Phantom Rhapsody is out this week.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:15.800
Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode Yokubari Sengen Tokimiki Up comes out this week and that is

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.520
from Nintendo themselves.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.600
I've got to know what Wagamama Fashion is here.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.360
I guess it's, oh god, look at the box art for this game.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.640
It's very pink and it's this girl and she's holding a purse.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:38.180
That looks like the cover of every shoujo manga compilation that comes out ever.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.940
And it looks like it is just like a fashion design game.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:45.000
It's like Nintendogs but for fashion people.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.440
And instead of dogs and cats you dress people.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.000
Oh it even has loli style.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Okay I want it.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.840
I have a birthday next weekend.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.840
You don't want the Disney Animal Crossing game but you won't want the mama fashion.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840
No I want Tomodachi Life.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.840
Alright.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.640
That's not until June though.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640
Okay fine get me Disney.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640
Alright.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.160
Actually I still want Bravely You to Fall but hey.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.120
Oh I forgot that you didn't have that.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.840
That's okay I don't have time to play anything anyway.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.840
Make time.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.840
Just kidding.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.640
Alright that really does it for releases over in Japan this week so let's go to the UK.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.560
We have some stuff.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.460
On the 14th is Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn for PS4.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.960
On the 15th Mac's The Curse of Brotherhood.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.600
Pure Chess for PlayStation 4 and War of the Vikings on PC.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.840
On the 16th we have Sly trilogy.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.680
The 17th we have Hitman Go for iOS.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:48.240
We have a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil for Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.880
And The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 for PC.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.820
That is it.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.280
Some folks in chat by the way telling us some more information about the Phoenix Wright

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.980
game I talked about in Japan this week.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.560
It's Phoenix Wright 1, 2, 3.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:07.080
It's a re-release with slightly better graphics because it's on the 3DS now.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.960
Another remastering basically but this time a handheld game.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.600
There you go.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.760
I don't know if that is coming out over here in the states or not.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.560
I would hope so but not everything necessarily makes it over here.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.880
Alright just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880
Loki?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:35.380
Alright well unfortunately Sega Europe has seen some layoffs and apparently they said

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:43.260
a limited number of redundancies have been removed due to a restructuring of Sega America

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.860
Sonic and Mobile divisions.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:51.340
And they're saying they're in the process of consolidating certain functions of both

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.280
of those departments within Sega of America where the management and production for those

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.780
areas business reside.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:03.300
And as part of the strategy a limited number of redundancies have taken effect in our European

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:09.900
office based in London so that's too bad.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.340
That's never fun to hear about layoffs and you know when it's somebody cool like Sega

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.100
it makes it even harder to hear that so didn't they just go through some layoffs not that

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.100
long ago?

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.900
Well yeah I think what they're doing is because what they're probably doing is just trying

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:28.380
to cut the fat and so you know people have pretty much the same job position since they're

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.120
consolidating stuff.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:36.560
They're just removing those I guess those workers because they don't need them.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.360
I mean they're not releasing as many games anymore so yeah less bodies are needed.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.480
You know but they need those bodies to who's going to make Shenmue 3?

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.440
Well they need a lot of extra bodies too because who else is going to add all the extra leg

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.720
for you know Sonic?

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:57.760
Right alright let's see let's talk about the PlayStation Now beta because PlayStation

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.580
Now that beta is still going on.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:05.180
I haven't got to see it myself yet but some people I know are in it and I hear it doesn't

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.300
really work that great that you still get a lot of artifacting and there is a little

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:15.860
bit of a delay but I suppose that depends on where you are but maybe there will be some

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:21.780
improvements as we go to version 2.0 because version 2.0 is out and I think this is all

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.940
still under NDA but with as many people as are in this beta it's all it's all getting

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.260
out there and the news is getting out into the blogs and things like that so the update

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:35.860
was 42 megs and there are 19 games playable now in this new PlayStation Now beta that

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:42.300
includes things like Shadow of the Colossus, Dead Island, Payday the Heist, I think those

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.540
are all in the original one.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:49.500
I don't remember seeing Disgaea 4 before though or Dead or Alive 5 or Mat Hazard or Earth

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.180
Defense Force Insect Armageddon so that's.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.020
Who would play Mat Hazard?

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.260
That game was terrible.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.420
That's when it was like oh it's a video game character and he's become like self-aware

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:07.860
now and he's going back and fighting all of his old, you know, old villains from different

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.460
games and stuff and it was supposed to be all cheesy and funny but it was dumb.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.420
Well now it's worth pointing out that some games were removed from the first beta so

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:22.020
if you were trying to play more Ninja Gaiden 3 or Papo and Yo or Killzone 3 those games

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.740
were removed so they're mixing it around a little bit with PlayStation Now but apparently

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.540
you can still unlock trophies and things like that so that's cool.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.340
Well you can play Puzzle Quest Galactrix too.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.420
That's the one Puzzle Quest game that kind of flopped.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.620
It wasn't very good.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.180
Yeah they changed the whole formula from the match 3 and it didn't really work out the

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.460
same way it was just a different game.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.780
Whatever happened to that series Puzzle Quest?

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.620
There was one and two in Galactrix and then I mean they were out on every stinking platform

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.620
but we haven't really seen anything in that forever.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.620
It's taking a nap.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.620
I guess so.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.260
Kind of sad.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:01.620
Alright well let's go back to the past a little bit and check out some classic games in a

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.660
segment we call the Classic Game of the Week and yeah I used Plural tonight we're gonna

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:12.020
check out some classic games in tonight's segment because Dark Sakura when she dives

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.380
into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be playing this this week she

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.660
does things her way and if she wants to do more than one game she's gonna fucking do

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.660
it.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.020
Well I'm doing a trilogy they're all related to each other although the one I wanted to

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.060
focus on is the last game in the series.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.980
Alright fair enough so Dark Sakura what is the classic games of the week?

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:38.660
The classic games start with a particular game called Final Justice that came out in

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.500
1985 for the MSX.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:47.620
It's done by Pako Fujishima who also designed the sequel game Gartic.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:53.020
The game after Gartic that rounds out the trilogy is Blaster Burn which after having

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:59.500
played Blaster Burn it honestly is a really really really a superior game but I figured

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:04.820
I'd just go through a little bit of basic gameplay with Final Justice it really isn't

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:09.420
all that special to look at it's just kind of a fun generic little shooter but really

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:15.940
the whole thing to bring up for that one is the fact that it did spawn Gartic which as

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:22.260
we know Gartic spawned a favorite game of at least two thirds of us in the room.

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.300
Oh wait let me let me switch to the Gartic foot that was all you're gonna say on Final

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.020
Justice all right let me go to Gartic.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.420
Yeah cause Final Justice is kind of crappy.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.020
It was basic it was early 80s what you do okay yes Gartic.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:36.980
Now a lot of this music should sound familiar if I'm gonna turn it up just a little bit.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.980
Sound familiar?

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980
Yeah.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:48.620
Gartic is the one that spawned Gartic Gaiden which we got on the Nintendo as the guardian

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:56.020
legend so Gartic is a weird little game Gartic is you you're sort of like in this series

01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:04.820
of mazes and you go and shoot enemies on the screen of all of a particular type and then

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.860
you move on to the next room and you're just sort of navigating this maze where you stop

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:17.060
and shoot things it really is just a weird little game through Gartic you also can buy

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:22.940
your power-ups like extra speed you buy different weaponry and you choose these things before

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:32.860
each stage so it's sort of a very non-traditional kind of shooting game and as you go through

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:38.780
it you can sort of see where elements that it's it puts into practice were split into

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:44.420
the guardian legend you know it's sort of like they combine the corridor theory with

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.220
the shooter games and you know the guardian legend I think wasn't that like the first

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:53.940
game I ever reviewed actually no it wasn't one of the first one but it was it was early

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:58.860
on because it's a long-running joke quote-unquote on the show but it's not a joke it's truth

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:04.420
that that was what we believe to be the finest NES game they ever made which in it was it

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:09.340
and it was not really critically well reviewed when it came out so one of those things that

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:15.300
kind of aged better than a lot of NES games did but the the thing with that is that I

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:20.460
think that they might have realized that they were trying to pack in too much with this

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:24.340
game I didn't realize the blue lander was in this game yeah it's in here I see it in

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:29.780
a little video this is MSX graphics so it's not you know it's not the same but still but

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:36.400
um but yeah you know this was a really interesting game like I said it spawned a guardian legend

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:43.240
for us which you know for us that's a win-win now what's really what I think the best thing

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.240
well I'm gonna say the second best thing to have come out of this trilogy is the game

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:57.600
called a blaster burn blaster burn is a pretty traditional shooter where this game has good

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:04.600
music for the record where basically it's a you just go through it's a standard shooting

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:11.720
game you have your power-ups and you're actually playing this ship called the gardic 2 so it

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:18.720
is a true I think sequel to the gardic series they're kind of you know it can it's not quite

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.640
a bullet hell it's just a standard shooter but it's fun and offered some unique features

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.040
and on top of that the music and it was really good your power-ups were fun and it just has

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:36.040
a lot of the fun compile you know what was it was it that that feel of a compile shooter

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.240
without falling back to some of the same old traditions that were in other compile shooting

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.240
games and as you can see I mean we've got like pretty complex backgrounds for the MSX

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.240
yeah the graphics are a big step up from even gardic considering they were both on MSX yeah

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.840
but this one was the final one that came out in that trilogy now I'll rewind a little bit

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.840
and go back to gardic because I mentioned with my what if I've been playing this week

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.040
that I had another game that I've been playing and that actually is gardic I have that on

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:16.040
iOS so they actually did release gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you made it

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:22.240
gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you move around and you shoot stuff it's it

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:29.240
controls okay you know about as good as anything on iOS does you know for a shooter but you

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:36.280
know going through these games I really find it a shame that they didn't really see the

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:43.280
light of day over here especially blaster burn because it's it's just a fun little shooter

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:50.480
so I would say anyone if you have an MSX or have access to playing MSX games this is something

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.040
that you should definitely definitely check out you know play through gardic get the roots

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:05.040
for the guardian legend and if you don't own the guardian legend why but I think that everyone

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.040
at least if you love a good shooting game you need to play through blaster burn all

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:18.040
right so there you go oh I did have the years for those by the way sure go for it final

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:25.040
justice came out in 1985 and gardic came out you know I'm actually missing the year for

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:32.040
gardic but blaster burn came out in 1990 and that was the last installment in the series

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:39.040
I want to say gardic was 87 because I think guardian legend was 88 or 89 so yeah but I

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:46.040
mean these were compile games I mean they're really great so but and anyone who has you

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:54.040
know an iOS device and has a dollar just go get good by gardic right now do it do it because

01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:01.040
I said so all right well there it is your classic game of the week dark sakura picked

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:09.040
the final justice trilogy starting with final justice gardic and then blaster burn this

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:16.040
is a cool name too isn't it blaster burn and look at those boss fights it's pretty fun

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.040
all right I better close it up there because we're going to take a break and we're going

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:27.040

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040
more of orange lounge radio

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.040
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on april the 13th of 2014 episode 548

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.040
of our show already in progress and in part a we talked a little bit about we got a live

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.040
report from pax east in a moving vehicle going down 95 back home also from the fantastic

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:23.040
rama over at anime jam session also we talked a little bit about some of the things announced

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.040
at pax east including civilization beyond earth and we're gonna talk about some of the

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.040
other things that were announced a few of them here in this segment we call rapid fire

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:39.040
news right loki that's correct this is kind of cool there's a brand new borderlands game

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:45.040
that was just announced now it's not borderlands 3 but it's borderlands the pre-sequel so that

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.040
puts it in between one and two what's kind of different about this one is it's actually

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:54.040
going to take place not on pandora but on one of the moons of pandora and so with that

01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:02.040
you know there's no oxygen and you actually have to collect oxygen as well as you've you

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.040
have the ability to jump very far and you have jetpacks and stuff like that some of

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.040
the characters are going to be in it are actually characters that have been in all

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:19.040
the other borderlands games just kind of not necessarily cameos but they've got for example

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:26.040
athena which is a gladiator type class and she has like some sort of like a shield type

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:33.040
thing that she uses to bounce off damage and stuff and i want to say she was in one of

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:39.040
the expansions there i just can't remember which one but uh so they have her uh oh she

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:47.040
was uh she was in uh borderlands one and uh they have claptrap which got anybody that's

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:54.040
played uh borderlands knows who claptrap is uh he's a playable character in it also wilhelm

01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:02.040
from borderlands 2 and nisha um so it sounds like it's gonna be pretty interesting i think

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:07.040
it's supposed to be coming out later this year she was nisha was i guess a sheriff of

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:14.040
lynchwood in borderlands 2 uh athena was a former assassin and former crimson last lance

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:21.040
um who was in borderlands 1 wilhelm was one of the bosses in borderlands 2 and claptrap

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:29.040
well he's in everything so um i don't know looks very very cool uh you're supposed to

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:35.040
have i guess um you're gonna be working for captain or not captain jack for handsome jack

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.040
yes captain jack that's a whole different character he'll shag anyone i mean hi captain

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.040
jack mission one don't copy that floppy i was thinking of captain jack harkness thank

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:50.040
you mission two go left go right go pick up the circle okay like there's like three people

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:55.040
listening we're gonna get that joke all right so um yeah handsome jack says who you're working

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:03.040
for in that it's kind of his rise to power in this um this game here so uh interesting i very

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:09.040
very excited to check this out whenever it comes out i'm guessing probably later this year uh then

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:17.040
along with that atlas is funding a game they didn't quite get kick started it's called citizens

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.040
of earth and what's kind of cool about citizens of earth is it plays very much like i guess

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:30.040
earthbound and um sort of a game where you recruit a bunch of people and they have like uh

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:40.040
you know it looked it almost reminded me of the wonderful 101 but i think it's it's not exactly

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.040
gonna play out like that but they i guess they have maybe sort of like sui coden because they

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:50.040
have 40 different people that you can recruit in the game um and they're saying they're even

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:58.040
gonna create one uh the 41st one uh for the game i guess as a contest allowing fans to um design

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:04.040
that character and it's uh supposed to be in development for playstation 4 vita 3ds wii u and

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:12.040
pc and supposed to be out in september and then this is kind of a strange crossover but you

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040
remember that game dive kick well there's going to be a cameo from johnny gatt from the saints

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.040
rose series he's going to be a playable character in that and i guess that's supposed to be coming

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:28.040
i guess later on to the playstation 4 and xbox one versions more reason for people to dive and

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.040
kick yes as well as i guess the playstation 3 vita and steam ones um and of course the playstation

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:42.040
4 version and xbox one versions aren't out yet but i guess it was coming later on so pretty cool

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:48.040
um man see see that that would be well it wouldn't be exactly like saints row with the whole

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:54.040
um you know where you create your own characters and stuff but man playing a playable johnny gatt

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:58.040
saints row game would be pretty awesome though even if you couldn't create your own character

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.040
you never know they're they've got to announce something they've got to come ahead they're

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:08.040
gonna have something at e3 they need to reboot that series we'll see we'll see we'll see oh

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:12.040
all right well earlier in the show we talked about smash brothers so let's talk about the

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:18.040
cheap knockoff version of smash brothers playstation all-stars battle royale sorry was that was that

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.040
statement too truthful for some of you sorry well there is some news to report on playstation all

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:28.040
stars battle royale even though it's boop boop i don't think it's even being sold anymore it's

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.040
just right i don't know it's off shelves did they finally just give it away in playstation plus i

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.040
don't think they ever did just give it away did they i don't know well whatever here's the thing

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.040
if if you if you're a big fan of playstation all-stars battle royale first i'm really sorry

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.040
for what i said but second you're going to get a new patch uh that's going to do a hundred percent

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.040
balance tweaking lots and lots and lots of balance between that's pretty much all the patch does

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:55.040
uh so uh the throw system in the game has been overhauled you can manually disengage a timed

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:01.040
super move double jumps can no longer be changed so you can get a new patch you can get a new

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:07.040
double jumps can no longer be chained off of certain types of attacks and certain recovery

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.040
animations and so forth also alternate costumes for isaac and zeus which were the dlc expansion

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.040
pack the graveyard pack uh it's currently on sale through april 24th for only a dollar 99

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.040
if you missed out on these characters somehow if you you know haven't played the game in over

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.040
nine months like most people i gotta be honest i'm surprised that they had an update for this at

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.640
all because this game came out like two years ago i don't think there's really been an update

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.400
in like a year on this um could it be one of those out of the blue things could it be that they're

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.560
doing a new game but like maybe it wouldn't be you know a purchase game maybe free to play or

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.320
something yeah are they gonna are would they go up against smash brothers with a free to play game

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.480
that would be a pretty ballsy counter move especially considering the first game was kind of

01:24:53.280 --> 01:25:00.720
well it was there i don't i don't think it was bad i don't i didn't play it but it looked fun

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.520
well it looked fun but well some of these balance issues might actually help out quite a bit

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:14.640
actually so i don't know hey you know what diablo 3 was saved with the patch like a year and a half

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.200
after the game came out i don't know anything is possible maybe a bit a bit of like an elitist

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.840
here but like with all like the talk of pokemon and stuff and all the new pokemon that they're

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.920
adding to smash bros it just kind of made me like yeah i don't really care you know it's just

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.680
i don't know there's a lot of nintendo stuff i just don't give a shit about yeah if we lost

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:42.560
ness so we can get greninja not happy sorry about it if you disagree but not happy like there was

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.560
enough damn pokemon in the game or you know char char has been in the game before come on

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.560
the pokemon trainer last time around remember you get three different pokemon why couldn't they

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:58.560
just bring the pokemon trainer back with three different pokemon oh it's just just not possible

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.080
for whatever reason uh let's see however in the nintendo camp there's some other games to look

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:09.440
forward to including nes remix 2 which looks like it's going to be all the things you loved about

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:15.680
nes remix 1 but this time with actually good games that we remember from the past so no more

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.840
golf an urban champion and all that crap but it looks like there's going to be some actually

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:26.240
pretty awesome games and there's also going to be a new 1990 nintendo world championship mode

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.000
which we talked about previously on the show but there are some more details there um super mario

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000
brothers is one of the three games in in the mode as it was in 1990 but now it will be mario brothers

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.360
3 and dr mario will be the other games and what will happen is that you'll do three successive

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:49.120
score based challenges to get a total score these scores can also go over to me verse and that's

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.800
how you can you know show off your ep and all your friends and all that however you have to own the

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.480
first nes remix game to get championship mode in nes remix 2 because uh super mario brothers was

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:06.960
in the first game so so terrible that they can't get rad racer i know but it wasn't it wasn't an

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.880
nes game or if it wasn't it wasn't a nintendo game it was a square game squaresoft back in the day

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.880
before they did final fantasy hey you know what i'd be totally 100 fine with square bringing

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.560
rad racer back i know it would be that would be kind of awesome that would be fucking awesome

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.720
especially with the hyper realistic graphics they do in like final fantasy 13 15 and stuff uh let's

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:37.120
see uh some of the games to look forward to an nes remix to kid icharis kirby's adventure metroid

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.280
see the good stuff you remember from nes good times that'd be exciting too bad tetra tetra

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.440
so i don't think nintendo can make tetris games anymore that would include the old stuff i don't

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.200
know all right now uh some news has come out about a game that was cancelled at lucas arts

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.680
when that company was shuttered and uh this is kind of surprising because it was a nintendo title

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:05.840
for the wii u the nintendo 3ds and the original wii and that was a darth maul game it was going

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.400
to be a game all about darth maul and kind of his backstory and so forth this game was actually

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.400
i'm sorry it wasn't cancelled when lucas arts was shuttered it was cancelled in 2011

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.120
so the game never did come out uh the main character was darth maul in the game

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:25.040
and red fly was doing the development and uh it was going to be a multi-platform release at one

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.840
point and um nintendo didn't want to make it a first party project i guess at one point uh but

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:36.080
the game was supposed to explore the origin story of mal's transformation into a sith lord it was

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:41.680
going to be a stealth action game george lucas had actually changed the direction of the game

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.760
so sounds like did he yeah i know right that probably let's be honest that's probably what

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.800
ended up ruining you know i'm glad that you made a game about darth maul but i think jar jar binks

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.480
needs to be in this somewhere now now jar jar binks is in star tours and that's actually the

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:05.280
best part so there like i said things can get patched years after the fact to make them better

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.960
it happens once in a while all right dark sakura what do you have over there doesn't happen enough

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.160
you should have you can't patch my childhood rob you should have flung your meatloaf at

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.640
george lucas when you had the chance i should have well here's other things that can be flung

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.800
how about the stuff in cat lateral damage which i still want to play game of the year contender

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:33.440
right here well it actually did um win the people's choice in indie prototype awards

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.600
for the 2014 mass digi game challenge and so right now it actually has been announced as part

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.920
of the fire hose games accelerator slash incubation program so that means that it will get the much

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:52.240
needed help it does to be out there and available for more people to play also um ea sports is

01:29:52.240 --> 01:30:01.920
resurrecting the dead they've teased their mystery fighter is bruce lee and um i didn't realize bruce

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:09.600
lee did ufc apparently not well they brought him back from the dead so we have zombie digital bruce

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:16.960
lee kicking people in the face um however if you have pre-ordered i hate that word pre-order if you

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:26.720
have ordered the game then you get him as a day one unlock and then last but not least um sony

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:33.760
has confirmed of another remaster who last of us is getting a remaster treatment for ps4

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:41.680
um they have a release window of summer 2014 and yeah let's say that's the list what list

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:47.120
of games that are being remastered oh yeah for real well this one was rumored for a long time

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:53.680
and then they finally came out and said it's happening and we're all like no shit you know

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.440
this makes me really happy i skipped it on playstation 3 it was one of those games i

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.400
always meant to get around and play and i never did but now i'm like oh

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.560
well see i knew all along that would happen

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.720
you know what i was gonna say uh you know kind of going back to the whole ea sports eoc thing

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.000
the game looks really good as far as like you know the presentation the visual stuff on it

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
i really wish that like they would just make like a good arcade style fighting game because they

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000
have an engine that can really pull it off but you know they use it for all the simulation

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:36.080
boxing and ufc and i guess they tried it with def jam icon but yeah back to the ufc thing

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.760
sure because we have some comments in our chat room at live i think it's tacky i think it's

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.480
fucking tacky yeah i was like we're gonna put bruce lee in it so that we can get more money

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:50.160
because everyone wants to be bruce lee no it's fucking tacky everybody doesn't want to be bruce

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:55.280
lee i mean here's the comment in the chat at live.com tiger claw says bringing in bruce lee

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.680
in the ufc is kind of an unfair fight he will beat everyone well this is true but it's still

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:05.360
fucking tacky yeah you know it's like for example i put it along the same lines that they did the

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.320
audrey hetburn commercials those were it was a really cool commercial the cg was very well done

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:21.120
i still thought that it was kind of tacky you know using the image of a dead person to promote

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:26.960
you know your chocolate or your whatever you know i think that

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.280
he at least should have his own game well that's actually what dungeon buster says in our chat

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.920
room at live.vognore.com dungeon buster says bruce lee still needs a good game maybe him and

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:43.360
ufc might be as good as we can hope for at this point that bruce lee game for the xbox was just

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.000
um and then nemesis 47 says the bruce lee game on the super nintendo was decent ish

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.560
so i mean this isn't bruce lee's first time being adapted in a video game but i would like enter the

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:59.360
dragon the game i just think now you know a game dedicated to bruce lee that that would be cool

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.280
bringing back for ufc that's just tacky how about a game dedicated to brandon lee

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:12.480
then again oh yeah that'd be awesome then again and see this is where you want to talk tacky

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.960
let's talk about the fact they're remaking the crow excuse you no excuse all that no excuse for

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:24.640
that as if the sequels weren't bad enough but okay and this has been brought to my attention

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:30.160
to not in chat but earlier today like um dan has been talking all up and down about the

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.920
wrestlemania 2k14 which granted looks really cool it recreates like some of the classic

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:44.080
matches some of the people in the game they're dead however they were part of that genre they

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.280
were wrestlers you have macho man in there now ultimate warriors dead but you know i did watch

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.520
the commercial he did for the game it was pretty funny is andre the giant in there i loved him i

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.840
think andre the giants in there even if you didn't like wrestling you loved andre the giant because

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.640
you probably love the princess bride if you hate wrestling and the princess bride get out of my

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.240
world you're just that person who doesn't have fun at anything you're probably you you probably

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.280
don't like video games either so i doubt you're listening to this show to be honest

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.200
what was what was it that pat and oswalt said you're gonna hate everything and die angry

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.520
is that a song no it was it was one of his a stand-up comedy but i mean but bruce lee

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:32.320
did never did ufc i don't even know if he would like the concept of ufc

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:39.920
i mean it's different for i don't know i just i totally i think it's tacky that's me uh now

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:44.480
some folks agree with you in chat about the enter the dragon game but tiger claw suggests game of

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.360
death game of death would be awesome and dungeon buster says a lot of fans would love that or game

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:56.720
of death uh and nemesis 47 confirming that andre is in wwe 2k14 you know you know what i need to

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:05.120
get have a bruce lee movie night and just watch game of death and just game of death uh gamer girl

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.720
says i don't really like wrestling but i love princess bride does that count no absolutely it

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.760
counts no i said i said you you you even if you don't like wrestling you love andre the giant

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.000
because of the princess bride well how's this for funny now that we're bringing up the princess

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.560
bride what well you know how awesome julian is yes becky's son yeah he was born with an extra

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.160
thumb yeah he had six fingers on his right hand i know that's great so we can just say you know

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.840
good thing that that was taken care of or else he could go around murdering people with sword

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.560
and aniga montoya might come from and he's too young to be murdering people not until he's 14

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.600
and i know becky's listening so becky tell julian not to murder anyone until he's at least 14

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.000
and then to do it with a really pretty sword but never the guy that made the sword because then his

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.560
son will come after him and that'll be all kinds of a nightmare and i will have to just get in

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.840
between that and go no well if becky is listening hey becky hey she was listening earlier we were

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.240
talking about all the mass effect wank oh good and said she wants to be on a mass effect wank show

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.760
good good because actually which is funny because when i brought up thane earlier in the show i

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:17.200
thought of becky like it's that like it is like becky's thane wank is so strong i now associate

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:28.720
the two so thane wank well anyway see she she sells the the uss uh green lizard what was what

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.720
was i going to say i i got on a tangent about gamer girl's comment here oh yeah i don't really

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.600
like wrestling but i love princess blight here's the thing i don't obsess with wrestling but i

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:43.440
don't i don't even go so far to say i like wrestling but i don't hate it and i get why

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.600
people like wrestling because it soaps for men it's it is it's a testosterone version of doubt

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:56.160
and abby when you look at it how different are the two of them really except maggie smith doesn't

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.520
exactly maggie smith is not dropping a pile driver on the rock but god it would be so fucking awesome

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.560
if she did i love maggie smith how about a doubt and abby fighting game i want to see maggie smith

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:12.240
in ufc 2015 she's gonna have the purse with the brick with a brick in it better yet ben de la crème

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:20.000
as maggie smith let's see i want to i you know what sucks is it it's my birthday coming up and

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.960
i want to get this game for dan just so i can do create a wrestler mode okay okay there's something

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.960
i had to talk about this russell mania 2k14 that is the best feature of the game all right wrap it

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.280
up and then we're going to the frugal question yes all right well you know how the shows have

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.800
like their own storylines and everything and this rivalry with that person and and oh girl did you

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.240
hear what the rock did you know oh girl gold dust was in the gym the other day and you wouldn't

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.800
believe yeah it's that kind of stuff well you can make up your own is there a podcast where

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.560
drag queens talk about wrestling oh my god this should be a thing this should be a thing

01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:01.760
knock down drag out wrestling oh my god and then i saw the undertaker come up and i was like oh

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:11.360
girl no she better don't i could not even so anyway you can loki you even you would have to

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.280
listen to this i think right you don't like wrestling or drag queens but i just thought

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:21.520
i don't like drag queens i just in this way i don't want to watch wrestling and i i don't

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.960
know if i'd really want to hear i mean if i had the if i had to have a choice between you know

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.040
comment you know listening to commenting from the people that actually officiate you know the

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.120
wrestling stuff or drag queens i'd probably pick drag queens that's that's that's that's a fair

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:41.840
that's just like would you rather watch twilight breaking dawn part one or would you rather watch

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:49.120
twilight breaking dawn part one with rift tracks exactly can i finish my point yes please anyway

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:56.960
the wrestlemania 2k14 has a create your own storyline mode and yeah becky says that julian

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.640
thinks we're very silly and she says hearts rob so back see even becky's interrupting me what the

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:14.400
fuck becky hi i mean hi um anyway and julian never say that at school so anyway um you can create

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.280
your own storylines you know with dialogue and everything you can have different events happen

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:28.160
and someone redid the did one called vince russo takes over the wwe and vince russo was the guy

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:38.080
who was responsible for degeneration x and all of the really just wanky era of you know early 2000s

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:44.160
late 90s wrestling so it's actually the funniest thing i've ever seen is the vince russo takes

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.840
over for a day because it parodies everything that's wrong with wrestling and that is the

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:57.360
reason to have this game is just to download vince russo's day i can't stop thinking about

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:05.600
drag queens commenting on wrestling i'm sorry you can actually make drag queens in wwe 2k14 yes

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.680
you know what mr peanut they made mr peanut they actually had a wrestling challenge in an episode

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.840
of rupaul's drag race now that i think about it i think it was a couple seasons ago anyway

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.520
aha someone gets it john cena versus mr peanut yes i am not the only one who has seen this

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.640
it is the funniest shit i have ever i was cracking up and normally i was like dan's watching another

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.960
game you know youtube he's not playing it he just oh my god it's mr peanut uh pretty funny dark

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.960
tetsuya in our chat says down abby wrestling hey there's our next dream game um yeah i would

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:46.000
support that as well our dream game down abby wrestling yes you know i liked the undertaker

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.320
better when he was in the whole biker thing now that he's gone back to the undead thing is just

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.640
so unrealistic oh and i don't understand how did the undead just come up and wrestle

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:05.920
but they're dead what about absolutely what about absolutely fabulous wrestling wrestling all right

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:12.240
we need to move on rapid fire news taking over i'm just glad somebody else's has seen what i'm

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:18.240
talking about are you officially done are you can you officially not even anymore unspent

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.920
then let's get to the frugal question of the week

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.720
take facebook and you take google and you slam those words together and you get frugal

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:42.400
and we ask a question of our fan communities over at facebook.com orange launch radio and

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.240
google.com plus orange launch radio we ask questions of our fan communities there every

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.960
week and this week is all about the remastering of games that we were mentioning a minute ago

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.720
after much speculation it was confirmed this week that the last of us is being remastered

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:04.240
and re-released on the playstation 4 is there a game from the last era of consoles like 360

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.520
playstation 3 we that you'd like to see remastered for the new era of consoles like the one the

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:15.840
playstation 4 that we do or do you think these remasterings are cash grabs whose resources could

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:24.560
be better spent somewhere else let's get to some of the answers tonight um actdef starting us off

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:31.840
with a haiku our favorite form of answer i will always read a haiku actdef says hd remakes good

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.960
but only if they offer new stuff in the game

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.360
very good very good uh scott g on google plus says left for dead 2 please you know what though

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.720
if you're gonna go for left for dead 2 why not why not hold out for a left for dead 3

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.240
would you really want a left for dead 2 remake over a left for dead 3

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.400
i mean i guess that could be said for a lot of these games though

01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:00.560
uh let's see uh we go to redertainment who says no any re-release of a 360 ps3

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.480
game is a blatant cash grab and would make me wonder loudly why they can't just make

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.200
the new consoles backwards compatible besides i still have the previous generation of consoles

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.200
in perfect working condition and can buy games for those consoles quite expediently

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.520
that being said ask me this question again in a couple years my opinion might change

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:25.040
um travis h says personally i don't know if the gaming devs have ran out of ideas too lazy or not

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.280
enough funds to create new titles i think we've lived in the heyday of gaming as 30 and 40

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.920
somethings that being said a game that came out less than a year ago is nothing more than a cash

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.720
grab i'm playing through the last of us right now and have no means whatsoever to spend another 60

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.880
40 or 20 to buy it again for my playstation 4 that's right even if it was 20 bucks they can

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:51.840
keep it i think the playstation 3 version of the game is as beautiful as is you gotta wonder is

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:59.440
this game really targeted for people who only missed or who didn't own playstation 3 and missed

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.840
it completely yet they have a playstation 4 because ps4 is selling so well i don't know

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:12.320
let's go to some of the answers over on facebook um renee uh answers and says remastered games i'd

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:19.200
love to see uh bayonetta on playstation 3 no more heroes on the wii no more heroes 2 on the wii and

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:25.360
samba de amigo on the wii yes silly i know but it was fun but that in turn if you think about

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.320
it was a remastered game for the generation before so you would be making a copy of a copy

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.160
at that point although samba de amigo is worth it samba de amigo is a good good time uh let's see

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:42.160
andy r says valkyria chronicles yes that would be a great one actually uh ronnie b says i think it's

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:48.880
silly to remaster a game instead why not make a sequel with more improvements awesome unicorn

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:54.080
if a game is going to be remastered my main hope would be that it would give the game a chance that

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.360
it didn't have the first time a game that seems like a prime candidate is xenoblade chronicles

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.760
the game is a masterpiece that many people overlooked simply because they had already

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.160
moved on from the wii or because they claimed that the graphics simply were not good enough

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.960
to them that's a great candidate by the way i i actually really really agree with that answer

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:20.720
good job um let's see uh rod l replied and said there needs to be enough of a gap in the tech

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.800
to make the remake noticeable for example final fantasy 10 and 10 2 the last of us is too recent

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.760
to make it a valuable purchase for anyone who picked it up already that said a skyrim remake

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.800
might be awesome especially considering how broken that game was on playstation 3 and have a good

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.400
show well thank you you know most people don't sign off saying have a good show or you know hope

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:48.080
your day is super so thank you very much i appreciate that thought uh our buddy captain

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.960
spike from the game buoy.org podcast we love those guys over game boy and let me take this

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:59.280
opportunity to shout out game buoy on a happy two-year special because they hit two years

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.760

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.280
but happy episode 50 to uh captain spike and first mate slidekick yay

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.480
now captain spike says i'd kill for playstation 4 remasters of infamous one

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:22.720
two and festival of blood uh let's see our pal delvin from the show video game realness and

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:27.280
that's a really fun show if uh you want to hear some sassy commentary on video games out of

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.320
toronto video game realness is your show and delvin says remastering a game less than a year

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.560
old i.e tomb raider and now the last of us an absolute cash grab it's ridiculous just release

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.920
them all at the same time when it's so soon and i guess since i'm shouting out other podcasts i'll

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.040
shout out koopa club and ian from that show answered as well and ian says i double dipped

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:53.680
on tomb raider but i don't plan to on the last of us the story was great but the gameplay isn't

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:59.200
worth it to me to go through again i like my powerful females better anyway i want to see

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:05.600
final fantasy 12 get the hd treatment or for some reason skyward sword yes yes yes to final

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:10.800
fantasy 12 that's like the one reason i want final fantasy 10 to sell really really well is i really

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:17.040
want fantasy 12 to get another release and another chance because when final fantasy 12 came out like

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.840
this like right around the same time the xbox 360 did it just yeah it was lost a little bit

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.960
and that game is so good and the battle system is so good like oh my god i so agree i so agree

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:32.160
all right lastly nemesis 47 says i may get this on the playstation 4 given this game will have

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.840
all the ps3 dlc expansions included and it's updated for the power of the playstation 4

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.240
since the last of us is a clever and epic game and in a way it's kind of the game of year edition

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.080
as for what game i want to see updated from the last gen i'd love to see the guilty gear

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:51.600
franchise or even blaze blue updated in hd on the playstation 4 as long as we get new content such

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:56.640
as characters more story or even more content than the same game we played millions of times

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.240
maybe even a batman arkham game would be awesome on the playstation 4 as well well there's gonna

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.640
be a batman arkham game on yeah there's gonna be the new one is now on playstation 4 right so

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.680
you have that to look forward to all right so those are some of the answers from our facebook

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:15.440
community please visit our community to read the rest of them because there's some other answers

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:22.880
they're worth your time facebook.com orange lounge radio uh quickly you guys thoughts on games from

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.800
the last gen that should be updated or should they stop this practice all together final

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.760
fantasy 7 final fantasy 7 now you're going back a few generations but i suppose for final fantasy

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:40.560
12 you're going back a few generations as well so we should accept that answer too because it's it's

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:48.000
long since time i mean uh and if i'm gonna go to that same era then i'm gonna say new jumping

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.040
flash as well bring back jumping flash why not because the closest thing i have to jumping flash

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.640
is robot uh drunken robot pornography um i am gonna absolutely agree with the listener who

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.520
said xenoblade chronicles i think that's a great choice as is uh you know what again because the

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:10.160
game was horrifically underrated lost odyssey i want to see that redone although that will never

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.960
happen how about a lost odyssey 2 throw me a freaking bone here i need to go back and finish

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:19.360
that game it was first i need to find the disc for that game and then i need to go back and

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:23.840
do you want to borrow mine i have mine somewhere but once again also i still have to finish final

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:31.520
fantasy 13 the first one yeah and i kind of don't want to so but that's any that because i finish

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.640
all my final fantasy games there's not this is the first 12 12 was a long one i didn't play 12

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.640
oh shame shame what about a game for you that you would remaster um twist them all black

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:49.200
um you were really into that simil was really terrible yeah i hear they just try to do too

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.600
much weird stuff but like just take the older ones and make them really cool looking don't do

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:02.640
anything fancy just you know new new levels new characters done don't don't try to add mechs or

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:09.440
blimps or helicopters none of that shit made any sense just new characters new maps that's all you

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.080
have to do why don't they just realize it's all you need to do new characters new maps done

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.880
something just occurred to me i'd like to see the grandia series remade

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:25.440
oh like make make it have all the good music and all the cool stuff that the saturn version had

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.800
but bring everything up to date you know touch up the keep it sprite based even i don't care

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:36.320
i just want to see you know better music you know the music remastered the levels you know touched

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:42.560
up and be as expansive as it was on the saturn rather than the kind of crappy uh rendition the

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:48.160
playstation got and then bring out grandia 2 or if we're just going to go to fan wank here i would

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:53.680
love to see a version of legends of link to the past um done in the style of legends all the wind

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:59.280
waker but i'm not talking about like a top down game i'm talking about full 3d zelda game where

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:04.400
i can pan that camera around wherever i want the hint of it you get in oh that pissed me off like

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:10.640
what the hell this could have been this and instead you're just like ah fucking flood

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.000
the shit you know it's like i was like what the hell yeah exactly that's what i'd want to see

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.360
spoiler for a years old game uh anyhow uh the other thing i was going to say uh raginator in

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.320
chat brings up a really good point i do want to move on from this topic this is a really good

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.400
point about a very important component we're missing in the equation and raginator in chat

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:34.240
at live dot com says we already have final fantasy 7 and 8 on steam and i have both but

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.280
now we need to get the rest of them we are leaving pc out of the equation when we talk about these

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:43.760
remastering how does pc fit into all this because when you're talking about grandia my mind went to

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:49.440
oh yeah i played the ease uh remakes that are on steam on pc and they're really good so yeah

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:57.600
it was surprising we had you know the east got the remakes and not you know other games that

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:01.680
i mean as in the east series they're all great don't get me wrong yeah but the fighting is so

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.720
weird in that game now by today's standards like the fact is like bump bump jump i wish

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:12.320
they would bring the uh was it the four remake um to steam you know the one that they did with

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:17.360
all the extra dlc stuff that they had on we and stuff remember that i wish they would bring that

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:23.440
back in also the remake yeah i don't know if i want the remake of six but i like six i think

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.320
the original four remade the four remake on honestly on the psp was like the best one that's

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.920
what i'm saying yeah like that this is great all right uh let's move on we're getting we're getting

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.840
hung up a little bit on the remakes thing and we want to have time for your call so let's move on

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.480
with some more news loki all right um so this is kind of neat there's an yet another game that

01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:52.000
harmonix is announcing and not the you know they like to do games with uh you know any sort of

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.480
rhythm based elements in there and this new one is going to be um a game called record run

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:04.320
it's i guess they said it's like a rhythm runner and it's coming to mobile platforms uh it sounds

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:12.560
a lot like the uh bit trip games but um they're saying that it's going to use i guess um your

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:19.680
music as a way to generate you know obstacles and stuff so kind of like bit trip meets like uh

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:26.400
vib ribbon or something like that um i don't know so that sounds kind of cool

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.440
uh this is the game that zaku was talking about a little bit in that phone call in the beginning

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.520
of the show right i think so yeah sounds like uh it sounds like it uh it looks to be pretty cool

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.080
and it's it's nice to see some of the other stuff harmonix is working on now now we have an idea

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:47.920
what life is like after rock band and uh you know well although you know this this isn't in

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:52.240
the show role per se but i do distinctly remember reading an article about a comment was made

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:56.560
that rock band and dan central are not gone that they're just they're slumbering but they're they

01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.920
would like to see those games come back for the you know these new eras of consoles that we have

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.800
i think we just have to figure out what to do different and how to add how do you add to that

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.840
how to convince me to buy new peripherals all the freaking over again like if that you don't

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:16.240
need new peripherals for run you know dance center well if they well that's essentially you don't and

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:22.720
then for uh come to think of it yeah for um it was all usb on playstation 3 right so they could

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:29.360
technically support all that which they were they should if they were smart although some of those

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:36.720
were wireless so that would be kind of a no-no type thing um but if you had the wired ones i

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:43.680
would hope that they'd still support that stuff right i don't know all right well uh i'm looking

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.720
forward to checking that out when it comes out and uh it sounds like it's uh very affordable

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:57.440
yeah so all right um some interesting changes at pax east and you know i forgot to ask rama

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.640
about how that diversity lounge thing oh yeah is that the first time that they did that this year

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.120
yeah i was curious about what that was what that all entailed because i haven't seen a lot of

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:13.440
reports on that but i have heard about some of the other um uh things that are that were interesting

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.880
uh happening at pax east for example um there were bag search stations so every entrance into

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.040
the boston convention center you had to get your bag searched which is actually a standard security

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:30.560
protocol they do it at e3 as well if i remember right they do it at e3 yeah yeah and also you

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.320
know since it is in boston i mean not too long ago we have the whole boston you know bombing

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:41.520
things so i'm sure that they're still on edge a little close to home yeah and you know most people

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:44.400
are like you know they understand you know if you're going to go to a big place that there's

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.600
a lot of people you understand they do it at disneyland they do it you know they do it anywhere

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:53.280
there's going to be a whole lot of people uh there so there is that uh what is also interesting a

01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:00.240
last minute request from the city was to change some of the bathrooms at the convention center

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.320
because and this was a request of the city and this is important because you know unfortunately

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.840
pax has not had the best reputation in the past with some of its you know the creators of penny

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.560
arcade and some of their views on things so it's important to note that the city requested that

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:21.040
because of the number of people in the building and the fact that it skews male 65 35 they had

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:28.320
to convert some of the restrooms so some of the women's restrooms became men's restrooms so they

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:35.440
changed that uh so that's what they did um and they wanted to what uh actually one of the creators

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.000
of the con was a little confused because he was like did we have problems last year no

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.240
and he actually asked if they could change six women's restrooms into gender neutral rooms that

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:52.800
could be used by either gender and the city actually said no about that so uh very uh

01:56:52.800 --> 01:57:01.360
interesting uh changes at pax east so that's kind of an auto request i mean i understand i guess i

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.320
get it but some of the things i'm hearing is that because of the change some women were really

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:10.640
inconvenienced because they couldn't use the bathrooms closest to them they had to go clear

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.560
a clock across the floor to go to the one that wasn't converted and if i was the woman there at

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.640
the show i'd be a little bit frustrated i think i think it would be hard for me to go oh well i

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:24.720
understand in the moment that this convention is mostly men when i'm already feeling under yeah

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.560
exactly they're not gonna think oh the city requested that they're just gonna think oh well

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.360
they're just being dicks and they don't care about women so jamie you know i've got to ask

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.760
you your thoughts on this being the woman on our panel here do you think it was fair of the city to

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:47.040
ask pax east to change some of those restrooms when okay excuse mail i wasn't there i mean

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.760
well we did go to pax a few years ago so you've been to something similar yeah i

01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:58.000
i wouldn't have changed him honestly because just in my experience we have to pee more often

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.360
i mean seriously i'm not even making up anything there i have noticed that i typically have to

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:10.960
pee more than my male co-workers do um so i think if they were already because the whatever the

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:18.320
convention center is supposed to be is set for a particular standard for average use am i correct

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:25.280
so then all of the restrooms should have stayed the way they were all the anime cons i've gone to

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:28.880
have stayed the way they were when i've gone to classic gaming expo they've stayed the way

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:34.640
they were when we went to pax i didn't see any bathrooms being converted there and i ran into

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:41.680
more guys everywhere that i cared to see you know but i'm saying you know it's

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:50.480
get over your male privilege um now going to other convention news real quick i wanted to

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.760
throw this out there because this was some news that was kind of late breaking today

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:58.480
but uh some tweets from the folks behind gamer x which is the convention that you know we've

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.160
talked a lot about on this show because i went last year and i had a great time i'm dragging

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:06.720
dark sakura with me this year if if loki didn't have the baby at home i'd probably make him go too

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:11.920
but uh we're gonna go to gamer x this year uh well they've actually come out and said on twitter

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:17.360
this is gonna be the last year of gamer x um which is yeah it's kind of it's it's sad i mean

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:20.880
i understand it from a financial perspective if they're not making money on the convention

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.240
then they're not going to continue to do the convention i get that but just from the standard

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:30.640
of i really liked having this convention um i'm very disappointed to see it go and wish we could

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:36.400
somehow stick around i think i think they're really challenged with getting the perception

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.360
out there and it's really important to know so allow me to state this explicitly for folks

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:49.200
gamer x is not a convention just for gay lesbian transgender you know the quilt bag the whole

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:55.760
spectrum gamer x is not just a place for that gamer x is a place for everybody that you know

01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:02.000
brings light and attention to some of these you know issues and most importantly is a safe space

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.840
and a common ground for gay gamers and i'm gonna tell you that was really important to me

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:15.280
as a gay gamer because you know in the in the nerd community sometimes you know it's like oh

02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.760
you're gay i don't understand gay people gay but you know at least not i mean it's getting better

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.600
it really i mean as opposed to when i first came out 15 years ago christ i'm dating myself but

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.560
you know as opposed to when i first came out and now it is getting a lot better and you know you

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:36.160
have the people that are our age and younger and a little bit older to thank for that there really

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:43.280
is a generational shift in the way we think and tumblr don't forget tumblr i'm not i don't really

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.440
want to thank tumblr for anything except for pornography um i i had to know the stab i will

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:55.040
thank tumblr for this i will thank tumblr for this this is the greatest analogy that i have seen

02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:02.800
in answering the question well if you get a gamer x why don't we have a straighter x and the analogy

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.240
on tumblr that i saw is it's the same reason that in mario kart you don't get a blue shell when

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:16.720
you're in first place think about it yeah now as i was saying a minute ago another reason why i

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:23.120
liked gamer x is because as a gay guy believe it or not you you also face some of that again little

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:29.120
worse 15 years ago and it is now thanks to things like gamer x but as a gay guy it's like oh you

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:35.920
don't like these certain things or you don't fit into these certain molds of what you know a gay

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.720
gay person is you're a you're a nerd you can't be a nerd and gay like literally i have had eyes

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.040
rolled at me yeah i have had dates in the past that have gone bad because it came out that i

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.200
did a radio show about video games and it's like oh this guy's a bit too nerdy for me i want to

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:56.480
talk about you know my eye rolling is at that behavior yeah i'm sorry people the bits that

02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:03.040
you do or do not enjoy has nothing to do with the things that you like you know what i mean

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:11.040
you can you can like dick and mario right it's they're not mutually exclusive um at

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.600
defton chat says i hope rob didn't read the joystick commenters because joystick ran an

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.520
article on this earlier today and of course the comment section turned into a cesspool

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.880
when usually joystick has one of the better commenting sites on the internet but you know

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.880
that's just the the rule of the internet don't read the comments i made that mistake i read the

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:35.680
comments you know here's the thing i how do you like it as a nerd how do you like it you know

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:41.920
because if you're listening to if you downloaded a podcast about video games i'm going to speculate

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:47.040
you're probably a bit of a nerd and you've probably had certain stereotypes thrown at you

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:54.000
in your life like oh you grew up in your parents basement or oh you're fat you smell you have bad

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.480
hygiene or you know you you don't know how to play sports you can't do any physical activity

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:06.560
right i'm sure many nerds have had those things slung at them in their lives so when i and i i

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.920
think a lot of those comments are ignorant you know it's like you don't i mean being a nerd is

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:17.120
is empowering its culture it's part of what i what it's part of who i am and what i enjoy and

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.400
the things the things that give me pleasure in life great stories great characters superheroes

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.280
that save the day in a very mundane society all those things are great about being a nerd right

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.520
so when i go to joystick and i read comments like well this convention was just set up so

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:44.160
a gay a bunch of gay guys could get together and hook up really really i go that's as fucking

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:50.000
ignorant as those comments i i i get as a nerd about living in my parents basement and fat etc

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:58.000
etc that is just as ignorant because people don't hook up at straight conventions or do i have to

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.440
get rama back on this show to talk about what goes on at anime conventions or how about on the fuck

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.960
on how about you know not even so far as anime conventions but one of the big not really big

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:17.440
stories but one of the troll trolling for hits stories from like last year or so about uh pax

02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:22.960
west or whatever was the whole craigslist post for you know trying to get together or swingers

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:28.960
party or something from you know attendees so yeah that shit kind of happens or just the thing

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:35.040
that you get when you cosplay when you're a girl cosplaying and you get the guys out there thinking

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.280
that they can tell you how to pose touch you without your consent i don't let anybody touch

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:46.720
me i punch somebody one year this is the year i did the bike in cosplay that dan didn't like because

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:55.200
you too much boob and some guy tried to move my shoulder to pose me in a certain way and i just

02:04:55.200 --> 02:05:05.360
did you know flicked out my hand and and punched him in the sternum and he left cursing quite a bit

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:15.040
but he left and left me alone um but uh you know if if it wasn't for people you know trying to

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:21.440
think everything is about a hookup we wouldn't need the cosplay does not equal consent movement

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:27.120
we wouldn't need to have different conventions so that people can feel safe in other environments

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:32.480
fucking should have nothing to do with having fun it can be fun for some people

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.240
but it should not if you want a convention about fucking go to the fulsome street fair

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:43.040
or better yet dory alley you'll see some things that will shock you or the back end

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:46.400
eye blush at some of the things i've seen out of that or the back end of the castor street

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:50.640
fair but then again the back end of the castor street fair is also drag queen territory and

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.800
that is the best place anyway i just want to end with this thoughts here because black wolf says

02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:02.800
this uh the joystick comments quote e3 is for everybody herder here's the message that

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:10.960
unfortunately is getting lost in this internet cesspool e3 is for everybody so is gamer x

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.640
that's unfortunately the message that's being lost and e3 is not for everybody e3 is for

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:25.120
that's true industry people oh you want to go e3 well now fuck off yeah okay then pax is for

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:29.920
everybody that was able to click the button within 15 minutes you know or what have you and then but

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:35.280
then you hear stories about well because the city said it's too much of an imbalance between men

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.360
and women women have to walk further to get to the restroom you look at that and go is pax east

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:44.720
really for everybody i mean granted that was out of their control i'm not harping on them for that

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:49.840
but it's you know you can't look at a a thing like that and go is this really for everybody

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:55.120
yeah but what what it what prompted the city to make that kind of decision was it because of all

02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.600
was it because of all the bad press that they had gotten before about this kind of thing or is it

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:06.400
because of you know because i've never ever heard a convention their politicians loki they do weird

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.800
shit i've what i've met this is the very first convention i've ever heard that had the convert

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:15.760
bathrooms from women to men i mean this is the first you know if they're gonna do that

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:21.280
then why don't they just go back and segregate them again if you wanted to solve this issue we

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:25.280
could do like other countries do and have all bathrooms and unisex instead of a diversity

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.280
lounge let's have a men's only smoking lounge that's what we should have right oh there's

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:36.560
gentlemen's clubs they already have that to be fair though a lot of women i know have a great

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:42.720
time at a gentleman's club when when i go out with my lady friends her gentleman's club is

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:47.440
actually usually towards the top of the list of good ideas to be fair i would also like to respond

02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:52.560
to what nemesis 47 said there's nothing wrong in asking for pics it's not good or gentlemanly to

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:59.280
touch girls in that way well it also goes the same way for a woman don't touch a man without asking

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:04.800
absolutely his consent or a man to touch another man you know bumping into somebody you know

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:09.760
nudging somebody being friendly you know wanting to shake someone's hand that's one thing that is

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:18.240
you are inviting contact don't force the issue if it's not reciprocated and don't and the reason why

02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:23.120
i think that there's a little bit more focus on doing it towards women than towards men and men

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.640
can be victimized as well that that goes without saying it happens it happens regularly and it

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:34.000
doesn't get reported because you know there's also this sort of masculinity thing that you know men

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:45.520
are expected to adhere to um as well but um going back to that i think that it's still a perception

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.800
that because you really don't see it to happen that often with male cosplayers being harassed

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:56.160
the way that female cosplayers are all right anyway if you have more thoughts on the subject

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:59.360
just in the interest of keeping these rolling along because i went i went on that tangent way

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:03.920
too long sorry guys sometimes when things hit a little close to home i get a little ranty

02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.280
participate at orange laundry.com if you want to participate in our mailbag segment with your

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:13.680
further thoughts we're going to get to uh our mailbag uh from this week here very soon but

02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.200
we still have a few more stories to get to first dark sakura oh yeah i do have another one don't i

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:25.360
um well you know we've been talking about the net neutrality thing off and on well there's a

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:32.960
report that came out that comcast sent a campaign contributions to every member of the senate

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:42.800
judiciary committee um so that means they're probably uh not going to uh get well it means

02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:47.040
they're probably going to have more than enough support for their merger with time warner cable

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:54.160
um but that's also you know leading more and more towards a lot of

02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:01.760
what's the word i'm thinking of favoritism wank you know especially but see here is

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.120
the big thing here is that basically there were so many of the people in the senate

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.800
judiciary committee who um who were there for the congressional hearing on the comcast

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:21.760
twc merger um but a lot of the big uh people who spoke out against it including al franken

02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:28.640
received money from comcast uh the comcast pac gave five thousand dollars to his recount fund

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:37.920
in 2009 and he also um received 15 grand from comcast employees since 2009 so what we're looking

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:46.320
at these are the ones um for democrat side we had uh chuck schumer uh patrick leary lee he um

02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:53.760
sheldon whitehouse chris coons dick durbin amy klow bacher diane feinstein richard blumenthal

02:10:53.760 --> 02:11:02.080
mazy hirono and al franken and on the republican side uh oren hatch chuck grassley john corn

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:10.480
cornin leslie gramm jeff sessions mike lee ted cruz ted cruz is an asshole anyway and jeff flake

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:18.240
but i mean how can we take how can we expect any of these people who we have voted for

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.680
in our government to be impartial parties when they're all on corporate bankroll

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.560
it's one of those questions that goes a lot deeper than i think this show can even get into

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.080
but just so just so we're clear because there might be people listening to this

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:41.600
going well this isn't necessarily video game news why does a gamer want to care about this

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:47.280
because first of all you know especially going back into the net neutrality stuff

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:54.320
if you have say that you have someone who's a company that's not comcast say that comcast

02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:00.400
and time warner do this big merger they also get control over you know the bandwidth they get like

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:05.680
exclusive rights and you're left out of the loop well you know we're leaning more towards them

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:10.000
trying to gain a higher market share and get closer and closer i mean i honestly see a lot

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.280
of these mergers turning awfully close to almost being a monopoly you know but

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:20.800
especially also with so many of our games requiring that you be online

02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:28.800
with them being able to yoke and control what you're saying while using their product yeah

02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:34.880
there's a big thing behind it you know there's way more than i would be able to discuss but it's

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:44.480
still important the people know that the people that they voted for are and you as a gamer do

02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:50.000
have a voice and that voice is your vote you know yeah and i i realize we're a worldwide show so the

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.120
circumstances may be different in your country but the you know in in most countries that listen to

02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:00.320
this show you know they run somewhat in a democratic process one way or another so you

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:08.480
know you have a voice use it make your lawmakers understand why these things are bad because

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:13.760
i'll tell you what the threaten of not being re-elected speaks a lot louder than some of

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:19.760
these financial contributions i mean there was another thing that i was reading about too about

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:27.440
uh yi leland yi was trying to also still propose um something about uh

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.960
donation uh campaign donations not being able to be used or not being able to accept

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:38.720
campation campaign donations in the form of trips gifts and you know basically what should

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.920
be bribery anyway that people are passing off as donations yet he was doing all that and far more

02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:47.680
oh and there is more the the philippine government is actually calling for him

02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:55.600
to stand trial oh geez so yeah dude's in hot shit right now he is in boiling vats of oily shit

02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:03.920
ew yeah all right let's move on uh an issue that we just don't have enough time here on the show

02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:09.200
to discuss but uh you know now we've planted the seed in your head use your voices tiger

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.120
claw did post a link to the consumerist listing them as uh that one of the worst companies in

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:21.520
america for 2014 uh comcast oh yeah they won they won this year i don't i don't really talk

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.840
i mean when ea won that poll for a couple years i was like who fucking cares it's some website on

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:31.040
the internet you know and they're little they're little tin can award but so i don't think that's

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.960
too much too big of a deal but i think it does show if nothing else i mean ea was not even i

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.080
mean i think they were a contender but they didn't even make like they didn't even get past their

02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:45.680
first round this year you know people are really fed up with some of the ways i don't think that

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:51.280
necessarily speaks to comcast as a company i mean it does but i think that speaks to a lot of how

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.960
people feel that comcast needs to be better regulated well also in my job at locat i hear

02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:05.920
from a great many of our customers who use comcast as their isp and whenever i have to say well this

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.960
is something going on with comcast like i don't want to call them i really don't want to call them

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:16.080
and there's you know and i have friends that work for comcast and things like that and i know you

02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:20.480
know obviously there's a lot of good people but the problem with comcast is it's getting too big

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:24.720
it really is i mean that's that goes for almost any big company when companies get too big the

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:27.920
left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing and that's when you get sent to 500 different

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:31.680
departments before you get your issue resolved and all that stuff and then they they talk about

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.320
they want to get even bigger that's that's a concern huge one that's one of the reasons that

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:43.040
i really super like locat which i can't really go into more detail about is that a lot of what

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:49.200
they've been doing they're big but they focus more on keeping it to certain things you know

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:56.000
it's there's a constant communication there's constant training there's constant making sure

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.200
everyone knows what the other party is doing and i wish other companies focused on that same type

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:06.240
of philosophy it sounds like from what you've told me about your organization as well as that

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:12.400
there's very clearly defined roles there are yet you dabble your fingers in other pots as

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:16.720
appropriate exactly that's a good way to do it my company kind of does that is a completely

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:20.240
different industry but we do that a little bit too and i think it helps a lot yeah and i honestly

02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:25.920
think that ea has tried to do quite a number of things to clean up their reputation so they're

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:35.520
doing better all right um let's move on loki all right um so let's see they've got some new dlc

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:45.040
coming for uh titanfall and uh i should say the first of some dlc so it's a new map pack called

02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:51.840
expedition it's coming in may and it includes uh some new maps including runoff swamp lands and

02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:58.000
war games uh i know war games is supposed to take place in actually the training simulation

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.880
program that you use in the beginning of the game uh also they're saying that they're going to be

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:09.120
doing a free update which is going to include a new two uh two versus two last titan standing mode

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:14.000
as well as some other uh updates as well and hey uh rob this is actually kind of cool i mean you

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.080
remember one of my bitches about the game was that there was no private match mode well they

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:22.800
actually added that in so about time yeah so weren't they saying that was supposed to be in

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:28.320
like a week after release been a little while well it was technically in the week after release of

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:36.160
the 360 version so um and of course the dlc pack is going to be 999 or if you opt to go the season

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:42.000
pass they'll save you five bucks and it's 24.99 because they're going to be doing three different

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:49.200
dlc packs so i don't know i still want to get it on 360 but i haven't got a chance to yet

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:54.080
yeah i kind of want to pick up the game as well i think when i get that new computer i'll probably

02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:00.160
end up getting titanfall on pc yeah pc looks really good yeah it i could get it on pc i guess

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.880
well something i could play on pc in the interim or if i'm in certain countries i could play it on

02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:10.720
an ipad is hearthstone and some information coming out of packs east because blizzard was there

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.680
involves a an expansion of sorts to hearthstone it's not really an expansion but it's called

02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:22.080
the curse of nox from us which uh was uh dungeon in that was one of my favorites yeah it was early

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:27.120
world of warcraft and they revived it for wrath of the lich king so um it's a hearthstone adventure

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:31.280
and what this is it's a single player mode because you know right now hearthstone i mean you do have

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:34.480
single player where it can be you versus the computer but there's not a lot that expands on

02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:40.240
that so curse of nox from us a hearthstone adventure will have new cards a new game board

02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:44.800
bosses and class specific challenges um so yeah that's something that's going to be coming to

02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:49.920
hearthstone uh the adventure will not be available all at once and it will be over the course of five

02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:55.040
weeks where the wings will open one by one which sounds a lot like the raid whatever has different

02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:58.960
wings and so forth so that'll be kind of funny um in order to gain entry you're going to have

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:05.440
to purchase it with in-game gold or real money because our stone is free to play after all

02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.640
so you gotta play a lot of in the games or you gotta use plunker down the 99 cents or 99 or

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:16.160
whatever the first wing of course will be free um so there you go when you complete a wing you will

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:21.440
get a new legendary card so you at least you have that to look forward to for actually completing

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:26.640
things 30 new cards will be added with curse of nox from us they will not be dungeon locked so

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.160
you can use them in decks when other game modes as well uh don't know when that's coming out

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:37.040
but it should be coming out simultaneously with pc mac and ipad i would assume that means later

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:43.840
this year once they get the ipad version of the game all hammered out we'll see so all right i

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:50.000
think it's time to take a trip to our mailbag because every week you guys email us at mailbag

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:56.640

02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:21.200
spam or if it finally is upon flushed out at this point it all bounced i don't know it'll all be in

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:25.680
russian well regardless you'll want to send those emails to participate at orange hundred dot com

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.840
to reach the participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:40.960
use the passphrase forest hello jamie loki and rob i like jamie the best sorry boys

02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:45.680
oh god it's gonna be one of those emails you know who it is who can you guess

02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.440
i'm trying to think of jamie fans and i'm coming up blank i would write into horde house but as

02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:58.800
pax is going on right now by the time oh it's gamut it's getting it it would be too late i'm

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:04.320
sure i'm curious what you all think about blizzard's choice to announce the azeroth choppers

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:09.440
before the pax events have started do you think it's to pacify the player base yearning for some

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:14.640
kind of blizzcon information or is it a great pr stunt to get people talking about blizzard

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:20.160
games before the inevitable big thing that will come from a competitor either way it seems people

02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:25.840
will have calmed down about blizzcon and the blizzard world chatter has picked up curious

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:30.080
about your thoughts love the show thanks for making my horrible commute so much better jamie

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:37.920
rocks gamut i love you we need to be friends on facebook oh god i actually don't know much about

02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:43.280
this i've been seeing a little bit on twitter and i was just like even from like the little bits i

02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:54.560
was seeing it sounded dumb but here's the deal i guess it's that show um what is that american

02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:59.760
choppers or somewhere that's about motorbikes and they're actually having an alliance team and a

02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:06.960
horde team based on world of warcraft essentially um work on new chopper designs uh so they're

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:13.840
going to infuse the essence of horde and alliance into each bike uh and then one chopper will reign

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:18.880
supreme and uh that will be voted on by world of warcraft players around the globe so it's

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:25.600
essentially going to be a horde versus alliance wankfest that involves motorcycles i don't this

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:30.560
is really like nothing to me this has nothing to do with anything i think it's kind of lame i would

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:35.040
rather it be like you can do bike races in game if you have the motorcycles yeah you do have the

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:39.680
motorcycles already in game that's cool well the bikes that they create end up in game now that's

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:46.400
kind of neat if that's the case but otherwise this is this is really a blip on the screen like

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:52.080
i don't think this has anything to do with it's it's a weird promotion to try to keep warcraft

02:22:52.080 --> 02:23:02.480
on the tips of people's tongues honestly that's it so anyway how about less dead space there are

02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:10.160
no more emails in the box no one loves us except gamut loves me well at least you got that you'll

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:16.240
always have gamut you'll always have gamut well we need more emails in future weeks so please

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:23.680

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:49.280
yeah well we had a pinbot for a while i mean dan went on a rampage just listening to music from

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.840
pinbot like the whole day and he's like man we should have kept our pinbot and the design was

02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:01.680
great i mean definitely had that you know kind of heavy metal magazine type of artwork to it too

02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:07.280
but it was really i mean especially if they were able to reuse the game design for jackpot

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:18.400

02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:47.600
must know this system i vaguely remember this system but not like super well but it was uh

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:51.840
there was a this system that was the laser active and it was a laser disc

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.080
machine basically that actually played some games um now here's the thing what they're trying to do

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:03.200
on this uh particular forum it's a it's a mega ld dumping project basically where they're trying

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:08.880
to actually get all of these games together so that they can preserve these games i don't know

02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:13.520
if it's to be used on emulators or or what the deal is but basically trying to preserve preserve

02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.400
these laser active games for the future now it should be noted that a lot of the laser active

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.800
games in japan were pornographic they don't care they don't want to preserve those games they're

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:27.200
saying don't bother oh what the heck that's not fair yeah the guy says i don't want him in my

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:30.800
house and i don't want him around my kids is that you know what loki i think you need to start the

02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:36.800
effort to preserve the pornographic them yeah all right we need to get the porno games you know what

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:42.320
somebody needs to love those games too there you go in fact they even say like which games they

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:48.400
are virtual cameraman and angel mate dora dora paradise all right anyway but there are some

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.400
big sega games that were on the system uh road blasters uh was there hyperion uh high roller

02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.440
battle you know there's there's some pretty neat stuff there so uh check that out this is all going

02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:05.520
on on a website uh spritesmind.net if you check out their forums there so that's it's a pretty

02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:11.920
neat preservation project and a system the dark sakura doesn't seem to have in the vault so

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:19.680
well it's because i never wanted one we had we've had chances to get them just no until until uh

02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:30.000
until um until you find out that there's porno games on it i'm just kidding all right um

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.040

who's this it's ronma one more time you are already on the damn show can't you you're taking

02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:02.560
up someone else's time that's all right what's up yeah i was unpacking stuff from the car and

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:09.520
mako was telling me that kotaku ran an article about hooking up hooking up at cons is what you're

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:15.760
supposed to do no no no no it wasn't for it thankfully it wasn't an article from the evil

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:21.360
k it wasn't that whole thing no it was uh some comments that we were seeing is that and we i

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:26.640
was talking about gamer x and i said uh there's comments out there that somebody said gamer x

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:32.320
the only reason it exists is because gay guys want to hook up and i said if you don't think

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:37.600
hooking up at any convention happens then let me get rama on here to tell you about what goes down

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:44.160
at anime conventions let me tell you something as many years i've gone to anime conventions

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:50.480
and hooking up it's a i'm surprised no female cosplay walked up to me and said you're the daddy

02:29:50.480 --> 02:30:04.800
please you know um bobby made a comment in chat earlier that was um that was something

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:11.360
like if you can't get laid at dragon con you can't get laid at all that's right here and so

02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:16.800
you know hey and that's no different from what from one of the after parties i went to last night

02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:23.120
because here's my thing i understand that these add a lot of these after parties the male the

02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:31.200
female ratio is off the freaking chain because rob if you were single and you were there you'd

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:39.520
have sworn god like i got you okay it was like that but i get that and i understand that but

02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:44.160
the thing that gets to me the most is have these guys that go there all they do is stand there in

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:51.600
the corner they pick up their phone and they're like i'm at the party it is awesome geeks and

02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:58.960
nerds most of us have no rhythm i should know i'm black and i have two left feet and i still

02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:14.480

02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:19.360
dot vog network dot com and tiger claw and chat says i'm sure rama hooks up with other cosplayers

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:28.080
that's not the reason you go to these cons yeah i care to comment not anymore i'm i'm terrible i'm

02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:33.920
just terrible today yeah you're bad that's just you get a bunch of people it doesn't even have

02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:51.840
didn't realize until bobby mentioned on his last show that i was trying out on the dev kit too

02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:58.880
but no they had a good uh setup there though as ron as ron said about uh couch nights

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:07.680
um yeah no i i uh definitely tried it a bunch of the indie games which rama also say you know

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:15.840
there's that actually i think got a lot more uh attention than you know like some of the big

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:22.480
big name boots which is good because you know so you know uh well rama was saying rama was

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.280
sorry rama was saying when he was here that at like 85 of the show was indie stuff was that

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:32.640
kind of your experience too um game wise yeah there was a lot there was a lot more playable

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:39.520
games on the indie side than there were on you know the major you know developer side i mean a

02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.400
lot of the developer stuff like uh the borderlands people were there but they were showing like a

02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:50.000
video for the prequel so i didn't even i didn't bother lining up for that but there were like a

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.760
there were a lot of good games i think i tweeted to you guys about krypton the necro dancer yeah

02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:01.040
that was that was a lot of fun yeah i'm looking i want to try that i want to try that game out for

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.600
myself too yeah no that got a that got a huge following around it people going after it uh

02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:16.880
there was another tiny there was another small game i tried that it's called um rollers of the

02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:27.280
realm which is actually a pinball game that's an rpg and puzzle game so basically you know it takes

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:33.440
place in medieval times and you're fighting your way through uh through different levels and you

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:37.760
have to solve puzzles you have to defeat guys or they'll destroy your flippers so you're unable to

02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:44.400
use it which is and it has like a nice little story to it but now i had a lot of fun with that

02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:49.840
there there were just a lot of good indie games that were there and it's good and it's nice that

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:56.480
you know they got a lot of local developers there they get a lot of shit and they get a lot of uh

02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:02.640
different types of games a lot of tablet games stuff like that um but no i heard you talking

02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:10.480
about earlier about the diversity lounge yeah did you see it i did uh i did uh check it out um

02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:16.480
what was it now it's just really kind it was really just like a room that had a bunch of

02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:25.200
different groups that um were all about you know like diversity in the community um there was

02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:38.000
uh LGBT group that kind of publishes stories as publishes graphic novels

02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:46.480
there's a webcomic there was a there was a group similar to gamer x that you know it's for a con in

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:52.560
toronto very similar type of atmosphere that they were that they were promoting there was a cop

02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:56.800
there was a college there kind of just talking with people brainstorming about

02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:04.400
how to better the community through gaming and try to kind of get you know equal uh

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.520
and you know divert diversity and everything um then there was a group that i remember called

02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:21.440
like press xy which is about you know trans trans trans transgender group uh you know talking about

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:27.440
you know the struggles of being transgender through a game kind of similar to cards against

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:34.480
humanity which was really neat that's that's kind of neat that they were kind of showing that off

02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:39.600
through like a game like you know kind of i guess communicating with gamers on a level that they

02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:44.320
would absolutely understand that's that's pretty neat yeah and yeah i actually went to the actually

02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.080
went to their panel and you know it was like a very you know like a light fun atmosphere but

02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:53.680
also was very real because you know there were a lot of you know people within you know the

02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:58.560
industry they're also they're also transgender that you know they talk about their struggles

02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:02.400
and everything so it was like very real very you know light-hearted

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:16.640
type of thing and there was also a group uh about you know uh handicap gamers oh okay oh the

02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:22.080
is that the able gamers yeah it's able gamers yeah they had a booth you know showing off you

02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:28.080
know some of the controllers and other things and also talk about how they basically just go to

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:36.720
they work with other triple-a titles they work with a lot of developers on trying to make games

02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:43.200
more accessible for to sit for a disabled gamers there are big proponents of making sure that you

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:48.560
know button mapping is available keyboard mapping is available in all games that there's not really

02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:54.320
a reason quote unquote that any of that should be locked down uh being cognizant of color blindness

02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.000
and you know things like that i've i've yeah i've definitely heard of those guys before so that's

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.880
really cool that's that's yeah do you think that the message was heard from those groups do you

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:10.960
think that enough people were hearing the message i feel that it was because of the way that it was

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:16.320
initially executed the way that was initially explained kind of left a sour taste in everyone's

02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:25.360
mouth i think you know it had a lot of good i just don't think it was executed the right way

02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:32.480
initially i there was a lot of good in it right but i kind of feel that you know the room itself

02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:37.440
was kind of off kind of like the beaten path i don't feel it got as much attention as it should

02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:46.960
have but it's a start it's a start all right well um what was what was probably like your favorite

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.200
game you got to play at the whole maybe already talked about it but what was your favorite game

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:55.120
if not one you've already brought up well yeah well the favorite game was the

02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.840
prob was probably krypton and necro dancer and and the and uh rollers of the realm right those

02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:06.640
were like the two indie games they got they got to play and also the the oculus rift was a lot of

02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:12.960
fun right to get my hands on it and everything so you're you're a believer in the oculus rift now

02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:19.840
i am i am if it's at the right price but you know can't be can't be choosy the price is right the

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:23.680
price is right all right uh s2100 mad i'm gonna i'm gonna let let you go here so we can try to

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:27.440

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.320
they didn't really have feel is was was an issue but you know then again i didn't really use the

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:50.480
bathroom at pecs because you know yeah it's also kind of one of those things where like if i know

02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:55.120
i'm going to a convention i try to uh make sure we're all wrapped up in that department because

02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:59.600

02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.000
want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about on the show so far or something

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.400
else you don't have to have gone to a pax east to call i mean sure we love hearing from the people

02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.960
that were there i mean don't get me wrong those are some great calls but but i'd like to hear from

02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:47.600
uh i'd like to hear from uh all you guys out there 1877 game ol go game olr username on skype orange

02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:52.720
lounge radio i do have a couple tweets to read here they aren't necessarily stories but some

02:41:52.720 --> 02:42:01.040
comments um aj twist on twitter sent us a tweet you just saw a king commercial for candy crush

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:11.360
saga on tv do you believe that sadly yeah i kind of do believe that um because you know they are a

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:16.240
publicly traded company now and they've got to prove that they're not a one-hit wonder and in

02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:19.920
order to get there they're going to have to make that one hit of theirs last as long as they

02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.600
possibly can especially after especially how does that prove that they're not a one-hit wonder

02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:29.440
well after some bad press that one hit game they got to keep that going so they can fund those

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.800
other games but it is a little weird i think i want to say i saw like a farmville commercial

02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:40.240
on tv once though it's is that's that's life all right let's go to the phones hi you're on

02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:46.640
orange launch radio who's this hey did it suck death hey buddy how you doing well yeah i didn't

02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:52.800
go to pax east it's too far inexpensive for me to go but that's all right neither did we

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:59.680
we'll just sit here in the not cool kids club mope mope yeah well what's up buddy but but yeah i did

02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:07.120
uh i did do uh an interesting thing this weekend i i saw indie game the movie oh right indie game

02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:13.280
the movie one of the movies is available on steam yeah i actually watched it through there uh uh

02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:19.680
first first of all i want to ask you if any of you uh if you had watched it i actually own it

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.840
and have yet to watch it unfortunately i just you know i but to be fair i hardly ever watch like any

02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:31.520
movies um i get to the movies maybe like twice a year and then on on blu-ray i'll watch like maybe

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:36.080
three things although um dark soccer is gonna let me frozen and i'm very excited to see that because

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.160
i still haven't seen it because again see my comment about never getting out to the movies

02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:45.360
eventually yeah but uh so no i didn't see any movie the game but uh and i don't know if you

02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:50.240
guys did you see it lowkey no no yeah i don't think we did so you get you gotta tell us a

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.280
little more about it here well it's a it's a pretty interesting movie it's a it's really

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.520
entertaining to watch uh for the most part but yeah uh it definitely gave me another another

02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:11.520
view on on phil fish and jonathan blow because yeah if if you know me uh you know my my hatred

02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:17.600
or my despise for phil fish and i have seen you make some aggressive tweets in the past yeah

02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:26.480
definitely though though now watching this movie uh and i really understand now how phil fish uh

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:31.920
feels or at least how why he acts that like that most of the time because yeah it's something

02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:39.520
something really really uh that you see in this movie that uh at least helps you understand a bit

02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:45.920
i still think he's a douche he's his son asshole and jonathan blow is still pretentious

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:54.960
but at least i understand them now at least i know uh why they do and and and why they act that

02:44:54.960 --> 02:45:03.280
way because yeah it's and and aside from that aside from that uh the team uh also teen meat

02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:11.200
it's uh it's a really interesting story how how they started and how how the uh the development

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:17.920
for super meat boy uh progresses through through all of it and it's and it's really interesting you

02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:24.480
you even though you know how it finishes how it ends you still uh go like oh my god i want those

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:32.160
guys to to get through and and be happy because yeah though uh i do recommend watching the movie

02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:38.240
it's on netflix it's set on everywhere and if you have if you have steam you can watch it through

02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:47.120
there i i watched it through steam scene since i got the uh the special edition dlc yeah and and

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:52.000
also those uh those extras are really worth it are really interesting to watch too you get like

02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:57.600
achievements and trading cards and stuff too huh yeah uh i actually got all the achievements now

02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:02.240
that's funny uh yeah no it's it's uh definitely one of those things i gotta check out when i have

02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.320
more time available in the week and it's pretty cool that it kind of gives you that additional

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:10.400
perspective on people that you may have kind of written off one way but it gave you that

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.000
perspective it's interesting though because a lot of times when you hear that kind of talk it's

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.000
usually like a negative thing like we hear a lot about like people that go on reality shows and

02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.840
figured thought they were edited in a negative context or even i think about um

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:26.960
you know as far as video game documentaries go i think about the king of kong and how um you know

02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:30.400
billy mitchell i don't think necessarily agrees with some of the ways he was edited in that way

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:34.640
and certainly there's a big negative perception about him because of that movie um and whether

02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:38.960
that's right or wrong i don't know because i don't know the man personally but um it is very

02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:46.880
interesting the power that a documentary or a a reality tv documentary or whatever can kind of

02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:54.240
have on people so and yes and and it's a really introspective view on how indie development works

02:46:55.200 --> 02:47:02.320
at least as a general view because yeah it's a it's a lot of work for uh from so little people

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:09.200
in a team and like that so yeah it's it's a it's a really interesting movie if you haven't if any of

02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:15.200
any of the listeners having watched it uh you should again it's on netflix it's

02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.000
pretty much everywhere so it's really easy to find if you want to get the esteem version it's

02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:27.600
the special version the special edition it's it's a really great auto and i'm sorry but yeah all

02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.760
right uh well act deaf anything else you want to share with us before we let you go well other

02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:39.760
than that super smash brothers i'm excited though i do want ness captain falcon and jigglypuff to

02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.120
return but i will see we'll see yeah those are those are three at the top of my list too but

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:50.560
if they had some really really really awesome new characters then i guess i could forgive it but

02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:56.960
if it's more pokemon i'm gonna get a little irritated no offense to the pokemon fans but

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.960
there was actually really only one other tweet um that i wanted to address here and that was

02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:23.040
from dr noir who emailed us last week on the show and he was he was uh promoting a game that

02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:27.280
he really enjoyed on android and he said that he sent a tweet this week saying i just listened to

02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:33.920
last sunday's olr episode and for the record no i'm not affiliated with or paid by touch fu who's

02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:39.040
that company that made the game they just made a killer game no i i figured that really was the

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:45.520
case it's just it's just fun to give you a hard time there so all right uh again trying to sneak

02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:51.520
in one more call if you are feeling so brave 1877 i promise we don't bite unless you ask if you want

02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:57.600
us to we'll bite a little bit 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio if you want

02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:04.080
to give us a call otherwise there's there's no last minute stories and nothing else to talk about

02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:13.680
no i guess i guess got stuck on uh the david bowie animated gif subreddit is that a whole tumblr or

02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:19.680
something it's a subreddit just a few just on there but subreddit of course i should mention

02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:25.360
another tweet actually speaking of like time wasters um uh jamie's new bff gemit actually

02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:32.160
sent a tweet to me and uh horde house and the olr twitters that has a link to a game uh that was

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:36.800
like i think it was like ie killer or something like that and like i just played it real quick

02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.840
like it has to it's a whole tongue-in-cheek thing about windows xp going away it was like this little

02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:46.320
shooter game it was a little silly but i had fun with it so all right we do have another call

02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:49.440
coming in so let's take it and then we'll probably wrap up so hi you're on orange house radio who's

02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:56.480
this hey guys this is nemesis 47 how you guys doing i am good hey nemesis 47 how you doing

02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:03.680
i've been okay man uh just just uh been working on all that i did i hear you i hear you what's

02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:11.760
on your mind buddy uh nothing much um if there's one character they output in super smash brothers

02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.760
the new one they output like one character one character only the angry video game nerd that

02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:23.360
would be pretty funny to see i mean he would he probably probably attacked with a whole bunch of

02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:28.560
expletives and stuff like that but then nintendo probably automatically put an emory in reading in

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.120
the game yeah see now i don't know if that would necessarily work because wasn't there a little

02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:39.280
bit of a legal squabble hence why the angry video game nerd has his name because that wasn't his

02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:46.960
original name so yeah yeah yeah when we first started he was the angry video the angry nintendo

02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:53.760
when we first started that's right that's right you know maybe he can't be a character nemesis

02:50:53.760 --> 02:51:01.280
but what if he was the announcer that would actually be funnier see see we were working

02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.080
together here to create the killer video game here and that's you know i i can't think of a whole lot

02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:10.960
of announcing that goes on in smash brothers maybe this is what we need we need some announcer packs

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:16.080
from some great uh video game commentators such as the angry video game nerd there you go

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:20.080
and tiger claw wants to know in our chat room what would the angry video game nerds moves be

02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:23.920
he attacks you with bad video games see i think i think this this might be why he'd be a perfect

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:29.920
commentator she has jason come out or bugs bunny do you ever watch any yeah oh yeah no i saw the

02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:35.520
one on friday the 13th and it made me sad because i like that one is great yeah oh it's great it's

02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:41.760
great good stuff uh he probably he probably he probably attacked you with swear words he probably

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:47.040
probably had those uh you know the act symbol the hashtag symbol those other symbols he probably

02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:52.320
just smash you over the head with it maybe qbert qbert swearing that type of thing yeah that yeah

02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:57.760
there you go um i would uh yeah i i think that would be a special move it would be really funny

02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:03.200
though is if whenever he said things like that he got censored but in that really bad like movie on

02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:09.600
broadcast television censoring type of way like what is what is it okay y'all know snakes on a

02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:14.000
plane right and samuel l jackson goes i am sick of all these motherfucking snakes on this

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:20.160
motherfucking plane like didn't they dub it for tv and it's like i am sick of all these mother

02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:28.400
monkey loving snakes on this monday to friday plane or something really like so i think that's

02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:35.360
what they would do is they would have to change out the swear words for uh broadcast tv or show

02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:41.360
girls are dark sacrifice favorite movie on vh1 where they they draw on the bras and everything so

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.680
all right well nemesis any other any of the thoughts or wishes for smash brothers

02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:55.920
oh and also and also jimmy i would i would also give give dan w2k14 but when you get it

02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:02.000
try to get the uh season pass thing because not only because when you buy the season pass like

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:09.360
20 bucks you'll get you get all the uh characters all the whole bunch of other stuff i mean a bunch

02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:14.160
of other dlc but it's pretty pretty worth getting and also not only is andre the giant in the game

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:20.880
also king kong's bundies in the game oh cool oh wow so pretty much you got all the heavyweights

02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:21.840
tonight's show i see jamie has her microphone up so i'll start with you dark sakura your final

02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:27.520
thought tonight um i was watching youtube and i found this thing called musical puns where it's

02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:31.200
basically like all kinds of different instruments but the thing that cracked me up was bassoon 5

02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:37.680
playing maroon 5 music nice it was just really funny everyone should watch musical puns i like

02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:42.800
hearing modern pop songs covered in other genres and things like that like the swing band that

02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:51.280
does all the good stuff there's also another bassoon quartet called um what's it called

02:55:51.280 --> 02:56:00.480
breaking winds the breaking winds nice and they do um uh the someone i used to know they do a

02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:05.840
version of that that's really good so i've been really listening to a lot of bassoon music lately

02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.680
all right and then my final thoughts since dark sakura brought up youtube

02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:15.520
i have to say from my final thought tonight it's an orange it's an orange

02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:24.000
and last but not least loki your final thought tonight i don't listen to bassoon music because

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:30.640
you're not cool i guess not all right i played in a bassoon quartet once but i didn't play the bassoon

02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.960
i played contralto clarinet which is almost as bad as a bassoon i actually played bass clarinet

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.600
too when i was hey i played the better of the bass clarinets i played the contralto oh whatever

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:48.080
whatever you know if you want to hear deep look for the subcontra bass trust me all right that's

02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:51.680
