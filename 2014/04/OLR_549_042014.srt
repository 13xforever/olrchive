00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
This week things have been a little quiet, but you know what that means. More ports lining

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,280
on new systems, news of games that didn't make the cut, and interesting games that are

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,840
about to make their debut. In other words, it's another week in gaming. Have your favorite

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,760
candy at the ready and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,720
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here with episode number

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:51,000
549 for April 20th, 2014. That's right. Let me just get it out of the way now. Happy 420!

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,120
And Happy Easter, of course, if that's what you're into. And if you don't celebrate either

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,120
of those things, then I hope you're having a fine Sunday.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Happy fucking holiday! Hello, DarkSakura!

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,360
Because it's bunnies and shagging and eggs. Fertility holiday!

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,480
What are they calling it in Animal Crossing? You were just playing?

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Bunny Day.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Bunny Day. Happy Bunny Day.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,520
It's annoying in Animal Crossing. It's called the day after Jamie's birthday, so I'm a little

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
bit food hungover. And I feel sick because I've eaten nothing but crap.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,360
Well, happy birthday to you, by the way.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Thank you. I'm old.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
No, you're not.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Please.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
It's another year of awesome. Come on.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Yeah, I know I'm vintage.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Look, we've been doing...

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Better vintage wine than sour grapes.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Look, we've been doing OLR for, when we get to June, that's going to be our 12th birthday.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,880
So we've been doing this show for 12 years, so y'all do the math. Obviously, we are not

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
in our 20s anymore doing this show, you know, so there's that expectation we're going to

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
be a little bit older.

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm going to be doing OLR when I'm 70.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,320
We very well might be. We'll see. Not here tonight, unfortunately. Tech master Loki,

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,160
Tech master Loki does have the night off because it is Easter and he has some family

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,200
obligations this evening. But joining us in studio, it's a pleasure always to have this

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,920
guy on the show. He's a big supporter of not just OLR, but a lot of the things at vognetwork.com

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,800
and just a good guy to have here on the show. Say hello, everybody, to Flocko Jones.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Hello, everybody.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
How you doing, Flocko?

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm doing all right.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Yeah?

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
I just realized I had to turn my mic on. It was off. That would have been embarrassing.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,840
That happens. Loki likes to do the off and on thing. Yeah, he has to do the click, click,

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
click. Sometimes it happens. So what's new? How you been?

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,320
I've been pretty good. I had a really good Easter.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Did you?

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,360
I accelerated by eating four hot dogs, a hamburger, a pile of potato salad. I starved myself

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,600
for breakfast, though, so I could just throw down as much food as possible. They actually

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,560
ran out of hot dogs. I think I could have handled a dozen. I was going for a dozen,

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
but it didn't work out.

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,240
I love that even though Loki's not here, you still can bring it to food one way or another.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,720
I know. And now we have scones.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,600
I brought black court scones.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,280
And tomorrow, you know what the best thing about Easter is? I don't care if you celebrate

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,360
Easter or not. We can all celebrate in 4-21 tomorrow, which is going to be the day that

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,320
all the candy is like 75% off. That's universal, people.

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
I can't eat any of it.

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,280
Last year, that was 4-20 and that's appropriate.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,560
Yes, much better.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:19,320
Because I have decided that now that my birthday is over and I'm feeling old and sore from

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,320
walking all over San Francisco yesterday, that I'm going to wake up early tomorrow and

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
do yoga and go to the gym.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,360
You're going to start off this new year of your life in all the right ways?

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Well, yeah. Well, I was doing that before, but then work was kicking my butt. So now

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,400
that I'm used to my work schedule and got my vitamins all sorted out and starting to

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,320
feel okay again, I'm going back to the gym.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
There you go.

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,120
I submitted the measurements for my cosplays for GamerX.

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,280
Oh, you are going to be doing the cosplays.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Which is another motivation.

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Nice, nice.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Did you make it a couple inches less so that way you'd be like, I waited until I was super

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,720
bloated because my costumes have to be loose anyway because they're Homestuck costumes.

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh, okay.

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Gotcha.

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,200
Go to our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,680
vog network.com.

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,880
We have some comments in our chat room here.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's see.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,240
Kaijuto is starting us off tonight saying, O-L-R becomes O-L-D. Oh, that's like a sitcom

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
in the works or something.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,160
And I'm just sitting here going becomes.

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Just wait.

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,400
The older we get, the older you're getting too.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
That's right.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
How long have you been listening?

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,360
Also, let's see.

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,280
Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf not only says congrats on surviving another year, Jamie,

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,320
but he also says Flaco is there.

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Did you buy a UPS yet?

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,280
Now for those that don't catch the joke, the last time Flaco was on the show, actually

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,280
it was two times ago because I think the last time you were here, everything was fine.

91
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,560
Two times ago, the power went out mid show and that was like a lost episode because of

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
it.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Yes.

94
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
It's a legendary episode now.

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
That's how I like to look at it.

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Yeah, it is.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,680
You were on a deleted scene like me on RuPaul's Drag Race.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,800
I was on a deleted scene.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
It was so good.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
It was so much better than the next time I was on.

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,080
Wait a minute.

102
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I was better.

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
I mean, I was better the first time.

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,000
My stories didn't come back as good the second time.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, you're always.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was trying to recall.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's going so well.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,240
Well, I do have some kickoff topics I want to get into, but since Dark Soccer brought

110
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,760
up her birthday, I figured now was a good time to do a present.

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
Y'all ready for a present?

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I like presents.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,440
Now I don't rap, so I just put it here in this little thing.

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,200
So I'm going to just open it for Dark Soccer right now.

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Sing for me.

117
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Flaco, you need to do commentary because I got to put the mic down.

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,760
Oh, Rob is putting the mic down and now he's going to unzip Dark Soccer's present.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
I don't know how else to put it.

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Which is at crotch level.

121
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,480
It is in a box.

122
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Here it is.

123
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
He's presenting it.

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
This sounds really bad.

125
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
And oh, she squealed.

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm sure you heard that.

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
What is that?

128
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Bravely default.

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm going to play the shit out of this because now I'm going with Animal Crossing.

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
There it is.

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
That's what she said.

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
I was all intent.

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
I was going to go to the store and get her that Disney game, but then last week she said,

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
I'd rather have Bravely Default.

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
And I'm like, all right.

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Bravely Default is a great game.

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,120
So there you go.

138
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,880
And I could see Dark Soccer as being somebody that's really going to get into the story

139
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,120
and the characters and stuff because she likes to get into games that have story.

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
It's wrapped, Rob.

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
She's unwrapping it right now.

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm shrink wrapping it right now.

143
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,200
Rob shrink-wrapped it all himself.

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Shush.

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Love.

146
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
And Dan ordered me my present.

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,440
So I have my present coming from Dan.

148
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
And then I bought myself a whole bunch of presents.

149
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Nice.

150
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Because I was at Sakura Monster.

151
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I got myself a bunch of art supplies.

152
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Nobody got you that though, right?

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
No.

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I bought me an iPhone 5S.

155
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Oh, sweet.

156
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Because it's about time.

157
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Right.

158
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,120
And I'm not going to reveal where my husband is employed at either in case people are listening

159
00:06:49,120 --> 00:07:00,680
and because I also, so I'm going to say that Dan works at the land of, what should I say?

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,360
He works at the land of reps in service.

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
So Loras.

162
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Loras.

163
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.

164
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Dan works at Loras and I work at Locat.

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay.

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You got it.

167
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
All right.

168
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,200
All Homestuck references, by the way.

169
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,840
Going over to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

170
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,600
Eric RPG says, that Disney game is meh anyway.

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
I don't know.

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,440
I thought Dark Sakura might have got a kick out of it because Animal Crossing meets Disney,

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
but you know what?

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Bradley default's awesome too.

175
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,320
I want to play the Tomodachi game.

176
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Oh yeah.

177
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Well, that's not out till June.

178
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,320
So you'll have to wait for Christmas or something, Monica.

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,160
I street past so many freaking people at Sakura Matsuri.

180
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Tell us about your trip.

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,780
You want to, cause you know, a lot of nerds in the Bay area go to this.

182
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,560
You went to Sakura Matsuri yesterday in San Francisco, right?

183
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yep.

184
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
The Cherry Blossom Festival.

185
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,160
And if people want to see some of my pictures, if you go to kurotsubasa.tumblr.com, I have

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:06,640
some pictures I took, including a panoramic of the Peace Pagoda Plaza over at Japantown

187
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
or Nihonmachi.

188
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,160
At any rate, there were, there was some cosplay.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,520
There were some good cosplay that I found a really good Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin.

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
I found a few others and then I found like some honestly kind of half-assed cosplay.

191
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Like it was an afterthought.

192
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm not saying anything about the cosplayers.

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,320
You know, if you don't want to cosplay all the way, that's fine, but you know, don't

194
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,760
think you're hot shit if you know your costume's not all the way put together.

195
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,440
I ran into some really nice people just wandering around, talked to a few people, and then I

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
found more homestucks.

197
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,160
Okay, because it was my birthday, I decided to wear my Aradia shirt, which is basically

198
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,860
big red Aries on a black shirt.

199
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,380
As I was walking down the hall, I found a person wearing the Terezi shirt, which is

200
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
a Libra.

201
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,780
And we're like, oh, one of us and you know, then I ran into someone wearing a Hero of

202
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,300
Space shirt at Daiso.

203
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,260
And then she's like, yeah, I found a couple other people too.

204
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,460
So we have some representation, which we are an invasive species, but we're good.

205
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
I have no idea what any of that means, but that's cool.

206
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,020
Well, these people know what it means.

207
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,220
Did you get to go to that arcade that they have in the little...

208
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,220
It was busy.

209
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
I didn't want to go.

210
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,740
And I mean, the whole place was just like all over, but we went to where they were doing

211
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,940
the food booth.

212
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,900
And I was very disappointed because I wanted to have a takoyaki, because that's like my

213
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,660
big thing when I go to Sakuramatsuri is I have to have takoyaki.

214
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,620
And they made it, it wasn't takoyaki, it was like beef inside it instead of octopus.

215
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
So I was like, well, screw that.

216
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,380
So I had unagi don and it was delicious.

217
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,340
Did you get a crepe?

218
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,700
Because they have some great crepes there too.

219
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,340
Great place.

220
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,940
Sophie's Crepes was like way busy.

221
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,380
I just didn't bother.

222
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,020
But I did buy some art supplies because there's certain ones that I can't get locally.

223
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,180
I had to go to Kinokaniya.

224
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,260
And what else did we do?

225
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,900
Because I actually went and bought...

226
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,460
Because I mean, now that I'm older, I was always interested in Japanese culture just

227
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,060
from having been a Japanese major.

228
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,380
And I sort of grew out of my whole anime fangirl-ness.

229
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,580
And I use grow out of in quote-y fingers just because I'm not as interested in a lot of

230
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,820
stuff because it's geared toward teenagers.

231
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,700
It's not really my thing, except I totally love Kill la Kill right now.

232
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,900
Totally awesome.

233
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,860
But I really have been trying to focus more on my art.

234
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,620
So this time I went around and looked at different types of papers and looked at textiles.

235
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,660
And I bought myself...

236
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,060
It's a huroshiki, which is like a wrapping cloth, but I got one with cats on it.

237
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,420
And I hang it in my cube.

238
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,140
It was really cute.

239
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:04,180
And basically my point around this time was just to find different things that I thought

240
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,140
would stimulate me.

241
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,140
Not in that way.

242
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,660
Oh, it's that kind of birthday, huh?

243
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,340
As an artist.

244
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,580
And so that was really...

245
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,620
We watched some dances.

246
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,020
We watched...

247
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,020
There was a big Taigo presentation, which was pretty awesome.

248
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,660
Nice.

249
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,860
And then I got stuff for my desk and stuff and things.

250
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,980
Well, sounds like you had a good day.

251
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,500
And let's see my friend Tamara over on Clement Street.

252
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,660
She was working for a clothing designer.

253
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,300
So I got to really check out some home done textiles and everything.

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,260
Well, happy birthday once again from all of us here at OLR to you.

255
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,580
Thank you.

256
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,660
And I hope you get more presents before the week's up, because some birthdays tend to

257
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,420
go all week, so you never know what might happen.

258
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,260
So all right.

259
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,020
If the OLR listeners want to send you a taco or something, because I have had people come

260
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,100
to me saying, how can I send Jamie a taco?

261
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,620
I want to make Jamie happy for her birthday.

262
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,060
How can I send her a taco?

263
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,900
So I'll tell you what, if you want to make me happy, this is what you can do.

264
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,420
You can send me money.

265
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,340
No, I'm kidding.

266
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,580
What I actually, if you want to make me happy, I want to send her a money taco.

267
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,060
This is what I want you to do.

268
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:26,660
I want you to find a local animal rescue and give them some cat food or adopt a cat and

269
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,060
send me a picture of the cat that you adopted.

270
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,340
Oh, that's what I want you to do for my birthday is to adopt a cat or to at least donate food

271
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,020
to because some people are allergic to cats.

272
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,140
So to animal rescues because they need it.

273
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,660
The people who foster the cats need food and it keeps, it keeps from, you know, killing

274
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,220
an animal.

275
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,540
That's only fault is that it just was homeless.

276
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,140
Well, you know what?

277
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,620
That is, that is one thing better than a taco is cats.

278
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,220
Yeah, there you go.

279
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,100
Sounds wrong, Rob.

280
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,660
I didn't mean to eat the cat.

281
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,260
Let the cat eat the taco.

282
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,540
I just didn't think you were into pussy.

283
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,620
But anyway, on a serious note, I can always make an exception, dark soccer.

284
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:13,940
I adopted Midna and I would really like to see, you know, more people give, especially

285
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,780
older cats, give older cats a chance.

286
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,260
That's great.

287
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,380
Well, taking it back to video games a little bit, since we are a video game podcast, I

288
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,340
want to talk here a little bit on our kickoff topic about some things going on.

289
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,980
And I want to talk to Flaco a little bit too, because Flaco, you know, you've, you've still

290
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,220
been playing quite a few games since the last time we talked to you.

291
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,340
And I know you're mostly a gamer on the Sony platforms, right?

292
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes, I am.

293
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,300
I recently got a PS4 like a couple months ago, and I really enjoy it.

294
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,260
Played all of the games you get with PlayStation Plus.

295
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,340
But, and I guess, I don't know if you know this, or not a lot of my friends might know

296
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,940
this, but I bought my wife a Wii U for her birthday.

297
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,780
I do because you were telling me to add her on the Wii U thing.

298
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,180
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,060
I still haven't done it because you'll see my Wii U is still not hooked up from the move.

300
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,500
But I found her really, if you really want to, I guess you could.

301
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,220
I do really want to, because we want to play Wind Waker HD.

302
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,060
That's exactly the reason I got it though.

303
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,900
Because Wind Waker, but sure.

304
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,140
If you want to run it or something, yourself, I don't know.

305
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,940
It's worth it.

306
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,580
But that's the game.

307
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,740
It's my wife's favorite game ever is Wind Waker.

308
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,740
And I found a really good deal on the Wind Waker HD bundle and I got it.

309
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,860
And it was like an amazing deal.

310
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,460
It was used, but the little game pad that has the Triforce stuff.

311
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,940
Yes.

312
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,660
She loves it.

313
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,620
My wife loves it.

314
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,740
She went crazy for it.

315
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,820
So she's been playing that pretty much nonstop and I've been helping her when she gets stuck

316
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,500
and it's been really fun.

317
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,780
And the kids love it too.

318
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,420
Like my son just gets a kick whenever, uh, Link does like the different, uh, melodies,

319
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,380
you know, with the Wind Waker, he does a little conducting or whatever.

320
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,860
Uh, my son like hums along with it and it's really awesome.

321
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,740
So that is so precious hearing how the whole family gets involved in gaming.

322
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,780
Oh, it's so adorable.

323
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,220
I just want to hug you all.

324
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,380
I mean, that's such a good news story, right?

325
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,980
So why, why does Nintendo keep flopping in the eyes of the game?

326
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,820
I mean, obviously sales are sales.

327
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,420
They're not selling as many as competitors.

328
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,540
That's just, you know, the way it is.

329
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,380
But why, why is Wii U flopping when you have such positive things to say about it, you

330
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,940
think?

331
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,340
I, cause there's really not that much to play on it.

332
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,660
Like, I don't know what she's going to do when she's done with Wind Waker.

333
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
Mario Kart 8 will be out maybe.

334
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,260
She's not a big Mario Kart fan.

335
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,060
I want to play it though.

336
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,540
So we might rent it first and see if we both like it.

337
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,380
I see, I play, I play more on the PlayStation.

338
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,540
So, and I have a Vita too.

339
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,980
She got me a Vita for Christmas.

340
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,780
So I had to try to top that and get her a Wii U for her birthday.

341
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,220
And I got the PS4 just out of the blue.

342
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,180
I thought it was a family thing.

343
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,620
She's like, Oh no, that's your system.

344
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,260
I don't want to play that.

345
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,700
It was like, Oh, well I feel really bad.

346
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,980
Well, let me get you a Wii U.

347
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,940
So at least you guys, at least you guys can watch the PlayStation live together and enjoy

348
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,100
the people showing their titties and their dongs.

349
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,580
We did that.

350
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,660
We didn't see any of the racy stuff.

351
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,540
I mean, somewhat racy stuff, but nothing, no nudity.

352
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,660
We didn't see the night we were just perusing that we had friends over.

353
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:56,900
Of course.

354
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,460
So what do you do?

355
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,500
You turn on play room.

356
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,900
Right.

357
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,180
Or PlayStation live.

358
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,580
Look at the playroom streams and see how ridiculous it is.

359
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,060
So, uh, but yeah, nothing too crazy.

360
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,780
Just a lot of like, really like poor living room setups.

361
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,780
I would say really depressing.

362
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,860
Like, Oh, it's so dirty in your living room.

363
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,540
Clean up your house.

364
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,460
That's one big reason I don't do the play.

365
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,980
When you do, when you do the streams on like Final Fantasy 14, which I have streamed on

366
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,500
Twitch, your head's in a little box that they can't see anything about my little head in

367
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,980
a box.

368
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,700
That's that's nice.

369
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,500
That's enough.

370
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,940
That's all we need to see.

371
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,500
That's all you need.

372
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,260
But playroom, it's in those poor robots.

373
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,100
I feel bad for those poor robots.

374
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,620
They had to sit there and look at all that terrible debauchery going on and they look

375
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,580
so shocked sometimes.

376
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,220
What were you going to say to our Sakura?

377
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,940
Nothing.

378
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,340
Nothing.

379
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,260
Nevermind.

380
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,900
Bad for the robots.

381
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,940
What have you been playing on your, on your console, the PS4?

382
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,100
On the PS4, I've been playing mostly don't starve.

383
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,940
And, uh, again, for the kids, Lego Marvel superheroes.

384
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,820
But yeah, don't starve.

385
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,100
I've really, I really got into, it's one of the reasons I really wanted the PS4.

386
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,060
I went to extra for his house and he has a PS4 and I, that had just come out and he's

387
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,180
like, it's okay.

388
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,820
But you could have bought that for like $7 on steam.

389
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Well, I'm glad I didn't cause my PC's broken now.

390
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,140
So like all the other games I bought on steam, I can't play it now.

391
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,460
Touche, but no, I love it.

392
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I just, I like controllers better anyway.

393
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,020
So, uh, I've really enjoyed that game.

394
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,860
I put a lot of time into it.

395
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm not, I'm not very good at it, but I finally got to adventure mode, which to get to adventure

396
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,620
mode and don't starve.

397
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,060
You have to play the regular survival mode and then you have to find a door randomly

398
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,700
as you're surviving and kind of exploring.

399
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,340
So I just made it, made it my mission to just explore.

400
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,860
I just go out and try to find this stupid door that I could never find cause I'd always

401
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,740
die before I found it.

402
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,620
Mm hmm.

403
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,100
Cause I finally found it.

404
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,060
Is that the one that goes into the caves?

405
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,540
No, no, that's a, that's if you go into a, if you dig up a grave, I think you can go,

406
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,860
or you can spelunk and you can go down there.

407
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,620
I didn't do, I've only done a little bit of that, but no, this is, it's a giant door.

408
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,900
It looks like a door to hell and it's like, do you want to go inside?

409
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,300
And when you do, max, the villain, I guess that the game shows up and he's like, uh,

410
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,140
if you can survive five worlds, you know, you can find my door and find me.

411
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,500
That's how you beat it, I guess.

412
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,300
Oh, I had no idea.

413
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,820
There's like a, there's like a story mode in there, but unfortunately to, to, to get

414
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,660
in there, you have to find it first in the regular, but you kind of have to make it your

415
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,540
mission to find the door.

416
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,460
What's cool is once you find the door, whenever you die doing the five doors thing, you don't

417
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,060
go back to, you know, nothing.

418
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,860
You go back to the point you first found the door.

419
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,580
So that now is my save file for adventure mode.

420
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,100
And then if I ever want to play the game, survival style, just create another, another

421
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,220
new, new, new game.

422
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,020
And I just do that.

423
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,740
So, okay.

424
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,700
It's been really fun.

425
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
I learned something about don't starve.

426
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,860
Yeah, there's, there's a hidden like story mode, I guess.

427
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,900
So awesome.

428
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,420
And it being PlayStation plus, I'm sure you, you're snatching up all those free games.

429
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,660
Like what?

430
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,180
Mercenary Kings this month.

431
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,500
Yeah.

432
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,620
I had trouble playing mercenary Kings, so I haven't really got into that yet.

433
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,060
It's like press down to fix something up.

434
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,620
I pressed down.

435
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,420
I couldn't pick it up.

436
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,500
I don't know if it's because it's playing on the inventory is full.

437
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,860
Is that why?

438
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,020
Yeah.

439
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
That's what I learned first.

440
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,540
You can only hold like one or two things in the beginning.

441
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:01,940
Wow.

442
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,180
Okay.

443
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,980
Well, that's my problem.

444
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,540
I can't get past the very, it's like, put some C-shirt in this door.

445
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,780
Sure.

446
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,260
Something with me.

447
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,540
I sure there we go.

448
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,300
I was like, well, this game, I can't play.

449
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,940
I thought it was a bug.

450
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,300
Like I'm playing on the VITA.

451
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,220
I do a lot of remote play on my VITA.

452
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,740
And so I was like, well, maybe it's some VITA bug where it's not registering me pressing

453
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,140
down.

454
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,420
Like I'm like squatting.

455
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,860
I'm like, I'm not putting this C4 down.

456
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,900
Like it says I'm supposed to.

457
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,300
Yeah.

458
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,060
So I, or picking it up.

459
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,540
I don't know.

460
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,500
It's you have to use the C4 you already have, and then you can pick up the other one.

461
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,460
I see.

462
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,100
Well, there you go.

463
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,260
So I'm stuck on that, but yeah, we played outlast.

464
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,220
That was pretty awesome.

465
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,500
I've only, we're halfway through it.

466
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,980
We stopped cause we had some friends over and we're like, let's play through this.

467
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,460
And we got through halfway and it's like, well, we have to go home.

468
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,980
Like, oh, you don't want to stay up till two in the morning.

469
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,220
But so yeah, we didn't finish that.

470
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,700
But I really like, I really liked that game so far too.

471
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,740
And again, I know it's a PC game, but I don't really have a workable PC.

472
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,300
So I've enjoyed playing on the PS4.

473
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Um, besides just talking about what you've been playing on Sony recently, I wanted to

474
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,260
use this as an opportunity to talk about this too, because I'm sure some of our chatters

475
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,540
want to bring this up as well.

476
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,380
But speaking of all the Sony stuff going on, I'm sure you heard about that insane sale

477
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,020
they're having this weekend where they're, you know, they're giving steam a little competition

478
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,380
with this whole deep discounting 99 cents for what?

479
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,020
30 games.

480
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,660
I think they have on sale for 99, 30 or 34, something like that.

481
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,540
34, 35.

482
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,660
And, you know, obviously you're not going to get anything new, new, and it's not just

483
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,300
PS Plus.

484
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,500
That was the other surprising thing.

485
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,740
I thought for sure it was going to be PlayStation Plus only, but it's not.

486
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,460
It's for everybody.

487
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,900
Should be 50 cents for PS Plus.

488
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,420
I'm greedy.

489
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,740
Um, but, uh, yeah, I'm just really surprised.

490
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,500
Now you've got some stuff that's like really old.

491
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,940
You got some classics in there, like Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot.

492
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,060
But like, those are games I really remember from PS One.

493
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,460
So I was like, oh, for 99 cents, shit, I'll pick it up again.

494
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,340
So I can play it on the Vita.

495
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,740
Why not?

496
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,300
Right.

497
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,060
But then there's some stuff that's only a couple of years old, like Telltale has quite

498
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,580
a few things like the Jurassic Park game, Back to the Future.

499
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,820
And it's not just like one episode for 99 cents.

500
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,140
It's all four or five episodes for 99 cents.

501
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,580
That's a really good deal.

502
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,300
So if you are a PlayStation owner, I think the sale is only good through Monday at 7

503
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,940
a.m.

504
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,340
So if you're listening live, go get them.

505
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,260
If you're listening on the podcast, sorry, you missed it because it's over now.

506
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,940
I still haven't downloaded one of them, but I was really considering Jurassic Park.

507
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,180
That's that's the main one.

508
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,380
Well, I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

509
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,860
All right.

510
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,340
I did buy it.

511
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,820
So you have it.

512
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,700
You haven't taken advantage.

513
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,620
I haven't taken advantage of it because like you said, mostly.

514
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,020
Well, the other problem is I have a huge backlog on my PS3 and my PS3 is in the bedroom now.

515
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,580
It got moved once the Wii U joined the...

516
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,420
You had to play the same game I did.

517
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,220
Who ultimately gets to stay on the TV.

518
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,700
And it could have stayed out in the living room, but it's like, it'd be nice to have

519
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,740
a thing in the bedroom to finally watch, you know, Netflix and stuff in the bedroom.

520
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,220
So we moved it back there and I still have to play the Bioshock Infinite DLC.

521
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,140
I had to play the Last of Us DLC extra.

522
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,500
Let me borrow his game so I can do that.

523
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,220
I saw South Park to play and I have, you know, the PlayStation 3, you know, the PS Plus games.

524
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,540
Yeah.

525
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,300
I wanted I really like remember me.

526
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,340
I'm like halfway through that.

527
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,500
I think there's too much to play.

528
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,540
It is like a steam thing now where it's and it's another reason I'm not too sad.

529
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,340
My computer broke because I'm like, well, I've got enough to play already.

530
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,660
So I guess I guess I can just play my console stuff.

531
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,180
Who needs Microsoft Word?

532
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,300
I've got video games to play.

533
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,860
There you go.

534
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
Who needs that?

535
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,780
I don't need an internet.

536
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,500
I have a 10 year old computer I can do Microsoft Word with, but I can't game on it.

537
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,020
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

538
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,620
SSJ100Matt says, I actually didn't know about this sale until just now.

539
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,220
BRB buying all the things.

540
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,500
We helped one person out.

541
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,980
Hooray.

542
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,740
I feel, I feel a lot better here at OLR.

543
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,860
Let's see.

544
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,020
Gamer girl says plants versus zombies.

545
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,540
I'm thinking that's something she picked up.

546
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,580
That looks like a good one.

547
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,860
But again, I meant to check.

548
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,540
Is that on the Vita or is that just on the, I don't think that's on the Vita.

549
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,580
I think that's just the PS3.

550
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,020
I think that's only PS3.

551
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I want to say the Vita one was a plus game.

552
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,140
Sometimes it was, but it was before I got the subscription.

553
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,900
Sadly, cause I actually, well, I'll get in that later, but all right.

554
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,780
Gaming week stuff.

555
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,340
I don't know.

556
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,820
That's fine.

557
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,460
That's fine.

558
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,180
Uh, let's see.

559
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,580
Dungeon buster says retro city rampage is 99 cents and steam marked it down to the same

560
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,080
price.

561
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,460
So, Oh, a little, little comment.

562
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,180
And that's a good one.

563
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,900
If you haven't checked that out, extra for, uh, your brother-in-law, uh, co-star of a

564
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,460
hoard house Wednesday nights on the network loves that game.

565
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,140
Talks a lot about that.

566
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,460
No way.

567
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm getting mixed up with hotline.

568
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:06,980
Miami.

569
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,700
Oh, nevermind.

570
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,260
I'm sorry.

571
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,540
I was like, I've heard good things about our just city ravages, but yeah, I know he loves

572
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:11,860
hot love.

573
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,420
No, it's Holly.

574
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,740
Miami.

575
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,700
I was thinking of, nevermind.

576
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,660
That was already free anyway.

577
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,620
We'll just, we'll make it up and say extra for likes a retro city ramp.

578
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,900
I bet he would, if he played it.

579
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,260
Loki likes our diversity rampage.

580
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,100
Uh, nice.

581
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,660
Not to buy it.

582
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,900
Tokyo jungle is the other one that, but again, that sounds like a huge time sink and I'm

583
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,420
like, I don't, I paid $15 for that stupid game.

584
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,620
No, actually Tokyo jungle.

585
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,340
Here's the thing about that.

586
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,820
It plays a lot like an arcade game to me where, and if you play it in little chunks, like

587
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,300
every time you play and die within five minutes, you're still getting, you're still investing

588
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,100
in your save that you can use to buy more animals or do progress in the story a little

589
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,740
more later on.

590
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,100
Like you don't get very far each time until you kind of build.

591
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,500
It's one of those games you build on each death.

592
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,140
Uh, it's a lot like, what the hell is that game where you're in the castle?

593
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,180
It's like Castlevania.

594
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,260
Uh, God damn it slipped my mind.

595
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,620
I used to play this game a lot.

596
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,660
Jason's a big fan of it.

597
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:08,820
I know.

598
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,900
No, I don't know.

599
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,780
I've never played that.

600
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,340
It's the one where you play the descendants of all the characters.

601
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,060
Magica.

602
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,100
Why is it?

603
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,580
No, no idea.

604
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,380
Somebody will yell it out in chat in two seconds here.

605
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,340
Then I'll feel stupid.

606
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,740
Oh, I can't.

607
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,540
I remember the name of the damn game because you're old and the castle shuffles each time

608
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,020
you play.

609
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,860
Shut up.

610
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,300
You're the one that had a birthday.

611
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,940
I don't know why.

612
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,340
I don't know.

613
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,700
Thank you.

614
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,260
Rogue leg.

615
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,060
Okay.

616
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Alan just popped in.

617
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,220
Alan saved me again.

618
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,460
Yes.

619
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
It was rogue legacy.

620
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,300
Thank you, Alan.

621
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,380
And Jason just yelled it out in chat too.

622
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,940
Like that.

623
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,380
I don't even remember why I was bringing that game up now.

624
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,780
All right.

625
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,340
Let's talk about Tokyo jungle.

626
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,700
That's why.

627
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:55,940
Yeah.

628
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,020
Tokyo jungle is a great for 99 cents.

629
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,580
Heck yeah.

630
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,700
If you got to go, if you're listening to my life, you got to go get it.

631
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,620
Just it's 99 cents.

632
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,180
Like, you know, the other cool thing about Tokyo jungle is it is one of the very few

633
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,500
PS3 games that works with Vita remote play.

634
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,940
That's right.

635
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,220
The very, very few.

636
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,100
And they look ugly.

637
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,140
I looked, I played Pagle.

638
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,700
I have Pagle.

639
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,100
Pagle nights on PS3.

640
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,660
It plays with Vita remote play and it looks terrible.

641
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,060
Nothing like what the PS4 games look like.

642
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,660
Well, PSP had remote play a little bit too, but yeah, I never had one of those.

643
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,620
There was so few.

644
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,780
Like it worked with the minis and the PS1 and the PS1 games.

645
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,020
And you could do some of the video streaming and that stuff too.

646
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,460
That all existed on the PSP, but it was just one of those features nobody really talked

647
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,700
about.

648
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,740
But I remember going like, why isn't Sony doing more with this?

649
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,260
Because this technology is awesome.

650
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,300
Well, even the PS3, they didn't do that with the PS3 and the Vita.

651
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,420
Maybe it's because they're working on the PS4, but Oh, and the other thing I wanted to

652
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,500
tell you, you got Spyro and Crash Bandicoot, but I believe those don't work on the Vita

653
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,220
remote play.

654
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,780
What?

655
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,580
I know.

656
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,540
Oh crap.

657
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,420
Or not even remote play.

658
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,620
I just mean like, you know, I guess cross play, whatever you call it, like it worked

659
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,420
on both platforms.

660
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,100
Those are some of the few titles that aren't compatible for some reason.

661
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,900
It's part of the reason.

662
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,340
I know that's one of the reasons I wanted to get them.

663
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,140
I saw in the comments, everybody's like, Oh, why won't you make this work on Vita?

664
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,180
But maybe they will eventually.

665
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,260
Oh, well, at least it was only two bucks.

666
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,260
I thought the same thing like, Oh, that'd be great to play on my Vita.

667
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,740
And then I read all the people in the comments saying, uh, it would be nice if these actually

668
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,900
worked on Vita, but it's not on the compatibility list.

669
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,900
I'm hoping maybe with all that PlayStation Now stuff in the future too, that putting

670
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,900
those games in my library, when PlayStation Now is out, will let me, I'm hoping, I mean,

671
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,460
they haven't really said, oh, that's all going to work yet, but I'm hoping that maybe

672
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,900
flagging those games as purchased will enable it in PlayStation Now down there.

673
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,220
I think if you got it digitally, they should do that, but you never know.

674
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,860
Yeah, you never know.

675
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,580
You really don't.

676
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,340
I mean, then there's this whole debacle with The Last of Us on PlayStation 4 when it just

677
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,860
was out, but we'll talk about that later.

678
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,020
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about our frame of reference, the types of stuff

679
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,780
that we have been playing this week.

680
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,660
Dark Sakura, what have you been up to on your birthday week?

681
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,020
Um, Animal Crossing.

682
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,780
Um, I got a game called Kami, uh, which is like an origami based puzzle game.

683
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,420
It's kind of neat.

684
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:09,140
Um, played to Mass Effect because I've got my mods working again and my shepherd looks

685
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,620
awesome.

686
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,620
I can't wait to play Mass Effect 3 on my new PC.

687
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,100
Did I talk about that on this show yet?

688
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,460
I talked about it on Bobby's show, but not here.

689
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,140
Uh, Alan built me a new PC yesterday, so happy me.

690
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,060
They make a dude mods.

691
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,420
Oh yeah.

692
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,780
There's some good ones out there too.

693
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,580
There's also, um, someone did a, a version that you can use Caden's hair.

694
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,800
Okay.

695
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,580
Um, and someone made a, uh, a front curl mohawk.

696
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,860
That's actually kind of cool looking.

697
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,620
Did you see, uh, pics of the cosplay from PAX East with the, did we talk about this

698
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,260
this week?

699
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,900
Yes, we did.

700
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,220
Okay.

701
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,180
And he twerked.

702
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,240
Yes.

703
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
This is more of those pictures are coming out.

704
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,640
What's the name of my other tumbler?

705
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,320
Mass effecting.

706
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,560
I couldn't remember if we talked about the show.

707
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,160
Yeah, I guess the chat room is right.

708
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm having Alzheimer's in my old age.

709
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
That's what Raginator says.

710
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,760
Thanks.

711
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,720
Eat more blueberries.

712
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,600
I guess.

713
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
Well, that's going to have blueberries in it, right?

714
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,160
No, that was us.

715
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
Those were black currants.

716
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,040
God, I think I need more ginkgo blueberries.

717
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,400
Thank God it's not just me.

718
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
I was like, those are blueberries, right?

719
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,360
They're really good though.

720
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,840
They're good.

721
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,960
Currants are better than blueberries in my opinion.

722
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,160
And I'm always right.

723
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,400
Are they, are they currently better than blueberries?

724
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,600
But, um, I, uh, I was going to play some fun.

725
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,040
I think I did play a little Final Fantasy 14 this week or I might've, but, um, I'm planning

726
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:43,560
on, um, assuming that I can get my shift trade on Tuesday, then I will be playing a good

727
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,080
bit of that while I'm trying to stay awake.

728
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,240
If not, then whatever.

729
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,680
But I want, I want any people to run with me and help me level some more.

730
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,680
Let me tag along.

731
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:55,960
We'll see.

732
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,520
I want to do a Brayflop again.

733
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,320
Wait until you get that one on hard mode.

734
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,840
It's hilarious because the whole dungeon is fighting over cheese.

735
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,040
I want someone to run me through a Brayflop tonight.

736
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,600
There you go.

737
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,480
Well, we'll see.

738
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,760
Maybe I can live stream now.

739
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,440
Cause that's something I can actually do.

740
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,640
I can see how cute I am.

741
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
We already know.

742
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,920
I know.

743
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,400
Well, my character's extra cute and her feline adorableness.

744
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,760
All right.

745
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,080
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I'll go over to Flocko.

746
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
Bitch I wasn't done.

747
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm kidding.

748
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,600
Excuse me.

749
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,640
Go on.

750
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,520
No, no, no, I'm done.

751
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,760
All right.

752
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,160
Flocko.

753
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,360
How was your gaming week?

754
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,320
I had a pretty good gaming week cause I had most of the week off of work.

755
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,000
So I played a lot of Vita games and I played Lego Marvel superheroes on PS4 cause my kids

756
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,120
really liked that.

757
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,640
And it's funny cause my kids like to either stand in front of the TV or if I'm playing

758
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,760
on Vita, they stand, they like lean their heads in front of the Vita, you know, to try

759
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,880
to see everything.

760
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,280
So I actually did the remote play and when you do it on the Vita, you know, it plays

761
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,080
on both at once.

762
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
So if they're standing in front of the TV, I just look down on the Vita.

763
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,880
If they're putting their head in front of the Vita, I just look up at the TV and it

764
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,440
worked great.

765
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,960
So they love that game.

766
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,600
It's pretty fun.

767
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
I've never played a Lego game before.

768
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,720
And I'd always kind of badmouth them cause like, oh, it is kids games, whatever.

769
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
But it's actually really fun.

770
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,680
And it's, there's a lot of cool like inside jokes.

771
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,920
There's a part where you're like tumbling through a whatever portal to Asgard.

772
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,440
I'm not much of a Marvel guy either.

773
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,760
Sorry.

774
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,720
But you're going through some kind of portal to Asgard.

775
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,440
And as you're like tumbling through a TARDIS, like flies by the other way, like a little

776
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,160
Lego TARDIS.

777
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,280
It was really cute and funny.

778
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,440
So yeah, I played that.

779
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,240
I finally beat little big planet Vita after.

780
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,880
Oh, nice.

781
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,920
Yeah, it was really fun.

782
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,960
They did a really good job.

783
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,720
I had my doubts cause it's not medium molecule that did it, but they actually did probably

784
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,440
one of the better story modes they've ever had in a little big planet game.

785
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,600
I like the mechanic of the pushing the bricks by using the rear touch pad and the front

786
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,080
touch pad.

787
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,680
That was kind of a neat little thing.

788
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah, that was a fun level.

789
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,520
And actually my son played that one with me and I had him like touch the bricks, at least

790
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,400
on the front.

791
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,840
He got pretty good at the back touch too.

792
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,080
He realized when he touched it, at least on the Vita, uh, excuse me, on the, on the

793
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,960
little big planet Vita, as opposed to other games that have back touch, sometimes it gives

794
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,920
you a little indicator, like a cursor where your finger is.

795
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
And so he figured that out.

796
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,480
So he was able to really use that to take, hit the blocks for me or kill enemies or I

797
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,000
think there's a level we had to guide missiles.

798
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
He did that for me too.

799
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,880
It was really fun.

800
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,400
It was like father son play time.

801
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,640
And we were both sick that week bonding.

802
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,880
You guys are the cutest video games.

803
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,040
He's not great at the control stuff, but you know, in the age of like iPads and on all

804
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,640
that stuff, he loves touch stuff.

805
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,600
So the Vita stuff, he's really been able to get into more than the PS3.

806
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,720
Cause if he has three, he has a hard time with the controls, but touch controls are

807
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,360
so intuitive.

808
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,520
It's like, Oh, I can just put this here.

809
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,200
I realized my fingers moving around and, and yeah, he does a great job with that.

810
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,840
So, so yeah, I played some gravity rush on Vita.

811
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,200
I really love that game.

812
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,320
Almost done with that, I think.

813
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,360
And lots of Wind Waker with my wife playing.

814
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,800
Uh, let's see.

815
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,360
Tiger Claw in chat talking about the Lego thing you're saying.

816
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,600
Tiger Claw says, maybe that's a sign that we can expect Lego, Lego Doctor Who.

817
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,840
And Kaijuta says, Lego, stay away from Doctor Who.

818
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,960
Dark Tetsuya says, I kind of want the Lego movie game.

819
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,840
I heard that one wasn't so good though.

820
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,880
That's they usually get good reviews, but I heard that one didn't get very good reviews

821
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,120
because I feel like it's that, that classic case of a movie marketing game.

822
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,040
It had to come out as the movie release date.

823
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,400
I've heard it's kind of unfinished.

824
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,960
You know what I mean?

825
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
Jamie just gasped.

826
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,360
Are you okay?

827
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,520
Cause today is also George Takei's birthday.

828
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, it is?

829
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,560
Oh wow.

830
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,720
So happy birthday to my, uh,

831
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,360
Oh my.

832
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,760
To the man I want to adopt me.

833
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,280
Happy birthday.

834
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,200
Uh, let's see.

835
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Uh, yeah, I'm just thinking about the whole, uh, Lego and Doctor Who thing.

836
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,080
It just makes me think like, do you want me to make every nerd out there cringe right now?

837
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,400
Watch.

838
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,800
Okay.

839
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,280
Watch.

840
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,800
So Lego does a Doctor Who video game and they let Moffat write it.

841
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,560
Sorry.

842
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,120
Sorry.

843
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,280
Look, art as this show is art is to elicit a reaction.

844
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,440
And I just gave a reaction.

845
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,160
I just reacted too.

846
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,520
Jamie showed me her middle finger.

847
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,320
That was the reaction.

848
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,440
All right.

849
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,640
Oh, I did what I did play one PS3 game this week.

850
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,440
And that was the cave.

851
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,680
Cause that's another game of Vaclav that I haven't finished yet.

852
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,120
And I think I'm almost done with that one.

853
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Hey, Jamie says, ew, she hates the cave.

854
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,120
No, no, no, no.

855
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Did you know the man who invented the Frisbee was cremated after he died and made into a Frisbee?

856
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,120
No.

857
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,240
You're so weird.

858
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,400
Don't bring this stuff up on the show.

859
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,720
It's not appropriate unless he's made into Legos.

860
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,520
Thank you, Rob.

861
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,080
Plastic.

862
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,720
I don't know.

863
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,520
Yeah, it works.

864
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,080
It's a toy.

865
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,080
And the cave is, I believe one of the games included in the recent Humble Bundle.

866
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,760
I don't know if it's current, but it's recent.

867
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,880
I think you're right.

868
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,080
I know for Android.

869
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,200
I think it's one of those ones that's on Android and PC or maybe just Android.

870
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,640
I think it was an Android bundle and then it was on PS Plus some time ago too.

871
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,400
It was also free on Amazon not long ago, Amazon mobile.

872
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,520
And I got it there too, but I'm still trying to play the PSV version first.

873
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,280
All right.

874
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,440
Is that it for your gaming week?

875
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,000
That's all.

876
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,560
All right.

877
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,680
I'll talk about my gaming week.

878
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:14,840
Okay.

879
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,000
So I teased one for you, Flaco, a little bit ago in that 99 cent sale.

880
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,800
I went crazy.

881
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,240
And one of the games I bought, I bought the Jurassic Park game.

882
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,840
And some people are saying 99 cents.

883
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,000
You still pay too much for the Jurassic Park game.

884
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,520
Here's the, I guess the game, you know, Telltale does a lot of great games.

885
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,880
They've done so, so much, you know, obviously walking dead was phenomenal.

886
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,480
And, um, the monkey islands and, you know, they do a lot of good stuff, but

887
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Jurassic Park did not get such good reviews.

888
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,240
So, but I liked the movie an awful lot, Jurassic Park.

889
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I don't read a lot, a lot of books, but I read Jurassic Park when I was younger.

890
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,040
I read that whole books and there's, there's so many differences between the

891
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,200
book and the movie, by the way, if you didn't know, like everybody dies in the

892
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,320
book, everybody dies in the book.

893
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
I've read the books.

894
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,320
You're totally right.

895
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,880
Yeah.

896
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,280
So anyway, anyway, I didn't, I didn't mean to get on that tangent, but

897
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,800
Jurassic Parks had a very interesting history with gaming because my first

898
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,960
reaction to playing the Jurassic Park game on PlayStation was this game would

899
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,800
have been awesome 15 years ago.

900
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,600
But the games we got, uh, for Jurassic Park on the Genesis and on Super

901
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
Nintendo were, were very different.

902
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
And they were, they were like the Genesis one was huge.

903
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,160
I don't know if you guys remember, but the Jurassic Park on the Genesis was

904
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,480
like a hugely popular game because you had to play as the dinosaur.

905
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
And so that made it like, it was very different and all that.

906
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,640
You ever, Jamie, you're the Sega fan in the house.

907
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,280
Did you, did you ever play Jurassic Park on the Genesis?

908
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,720
Cause, Oh, it's that in the lab.

909
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,120
Mind you, when I was growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.

910
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,760
That's true.

911
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,000
Dan was the big Sega boy and he showed me another way when I moved out here.

912
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,280
Well, Aladdin was the other big movie tie in game, but then on the Super

913
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,040
Nintendo, it was really weird.

914
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,480
Like that was that whole when like virtual reality was really big and like

915
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,200
doom and all that.

916
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,280
So they actually put like a doom-esque, doom-esque component first person into

917
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,880
Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo, where you like go in these buildings and

918
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,200
the velociraptors are in the buildings.

919
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,240
And it was actually really cool.

920
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,400
It was really scary for like a Super Nintendo game.

921
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,520
It was pretty, it was pretty neat.

922
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,920
I'm sure if you went back and played it today, it would be like super crude,

923
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,680
but there's only one thing I can think of.

924
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,680
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

925
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:20,920
Okay.

926
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,760
Anyway, so for whatever reason, Telltale got this license and like 15 years later

927
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,520
is making a Jurassic Park game that is really reminiscent in many ways of an old

928
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,640
Sega CD game.

929
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Like, remember when like full motion video was all the craze and all that,

930
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,120
like it's the game itself is very simple.

931
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,600
You know, it's a lot of just like exploring different scenes and looking at

932
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,120
things in different scenes.

933
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,640
And then the other half of the game is basically like QuickTime movie, the game

934
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,400
where it's like, you know, press X and react really quick, press O and react

935
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,600
really quick and R1 and jiggle the controller and move it in circles and all

936
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:58,920
this stuff.

937
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,720
And, and like, if you do something right, then hooray, you live.

938
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,680
But if you do something wrong, Oh, a dinosaur just ate a little girl.

939
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,880
Like, and yes, that can happen in the game.

940
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,920
And so it's kind of like, it's very like, almost like, like dragon's lair meets

941
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,000
a CD game of yesteryear.

942
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,800
So it's, it's kind of retro in that respect too.

943
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,760
Now, this might sound like I'm dogging on the game, but I'm actually not because

944
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,600
I actually, I'm enjoying it.

945
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,880
Like I'm play, I'm halfway through episode two right now.

946
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,920
And what I'm getting a big kick out of is how they made this 15 year old movie

947
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,480
relevant again, by creating this whole side story that didn't exist in the books

948
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:39,800
and everything.

949
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Basically, it's like fan fiction.

950
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,120
You're playing a fan fiction game, but it works like it.

951
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,960
And if you guys didn't know what they did is they use, they use some of the

952
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,520
unresolved subplots in the movie, because like, for example, you know,

953
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,320
and I have spoilers for like a 15 year old movie people.

954
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,280
It's probably even older than that.

955
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I saw it in high school a long time ago.

956
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,800
So, so in the movie, there's the guy Nedry, right?

957
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,040
Who was, what's his name on Seinfeld?

958
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,840
Newman, Newman on Seinfeld.

959
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,360
You forgot to say the magic word.

960
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,080
Uh, so he tries, he tries to get off the island, right?

961
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,760
And, uh, cause he's, the whole thing is he's smuggling dinosaur embryos to a

962
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,040
rival company off the island, but he gets killed by the dinosaur.

963
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,720
He's the one that shuts down the security.

964
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,000
He tries to drive out, but, and he gets killed by the dinosaur because

965
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
security's shut down.

966
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,120
Right.

967
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,200
Before you say this, is this about the shaving can?

968
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,600
Yes.

969
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,240
Oh my gosh.

970
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,120
That's amazing.

971
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,400
That's like every fan fiction about Jurassic Park because they never go

972
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,120
anywhere with it.

973
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,280
It gets, it's almost like it gets preserved.

974
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,640
It falls into the mud.

975
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,160
It sinks down and you never see it again.

976
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,240
It's not even brought up in the game.

977
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,960
Oh my gosh.

978
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,080
Because did you know that the whole time there was a plan B because Nedry was

979
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,800
going to meet people at the docks and then he never showed up.

980
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
So the people at the docks go looking for him.

981
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
That's how the game starts.

982
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,840
That's amazing.

983
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,160
So, and then they have that and then they introduce these characters, but

984
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,800
they're making reference to what happens in the movie.

985
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Like, you know, there's this one thing where you're looking through a

986
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,200
triceratops pan and you see a Jeep and they go, why is there a Jeep out

987
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,360
there?

988
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,120
And they're like, oh, uh, they have some hot shot paleontologists here looking

989
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,960
at the park today type of thing.

990
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,360
And then in another scene where you get to the visitor center, you see a

991
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,400
helicopter flying away in the background, which signals that that was the end of

992
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,120
the movie right there.

993
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,680
So it is kind of neat how they created this whole universe that runs

994
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,800
concurrently with the movies.

995
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,120
So from the story perspective, I'm kind of like, and I went back and read

996
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,640
some reviews for the games and a lot of the reviews really razzed the story.

997
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,480
I didn't think, I don't think the story is bad at all.

998
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm like, the story's kind of better than the lost world was.

999
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,920
Sorry about it, but the lost world was ridiculous.

1000
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Like the chick does gymnastics to kick up a lost raptor in the face.

1001
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,320
Really?

1002
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,840
I mean, that reminds you guys about the plot of the lost world.

1003
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,280
It was kind of ridiculous.

1004
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,720
So the game in sorts is kind of a better sequel in that regard.

1005
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,320
I will say this though, from a technical perspective, the game needed some

1006
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,800
tightening up.

1007
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,560
I don't know if this is unique to PS3, but like I'm talking like frame skips,

1008
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,080
little hiccups, like you hit the button to react to something and like, I can

1009
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,560
hear that Sega CD switching to another track in my mind and then skip, skip,

1010
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,960
skip, skip.

1011
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Oh, play the new scene.

1012
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
It's like, wow.

1013
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,560
So I've had an issue with Telltale games on PS3, sadly, because I have, uh,

1014
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,640
Poker Night 2 and The Walking Dead and those do have some frame rate, like lags

1015
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,080
and some hiccups.

1016
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,120
Like, you know, The Walking Dead always is like previously on The Walking Dead

1017
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,800
and, and sometimes like it'll get ready to load a scene because it has to do it

1018
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,040
from based on what you've chosen in the past.

1019
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,560
And it tries to load it and I'll end up missing like half the scene.

1020
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,240
So I think, I don't know, maybe it's just because the old PS3 hardware or

1021
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,080
something, but they don't run too well on that.

1022
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,440
But I still have enjoyed the games, but I deal with the hiccups and the problems

1023
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,440
are kind of buggy.

1024
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,000
Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1025
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,480
Kaijuto says Telltale needs to make a Goonies game.

1026
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,720
Oh, that's actually a really good idea.

1027
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,000
Did you hear that they're actually, there's plans on working on the Goonies sequel?

1028
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,640
They've been talking that on and off for the longest time and no,

1029
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,800
this has nothing to do with Goonies 2 on the NES.

1030
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,920
Can we just get that out of the way?

1031
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,600
I love Goonies 2 on the NES, like Goonies 2 on the NES.

1032
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,280
Oh God, here we go.

1033
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,720
I was talking about Jurassic Park, a 15, I'm talking about a two year old video

1034
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,760
game, but on a 15 year old movie, and now I'm going to get into an NES game,

1035
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,200
such as an episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

1036
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,320
Hi, new listeners.

1037
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,680
Goonies 2 was like a Metroidvania game before like Metroidvania was really a thing.

1038
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,880
Think about it, right?

1039
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,680
Goonies 2 is amazing, but it really had nothing to do with the movie.

1040
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,920
It was only Goonies 2 because there was a Goonies 1 in Japan.

1041
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,360
It was on what, the Pay Choice 10 here, but it was never released.

1042
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,960
So it was literally Goonies 2, the video game where there's like a

1043
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,400
mermaid and shit that you're trying to rescue.

1044
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,880
It has nothing to do with the movie, but it's such a good game.

1045
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,920
It is.

1046
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,240
Anyway, where was I?

1047
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,200
Jurassic Park.

1048
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay.

1049
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,320
So it has its flaws, but as somebody who really enjoyed the movie as a kid,

1050
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,640
I really appreciate what they try to do with it.

1051
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,920
I do find the quick time action scenes to be a little bit exciting because it does

1052
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,560
kind of like it gets your, you know, like your, your character is going to get

1053
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,520
eaten by a goddamn dinosaur if you don't like react in time.

1054
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,960
So it does have like that tense moment.

1055
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,400
It succeeds in doing that.

1056
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,520
I like some of the mechanics where you flip to different points of view.

1057
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,040
Like you'll be playing as one person and then to really solve a puzzle,

1058
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,240
you'll have to flip to three different points of view to solve a puzzle.

1059
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,760
And so I kind of like that, like there's, um, I don't want to spoil too heavy,

1060
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,320
but in episode two, I just did a puzzle that involves a roller coaster because

1061
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,640
Jurassic Park after all was going to be a theme park, right?

1062
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,080
So there's a roller coaster you find, and there's a puzzle involving it where

1063
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,320
you have to rotate between the three characters to solve it.

1064
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,600
And I thought that was kind of neat.

1065
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,400
So, you know, a little bit of a nineties cliche in adventure gaming puzzles,

1066
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,000
but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

1067
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,760
So, um, Jurassic Park for 99 cents people.

1068
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,720
It's, it's a good, like, Hey, remember the movie.

1069
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,680
Wouldn't it fun?

1070
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,280
So yeah, I'll probably have to get that.

1071
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,920
I wouldn't have been mad if I paid like $5.

1072
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,560
I would have been mad even probably like 20,

1073
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,000
which would have been five an episode.

1074
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,600
I've been okay with, I don't know.

1075
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,120
Did they charge 40 when it first came out?

1076
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,080
10 an episode that might be.

1077
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,120
I don't think so because the walking dead was only the latest walking dead.

1078
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,560
Season two is only $20.

1079
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:11,960
Okay.

1080
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,440
Well then, then it's, it's, it's a decent price.

1081
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,800
It's it's fine, but it isn't as strong as some of the other telltale games,

1082
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,520
especially from a technical standpoint, I will say that.

1083
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,200
But it's, it's worth your time.

1084
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,800
You know, I think, uh, other games I bought, I bought everyday shooter,

1085
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,120
which I just missed out on the first time that was out.

1086
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,000
Um, that's a fun little Twix stick, twin stick game.

1087
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,080
Um, that it kind of is one of those.

1088
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,240
You, you learn the game as you go sort of things.

1089
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,120
Speaking of shooters, I bought a game called retro grade.

1090
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,960
I had no idea a game like this existed.

1091
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,800
I somehow missed this on the radar the first time,

1092
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,880
but it's like a music game as a shooter.

1093
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,200
And it's the really neat little twist on it is that you play the entire game in reverse.

1094
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,800
The game starts with the final boss fight and you play the game in reverse.

1095
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,760
And the whole reason behind that is I guess beating the final boss

1096
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,920
screwed up the space time continuum.

1097
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,800
So you have to go back in time to undo what you did.

1098
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,440
And because of that, everything is predetermined.

1099
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,600
All the motions in the game are predetermined.

1100
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,400
Enter how it's a music game because you have to move up and down in, in time.

1101
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,600
You have to hit the buttons to fire or, or like on fire or whatever in time.

1102
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,120
And so it's a really neat little mechanic and your score goes down, not up.

1103
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,840
And the whole goal is to get the low score in the level.

1104
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,120
So yeah, I liked it.

1105
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,400
That was really for 99 cents.

1106
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,520
That was a really cool little game.

1107
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,880
And I know we have a lot of music game fans at OLR that would get a kick out of that.

1108
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,920
That was retro grade.

1109
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,840
I recommend that one.

1110
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,320
You can also play that with a guitar controller.

1111
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,440
I do not know where my PS3 guitar controller is.

1112
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,560
It's probably in a dumpster somewhere.

1113
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,680
I think I threw it out when we moved.

1114
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,120
So I'll never get to try out that mode, but it is out there.

1115
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,920
You could borrow one of our million wins.

1116
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,120
Not that big a deal.

1117
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,960
I mean, the controls are, you move up and down.

1118
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,560
So I imagine that was what the strum did.

1119
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,160
And then you have the different buttons.

1120
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,440
So it's pretty.

1121
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,300
All right.

1122
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,920
I think that's about otherwise just a lot of the same stuff in my gaming week,

1123
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,240
like Final Fantasy 14 and Diablo three.

1124
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,960
I'm up to Paragon level 52 and Diablo three.

1125
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,240
Cause I'm really enjoying it.

1126
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,360
Like the, the expansion and the patch fixed everything.

1127
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,920
It's, it's so much more fun to play now.

1128
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,640
And yeah, I'll be playing more of it on my new computer this week.

1129
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,140
Yay.

1130
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,240
All right.

1131
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,600
Let's see.

1132
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm trying to look for more chat over at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1133
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,080
Let's see.

1134
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm trying to see.

1135
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,160
Jason says, personally, I think Goonies is a horrible game.

1136
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Technically speaking, punch someone five times, punch every wall,

1137
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,000
warping doors and hiding those behind you.

1138
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,120
Fuck that noise.

1139
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,520
Yeah.

1140
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,000
You know what?

1141
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,280
I'll give you that, Jason.

1142
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,920
A lot of the game didn't make sense.

1143
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,400
I wonder how much of that was lost in translation.

1144
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,640
Because again, you remember those early NES games when they were translated from Japanese,

1145
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,960
a lot of them lost something when they came over.

1146
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,600
And I'm sure you guys have heard some of those infamous translations.

1147
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,320
So I'm not sure if Goonies two is partially a victim to that.

1148
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,400
Cause like to beat the game, you have to know to punch an old woman five times in the face.

1149
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,960
And it's like, who would do that normally unless you have issues.

1150
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,440
So, but I'm thinking something was lost in translation there.

1151
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,760
I don't know.

1152
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,840
You had to have a guide really to finish the game.

1153
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,880
So I will give you that.

1154
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,360
The design was not exactly intuitive.

1155
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,120
So, uh, Tiger Claw apparently has assembled.

1156
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,560
Here are the top 10 death scenes from Jurassic Park the game.

1157
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,840
Would you like to look at some death scenes from Jurassic Park here in studio?

1158
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,360
We'll look at a couple here.

1159
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,080
Oh, sure.

1160
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,640
And maybe, maybe Jason can put some of these on the YouTubes as well

1161
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,000
when he puts the show together here.

1162
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,960
Let's just look at a couple of these.

1163
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh, this is a six minute video.

1164
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,920
We can't look at this whole thing here, but we can look at a couple just to,

1165
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,520
just to get a feel for the game here.

1166
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,800
And can we go river rafting?

1167
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,400
No, we're not going river rafting in the commercial.

1168
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,200
Okay.

1169
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,360
I gotta, I gotta stop because this is spoilers.

1170
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,200
Only if you lose, right?

1171
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,080
I haven't, there's a part with scuba diving.

1172
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,360
I'm not even two in the game yet.

1173
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,320
So I need to need to, um, not do that.

1174
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,840
What did you say the other games that you got were?

1175
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,720
I got Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

1176
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,240
Retrograde was the shooter.

1177
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,960
That's the music game.

1178
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,120
And then Everyday Shooter was the fifth one.

1179
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,520
Okay.

1180
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,240
That's what I bought.

1181
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:29,960
I spent like five.

1182
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,880
There was something else I was trying to remember you mentioning,

1183
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,920
but I don't remember what it was.

1184
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,400
You should click on my link in chat, Rob.

1185
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,880
Oh no.

1186
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,000
What did you do?

1187
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,200
It's another YouTube.

1188
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,840
Another one.

1189
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,400
What is this?

1190
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,920
Dare I ask?

1191
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,800
Just click on it.

1192
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm sorry.

1193
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,120
I know this isn't a whorehouse.

1194
00:47:44,120 --> 00:48:10,840
Yeah, I found a way to break the show.

1195
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,040
I would have given the game an extra half star if it had that song in it.

1196
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,600
Cause you know, they use the infamous John Williams score in the game and they use it

1197
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,680
very well, but I think I would have given it a half star at extra star though.

1198
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,960
Holy shit.

1199
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,920
It's a dinosaur.

1200
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,600
Like when you die, just play that song.

1201
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,000
Uh, all right.

1202
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,480
That's it.

1203
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,160
That's it for my gaming week.

1204
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,240
I think that's everybody's gaming weeks.

1205
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,440
So, uh, some quick housekeeping, please follow us on Twitter.

00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,440
As far as I know, we still have shows every week coming up until probably July.

1213
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,720
No, June, probably E3.

1214
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,040
We won't be here, uh, that immediate Sunday.

1215
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,680
We may or may not.

1216
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,320
I'm still waiting to hear back on E3.

1217
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,000
Bobby and I are trying to go this year to represent VOG and do some cool stuff there,

1218
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,240
but we are at the mercy of the E3 Pope.

1219
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,960
We are awaiting the E3 Pope's blessing and, uh, either we will be blessed or we

1220
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,720
will be excommunicated.

1221
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,480
We'll find out in the next couple of weeks.

1222
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,080
Keep your fingers crossed for us because, uh, we want to, we want to do that same

1223
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,520
thing that we did last year.

1224
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,760
Only with two people this time, uh, covering the show.

1225
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,320
So we'll see.

1226
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,360
All right.

1227
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,880
Uh, let us get into some gaming news of which there is, uh, just a little bit this

1228
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,040
week.

1229
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,160
It was a bit of a slower news week, but dark soccer and I are going to bounce some

1230
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,000
game stories around here anyway.

1231
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,480
Um, and, uh, Flaco Jones, uh, since, uh, I didn't know you were coming tonight

1232
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,920
until your Easter plans ended early.

1233
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,160
I didn't give you any stories, but please feel free to chime in.

1234
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,480
Okay.

1235
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,120
Okay.

1236
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,440
All right.

1237
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,440
We need your, we need your wit and your puns because according to the chat room,

1238
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,600
according to the chat room, I forgive your puns.

1239
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,320
Oh, really?

1240
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,000
I yelled at Loki about it a couple of weeks ago and I've turbo puns.

1241
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,680
So, uh, you need to make some puns so I can scold you.

1242
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,400
So fair is fair.

1243
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,440
I blame Irene.

1244
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,920
She always tells the best, worst puns and I, then I, I'm challenged to do even

1245
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,040
more terrible ones.

1246
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,520
No, I see.

1247
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,960
So it's, it's a pun competition.

1248
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,840
Yes, it's a pun off.

1249
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,720
That's okay.

1250
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,120
Very good.

1251
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,760
Very good.

1252
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,080
All right.

1253
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,920
Well, starting with this, um, this series has been dormant for a couple of years.

1254
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,960
I think the last time it had a video game was in 2010 and then it had a movie,

1255
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,400
which was pretty forgettable, but it's Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia,

1256
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,480
of course, started off as a classic computer game series that was 2d back in

1257
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,520
the day and it made the shift as a lot of games did to 3d.

1258
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,000
And, uh, the last game was, I think on PlayStation three, what?

1259
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,560
Sands of Time?

1260
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,160
Was it the last one that they did?

1261
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,760
Uh, you know, which was, which was a decent, uh, decent game as far as action

1262
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,600
adventure goes, but the time, the series has been sitting dormant since then.

1263
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,960
Well, there's rumors out there that Ubisoft is making a new 2d Prince of

1264
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,520
Persia game.

1265
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,400
So going back to their roots, but here's the deal.

1266
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,960
They're going to borrow from another Ubisoft game to do it.

1267
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,280
And that game is Rayman Legends.

1268
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,160
Ooby art framework powered the Rayman Legends game.

1269
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,320
It's also used in a game called Child of Light and a French website.

1270
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,040
And let's remember that Ubisoft is a French company, a French website, um, is

1271
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,600
reporting that Ubisoft is making this game using quote the same techniques of

1272
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,840
animation used in the last Rayman.

1273
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,000
The Prince's body is divided into several parts, torso, pelvis, leg, shin, foot,

1274
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,280
forearm, hands, et cetera, that are animated independently.

1275
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,800
This provides a real diversity and credibility in the postures and movements

1276
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,760
of the hero.

1277
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,560
So it basically gives the illusion of 3d modeling, even though it's a 2d game.

1278
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,400
And of course my mind goes to Extifer and his love of Rayman Legends, which he

1279
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,840
never shuts up about that game, right?

1280
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,520
Flaco, has he made you play Rayman Legends?

1281
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,920
He got me a copy for Christmas on Vita and I still have not taken it out of the

1282
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,160
street.

1283
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,720
Well, I've seen so much of it.

1284
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,160
I feel like I have to like wait now for it to like really go away from my brain

1285
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,600
for a little bit so I can experience it again without being like, Oh, I've

1286
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,960
seen this a million times.

1287
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,840
Well, I'm not sure.

1288
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,200
My viewpoint of Rayman is a little tainted because I keep thinking about how

1289
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,720
much Extifer loves the game.

1290
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,000
And if you guys listen to Hoard House, he talks about the game, even on that

1291
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,520
show, which is supposed to be about online games.

1292
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,120
He talks about Rayman a lot.

1293
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,680
So my perspective is, Oh, people really like Rayman Legends.

1294
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,360
I don't really know cause I just have Extifer, but I think it's been doing

1295
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,600
well.

1296
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,120
They've released it on tons of platforms.

1297
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,080
I think it does.

1298
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,480
Okay.

1299
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,280
I mean, I don't think it did as well as they were hoping you would do, but I

1300
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,040
know it did pretty well in the Wii U.

1301
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,680
Yeah.

1302
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,240
So that's true.

1303
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,400
Cause it was supposed to be a Wii U exclusive and it's still, I think is

1304
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,440
where it sold the best.

1305
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,760
Yeah.

1306
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,640
Oh, how funny.

1307
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:31,880
Yeah.

1308
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,440
But I kind of think like, Oh, well, you know, a 2d Prince of Persia in that

1309
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,120
same vein would actually be kind of neat because that's how Prince of Persia

1310
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,000
started anyway.

1311
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,160
Right.

1312
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,480
What do you guys think of the idea of Prince of Persia going back to 2d?

1313
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,040
I think it's pretty cool.

1314
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,760
I mean, I don't know about like going back.

1315
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,560
I didn't really play a lot of the Prince of Persia games, but I just know that

1316
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,320
that Child of Light game looks awesome.

1317
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,480
I I've seen, like you said, extra play Rayman Legends a million times.

1318
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,040
So I think the engine is really nice.

1319
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,360
So if they're going to put it on anything, why not do that?

1320
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,960
It's it's proven it's beautiful and it's really smooth and fast.

1321
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,640
So yeah, go for it.

1322
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,280
Why not?

1323
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,120
It can't be any worse.

1324
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,600
Right.

1325
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,080
Yeah.

1326
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,440
I mean, Child of Light looks great.

1327
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,240
I really want to play it.

1328
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,440
Darzaka?

1329
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,760
I think it's an interesting concept.

1330
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,000
I mean, the whole thing is just, you know,

1331
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,640
I I can see why there would be an advantage to doing that way,

1332
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,120
but it seems like it would be complex programming wise.

1333
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,480
It actually makes me think of basics of flash animation for doing motion

1334
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,920
movement because you rig your your joints independently.

1335
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,200
So I'm I'm actually sitting more or less not thinking of how the game would look

1336
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,440
and play, but thinking of how it would be made.

1337
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,360
Yeah, I really do.

1338
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
You know, even if it does go back to its 2D roots,

1339
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,760
I really hope they do modernize it in many ways.

1340
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,640
It's not that, you know, the classics exist for a reason.

1341
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,920
The classics are still great.

1342
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,600
You can get the classic.

1343
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,200
I believe they put it out on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live a couple of years

1344
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,320
ago, they redid the classics around the time they put out the latest game.

1345
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,760
But it's kind of like, all right, well, you know, those games also got a little

1346
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,560
bit repetitive.

1347
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,920
I mean, they were great in the 80s, but they don't hold up very well in today's

1348
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,240
standards.

1349
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,320
So I really hope if they're taking it to 2D, they're really giving it some varying

1350
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,160
environments, some new mechanics, you know, some things to make it competitive

1351
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,240
with today's platforming.

1352
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,440
And dude better look Persian and not like some white dude.

1353
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:25,560
Yes.

1354
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,600
And he better look he better look like he's actually the Prince of Persia.

1355
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,960
He can't look like Jake Gyllenhaal.

1356
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,680
Very few people can look like him.

1357
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,200
Actually, I'd be okay with him looking like Jake Gyllenhaal.

1358
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,080
I saw that movie in the theater.

1359
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

1360
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,360
It was it was a movie.

1361
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,920
I think that if you're going to have somebody represent a certain ethnicity,

1362
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,160
they need to look like said ethnicity.

1363
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,360
The end.

1364
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,480
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1365
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,200
Dungeon Buster says, I wouldn't mind seeing a 2D Prince of Persia.

1366
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,120
It's a nice homage to its roots.

1367
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,880
Darth Tetsuya said, I did like the 2D originals, though I think the only one I've

1368
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,000
liked since was Sands of Time because it was similar to the originals.

1369
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,320
But this new 2D one sounds interesting.

1370
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,520
And Act F says, I'm in favor of Prince of Persia Origins, legends.

1371
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,160
So there you go.

1372
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,800
It looks like most people in our chat room are open to the idea.

1373
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,760
So again, how much is it going to cost?

1374
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,320
And is it going to look like a game that's worth 60 bucks?

1375
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,600
If that's throughout, they go with it.

1376
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,640
So we'll see.

1377
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,000
So I hope they go download route, like with Child of Light.

1378
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,520
Was that $15, $20?

1379
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,080
I think so.

1380
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,320
That could be it could end up being a network game.

1381
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,320
I would assume since they're using the same engine,

1382
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,520
it probably saves them a lot of money.

1383
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,640
And you know, why not?

1384
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,720
Well, I imagine this is one of the E3 things that is leaked out.

1385
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,840
So we'll know if this is fact or crap come E3.

1386
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,280
Remember, that is rumor right now.

1387
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,240
But it's one of those rumors that has a lot of buzz around it.

1388
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,280
Like, you know, you can usually tell the true runs from the fake ones.

1389
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,000
So we'll see.

1390
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,720
We'll see.

1391
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,440
Anyhow, moving on.

1392
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,000
Dark Sakura.

1393
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,800
Well, there's this game that we play that involves cat people and really tall

1394
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,480
people and really huge people and really tiny people.

1395
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Let's see Final Fantasy XIV.

1396
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:05,980
No shit.

1397
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,120
So anyway, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn has reached 2 million registered user accounts.

1398
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,920
So that means that this is since when was the release?

1399
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,440
It was like last year.

1400
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,320
So with the they basically after the beta, there were another million more signups.

1401
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,520
So it's really starting to chug along.

1402
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,320
So I'm very pleased because that means they will at least have it for a little while longer.

1403
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,160
And such a neat story because of the fact that, you know, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn

1404
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,520
was essentially having to do over a video game that flocked and it worked.

1405
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,920
And I think there was a lot of that into the story.

1406
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,200
Yeah.

1407
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,440
Oh, yeah.

1408
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,520
They really had to back park the car into this spot that somebody else built, you know,

1409
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,600
that was kind of a mess in some ways.

1410
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,280
But they did a great job with it.

1411
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,640
Like, it's a great MMO.

1412
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,560
You guys know I never shut up about it.

1413
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,920
And I'm excited that it keeps gaining steam too, because

1414
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,280
I think Warcraft could use a little competition.

1415
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,200
And it's not that's no disrespect towards Warcraft.

1416
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,240
I love World of Warcraft.

1417
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,640
I can't wait for the next expansion for World of Warcraft.

1418
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,040
But I think Blizzard kind of tends to rest on their laurels a little bit with World of Warcraft,

1419
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,080
because there is literally nothing going on in that game right now.

1420
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,400
And Blizzard thinks they can get away with that for another six months until that expansion comes out.

1421
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,800
And so I kind of think Blizzard needs a little fire under their tushies.

1422
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,760
So I think this is only

1423
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,480
a little?

1424
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,980
Yeah.

1425
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,040
Well, to be fair, I'm like, I am also obsessing about Diablo 3 right now.

1426
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,160
And that's Blizzard.

1427
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,640
I know tons of people that are losing their shit over Hearthstone, which is also Blizzard.

1428
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,120
And that just had an iPad thing too.

1429
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,080
So, you know, it's not like Blizzard isn't doing good things other places.

1430
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,880
But it's just like, as a long time Warcraft fan, I kind of, I hate the whole...

1431
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,560
They do a patch.

1432
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,520
They do a patch.

1433
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,720
They do a patch.

1434
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,520
Drought.

1435
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,600
$40 expansion.

1436
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,840
Patch, patch, patch.

1437
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,340
Drought.

1438
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,400
$50 expansion.

1439
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:05,880
Yeah.

1440
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,120
The only thing I'm excited remotely about the next WoW anyway,

1441
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,080
is just I want more Space Goats lore and I can read that.

1442
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,400
They did things with the characters after the last bit that I just was not happy about.

1443
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,680
So I'm kind of done.

1444
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,360
Well, but you have been enjoying Final Fantasy XIV.

1445
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,680
What do you think about Final Fantasy XIV?

1446
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,240
Have you been enjoying it and you and your time back?

1447
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,800
I'm really liking it.

1448
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,200
I mean, it's not that I...

1449
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,560
I mean, I just don't have a lot of time,

1450
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,960
but I like that I can play it when I don't have a lot of time.

1451
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,480
I will say this though, because I don't want to sound like I'm totally up

1452
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,880
Squeenix's ass in my praise of Final Fantasy XIV, because the game isn't without flaws.

1453
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,680
Like I do think Endgame right now is a little bit flawed.

1454
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,280
I think the content itself gets a little dry,

1455
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,640
but the good news is that Square Enix has done a very good job of giving regular updates.

1456
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,280
And if they can actually keep sustaining that and not do these big drought phases like Warcraft has,

1457
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,480
that's going to be the real test.

1458
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,640
But if they can, apparently they have two teams,

1459
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,400
one on the expansion, one on patches.

1460
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,960
So if they really are able to kind of keep going with this,

1461
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,760
it'll be a really, really good thing because each patch brings some like great stuff.

1462
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,880
Like it seems like they have one every couple of months right now, right?

1463
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,400
Yeah. And they're talking, there's going to be a, let's see, they're on 2.2 right now.

1464
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,720
And then the next one's 2.3. That's a few months away,

1465
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,520
but they're saying 2.25 will be out at the end of this month.

1466
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,080
See more frequent, smaller patches. It works.

1467
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,200
Yes. Just do it.

1468
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,440
If I would just like take a bunch of their content and just like, you know what,

1469
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,080
let's just put this thing in a patch.

1470
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,240
People would, I mean, maybe it's a little artificial,

1471
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,560
but people I think would feel better about it than getting it.

1472
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:47,880
Yeah.

1473
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,200
I don't know all at once and then getting nothing for two years.

1474
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1475
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,280
I just wish I had a little bit more time to play.

1476
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,880
Um, but I, you know, cause everyone's sort of shot past me,

1477
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,520
but I also have other things that I do.

1478
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,360
So, but, but the nice thing is, is that with the whole level sinking, you know,

1479
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,000
you can get your friends to come do the lower stuff with you.

1480
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,680
And it's not just busy beating Titan.

1481
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,000
They don't just raffle stomp everything and all that.

1482
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,160
I did like tagging along for the treasure hunt,

1483
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,880
even though I can't kill anything cause I at least get a little bit of something out of it.

1484
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,400
But it was fun. I just stood back there and danced.

1485
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,560
To register participation for this week's episode of orange

1486
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,680
underrated with vog network.com. Use the passphrase journey.

1487
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,880
Uh, C. Allen, our chat, Si Allen, our chat room.

1488
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,320
I always mispronounce that name. So sorry, buddy.

1489
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,320
In chat says sky is on squares payroll. I wish it would be, I can get paid for this.

1490
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,000
How do you think you got this sweet new house?

1491
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,280
All I have to do is sell out.

1492
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,440
Yeah. You know, you're the first guest in studio N seven, I believe.

1493
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:48,840
Really?

1494
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,000
Wow. I guess so.

1495
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,040
Yeah. And we actually, we have still haven't shown pictures of the new studio out there.

1496
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,840
You want to, you want to quickly describe for listeners the new studio?

1497
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,760
I don't have the best like way of describing things, but it's pretty cool.

1498
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,800
We've had pictures of my feet in the new studio.

1499
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,280
That's true. Um, no, I really like it here. I like all the geeky posters,

1500
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,600
the game posters in your kingdom hearts. That's pretty awesome.

1501
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,560
That was Alan's idea.

1502
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,800
Yeah, I love it. I love all the posters. Uh, it's super cozy.

1503
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,480
Keep it a secret.

1504
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,840
It's like we're in, we're in like your living room or dining room area and it's just pretty,

1505
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,360
it's pretty amazing. I really like it.

1506
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:24,860
Thank you.

1507
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,400
It's like, it's way different than being huddled over the kitchen table. The last time I was like,

1508
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,000
that's all hit by the sit by the kitchen table and tell stories.

1509
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,200
It's like in here you actually get to lounge around a little bit.

1510
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,920
Yeah. I feel like I'm like kicking back. I got my brew free or die IPA product plug

1511
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,400
and uh, it's really good. And so I'm just drinking some beers and having a good time here.

1512
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,600
Awesome. I like, it's super cozy in here. It feels great.

1513
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:54,600
We'll get a YouTube or something up soon and do all that. All right. Uh, let's see. Um,

1514
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,520
what else do I want to say about final fantasy? I thought it was something else

1515
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,400
I wanted to say about the game. Fat choco bows.

1516
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,360
Yeah. Fat choco bows are great. Uh, the angle that final fantasy has that wow. Doesn't that

1517
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,640
I think really does give them a leg up. PC PlayStation four, PlayStation three,

1518
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,040
all coexisting peacefully on the same servers. Not a lot of games that do that.

1519
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:22,760
Last game I can think of that did that final fantasy 11, which included Microsoft and Alan,

1520
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,120
come over here. Alan. Alan's like me, me, me. I want to say something. Yes, Alan. Hi Alan.

1521
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,160
How are you doing? I'm doing all right. Thank you for building me a PC by the way.

1522
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,200
Maybe I'll sit in at the start of TARP part B and we can talk about it.

1523
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,960
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You can share everybody, the geeky specs and everything. Uh, what'd you want

1524
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:42,600
to say about all this? Uh, the rumor is that the reason why, uh, final fantasy 14 is not on the

1525
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,400
three 60 or rather the Xbox one is because Microsoft doesn't want their player base

1526
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,400
interacting with people on the other console. They want their own 14 world. And square's like,

1527
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,880
no, that's not what the game is. So Microsoft doesn't get 14 because they don't want to let

1528
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,600
other kids play nice. I don't think that's a rumor. I think that's true, but it's, it's,

1529
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:08,760
if the thing that gets me is that, but 11 was like, I was at the E3 where at the Microsoft

1530
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,280
booth, they made a huge deal about 11 coming to the Xbox three 60 and that you were going to be

1531
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,800
able to play with everybody else. And that was you, but you still had to have gold to do that.

1532
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:26,280
And then the play online shed, right? Which by the way, who co-owned play online Sony. So you

1533
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,160
had to install a Sony product on your Xbox three 60 to play final fantasy 11. That game broke all

1534
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:36,680
the fucking rules and Microsoft was like Xbox one can play blu-rays. So I guess that's true.

1535
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:42,280
That's true. Sony making money all over. All right. Uh, let's move on. Speaking of final

1536
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,880
fantasy, I have another story about final fantasy for you guys. And that is about final fantasy

1537
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,200
three fantasy three, not three America, which was actually six. Okay. But we're talking the

1538
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,640
old school NES final fantasy three Japan that has been re-released here on America on the DS,

1539
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,040
right? They did it in a three D format. They made it look more like the PlayStation

1540
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,840
one era games a little bit. Um, it was on the DS and now it's on mobile phones, right?

1541
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:15,320
Well, guess what? Apparently it's coming to PCs as well. Uh, this is revealed by a rating from,

1542
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,400
you know, ratings boards tend to spill the beans all the times. It's always in another country.

1543
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,960
Well, thank you, Germany. Germany's usk board apparently leaked the news file fantasy three

1544
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,160
on the PC. Hey, for what it's worth, it's rated usk six, which I'm imagining means what six and

1545
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,240
up probably type of thing. Uh, we know that final fantasy seven and five has a three already exists

1546
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,520
on the PC, but we have not heard anything about final fantasy three. This would make sense though.

1547
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,560
I mean, I would imagine the back structure that goes into the game can't be that much more

1548
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:50,040
complicated than the already existing iOS port and excuse me, iOS port for Jamie gets me on that.

1549
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:57,000
And, um, Android part heart. Uh, I, I, I imagine that it's not that difficult once those ports

1550
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,640
exist to get it over to PC as well. I mean, granted my programming knowledge is very little,

1551
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:07,400
but I can't imagine it's too difficult. But the interesting news is that would lead me to think

1552
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,440
that if this is released and does a decent job, which final fantasy on the steam store at a

1553
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,640
discount ought to do pretty well. This means we're going to get final fantasy four, final fantasy

1554
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:23,400
five, and the, well, let's hope if they decide to put out file fantasy six, they go back and

1555
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,120
fix some things that were wrong with it. But this could very much open the door to a lot more final

1556
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:35,000
fantasy games on steam. We'll see. This could be very, very interesting. All right. Uh, going to

1557
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,800
our chat room over at live.vog network.com Akuma JP and chat says why final fantasy three is already

1558
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:49,240
everywhere. Good point. Keep in mind Akuma JP. We never, we, the game was new to us until the

1559
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,560
DS version came out. It was the last final fantasy game to get released in the U S that

1560
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:59,480
had been out in Japan, but not here. Translated Rome. Oh, look at that. Oh my gosh. On your little

1561
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:07,480
Android. That's amazing. Um, Bobby Black Wolf wanting to clarify, uh, what Alan had brought

1562
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,840
up earlier here about fantasy 11. He actually, uh, pointed to a news article from RPG site.net

1563
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,160
that says Microsoft refuses to allow titles to share a multiplayer service between other

1564
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:22,280
platforms for final fantasy 11s, Xbox three 60 release. The company made an exception,

1565
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:27,480
presumably to Curry favor with square Enix to secure final fantasy thirteens release for their

1566
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,400
console, but no such exception was made for the last latest MMO entry. Well, if the game continues

1567
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,880
to do well, they might need to reconsider. Maybe they should pull final fantasy 15 from it. No,

1568
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:43,480
just kidding. No, it worked. They got final fantasy, uh, 13 on there. So right. 12 and

1569
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:49,240
did they get 12? No, just 13. Yeah. 12 was 12 was on PlayStation two. So yeah, I wish they'd done

1570
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:55,000
12 on Xbox 360, but they didn't. Yeah. So no, it was just 13, 13, 13, two, 13, three, 13, four,

1571
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,440
13. Sorry. I lost track. And presumably 15 is on the Xbox one as well. That's what I've heard.

1572
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,440
So, so my joke was take it away from them. Well, there, there's some interesting news

1573
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,240
we'll get into later where maybe Sony has now done some things that might not sit well with

1574
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,320
Square Enix. So we'll see. We'll see. We'll get into that later in the show. All right. Um,

1575
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,360
meanwhile, let's move on with some more news before we get to release date stark Sakura.

1576
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Well, there was some crap going on with elder scrolls online. They found a bug that lets you,

1577
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:35,800
basically duplicate pretty much unlimited amounts of gold shows any max online studios that, uh, no,

1578
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:45,000
they are, uh, going in and trying to, uh, make sure they can get the local economy back to normal

1579
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,040
and trying to get the bug ripped out and squished like the evil that it is. Um, but they haven't

1580
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,880
said anything about like what exactly they're going to do to address it. Well, yeah, usually

1581
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,680
they're not going to tell you because they don't want people to duplicate the bug. That kind of

1582
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,960
stuff is killer in MMOs, those types of exploits. Final fantasy 14 actually had one when the game

1583
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,360
first launched on the realm reborn and they took out, not only did they patch it out without

1584
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,520
telling people they were going to do it, they did it overnight, but then they went and like,

1585
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,400
if you had Gil from this exploit, they either banned you or took your Gil away, all of it.

1586
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,000
So, and like there were people that got caught up in it that weren't even like somebody had bought

1587
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,400
something with the Gil from their auction house posting. And so they got the money taken back.

1588
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,360
Like it's that it will fuck up an economy that good where they have to really change that.

1589
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,800
But that's, that's crazy when, from my understanding is this bug was reported in beta.

1590
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:46,760
Well, what they did since is that basically they have, um, disabled access to Guild banks

1591
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,720
and, um, they had a patch out that changes the auto stacking in the Guild banks.

1592
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,680
So it's basically trying to prevent it until they can, until they can fix the economy.

1593
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:02,520
Oh, there you go. If you abuse it, lock it down elder scrolls online. You know,

1594
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,120
there are some people I know that are playing it. They're really, really enjoy it. But, um,

1595
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,400
overall the reception seems to be a little bit tepid. So I'll be interested to see if

1596
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,960
they can keep up that sub fee thing going on. So you haven't checked that out at all, right? Flaco?

1597
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,840
No, I have not. Not even the beta again, PCs dead, but it's supposed to be coming to BS four. So

1598
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:23,160
it is. Uh, is that one of the ones that's on the one as well? I don't remember. I guess not.

1599
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,760
I probably not. I don't think so. I don't think any, I don't think that any of these MMOs are

1600
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:31,880
coming to one like world of tanks. Yeah. But then that's exclusive to them though. Right? Yeah,

1601
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,000
it is. Yeah. So there you go. Get anything is by making it an exclusive. Uh, they had defiance on

1602
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,320
three 60, but those servers were segregated or segregated. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's how they

1603
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,120
got away with, I don't know. Maybe they're, maybe they're getting it and it'll be segregated.

1604
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,800
All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates and talk about some, uh, games

1605
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,840
coming out soon in a store near you this week, uh, in the U S since Loki's not here tonight,

1606
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,320
I'll go ahead and do the U S releases here. Uh, we have demon gaze coming out on the PlayStation

1607
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:06,280
Vita Tesla effect on a windows and Macintosh. That's a text Murphy adventure and war face on

1608
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,920
X-Box live arcade, all those games on the 22nd, as well as on the PlayStation four Flaco. I don't

1609
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,880
know if you've heard about this game. Octo dad, deadliest cash. I am dying. I played it actually

1610
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,800
on a demo kiosk fries and it was so much fun and a, you know, and I'm big into those, um,

1611
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,840
what do they got? Awesome games done quick charity marathons. Uh, two years ago they had the people

1612
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,680
that made Octo dad come on there and demo that, that verse version of the game that I believe was

1613
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,920
free or really cheap. It was kind of like, you know, their, their first version of it. Right.

1614
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,360
And, uh, it was really funny to watch them play it. And that, in that game it was on the PC and

1615
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,600
you had to take the mouse and dip it in, hold it either the left or right mouse and like move,

1616
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,120
like slide it forward and to move your little Octo legs. And from what I saw and then from what

1617
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,800
I played at the PlayStation four controller, they really captured that perfectly because

1618
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,760
you had to like hold up, hold one of the shoulder buttons and move one stick to move your, like half

1619
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,160
of your legs on the one side of your body and then do it again to move your other legs. And you pick

1620
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,920
stuff up and you move around very surgeon, similar, like, like you knock everything down

1621
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,640
when you move around. It was really fun to play. And you know, a part of me, you know, I'm like,

1622
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,240
I'm such a cheapskate. I'm like, please do you play station plus, but if it isn't,

1623
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,360
I'll probably still throw some money that way because it looks really fun. Well,

1624
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:25,400
there could always be a 99 cents sale. I know, but do I want to wait now? Do I want to wait?

1625
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,040
I could wait for PlayStation plus, which I usually do, but for this game I might make an exception

1626
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,840
because it was so much fun. Like you had to put on your tux to get to your like wedding.

1627
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,200
It was hilarious. And no one knows you're an octopus because you're in disguise.

1628
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:44,040
Well, on the 25th, a little later in the week, you can look forward to dark souls to getting

1629
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:50,440
its windows release. So you can die over and over and over and over and over and over

1630
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:58,600
and over and over again on your windows machines. So dark souls two coming to kill you this week

1631
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,040
on the 25th, also on the 25th, a lot of Wii U Nintendo fans, very excited for the release of

1632
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:11,800
NES remix two AKA NES remix with the good games coming out this week on the Wii U I'll probably

1633
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,960
be picking that up. So I enjoyed any S remix until I had to play the games that you unlock.

1634
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:24,360
So I was like, wow, they usually the unlock stuff is the good stuff. But here I got golf and wrecking

1635
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:31,080
crew and urban champion. Are they discounting the first one? I don't know. But if you own both,

1636
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,720
you get like a bonus mode, you get that 90s championship mode, where you can, you know,

1637
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,600
you get the like, remember that cartridge that was in three steps, the very rare cartridge they did,

1638
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,080
like a wizard style tournament where you did, it was rare. I don't remember. I didn't have rare

1639
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:51,720
stuff. No, no, no. I mean, it was actually a rare. That's what I meant. I only had, what was it? The

1640
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,520
86 World Championship? Yeah, there was two of them. One of them had rad racer and Tetris and

1641
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,880
another one had, I don't remember. Yeah. I didn't, my parents hated buying me video games. So I only

1642
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,920
got video games that were handed down to me. So I got whatever my uncles bought. All right. So those

1643
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,160
are the releases in the U S this week. Let's travel over to Japan real quick and see what's coming out

1644
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:16,040
over there. Cause you know, what comes out here tends to come out there a little later. Sometimes

1645
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,280
what comes out there comes out here a little later. Sometimes, uh, first off, uh, on the

1646
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,960
PlayStation four, nothing. Cause you know, it's still kind of new over there and they did get

1647
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,600
final fantasy this week. Uh, Xbox one still not released over there. So there's nothing to report

1648
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,440
on that on the PlayStation three. However, there's a few things, uh, 2014 FIFA world cup Brazil on

1649
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:41,160
April 24th, along with grand theft auto for the complete edition, uh, love photon flowers. You

1650
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,160
know, we love our love love here at orange on its radio. And so that is coming out on PlayStation

1651
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:50,440
three red dead redemption gets a price reduction in the complete edition comes out, uh, as well on

1652
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:58,360

1653
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,280
as well. And I have no idea what that is, but, uh, I recognize the word Tengoku that's heaven,

1654
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:13,480
right? Yes. Uh, it looks like cute girls raising a cat who's and the girls sometimes their clothes

1655
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:18,440
fall off. That's apparently what I'm getting from the screenshots and they're in made uniforms

1656
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:24,680
and, uh, pervy kids everywhere. The cat looks up at them from very low angles. Yeah.

1657
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,600
I think we know what kind of game that is. All right.

1658
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,080
Those are the kind of games that for some reason don't get released here. I don't understand,

1659
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,640
uh, on the Xbox three 60 this week, uh, monster hunter frontier GG premium package. Ooh, uh,

1660
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:47,080
Jason love plus Pingo in regular limited and Sega store limited edition. Is that like the old school

1661
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:54,600
Pango game? Like redone? Oh my God. It is. It's the old school Pango game. Remember the,

1662
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,680
the penguin that you push around the cubes and everything? It's like a new version of that,

1663
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:05,400
but it's like in widescreen and shit. Are we getting this here? That's kind of rad.

1664
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:11,640
Not with that box art. Yeah. That box art is amazing. I love it. I guess. Yeah. Wow. I didn't

1665
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,040
know that Pango still had like rabid fans over in Japan or something enough to necessitate this in

1666
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,280
three different releases. That's pretty cool. All right. Well checking out the handhelds. Oh,

1667
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,000
sorry. I strict with you real quick here. We, you does have, they get the retail release of

1668
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,640
Famicom remix one and two. They're getting a retail release this week. So you got that as

1669
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,600
well as a monster hunter premium package as well. I think it's just a rebranding of monster hunter

1670
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:40,040
all over again. Checking the handhelds now on the PlayStation Vita blaze blue chrono phantasma,

1671
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,560
uh, Rayman legends and sword art online hollow fragment in regular and limited edition on the

01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:51,880

1673
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:59,480

1674
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,280
it was like a huge thing over there. That's cool. Uh, and, uh, let's see if last but not least on

1675
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:12,760
the 3DS this week, maple story. Unmei no shouju comes out this week. Fate of what? Uh, it's just

1676
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,760
a maple story side story. I'm sure is all that is. It looks, I'm trying to see if it's like,

1677
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:22,600
it looks like the actual maple story is so cute and it looks boring as hell to me, honestly.

1678
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,360
All right. Some people will be into it and yes, thank you. Acted after I was thinking that

1679
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:34,680
Octo dad equals chicken boo, the game where a disguise look like human guys. Isn't, um,

1680
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:40,680
Octo dad more like QWOP kind of, I never played that, but I heard that control wise. Yeah.

1681
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,480
I guess surgeon simulator, surgeon simulator meets chicken boo. Maybe that's a better

1682
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:52,440
description. Anyhow, dark soccer. How about the UK? Um, there's some stuff, a few things. Um,

1683
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:59,400
on the 22nd war face comes out 23rd, the walking dead season two on Vita and 25th dark souls two

1684
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:04,760
and Joe Joe's bizarre adventures, all star battle. And that's it. You know, it was just funny. I'm

1685
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,800
still kind of hilarious that Joe Joe's bizarre adventure is still like,

1686
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:16,280
uh, I guess a lucrative IP, especially since it's been done for like years. Wasn't,

1687
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:21,000
I think the manga was like originally out in like the mid early to mid eighties. Wasn't it?

1688
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:29,960
I think so, but my, my mind just goes to Mojo Jojo or KC and Jojo, but how did the Jojo

1689
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:35,880
fighting some system or the other? Yes. My kids love Powerpuff girls.

1690
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,840
All right. One more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. And

1691
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:46,840
I like being able to do gamers do good news stories this week. And there was a great,

1692
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:52,920
uh, there was a really cool little fundraiser that happened this week, uh, that was taking place on

1693
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,480
Twitch, you know, as a lot of fundraisers do for video games, but playing a game that's near and

1694
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:06,200
dear to our hearts. DDR. Yes. They were playing DDR on Twitch for the team in training leukemia

1695
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,840
and lymphoma society. Um, so they were on there. I'm trying to remember what the specific rules of

1696
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,280
the whole thing were. I believe it was that he was going to play, uh, DDR. He was going to keep going

1697
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,000
and, uh, his name is Jeff is the guy that did it. And, uh, Carl, his friend was the guy that was

1698
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,160
raising money for the leukemia lymphoma society. I've actually heard of this cause I have friends

1699
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,080
that do this. It's like a big marathon that you raise money to do. And you know, at, um,

1700
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,080
the money goes to a good cause obviously. And they actually do good on like the Komen group

1701
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,440
for breast cancer. Yes. Uh, and, uh, so they were doing a desert bus for hope style where

1702
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:44,920
you donate and it will force them to keep playing DDR continuously. And, uh, if you donate, you can

1703
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:51,080
make requests to do like weird things or play songs, make them play, keep on moving or, or what

1704
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:56,040
is that song? That's so God awful in the game. Um, let them move. You can play, let them move

1705
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,680
over and over and over again, if you want. Um, well notch, you know, the notch that made

1706
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,960
Minecraft, he decided to drop $10,000 on it. So they got to dance all night long. They went for 16

1707
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,920
hours. So nice. Very cool. He has all that extra money. He's not supporting the Oculus anymore.

1708
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:21,800
Now, now don't shade him when he's doing good. Yes, he's doing, I said some shady things about

1709
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,800
notch a couple of weeks ago. Cause I thought that was some, some BS, that whole thing about the

1710
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,840
Oculus, but look, he's going to put the money towards good places. We should say thank you.

1711
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:37,560
Not so good job. Not good job right off job notch. Now maybe you should reconsider some other things.

1712
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:42,360
No, in all, in all seriousness, I know some of our listeners were like, I know like Jason was

1713
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,720
watching this feed and as soon as Matt was telling me about it and dark Tetsuya,

1714
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,240
all these people were talking about, uh, what was going on with that. So I think that's a great

1715
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,960
thing. Uh, raising the money for good. So, uh, congrats. And I, that's awesome that it was such

1716
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:59,960
a success. They raised, I think I heard it was like $17,000. Wow. Yeah. Right. God. And I thought

1717
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,440
it was awesome when we raised a thousand dollars on Horde house last year, which was awesome.

1718
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:10,280
Don't get me wrong. No, that's great. Congrats you guys. All right. And I really hope you didn't

1719
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:16,360
have to play, let them move. Cause the song is so awful. So awful. Hey, uh, less awful.

1720
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:21,240
A chance to take a trip down memory lane and visit a classic video game. The dark soccer things. Hey,

1721
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:30,120
listen, all you little brats out there enough of this whole new fangled MMOs that aren't on your

1722
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:35,000
X-Box one, those were called gemstone and they were texts and you plan through AOL. That's right.

1723
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,320
You played Ultima online or get out. You might've been eaten by a group and you liked it. Maybe

1724
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:47,560
it's the classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find

1725
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:54,600
a game that she thinks, Hey, play this. Are you stupid? Dark Sakura. Yeah. You're stupid. Cause

1726
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,560
you are the dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Alex Kidd miracle world.

1727
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:04,360
Because I somehow haven't done this game yet. How have you never done Alex? I think I did

1728
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,520
Alex Kidd in Shinobi world, which was the one I really liked. Ah, okay. Alex Kidd in miracle

1729
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:13,560
world. Alex Kidd in miracle world is a very special game. Um, it was a platformer that came

1730
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,720
out on the Sega master system and it came out in Japan on Saturday, November 1st, 1986. And then

1731
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:28,920
went to, uh, the Western area and Australia in 1987. And it's probably the best known of the

1732
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:35,000
Alex Kidd games. And when the master system two came out, Alex Kidd miracle world was built into

1733
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:45,720
the system. And, um, it basically you play as Alex Kidd who lives in the miracle world. Um,

1734
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:52,120
that's like this big fantasy world and he has the ability to punch rocks. And so he's going to look

1735
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:57,880
for his, uh, long lost brother, Prince Eagle. And he punches frogs in the face.

1736
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:05,240
He does. Um, to fight against Junkin the great who, um, took over the land of Radaxian.

1737
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:14,040
So basically, um, you basically have to, uh, all the citizens were turned into stone.

1738
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:21,320
And so you have to, uh, basically do all this crap to go rescue people. And you go around punching

1739
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:27,080
rocks and punching creatures and riding. And you're on a motorcycle. Exactly. Riding

1740
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:33,960
motorcycle. So you have all kinds of different stuff to go. And this feature, um, you basically

1741
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:39,240
also have different ways to continue the game. It has a continue feature that's undocumented

1742
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,120
where you can continue the game with three lives from the beginning of the level where you died.

1743
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:49,720
You hold the up button and press the, uh, the two button eight times during the game over screen.

1744
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:56,360
But it costs you 400 bombs, which is the, uh, the currency in game. Um, to finish,

1745
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:03,560
um, you also, uh, have to face a boss who you have to win by playing, uh, Junkin Pong,

1746
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:10,040
which is, you know, rock, paper, scissors. And then, um, it's such a weird way to fight bosses.

1747
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:15,880
You play rock, paper, scissors. There's no, there's a strategy, but, um, to finish the stage,

1748
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,520
you also have to grab a food object at the end of each of the stages. You can only take one hit

1749
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:27,320
before you die and it doesn't have a battery save option or a password system. So what you see is

1750
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,880
what you get. And to be good at this game, you really have to wait, wait, you die in one hit.

1751
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:42,680
Back in the day, you had to be a pro. However, like I said, there was the, uh,

1752
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:52,600
undocumented system. So Sega loves us. Um, so, um, well, if they really loved us,

1753
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,960
they give us Shenmue three. So I don't think they really need to let the Shenmue thing go. I can't.

1754
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:07,160
Anyway, um, this was, uh, basically the game was created to combat Super Mario Brothers.

1755
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:17,160
Um, and Sega, um, was, uh, really trying to, to have a good competitor. Um, basically

1756
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:24,040
what they were trying to do without Skid, they had already had, um, Wonder Boy also.

1757
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,360
Um, but they couldn't do it with those types of platformers. They didn't actually get any

1758
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:35,240
good competition until Sonic was created, but the game was received very well. Um,

1759
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:45,960
they loved it in France. What don't they love in France? Americans. Oh yeah. Um, IGN, um,

1760
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,120
for a 2008 retro review gave the game a nine out of 10 that won an editor's choice award.

1761
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,880
Well. And there's a French band, like I said, it's loved in France. The French punk band called

1762
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:04,680
Chunk No Captain Chunk have a song named after the game on their album Something for Nothing.

1763
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:10,920
The game used to only be available in cartridges. There was a slightly different version in 1990

1764
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:17,080
that came out, um, for the Master System 2, but like I was saying, it was also built into the,

1765
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:23,080
uh, Master System 2. And, um, the game also was re-released along with Super Hang-On and Revenge

1766
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:28,840
of Shinobi as part of a Sega vintage collection, Alex Kidd and Company, which came with Xbox Live

1767
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,760
Arcade and PSN. Um, there was the sequel, there was Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle,

1768
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:40,440
which is the fifth one, but it was considered the actual sequel to Miracle World. And that one came

1769
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:48,520
out for this, uh, Sega Mega Drive, which was the Genesis over here. So it's, uh, that's it.

1770
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,560
Alex Kidd and Miracle World. It's a damn good game. Why aren't you playing it?

1771
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,960
I'd go, go, go do it. You can get it on virtual console, right? You said?

1772
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,280
Um, PSN. And yeah, I think it's, I think it might be on virtual console. I don't know.

1773
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,680
All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Miracle World. And you

1774
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,360
could rock, paper, scissors. I still like Shinobi World better, but that was me.

1775
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:19,320
That's all right. It's well, you know, cause it, it has, because it's kind of the marriage of the

1776
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:24,520
Shinobi World as well. And it's a little, little more. That was actually the first Alex Kidd game

1777
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,760
that I played with Shinobi World. There you go. Yep. All right. Well that is going to do it for

1778
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,200
this part a of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys. Cause we have plenty more of the

1779
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:36,760
show to come, including the FUGL question of the week. Uh, your emails, the FUs of the week and

1780
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:42,760
your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. More with Flaco

1781
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,800
Jones as well after the break and Alan going to be here to talk super nerdy computer building.

1782
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,400
So we'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned.

1783
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:05,800
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio with episode number 549 already in progress for this

1784
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:12,440
April the 20th of 2014. So happy Easter to you or happy 420 or happy Sunday, whatever it is you're

1785
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:17,800
celebrating today. Uh, welcome back. Flaco Jones joining us in studio being our extra special

1786
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:23,160
guest. Uh, Loki not here tonight. Uh, he is off celebrating Easter with the fam. Dark soccer is

1787
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:28,360
here in studio celebrating her birthday and uh, she got some presents earlier in the show and

1788
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,240
then gave us presents. Those yummy scones is very delicious. Um, also joining us here at the top of

1789
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:39,480
part B cause we said he'd be back here. Uh, Alan is here. Hello. How are you Alan? I'm good. How

1790
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:45,160
are you? Yeah, I'm good. So Alan, thank you for building me a new computer. You're welcome. I was

1791
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:51,160
due. What do you mean you were due? I usually try to upgrade my own PC every like three to five

1792
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,480
years and I usually build them to where I can last the whole five years, but I haven't been able to

1793
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:00,040
afford one. My machine that I built is still running from summer of 08. So I'm running a six

1794
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:07,400
year old system. Go straight to gamer jail. Um, but uh, when you, for the longest time when we

1795
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,400
started dating, I was like, you have a pre-made gateway, I'm going to build you a PC. And it

1796
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,080
finally happened. Did you judge me a little bit for that? No, you didn't know any better.

1797
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:19,080
Yeah, I do. I do. But yeah, no, you made it, you made it your, your mission to build me one. And

1798
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:23,320
they actually said at the store we went to to buy all the parts, which it was fries, whatever.

1799
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,000
I usually don't like naming places cause they don't pay us to mention, but whatever,

1800
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,240
went to fries. And they were like, uh, you know, you bought all this stuff and we'll assemble it

1801
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,000
for free. Do you want to do our assembly? I didn't, I didn't know that they even did that,

1802
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,680
let alone for free. But I was like, I can handle it. And I did. It was fine. Yeah.

1803
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,680
Well, except for that part you broke. That's all right.

1804
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:47,400
I mean, it's the thing that was wrong out of the box. No, the chip you tried to put in your

1805
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:54,920
computer today. Yeah. That I, that was my fault, but I was trying to cannibalize your PC that was

1806
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,320
now you've replaced it. So I was like, Ooh, you've got a quad core. I want to take that. But I

1807
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:05,400
somehow bent a couple of the CPU pins, which is, which is bad. But I, I got to take some Ram.

1808
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:10,120
I took some of your Ram. Are you noticing any difference at all? Not really. I'm defragging it.

1809
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,200
So there you go. Yeah. All right. So the nerds want to know what, what's, what's the specs.

1810
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:22,680
What do we do? Uh, how do we build the new PC? So if to start to stop any like fan wars before

1811
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:27,880
they start, I have certain allegiances to products that are just based off of my own experiences.

1812
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,720
If I had one bad experience with one brand and then good experiences with another,

1813
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:37,480
I'm just going to lean towards that. So I went with AMD just because I feel the performance that

1814
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:42,760
you get in the longevity you get for the price is better than Intel. You're paying for a premium

1815
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,600
with Intel. I know, but kind of like buying a Sony TV, why would you want to spend the extra

1816
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,320
two grand on a Sony TV when you can get a Samsung? That's kind of my attitude about it. Um, it's an

1817
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:59,960
AMD 8,358 core. It's got eight cores and the clock speed is 4.0 gigahertz, uh, 16 gigs of Ram,

1818
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:07,560
uh, Corsair Ram. I'm not sure of the speed. And it was, it wasn't the most super ultra

1819
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,840
fastest Ram cause it was just too expensive for 16 gigs. So it was kind of in the medium range.

1820
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:20,680
And then for the video card, it's a EVGA is the ones who made the card and the chip set

1821
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:30,680
is a, uh, Nvidia GTX, uh, 760 with two gigs on it. And it purrs. It's very quiet and I'm jealous

1822
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,760
of it already. Oh, it's such a quiet, but I had, I had, I had a fun time. I had a great time building

1823
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:39,160
it. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear it. I had a great time playing games on it last night. Yeah. Every

1824
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:44,440
it's like three is so smooth and a solid state hard drive for instantaneous windows and game

1825
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,920
loading. And that was based on Facebook recommendations. You didn't have that in the

1826
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:54,600
Yeah. Well just for regular disc trade, like a SATA hard drives, you can get like a terabyte

1827
01:30:54,600 --> 01:31:04,040
hard drive internal for like 110 bucks. Like just the cost of space is dirt cheap. And I'm like,

1828
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:09,560
if you've got a steam library, like we do with like 400 gigs worth of games that you can install,

1829
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:16,040
why not get like a giant fat plate disc hard drive? But everyone's like, no, you got to go

1830
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:20,200
solid state. So it's like, all right, you're the one buying it. So I'll get, I'll get you the

1831
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:25,400
prettiest thing. Um, go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tiger Claw asks about

1832
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:30,840
the PC case. Does it have a side panel window? It does. Um, which, which is really good because

1833
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,600
when you hook it up and you're ready to turn it on, you hit the little switch, not the main PC

1834
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:39,000
switch, but you hit the little switch on the power supply to get that power. Um, there's a little

1835
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,560
green led on the motherboard that lights up. It says everything's good. You're, you can try

1836
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,400
turning me on. So the, the, um, the little glass panel on the side of the case lets you see the

1837
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,880
motherboard. And I think there's like a red light or like it'll blink. It'll blink. If like, it's

1838
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,760
like, don't turn me on. Like you screwed something up. A lot of those things are kind of foolproof.

1839
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,720
Now. That's great. Like I'm sure there are nightmare stories where you hook something

1840
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:05,800
up wrong and turn it on and then you smell ozone and you just blew out the stuff you just bought.

1841
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,120
But there's a lot of fail safes in that stuff now. Um, now earlier in the show, when I was talking

1842
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,960
about the computer being built and everything, we had a chatter that said, why not just get a PC out

1843
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,640
of box or that's, that's really nerdy building your own PC. So why, why build your own PC Alan?

1844
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,520
Why, why did we take that route? It's kind of like, I don't know,

1845
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:29,400
dudes that are into, or, or, or women or whoever, uh, who are into cars that like just buying,

1846
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,920
restoring cars and they're all, their hands are all cut up and they've got calluses cause they like

1847
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:39,800
going in and going, here's this thing I made. That's, I can look at that computer and go,

1848
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:46,280
I built that. Um, also being kind of pretentious you, if you build your own,

1849
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:52,200
you can get exactly what you want. Um, the only way you can really do that as a gamer is to go to

1850
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:57,880
Alienware or what's that one company that they always podcasts have an affiliate program with

1851
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,520
them. They're in Seattle. Oh, uh, no, we won't mention because they don't sponsor this show.

1852
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:09,800
Well, you can, it's a cat apartment systems. Okay. All right. Um, Oh, okay. That's right.

1853
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:15,080
I just remembered. Um, you can go that route, but then you're paying a huge premium for all

1854
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:23,400
the souped up water cooling, dry ice, bubble led blinky shit like jet engine, weird custom

1855
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:29,160
loose site stripper heel case. Well that case has these two holes in it. And I was like,

1856
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,400
is that so you can fuck your computer? No, they're like, they're like little rubber

1857
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:37,400
buttholes that you can stick your finger in. No, it's for, it's for water cooling. If you

1858
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:42,600
want to run tubes, if you want to run tubes through like a chassis that will cool your

1859
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,440
graphics card and your CPU. So, um, you know, the case, um, for anyone that wants to Google image,

1860
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,400
search it, it's an ant tech and I love ant tech. That's one of those things where,

1861
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,160
why did you go AMD or why did you go into video? I just, I've had good experiences. So I'm,

1862
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:00,120
I'm loyal to those products. Well, and I know my current case is an ant tech 900 and I got you

1863
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:05,480
or picked out for you an ant tech 302. Uh, code man in our chat says I had a bad AMD

1864
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:09,800
processor once and it turned me off, but I love AMD video cards. That's actually where I'm at.

1865
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:15,960
I love the AMD video cards, but since, you know, I was, I was letting Alan be the boy playing with

1866
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:22,840
Legos and yes. Yeah. All right. You just, you do what you think is best and all. I had a nightmare.

1867
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:29,880
The computer that I had before this one, um, the catalyst software that ATI might be better now,

1868
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,280
but there was something about that catalyst software and the other hardware that I have,

1869
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:39,480
it was, I hated it. It blue screened all the time and I just, I did not like that. But Nvidia

1870
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:44,760
was always generally fine for me. So, okay. Um, gosh, I'm trying to think of what else to

1871
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,040
ask you with that. So are you, are you already thinking about what you want to do for your new

1872
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:52,680
computer now? I could upgrade. I mean, I can't get something as souped up as what you have,

1873
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,240
but I could like, I'm still on a dual core. I could just get a new motherboard and a CPU,

1874
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:00,360
even just keep the Ram that I have, even though it's like five year old Ram,

1875
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:04,120
I could probably do that for like 300 bucks or less. And she's, she's thinking they might have

1876
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:07,560
an extra quad core processor. I bet if we batted our eyelashes and asked very nicely,

1877
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,320
it's probably people out there that are getting like, I just got rid of mine. So my stuff is so

1878
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:16,520
old that I can't really even like the chip that I have is the highest chip that my motherboard

1879
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,560
will take. So I have to replace the motherboard too. All right. Well, if somebody wants to donate

1880
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:25,160
to your new computer fund, where can they find you on the internet? Uh, salacious pop on Twitter.

1881
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,440
It's salacious underscore pop on Twitter. And then I'm Alan alchemy on tumblr. There you go.

1882
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:37,320
And, uh, I fixed your DVD Ram drive. Usually there's one minor thing where I'll build the

1883
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:41,160
computer and turn it on. And like the little activity light that blinks when like you're

1884
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:45,160
reading to the hard drive that won't be hooked up. The thing that I forgot to do is your,

1885
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:50,920
your DVD Ram rider drive. I didn't hook it up to the power supply. So when I turned it on,

1886
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:57,080
I hit the little eject disc tray thing and I'm like, Oh, oh, DVD, DVD. Ram's not working. What

1887
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,200
I do. I just, I just hooked it up to power. Now it works now not to be reading Facebook

1888
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:07,240
messages, uh, publicly, but I have to ask you about this one because I noticed our buddy Brad

1889
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:13,160
from pod culture commented on your post about how you accidentally botched the pins on the four core

1890
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:18,760
Intel. And he suggests the old trick of using the barrel of a retractable ballpoint pin.

1891
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:23,560
I did not know about that trick and I may still try that. The thing is, is that I didn't realize

1892
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:28,760
that some of the pins were bent when I was trying to originally see it back onto the board. And by

1893
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:34,680
trying to see it, I made them worse. So the pins that the pins that are bent are pretty badly bent.

1894
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,920
They're not really kind of just leaning. One of them is pushed all the way down like flat.

1895
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,360
So that's pretty bad. That's bad. Yeah. All right. Well, anything else you want to share

1896
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,880
with listeners tonight? Um, I'm sorry that I don't guest on the show more, but as Rob knows,

1897
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:55,720
Sundays are usually my Mondays at work. Um, so I'm at work and then when it's a holiday or work

1898
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:02,360
is slow and I'm home, the show's great, but it's like, it's a free day off. I'm like,

1899
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:06,520
I don't usually work on Sunday, so I'll do housework or I'll just play 14 or video games

1900
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,360
or Diablo three. And then I'll listen. Like earlier when I was doing laundry,

1901
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:16,920
I was listening to the show that's happening in the house on my cell phone on a 10 second delay.

1902
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:22,600
So I would hear Flucco Jones laugh in person and then I would go down the hallway. Then I

1903
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:27,640
get the laugh again in my head, in my head, in my headphones. It's a very trippy effect

1904
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,840
to stream a show that takes place. Well, if you hurry, you can hear yourself. Yes.

1905
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,240
Uh, quickly though, what other, what other games have you been playing lately? What have you been

1906
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,920
into? It's a 14 and doing this stupid, it's more a conversation for a whorehouse, but the bullshit

1907
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,200
with the new kind of like your legendary weapon that they have in, wow, the relic stuff. It's

1908
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:51,240
really to chain you to a subscription because it takes so long to do. And so much of it's based off

1909
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:56,440
random numbers that I'm just, I'm hooked on trying to get that done. Uh, one more tip from Brad from

1910
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:00,920
pod culture in our chat room at life.vognetwork.com. Brad says really slowly bend it back with a pen

1911
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:05,480
and it should work. So yeah, good luck. I mean, Hey, if that works, that'd be awesome for you.

1912
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,880
Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. Uh, gosh, I can't think of anything that I already know. I've been playing

1913
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:15,240
14 Diablo three, which Skyrim. Oh, I talked earlier about Jurassic park. You've been watching

1914
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,600
me play that. What do you think of that? It looks fine. It looks like just one. It looks like a

1915
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:25,560
telltale adventure game. I did. There's there's the, the, the, I don't know if it switches

1916
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,280
characters in the, in the later episodes, but you're a professor, a veterinarian and his daughter.

1917
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:35,640
And she was asking him a question and I kind of chimed him, daddy, why do we look drunk?

1918
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:40,840
Because they kind of have this glassy eye, like the art direction's kind of weird.

1919
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:46,840
Like they just look, I swear to God, he should be doing live streaming. He is so

1920
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,800
funny. So why do you think I like him? So sometimes watching, watching the characters

1921
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,120
kind of talk, I'm like, there's, something's wrong with them, but that has nothing to do

1922
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:00,840
with the game. That's just kind of like how the people look, but it looks, it looks fine.

1923
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,440
Well, and then my favorite, well, I don't want to give a spoiler, but it's just, you know,

1924
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,840
the two characters that, Oh, they know each other. What a surprise because yeah, well,

1925
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,480
they both have bandanas. They're both, they're both the two people that aren't white.

1926
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,360
They both, they both have tattoos and it's like, and then she's like you and I'm like,

1927
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:26,600
of course they knew each other. Like it's, it's, yeah, it's bad. And then I loved screaming,

1928
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:30,680
like you were trying to, you were trying to solve a puzzle involving turning on the electricity.

1929
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,160
So when she opens up the electrical cabinet, I'm like, and dinosaurs,

1930
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:38,040
dinosaurs right now, lost her after right now. And he just kept waiting for dinosaurs to jump

1931
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:42,360
out for no reason. Like she, you know, she, she turns over like a dinosaur.

1932
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,200
As soon as they got the power on, what happened?

1933
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:49,640
A dinosaur showed up. But I want dinosaurs, like a full T-Rex to come out of like a can of soup,

1934
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:56,200
just like dinosaurs, like, like snakes in a can. But yeah, it looked fine. I don't really

1935
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:01,480
understand why. It's got some, a few tech hiccups though.

1936
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:08,600
Yeah. When the, when the game kind of froze, but three or four sentences of conversation audio

1937
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:13,960
were still happening. And then the subtitles and the video kind of caught up with the conversation.

1938
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,600
I was like, was that lag? Like what just happened? So yeah, there's a lot of weird tech stuff.

1939
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:24,200
All right. Well, Alan, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news and emails

1940
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,800
and all that good stuff. But thanks for dropping by.

1941
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,600
Did you see in chat when I said there were two OLR birthdays this week?

1942
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,920
No, tell us about the other one. I did see it, but it, our conversation had moved on.

1943
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,040
It was a whole delay thing, right? So tell, tell listeners about the other birthday.

1944
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:42,360
Our kitty Sanrio is 14. She's very old and she's still in great health. She's just,

1945
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:46,520
she's old so she sleeps a lot, but she'll be around for a few more years.

1946
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:51,400
That's great. Well, we'll give her extra, but we don't really celebrate cat birthdays sadly.

1947
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,080
I would like make her some actual fish, like tuna or salmon and cook it up,

1948
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,720
make kind of warm and give it to her. But I don't want her to have,

1949
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:01,400
I'll have to deal with that in the litter box later. So she doesn't really get

1950
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:08,360
a birthday feast. Her, uh, her system is too fragile for that. So she gets kibble forever.

1951
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,120
There you go. Well, she gets extra pettings. Yes. Today. All right. Well,

1952
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:15,080
Alan, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to, if you hear Flaco Jones laughing later and

1953
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:19,080
you want to respond to it, feel free to just jump in here. Okay. All right. You're always welcome.

1954
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:26,360
All right. Like the laughing gas left up track on big bang theory or something. I can't stop

1955
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:31,000
laughing. O L R was taped in front of a live studio audience of just Flaco Jones.

1956
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:38,040
All right. Uh, Oh, hack deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Sanrio.

1957
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:43,560
I'm not sure how to stop with the old jokes chat. I know, right? Y'all are mean.

1958
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,880
All right. Let's go to some rapid fire news. You guys, we're going to talk about a few things

1959
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:53,240
happening in the industry quickly. Uh, starting off with, um, I gotta be honest, guys. This is

1960
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,520
what happens when you have a week where there's not a lot of news. You get a lot of, you get a

1961
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:02,440
lot of stories, you get a lot of rumors and talkings going on. And there's an interesting

1962
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:07,320
story out there about apparently Sony originally wanted Titanfall on the PlayStation Vita.

1963
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,560
Titanfall, of course, the big game that came out on Xbox one last month,

1964
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,760
yet PlayStation four still managed to sell more consoles, but that's probably the price difference

1965
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:21,240
and nothing else coming into play there. I don't know, but anyhow, Titanfall was the big app that

1966
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:25,800
was, uh, going to move some Xbox ones last month. And it probably did, but it could have maybe moved

1967
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:32,360
some Vitas, uh, apparently respawned and reached out to Sony before the exclusive is exclusivity

1968
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:38,920
agreement, exclusive agreement, God damn with Microsoft, uh, to talk about, uh, all, all that

1969
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:45,880
and putting Titanfall on the Vita. Um, this all came from the final hours app, which is, uh, was

1970
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,960
released for Titanfall. There's been a few of these apps for games like tomb Raider and I think

1971
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,080
portal two might've had one and some of those games. So, uh, that all came out of that. However,

1972
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:01,640
respawn did after the story first broke, they did clarify that Sony wanted it to do what was called

1973
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:09,080
an R one project on the Vita, not the finalized Titanfall games. In other words, it was way before

1974
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:14,520
the game became what it was is when Sony wanted it, but I still kind of go, well, that's still,

1975
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:19,960
you know, that's still pretty big because, you know, respawn the whole way that, you know,

1976
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:24,600
kind of started and what the kinds of games they've made and so forth and in their history and

1977
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,920
so forth, you, whoever was going to get the exclusive from them was going to be a big deal.

1978
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:34,040
So it's, it's really not a surprise at all that Sony pitched it. I think the, the interesting

1979
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:37,800
thing to think about is what if that game had been on the Vita? It's kind of interesting,

1980
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:41,480
but I think response coming out and saying, if it had been the Vita probably would have gone

1981
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:47,160
a completely different direction. So it makes sense to me. So anyhow, there is that talk going

1982
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:52,520
on on the internet this week. Um, speaking of team-ups that didn't happen, Activision,

1983
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:57,640
and this isn't, this is something Activision said themselves. Activision said that initially

1984
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:04,840
they wanted to team up with Skylanders with Nintendo. Uh, Nintendo turned it down.

1985
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,680
Now, even though Skylanders, uh, is on Nintendo devices, as you know, Skylanders is pretty big

1986
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:17,160
and it's on all the different game consoles. Uh, here's a quote here from, um, let's see,

1987
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:24,360
uh, who said this? I don't know who said this comment here because the, the source article

1988
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:29,320
I'm reading never says who, who did this, but, uh, some executives at Activision said, quote,

1989
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:33,000
we have been directed towards thinking about something that would play well with Nintendo.

1990
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,840
I think there was some co-marketing money and the Wii was doing well. They had some success

1991
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,200
with peripherals. They spent a long time looking and looking. They were just like,

1992
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,800
we've never seen anything like this before. I've always wondered about the full meaning of that

1993
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:49,400
comment. We have no idea why they didn't commit. Clearly they have got properties well suited to

1994
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,560
this world. Why is it that they didn't rush in here will probably haunt them for the rest of

1995
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:59,320
their days. So, um, that's interesting that Nintendo could have had that, but they didn't

1996
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:04,680
want that. Um, but it's not that, I mean, again, Skylanders made the Nintendo platforms at the end

1997
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:09,560
of the day, but Nintendo would have been more deeply involved probably with the creation and,

1998
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,480
and considering some of the strong characters that Nintendo builds that could have made for

1999
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:23,000
a very interesting partnership. So, Hmm. Um, also, uh, in kind of what the heck type of news going

2000
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,240
on, uh, bungee, which, uh, made the halo series in the past and is now making destiny, which a

2001
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:35,240
lot of people are looking forward to, including myself, uh, let go their big composer this week,

2002
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:39,560
Marty O'Donnell or Martin O'Donnell, excuse me, who, uh, actually crafted some of the,

2003
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:44,760
the Epic soundtrack for the halo games and was working on the destiny games was terminated by

2004
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:50,680
bungee this week, which is, uh, very interesting. Uh, bungee did talk to the media at a destiny

2005
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:56,120
preview quote, we don't make decisions lightly and the music from O'Donnell will remain in the

2006
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:02,120
upcoming game, but there's nothing else after that. So, uh, very interesting circumstances.

2007
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:07,800
The tweet from, uh, him says I'm saddened to say that bungee's board of directors terminated me

2008
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:15,560
without cause on April 11th, 2014. Wow. So you got to wonder, I mean, I don't know, like, I don't

2009
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,800
want to be all up in the business. I mean, who knew maybe the guy showed up late for work every

2010
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:24,120
day or something. I don't know. I just, there could be a million, a million, billion reasons,

2011
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:29,800
but it's going to be weird because this music is so, so, so good, uh, that it's not in the,

2012
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:35,880
um, next game after destiny two or whatever inevitable things comes after that dark saga.

2013
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,320
He could have just been a big diva, you know, you never, it could, I mean, there's,

2014
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:44,040
we don't really, you know, companies aren't going to exactly talk about personnel issues forthright.

2015
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:47,400
So we're left to rely on Twitter and reading between the lines and all that.

2016
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:53,160
Well, in some other quick news, um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be available via

2017
01:46:53,160 --> 01:47:00,120
steam early access. Um, so you can basically play it as it's in progress and it's supposed to be a

2018
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:05,160
pretty neat game. I mean, there were strange adventures in infinite space in 2002 and then

2019
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:12,200
weird worlds returned to infinite space 2005. Um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be,

2020
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:20,200
$9.95 and like I said, early access. And then, um, there was a little bit of talk about, uh,

2021
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:27,400
the last of us, the PS4 edition about if it was going to be, um, discounted as well. And, um,

2022
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:34,280
uh, uh, dude from Naughty Dog, Eric Mona, Monticelli, is that how I pronounce his name?

2023
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:41,720
Um, said, uh, that they're looking into the business model for the, uh, different versions

2024
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:48,920
of the game. Um, at least as far as discounting the PS3 one as well. Um, and they were looking

2025
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:53,080
for owners of the, basically the big question was regarding the owners of the PS3 version

2026
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:59,480
who also got the PS4 version, but they haven't given anything really committed to it.

2027
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:07,720
And then, um, last but not least in Outrun, uh, 3D Outrun is going to have two new songs in it,

2028
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:13,320
like brand new songs. One is, um, it's coming out April 23rd in Japan. It's Cruising Line

2029
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:22,280
by, uh, Manabu Namiki and Camino Amiamor from, uh, Jane Evelyn Nisperos. And there's going to be a

2030
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:29,320
new car, three different simulated cabinets, four screen modes, remappable controls,

2031
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,840
replay saving with multi-spleet payback, uh, mid-race saving, customizable volume for game

2032
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:42,360
audio, engine noise, and ambient arcade machine noise. So, yay. That's it.

2033
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,120
Are you going to be picking that up? Huh? Are you going to be picking that up? Outrun on 3DS maybe?

2034
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:57,000
Well, I'm sure Dan will probably. He's the one with the XLs and he's the bigger Outrun fan.

2035
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:03,080
Gotcha. All right. Well, now is the point where we're going to, uh, turn to our listeners for

2036
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:07,480
feedback on a particular question we ask in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.

2037
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:19,880
Every week we ask a question of our fan communities over on Facebook and on Google Plus.

2038
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:25,480
And, uh, we read some of our favorite answers here on the air. Uh, tonight was a bit of a tricky

2039
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:29,400
question, but it has to do with the whole Prince of Persia thing we talked about earlier. And the

2040
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:35,240
question we asked was, what classic video game franchise would you like to see done in the style

2041
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:40,040
of a newer video game? So that's the question we asked because, you know, Prince of Persia being

2042
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:45,720
redone like Rayman Legends. So, okay. Let's, rumor anyway. Let's see what you guys think would be a

2043
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,480
classic video game redone, like a newer video game. We'll start with Google Plus tonight and

2044
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:54,760
some of the answers over there. I love this answer for entertainment. Leisure suit Larry

2045
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:02,040
done in the style of Farmville. You can help, you can help your friends to farm the necessary

2046
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:07,320
materials to put together the necessary quest items in order to hopefully nail that saucy Latina

2047
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:12,200
down the hall. Or you could actually talk to that equally saucy Latina in the cubicle next to you,

2048
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:17,160
who has the added quality of being real. I don't know where he was going with that,

2049
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:22,200
but I like the opportunity of combining Leisure Suit Larry with Farmville. It's great.

2050
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:29,960
Panaxium replies. It says Kid Icarus done in the new Strider style. The new Strider game was

2051
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,720
pretty hot. Kid Icarus, don't think that would be cool. Or Mega Man X done like the Mass Effect

2052
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:41,720
trilogy. I don't know about that one. Who would be interesting? Who would Mega Man romance in that?

2053
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:47,240
I don't know. That would be very, very interesting. All right. Act Deft replied on

2054
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:51,960
Google Plus and said this reminds me of the 3D classics Nintendo and Sega made for the 3DS.

2055
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,800
I would like to see more games done in that style. Well, you got Outrun to look forward to. There

2056
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:02,600
you go. And Travis H says Symphony of the Night done in the style of Shadow Complex or Super

2057
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:08,200
Ghosts and Goblins done in the style of Rayman Legends. Oh, Ghosts and Goblins. That's a, that's

2058
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,160
a series that's been gone way too long that would be cool to see come back in a new modern platform

2059
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:18,360
style. That's pretty cool. I like that. Let's go over to Facebook and see some of the answers

2060
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:23,480
over there on facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Just a few comments on Facebook tonight,

2061
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:28,360
so I'll go ahead and read them all here. Fifth Dream says I used to love an old game called

2062
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:34,440
Gain Ground. I imagine it would be really cool if they revamped it to be a lot like Diablo 3.

2063
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:39,320
You know that's happening with Gauntlet. Gauntlet is being redone and it's going to look like,

2064
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,280
we talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show, it's going to look like Diablo. I'm very

2065
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:49,320
interested. Awesome Unicorn says every game series ever with good music done in the style

2066
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:55,480
of Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Donkey Kong Country, Castlevania, Saga, Mana, Kingdom Hearts. The

2067
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:59,800
possibilities are endless. Okay, that's not what you really asked, but I still want it. You know

2068
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:03,400
what? I'll accept that answer, especially because some of those games you mentioned were other

2069
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:08,360
square franchises. I was kind of surprised it wasn't DLC in the first Theatrhythm,

2070
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:17,000
maybe in this Theatrhythm game, who knows. AZHP, I love this answer, says Final Fantasy

2071
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,800
done in the style of Bravely Default. Okay, do you guys get why that's funny? Because Bravely

2072
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:29,080
Default is a throwback to the old Final Fantasy games, whereas Final Fantasy 13 and so forth

2073
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:34,040
haven't really been like the old Final Fantasy. That's the joke. Forget it. All right,

2074
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:40,760
Ospher says I'm going to do a reversal on this and say a newer game done in the style of an

2075
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:46,280
older one. Who said you could change the rules? Who do you think you are? All right, fine. I'll

2076
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:52,440
take it. Ace Combat, yes, the flight simulator, done in the style of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

2077
01:52:52,440 --> 01:53:01,160
Okay, if you're going to flip the script, do an answer that makes more sense. I don't get that

2078
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:08,520
one. I guess because it's fast. He says because it would be hilarious yet beautiful. Fabrice A

2079
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:15,000
replies on Facebook and says the first Sega Rally Championship with upgraded Outrun 2 graphics.

2080
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:23,800
It might be good. Good times. Burr replies and says mech warrior done in the style of Titanfall.

2081
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:28,040
By that I mean more urban warfare with lots of ground units and elementals.

2082
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,400
Lots of mechs or mechs are coming back in with Titanfall. I mean, not that mechs ever left,

2083
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:39,000
but definitely Titanfall. Like everybody loves the mechs in that game. All right, there you go.

2084
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,200
Those are the answers from Facebook and Google Plus and we look forward to seeing more answers

2085
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:50,200
throughout the week. And you should add us on our communities so you can answer questions in future

2086
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:56,280
weeks. There you go. Some folks in chat trying to figure out how the hell is Sonic 3 going to work

2087
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:01,240
with a plane. And Orange Right says Sonic 3 with a plane. ACT-DEV says Sonic 3 already has a plane

2088
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,920
though. That's right, like in the very beginning of the game, right? And Darted Studio just says,

2089
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:10,360
I don't even know how that would work. I'm going to ask for to email us and tell us a little more

2090
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:16,920
about his plans here. It is 4.20 after all. So you are going to hear some really weird ideas today

2091
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:22,280
for no particular reason. Just saying it's, you know, just it's all the peeps people are eating

2092
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:29,080
today. Everyone's high on peeps. Okay, fine. Everybody's chocolate peanut butter eggs.

2093
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:35,320
I haven't eaten any of those yet. Tomorrow's the big day. I bought a bag of peanut butter M&M eggs

2094
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:40,600
and they are delicious. Why did you not share? I should have brought those over. I brought beer.

2095
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:45,800
I'll take a beer. Go for it. I got a couple left still. I'm not drinking anymore because

2096
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:50,920
they're a little strong. Free beer. Jamie has to drive home, so no beer for me. Awesome. Okay.

2097
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:58,360
What was I going to say? I was going to ask you guys if you had a, I know it's a tricky question.

2098
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:04,360
I don't know if you guys thought about it before the show, but a old video game done in the style

2099
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:09,880
of a new video game. Anything you have to think of? An old video game done in the style of a new

2100
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,720
video game. Well, I'm in honor of my Silent Hill shirt. It's not really like that old,

2101
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:19,800
but, and I said this when I first played through Heavy Rain with my friends. I was like,

2102
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:24,520
why don't they do Silent Hill like this? It's so cinematic. You know, I know it's not Silent

2103
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:30,600
Hill, but the series really hasn't gone very far recently. So it's not like, just say the old,

2104
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:35,960
the good Silent Hill games done in the style because then maybe, you know, and I love the old

2105
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:39,240
good Silent Hill games, but maybe what I'm thinking is more as a revival, do it in that

2106
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:44,360
Heavy Rain. What's the other game that came out this year? Beyond Two Souls style of, you know,

2107
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:49,480
choose your own adventure. Very cinematic, very scripted, but there's multiple branching paths

2108
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:54,600
and it can turn out a really good story. I love those games. So maybe since Silent Hill's kind of

2109
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:58,600
falling off and it's hard to recapture the magic, doing the same thing over and over again, maybe

2110
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:02,440
do something like that. And I don't know, that's just something that I thought of. Not really the

2111
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:08,600
exact question, but. The first Mass Effect remade with Mass Effect 3's game play. I'm not serious

2112
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,120
about that. No, yeah, yeah. It would, it would help. That's like the one thing I don't like

2113
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:16,280
about the first Mass Effect is that I like playing like the way the third one plays better than the

2114
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:20,200
first one. I think a lot of games could benefit from that. I know I hated the first Uncharted

2115
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:23,480
game. I liked the other two, but the first Uncharted game is such a slog to play through.

2116
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:27,480
It's like, I wish it was more like this, more like this. And they really, you can tell when

2117
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,840
a game improves on something and it's like, but then sometimes you wish they could go back and

2118
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:38,120
fix the original. Gosh, I'm having a hard time thinking of a good answer for this. I thought I

2119
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:45,240
had something before the show went live tonight, but maybe I kind of want to say, I don't know,

2120
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:51,160
my mind goes towards, I really want to see a Gradius revival done. And I think I'd like to see

2121
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:55,960
it in the style of like, like a, like a twin, like a modern twin stick shooter, maybe something like

2122
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,120
Resogun, like really pretty like that. But like, I think I just really want a new Gradius game,

2123
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:11,640
honestly, is what I want. So otherwise, maybe a rad racer game, cheesy 3D and all done in the

2124
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:20,840
style of Burnout. How about that? It'd be fun. All right. Let's go back into some other news.

2125
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:24,440
Huh? Actually something just occurred to me. Yeah, go for it. We were watching some

2126
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:30,040
Inside Sim Racing, which is a video cast that Dan likes to watch, was doing a review of,

2127
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:36,360
I think the game's called MX2. It's a, it's a motocross game. But they mentioned something

2128
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:41,160
about wanting customizable tracks. I was just thinking, wouldn't doing Excitebike in the style

2129
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:46,920
of MX2 be cool? Cause that actually was a really neat looking game. Just saying. Bobby Blackwolf

2130
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,240
in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Rock Band in the style of Flappy Vog.

2131
01:57:51,240 --> 01:58:01,320
All right. Let's get back into some news. Let's see. I mentioned earlier in the show that there

2132
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:06,360
was some interesting things going on with Square Enix and Sony and that whole thing. So news broke

2133
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:11,560
earlier this week that Sony announced they're going to be selling off their stake in video

2134
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:17,080
game company Square Enix. You may not have known this, but Sony was actually an investor in Square

2135
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:22,600
Enix since the early two thousands, you know, around the time they got Final Fantasy 7 to come

2136
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,880
out on the, actually it would have been more around nine probably was coming out around that

2137
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:33,000
time. But yeah, Sony was once an investor in Square Enix. They owned 8.2% of the company.

2138
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:41,720
So they sold off 9.5 million shares valued at $156 million, leaving a $47 million profit. However,

2139
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:49,320
we won't really know what this boils down to until the end of May. Now don't think that this

2140
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:53,000
is because Sony's like mad at Square Enix or something like that. Like it's not necessarily

2141
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,720
that. This definitely seems to be a, you know, basically financial. It's business, not personal.

2142
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:04,040
Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Really. They're saying that basically Sony's been streamlining

2143
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:10,040
their operations. For example, Sony got rid of the VAIO computers. They laid off employees.

2144
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:15,160
They restructured the TV business. They shut down some of their buildings, including the

2145
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,560
old headquarters in Tokyo. So, and the New York City tower, as well as the Sony,

2146
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:24,120
even though the PlayStation is doing very well for Sony, they're really struggling in some other

2147
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:31,640
areas. So this is kind of part of how they balance the books basically. So that's what's going on.

2148
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:39,320
Now, no clue what this means for Square Enix. But hopefully they'll be able to, you know,

2149
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:43,320
kind of, you know, since this is a traded company, those shares will get picked up

2150
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:51,640
somewhere else. We'll see. So, an interesting, interesting move. You know, Sony and Square

2151
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,720
Enix back around that same time would have been partners in that whole play online thing. So they

2152
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,760
were kind of, you know, they were close buddies for a long time, but now who knows what this will

2153
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:08,360
cause for the future. Dar Sakura, what do you got for us? I have some stuff. Basically, given that

2154
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:13,240
we were talking about Silent Hill earlier, this is pretty good to mention, is that Silent Hill

2155
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:19,960
Origins and Shattered Memories are both going to the Vita. And that's soon, according to Konami.

2156
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:28,840
But they will be £7.99. No, I don't really see what the word is for how it would be in US and

2157
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:42,440
Japan. So, also, I accidentally closed the thing trying to make it visible. I don't think it was

2158
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:46,760
just Silent Hill Origins. I want to say Shattered Memories. I did say Shattered Memories. Oh, sorry.

2159
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:53,320
Rob, that's what you get for nothing. See, now we can make this the Pooh and Rob. He had to open

2160
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:58,360
his beer. Yeah, I know, right? There really wasn't a whole lot else just talking about the history

2161
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:03,480
of those games. Silent Hill Origins was a PSP game from 2007, and Silent Hill Shattered Memories

2162
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:09,480
was PSP, PS2, and Wii, which was a little different. I played that game on the Wii.

2163
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:14,520
The problem I had with that game was, and I don't know if you can do this, but the nunchuck is

2164
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:18,680
corded, right? I don't know if they have wireless nunchucks, but there's an element of that game

2165
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:23,720
where if a monster... Well, the move is wireless nunchucks. No, I'm just talking about the actual

2166
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:29,000
Wii. The only ones I ever used were wired nunchucks, so there's a part where the enemies

2167
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,080
have to grab onto you, and you have to shake the controller, and I kept whipping myself in the face

2168
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:38,040
with the cord between the nunchuck and the Wiimote, and I'm just like, ah, get it off of me! You shake

2169
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,160
it off, and the monsters get on you, and you zap, and you just keep whacking yourself in the face

2170
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:52,200
with this stupid cord. That game was... It could have been so much better. I don't know. The worst

2171
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:57,320
part about it was when you're exploring the world in that game, nothing bad can happen to you,

2172
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,920
so it kind of takes away that tear element. It's creepy and everything, and it's got the atmosphere,

2173
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:08,280
but the fact that you're completely safe at all times you're exploring is weird. It's like you're

2174
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:13,000
used to walking around the corner, and there's a dog or a monster or something that can just start

2175
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,760
getting you, and you're trapped, and you don't have any weapons or anything, but in this game,

2176
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:20,360
it's just like, oh, these are exploring parts. Nothing's going to hurt you, and these are the

2177
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:23,560
monster parts. You just run, run, run, run, and if something gets on you, you shake your controller

2178
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:28,040
and whip yourself in the face, and that's all it was. Silent Hill for five-year-olds?

2179
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,280
Yeah, it really wasn't. The thing is that the monster running parts were so hard I had to have

2180
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:38,040
my friend Nathan do it. It's like, you do it. I get lost, and if you slow down for a second,

2181
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:44,120
you just get overwhelmed. You die and just start over, but there's only a few of those segments

2182
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,080
really in the game that are... There's three really hard ones. The rest of them are pretty

2183
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:51,080
easy, so it's more of an experience than a straight-up game.

2184
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,840
I don't know how that would translate on the Vita. Like, you shake your Vita around?

2185
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:58,040
You shake the Vita?

2186
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:01,320
But I never played... Apparently, there's a PS2 version, so I don't know. On that one,

2187
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:03,720
I doubt... You can't shake the controller around, obviously,

2188
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,800
so maybe you just mash a button. I don't know.

2189
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,160
Jiggle the analog sticks.

2190
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,360
Yeah, that's probably what it is.

2191
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:13,000
Would you be interested at all in checking out either of these games on the Vita?

2192
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,120
You know, I never played Origins, so I would be interested in playing that one.

2193
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:20,280
I do have it on PS2, but I don't feel like hooking it up, so... For eight bucks,

2194
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:25,080
and maybe it'll be cheaper someday. Maybe I'll get that one. I always wait out for the PS Plus

2195
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:28,760
deals, so there's a chance I could get it really cheap. I would probably get that one.

2196
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:29,960
That works.

2197
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:35,080
All right, well, moving on to a story about the Xbox One. The Xbox One got a bit of an

2198
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:41,640
update this week. They had an update roll out to the Xbox One consoles that include quite a

2199
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:48,200
few things, including improved game DVR video quality, Blu-ray player supporting 50

2200
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:54,920
HZ video output, where applicable, controller and headset firmware updates to help improve static

2201
02:03:54,920 --> 02:04:00,760
issues, Connect voice and motion improvements, which some people have been bitching about on

2202
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:06,760
the Xbox Ones. That's good. Friends improvements. When favorites and friends sign into Xbox Live,

2203
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:10,200
you'll get notifications. I had no idea this wasn't already on the One. It's on all the

2204
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:15,720
systems that are out there today. That was interesting. And then game app and saves progress

2205
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:20,680
bar updates. So you'll actually get a progress bar that shows you how far along your game is in

2206
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:24,200
saving, so you don't think the whole thing's locked up and shut it off prematurely or something

2207
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:30,120
like that. So that should be already out there on the Xbox Ones. If not, you should probably

2208
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:34,920
connect your system to the internet and let the magic happen so you get all those fancy new

2209
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:40,600
updates. All right, we're going to open up our mailbag every week. We invite you guys to

2210
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:46,040
participate with our show by emailing us participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2211
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:52,520
Dark soccer is going to dive into the email bag and pick out a few emails that she believes are

2212
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:57,560
worthy of sharing on tonight's show. Well, we had four emails, which I am actually waiting to

2213
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:04,120
load now that for some reason I keep getting disconnected. Your tablet is being very unruly

2214
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:10,920
tonight. It is. But there was one that SSG100 Matt sent us that we've actually already covered.

2215
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:20,840
And that was about the DDR marathon and Notch's contribution towards it. But it's definitely good

2216
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:26,760
that you wanted to let us know about it. We should spread gamers doing good. We should spread the

2217
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:31,720
good news with that. So I kind of knew that would come in from some of our listeners that have been

2218
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:36,760
with us a very long time when we were music exclusive. Hey, that's one of the downsides

2219
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:43,400
about getting into the late 30s. I could never do a marathon like that anymore. I need a marathon

2220
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:50,600
where I can be seated and play the games. I can't dance for 16 hours straight. So more props to you.

2221
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:56,280
It's just hold on because it keeps logging me out of the email.

2222
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:04,920
So I'm very, very irritated right now. That's not good. Well, that's the joys and

2223
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:10,120
adventures of doing live radio. Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights.

2224
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:12,840
And those of you guys that listen to us through the podcast feed, you should try to join us

2225
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,400
sometime. I mean, I know Game of Thrones is on and all, but you can pirate it later like everybody

2226
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:22,840
else does. That's what Netflix is for. Well, actually Game of Thrones ain't on Netflix.

2227
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:27,240
You have to HBO special. They do their own app. But anyway, we've got, we've got mail.

2228
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:32,760
Hey guys, this show is awesome. You make a boring data entry. So much more exciting for me here at

2229
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,960
work. I heard you need more emails. So I'm going for it. I just started playing torchlight too.

2230
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:43,080
And it was my very first top down RPG experience. I started co-op with a buddy at the hardest

2231
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:48,360
difficulty. I seem to die every five minutes. Any tips? Start on easy and practice.

2232
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:54,120
Yeah. Honestly, you answered your own question. Uh, you've got it. You got to tone it down

2233
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:59,880
and practice and then work your way up to that. I don't remember with torchlight to either if it's

2234
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:05,480
like Diablo, the thing in Diablo, you start on the easiest difficulty, get gear, and then you

2235
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:10,040
can amp up the difficulty to get better drops. And then once you get into like torment, which is the

2236
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,560
hardest difficulty, you get like the best drops in the game. So you do have to work your way up.

2237
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:17,560
I can't remember in torchlight. I have played torchlight and I liked torchlight to an awful lot.

2238
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:21,240
I can't remember if it was that similar thing where you can take that character and move them

2239
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:25,240
through different difficulty levels. I don't recall, but if you can, I would suggest doing

2240
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:30,840
that for sure. But, uh, I, I think you actually answered your own question. If you really want to

2241
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:35,480
otherwise, like you're all gung ho about, Nope, we're going to do this in the hardest difficulty

2242
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:41,720
from the outset, then you gotta be prepared to die a lot. But I would say, know when to go in

2243
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:47,320
and retreat. And especially in those types of games, I find that if you get just a little too

2244
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:52,840
close, like you're running too fast, you'll pull a whole pack of mobs at once. So I would say,

2245
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:59,320
move slowly, take it slowly. I still say, go start easier so that you can learn the mechanics

2246
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:03,800
while you have an opportunity to use said mechanics. That would be my first answer as

2247
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:06,920
well. But if, if for whatever reason you guys are like, Nope, we're going to do this

2248
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:11,560
the hardest way and get our achievements and that's what we're going to do, then that would

2249
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:16,200
be my strategy is make sure you're moving slowly. So you don't pull a whole screen of mobs at once.

2250
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:21,160
All right. Um, also I really prayed that Titanfall would be the Call of Duty killer,

2251
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:26,040
but at least on PC, the active player count has gone way down to the point where a couple

2252
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:30,280
playlists are completely empty. I think it's because the game is too difficult for Call of

2253
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:34,280
Duty newbies who can't take their shooter skills vertical. What do you guys think?

2254
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:42,440
I think I don't like either game, so, um, I'm more interested in Titanfall and Call of Duty for sure.

2255
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:47,080
Um, just, you know, I, I liked more of the sci-fi stuff and you know, that's why I was in a Mass

2256
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:52,760
Effect and so forth. But, um, I haven't really played it on PC. My assumption is that the player

2257
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:58,520
base is probably dwindling because a lot of attention gets diverted in other directions on PC

2258
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:02,840
and especially with the cost of the game being a little high, you probably really only have the

2259
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:07,320
diehards in there right now. I would imagine as soon as the game gets discounted, which is going

2260
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:11,400
to be a little bit because EA doesn't always discount right away, but once the game does

2261
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,680
get discounted, you'll probably see a lot more people jumping on board with that real quick.

2262
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:20,280
Just give it a little time. It's probably a game that's going to build slowly. Um,

2263
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:25,800
and I think a lot of people, you know, on the Xbox one, that was the big game for the month.

2264
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:31,400
So you're going to have people that kind of last a little longer, the pool of players on there,

2265
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:35,080
because there's not a bunch of other stuff on the Xbox one competing for attention right now.

2266
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:40,280
Have a wonderful Sunday and keep gaming guys. That's from EA Skizie.

2267
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,600
Thank you EA Skizie.

2268
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:43,960
Next up.

2269
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:47,560
Good luck typing. Because they said data entry was their thing.

2270
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:52,600
I don't have any ideas, any idea what prompted this discussion topic,

2271
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:57,400
but what major video game characters slash enemies come to mind? His primary attack

2272
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:04,120
is self-destructing. I was thinking of Dan Hibiki because his version of the Shingoku

2273
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:10,120
Satsu takes him down to like one bar of life. Um, the four most obvious ones to me would be

2274
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:17,080
the creepers in Minecraft, the Bob-ombs from Mario Brothers, um, two, sorry, and the Pokemon

2275
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:22,280
Voltorb and its evolution electrode and possibly the prenees from Disgaea. And that's from Robert

2276
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:28,120
M. Optional P.S. I heard Weird Al's your horoscope for today and check to see if there

2277
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:33,560
was an AMV style video redundant for a certain web comic, which of course there is.

2278
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:36,840
That homestuck.

2279
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:40,440
Yeah, even I got that reference from the shirt talk you were talking about later.

2280
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:45,640
Thank you for the email. What a random question, but you hit all the big ones. I would have

2281
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:49,880
thought of the prenees from Disgaea too, but one that you didn't name since we've been on

2282
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:54,040
a Final Fantasy kick tonight. There's always some type of bomb. Yeah, there's a bomb,

2283
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:58,280
mobs, grenade, or whatever they call it in the game. And their big attack is, uh, exploding.

2284
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:03,640
So you have to kill them before they explode and kill you. It's almost always in a Final

2285
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:04,760
Fantasy game. There's one of those.

2286
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:09,480
Doesn't one of the weapons kill itself if you can't kill it in seven or was that something

2287
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,040
else I'm thinking of?

2288
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,480
I think so. It has been forever.

2289
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:18,280
Some enemy will, oh, uh, pyramid head. If you don't beat, well, when you technically,

2290
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:25,640
when you beat the red pyramid, it actually turns and lands on, he lands on his, uh, knife.

2291
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,140
That's right.

2292
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:29,960
So not that it's an attack that's self-destructing,

2293
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:33,960
but that you don't get to be the one to get the kill hit really.

2294
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:38,840
Flaco Jones, you a big fan of any self-destructing mobs in video games?

2295
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:42,360
I hate self-destructing mobs in video games.

2296
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,160
Very random question.

2297
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:44,120
Me and PvP.

2298
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:49,640
Chrono Trigger has those ones that they give you tons of XP and everything,

2299
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:53,400
but you have to kill them before they self-destruct. There's those like rock things.

2300
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,400
Uh, when you're up on the mountain.

2301
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,040
Yeah.

2302
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:56,540
Yeah.

2303
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:57,880
Me and Spelunky.

2304
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:01,720
That for me, that's like a race. Like I got the XP because they're so good for farming on,

2305
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:04,280
but if they blow up ahead of time, you don't get anything.

2306
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:08,760
Uh, me and Spelunky, I self-destruct myself all the time in that frustrating ass game.

2307
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,440
That's for sure. All right.

2308
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,120
Little big planning to blow yourself up.

2309
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:15,480
They just did that to work around people getting stuck on their terribly designed levels.

2310
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:20,920
You know, the first one I thought of was, was Dan in Street Fighter.

2311
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:25,960
Cause he has his, that the screen goes black, everything. And he's like, almost,

2312
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:29,080
he does die if you're, if you don't have a full life bar.

2313
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:34,200
So, and then it does like two bars on the enemy or something like that.

2314
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:38,840
Well, that was a random ass question, but you know what? I like random questions. So thanks.

2315
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:40,600
This is the random show.

2316
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:45,720
Um, last email then. Greetings, OLR. Since you have been light on emails lately,

2317
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:48,920
I figured I'd send one that I'd been batting around for awhile.

2318
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,240
This has to do with the dream I once had as a child.

2319
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:56,680
At the time, the dream had tormented me due to its promises. And I'm wondering nowadays

2320
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:58,920
if I was really onto something ahead of its time.

2321
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:05,800
Run the clock back to mid 1991 with the SNES American release, uh, quickly approaching.

2322
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,240
Having finally discovered the true glory of RPGs,

2323
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:12,680
I was positively salivating over the intended power coverage

2324
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:16,680
of the incredible looking Final Fantasy II, which was IV over there.

2325
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:20,680
For the upcoming powerhouse of a system, the game was consuming my every waking

2326
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:23,560
moment until it finally snaked its way into my dreams.

2327
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:26,120
Now, I didn't actually dream about the game itself per se,

2328
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:29,960
but rather I dreamed about the act of owning it.

2329
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:33,000
You see, in my dream, not only did I own the cartridge for the game,

2330
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,880
I would transform it to fit whatever system I tried to put it on.

2331
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,520
Game Boy or SNES.

2332
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:41,560
Much like the cross-saved functionality of Sony's products today,

2333
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:45,240
I was carrying this game with me and playing it constantly.

2334
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:48,280
At the time, the dream just left me frustrated and impatient,

2335
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:50,120
and I can't help but feel like decades ago,

2336
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:53,320
I foreshadowed the way I'm currently playing Final Fantasy X and X-2.

2337
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:58,040
So, OLR crew, have you ever had any particular memorable dreams involving gaming,

2338
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:01,160
whether it be about a game itself or just the act of gaming?

2339
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,640
My most sincere apologies to everyone

2340
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:07,560
if I tap into Hidden Well of Nocturnal Subconscious Mass Effect slash fiction.

2341
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:11,800
Keep up the great work, and thanks for the hours of entertainment.

2342
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,160
Sincerely, Awesome Unicorn.

2343
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:16,440
A dream involving video games.

2344
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,280
I know, I had one, actually, I can tell you right now.

2345
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:18,600
Okay.

2346
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:20,440
This is how I figured out how to play DDR properly.

2347
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:24,680
It's because I actually, because I kept doing the step back to the middle thing

2348
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:29,560
that everybody does when they're new, and then I just like, I went to bed,

2349
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:32,120
and then I started dreaming about moving from arrow to arrow,

2350
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:35,480
and then I got up and played the game fine the next day.

2351
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:41,320
I went from doing like three star, or three foot songs,

2352
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:44,920
to going right into, you know, sixes with no problem.

2353
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:51,320
So it was just, it was just a sort of an occur to me kind of thing.

2354
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:54,440
I don't really remember dreams.

2355
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:57,400
I'm one of those people, like some people can't remember their dream,

2356
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:59,800
which is funny because we were talking about my memory issues earlier in the show,

2357
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:04,440
but like for real, once in a great, great, great, great while I'll have a dream that I remember,

2358
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:09,320
but it's so rare, like, and not nothing I can think of that involves video games, actually.

2359
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:10,120
Sorry.

2360
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:15,160
I do almost, almost always remember at least something I would have dreamt the night before.

2361
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:16,360
I'm a lucid dreamer.

2362
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:17,000
No, not me.

2363
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:22,040
So like, wow, that's one thing that that always crept into my dreams.

2364
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:25,480
It's like, because you stop playing, but the game is so like,

2365
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:27,400
I don't know, monotonous, I guess, in a way.

2366
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:31,560
I just, I would go to sleep and I would just imagine I'm still grinding on something.

2367
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,960
You have to go to kill 10 chickens in your sleep.

2368
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,880
Yeah, killing like, I'm still doing all this.

2369
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:36,840
It really is like that.

2370
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,160
It's weird, but it's not, it's not a bad dream.

2371
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,960
It's like, hey, cool.

2372
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,480
I'm still questing while I'm sleeping.

2373
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:42,360
And it's fun.

2374
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,560
My wife has them too.

2375
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,360
She tells me all the time.

2376
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:48,040
She's like, oh, I just, I just dreamed I was like riding my mount through the barrens.

2377
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:49,400
And that's just something that happened.

2378
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,880
At least in the dreams, there's no barrens chat.

2379
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:52,600
At least not for me.

2380
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:55,160
I did kind of have the dream about, wow, one time.

2381
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:59,080
Do you remember after, this was when we were still on Blade's Edge,

2382
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:03,160
and I was playing as Rebecca Black when I finally decided to level her.

2383
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:03,660
Yes.

2384
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:08,360
And the one guy was following around, making up his own lyrics to Friday.

2385
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:12,920
I dreamt about that last night that I was playing through like

2386
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:17,960
a 16 bit version of wow, with that being the background music.

2387
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,320
That's awesome.

2388
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,880
With me playing on Rebecca Black.

2389
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:23,160
It was pretty funny.

2390
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:24,520
Wow.

2391
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:28,280
What, what made you want to roll a character named Rebecca Black in the first place?

2392
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:30,360
I was bored and I was going to make a tank.

2393
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,800
And so I couldn't think of a name.

2394
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:32,840
So just made Rebecca Black.

2395
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:34,360
Did you roll the character on Friday?

2396
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,120
I don't know.

2397
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:39,640
However, those details are important.

2398
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:44,280
I use the dorky human female with the long black hair.

2399
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,680
So the only, the only human female model.

2400
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:50,280
Well, yeah, but she had the, the one with the long black hair.

2401
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,760
Yeah, but she had the, the long black hair and everything.

2402
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,260
Okay.

2403
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:55,720
And, um, I actually got her to 85.

2404
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:56,780
Wow.

2405
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:02,120
And I had one person drop out of a Headless Horseman pug.

2406
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:08,280
Because, and our healer, mind you, I ain't healing Rebecca Black.

2407
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,880
And oh hell no drop.

2408
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:14,600
Well, next week I'll know to ask you, I'll say,

2409
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:16,440
Hey, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

2410
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:17,400
And you'll say something like,

2411
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:25,240
I super like Saturday.

2412
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,280
Oh, the sequel song that she did.

2413
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,880
It's actually really good.

2414
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:30,380
Yeah.

2415
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:34,680
It's actually like, she's actually learned how to sing.

2416
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,800
Uh, but it's not, it's not technically her, is it?

2417
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:38,760
It's her and somebody else.

2418
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:44,600
Well, no, she's her and some other guy, but it's mostly her.

2419
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:46,520
I like Conan's version of Thursday.

2420
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,480
That's my favorite parody.

2421
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:54,200
Uh, let me see if I can get a little clip of Saturday here for Flaco Jones.

2422
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,520
And if you're pissed and I'm playing this, blame Flaco Jones.

2423
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,760
Don't, don't play it.

2424
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,280
No, you can't blame me.

2425
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,680
The lyrics are actually kind of funny.

2426
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,640
The lyrics are for Friday or Friday.

2427
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,560
We so excited.

2428
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:20,520
Look, she wrote in the sand.

2429
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:21,560
So excited.

2430
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:22,600
Oh my gosh.

2431
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:25,960
So she made a parody video.

2432
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:26,600
Pretty much.

2433
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:27,960
Pretty much.

2434
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,960
And like my favorite side is the guy who's singing it with her.

2435
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,120
She's like, Oh my God, come over.

2436
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:35,400
You know, completely messing up.

2437
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:36,440
And he's like, sure.

2438
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:40,680
As soon as I find my pants, it was really funny.

2439
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:41,320
I thought it was,

2440
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:47,080
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is cursing out Flaco Jones in our chat room and revoking all of his loot.

2441
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,960
I said, don't play it.

2442
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,560
I actually, I actually do.

2443
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:55,880
Saturday is sort of like my guilty pleasure song now.

2444
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:58,920
I hated Friday because I can't stand auto tune out of tune.

2445
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:00,600
Okay.

2446
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,560
Saturday is actually good.

2447
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:03,240
Everybody has a guilty pleasure song.

2448
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,520
Well, if I'm already having all my loot revoked, then just play Chinese food.

2449
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:08,680
Is that your favorite?

2450
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:09,720
Is that your guilty pleasure song?

2451
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:10,760
The Chinese food song.

2452
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:14,120
It is now take down the network.

2453
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:19,800
Uh, my favorite guilty pleasure song is two one two by Asphiela Banks.

2454
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:23,480
But anyway, just listen to it on your own time.

2455
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:25,160
I confusion.

2456
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,360
All right, Rob, I have to have paintberry tonight.

2457
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,800
It's Easter Sunday.

2458
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,840
They're probably closed.

2459
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:32,040
So we'll break in.

2460
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:35,400
All right.

2461
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:36,200
Yes.

2462
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:37,320
Thank you, gamer girl.

2463
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:37,880
I agree.

2464
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:41,880
What says, Oh my, Rebecca Black actually has a voice.

2465
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:46,360
Well, she was only like 13 when that Friday thing, but that's why I couldn't like some

2466
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:48,760
she's actually done more music since then.

2467
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:51,960
Some of the things that people said about her when that video is huge.

2468
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:53,720
I was like, you know, she's like 13, right?

2469
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:58,840
Did you know that they did a Rebecca Black, uh, reacts video to Friday?

2470
02:19:58,840 --> 02:19:59,320
Oh yeah.

2471
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:01,320
And it's her reacting to it two years later.

2472
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:04,920
My favorite was, there was, um, there was like a, it was, it was either death metal

2473
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,840
or screamo version of Friday.

2474
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,160
Funny.

2475
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:10,600
And I'll still post that on people's Facebook to this day.

2476
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:17,080
Not good shooting any conversation.

2477
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:19,080
The best thing to come out of Friday was gang fight.

2478
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:20,680
Yeah.

2479
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:23,240
The bad lip sync or whatever, which I still have.

2480
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,120
Don't, don't judge me.

2481
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,480
I still have it on my playlist.

2482
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:25,800
All right.

2483
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:29,640
So, uh, somehow our emails on dreams turn into a discussion on Rebecca Black.

2484
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:33,080
So thank you to the emailers.

2485
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:34,280
Man, that's my fault too.

2486
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,080
I talked about, wow.

2487
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,120
All right.

2488
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:38,040
Uh, any other emails tonight or is that it?

2489
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:39,320
That was it.

2490
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:40,040
And I'm sorry.

2491
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,000
SSJ 100, Matt.

2492
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,840
Your email was super long and we already talked about it, but I still love you.

2493
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:46,280
I hope you're enjoying Passover.

2494
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:46,600
All right.

2495
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:49,960
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2496
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:52,280
If you'd like dark soccer to dismiss your email as well.

2497
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:55,640
I acknowledge it right from the beginning.

2498
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,440
Oh my God.

2499
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:02,920
Rob, I can't believe that you, you know what I can't, I can't now thrice acknowledge.

2500
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:03,960
This is me.

2501
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,160
Unable to cancel.

2502
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:08,120
Oh, she is unable to even right now.

2503
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:08,920
I can't even.

2504
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:10,600
It's happened.

2505
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:12,840
It's it's not happened.

2506
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:17,480
It's it just, I just right now.

2507
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:17,980
Okay.

2508
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,360
Dark soccer is getting wound up.

2509
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:31,800
You guys, you know what that means?

2510
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:38,600
It's the can't evens of the week.

2511
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,480
Dark Sakura.

2512
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,840
Marissa's in chat.

2513
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:41,640
Hi, Marissa.

2514
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:43,560
We love you, Marissa.

2515
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,600
Why aren't you here, Marissa?

2516
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:45,080
I can't.

2517
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:46,520
I can't either.

2518
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:50,040
Uh, but, um, fuck.

2519
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:53,160
Um, this thing that's suddenly appeared on the side of my face.

2520
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:54,600
It hurts.

2521
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:58,920
It's because I've been, it was because.

2522
02:21:58,920 --> 02:21:59,800
Are they flames?

2523
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:02,600
No, that was Victoria already today.

2524
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:05,320
I'm rehashing jokes.

2525
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,400
On the side of my face.

2526
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:09,480
No, well, no.

2527
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:15,960
I was going to say, um, I've been eating nothing but crap and my body feels like crap and I

2528
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:17,320
miss the gym a whole lot.

2529
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:19,080
So just F you.

2530
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,120
Gym's right here.

2531
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:20,920
Yeah, I'm right here.

2532
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:22,520
Yeah.

2533
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:23,640
Can I bench press you?

2534
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,400
I don't know.

2535
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:29,160
I had, remember four hot dogs and a hamburger and a pile of potato salad today.

2536
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:30,680
Probably not.

2537
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:35,320
But I miss, I miss being more active like that and how good I felt all the time.

2538
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:47,000
And so, and this weird gas, it's like having to burp and can't burp.

2539
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
So I actually literally can't right now.

2540
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:54,520
Literally can't, uh, my, a few of the weeks, the stark soccer, I brought her up.

2541
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:58,520
My few of the week goes to Victoria because you know, of all the years I've been doing

2542
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:00,120
these shows and have known Victoria.

2543
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:02,760
I think she's only ever been on OLR once.

2544
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:05,400
And that was back when we were in the garage studio.

2545
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:06,600
It was way too long ago.

2546
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:08,920
Victoria, get your ass over to Bob.

2547
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:13,800
Yeah, she needs a game of throne show on the network or something like that.

2548
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,360
She call it chair of swords.

2549
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:18,920
Something game of complaints.

2550
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,600
That's all you people will do to watch that show.

2551
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:21,880
You just complain a lot.

2552
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:22,360
All right.

2553
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,440
Uh, or game of spoilers.

2554
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,760
Game of spoilers for a 10 year old book.

2555
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:30,520
Uh, Blanco Jones, your FUs of the week.

2556
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:32,040
Uh, it says, Loki's not here.

2557
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:37,560
I'll complain about bad drivers, uh, trying to get here today and like stuck behind a

2558
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:39,480
slow moving car, but it's like a Mercedes.

2559
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:40,600
Like drive your car faster.

2560
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:43,320
If you have an expensive car, you can afford to get tickets to drive faster.

2561
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:49,160
Of course I finally pass him and he's like, he's like drinking a soda and looking down

2562
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:49,960
at a phone.

2563
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:52,840
So of course it's like, all right, well, at least he can kill anybody.

2564
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:55,180
All right.

2565
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:56,440
There it is.

2566
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:59,080
Your FUs of the week.

2567
02:23:59,080 --> 02:23:59,800
Love it.

2568
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:00,040
All right.

2569
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:01,160
One more story for you guys.

2570
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:02,840
And then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2571
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:04,760
Cause we want you to call in and be with our show.

2572
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:09,720
Uh, one eight seven seven game, O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

2573
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:13,480
And the last story tonight has to go with a sale.

2574
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:19,720
And it's something you want to get now on sale because the game will no longer be available

2575
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:25,960
after April 30th, a moment of silence internet for burger time world tour.

2576
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:27,480
That's right.

2577
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:32,360
The moderate envisioning to one of the greatest classic video games of all time,

2578
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:37,320
time, time, time, time is, uh, no longer going to be a thing.

2579
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,520
And let's be real.

2580
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:45,640
The re-imagining was kind of jank, but it was a great game, uh, back in the eighties.

2581
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:48,680
And, you know, we, we love these reimaginings of games.

2582
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:54,680
They, they remind us of the past a little bit, but anyhow, uh, the game is on sale on

2583
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,440
Xbox live arcade PlayStation network.

2584
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:59,640
And we were for $4 and 99 cents.

2585
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:05,320
Monkey paw who published the game is, uh, having some expired licensing agreements for

2586
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:08,120
Peter pepper and all his, all his friends.

2587
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:10,680
Cause monkey paw games didn't create burger time.

2588
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:12,840
They had to license it from somebody else.

2589
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:19,320
So burger time world tour will be a shutdown by the food and drug administration on April

2590
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:20,120
30th.

2591
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:25,960
I guess, I guess, I guess you could call it, say that this video game got assaulted.

2592
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:30,520
I could see the pun coming from so far away.

2593
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:32,600
You weren't doing it.

2594
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:35,400
I was face palming before you said it all the way.

2595
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:36,840
That was a preemptive face palm.

2596
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,800
I love burger time.

2597
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:43,640
Who doesn't, who doesn't people that don't know their games?

2598
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:44,360
That's who all right.

2599
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:50,120
One eight seven seven game, O L R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2600
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:53,400
You can give us a call right now and we can talk about anything we've talked about on

2601
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:56,280
the show world tonight so far, or maybe you have something else you want to bring up with

2602
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:57,960
us or what have you.

2603
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:01,400
This is where I'd usually turn to Loki and go, Hey, you have any last minute news, but

2604
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:02,360
he's not here.

2605
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:04,280
Flaco, you have any last minute news?

2606
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:07,560
Uh, I wish I could drink more beer, but I have to drive home.

2607
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:09,800
I'm going to leave that last can for another day.

2608
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:09,960
Yeah.

2609
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:11,080
So I save it for a rainy day.

2610
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:13,000
How do you like it by the way?

2611
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,360
It's pretty, it's pretty hoppy.

2612
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:15,720
It's, it's an interesting kind of flavor.

2613
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:18,120
It's not as dark as it was in a hoppy brew.

2614
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:18,680
Is that where it is?

2615
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:19,080
Very hoppy.

2616
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,240
Yeah, it's, it's, it's an IPA and you pay a little.

2617
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:23,320
So yeah, it's hot, but it's got a nice maltiness.

2618
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,680
It kind of offsets the bitterness.

2619
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:25,000
Yeah.

2620
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,040
I like it.

2621
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:26,360
All right.

2622
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:27,560
Hey, we've got a call coming in.

2623
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,120
Talk.

2624
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:30,280
We'll, we'll ask our caller if there's any last minute stories.

2625
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:30,520
Hi.

2626
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:31,320
I'm orange launch radio.

2627
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:31,720
Who's this?

2628
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:33,240
That's your residence.

2629
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:35,720
Your favorite anime con whore Rama.

2630
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,640
Hey, anime con whore Rama.

2631
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:39,080
Were you a wonder con this weekend?

2632
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:42,840
Uh, no, I was at sleep con.

2633
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:45,880
You know what, with all the cons you go to, I'm not surprised at all.

2634
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:48,760
You don't, or that you, you have to sit one out once in a while.

2635
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:49,560
Yeah.

2636
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:50,440
Cause I'm gear.

2637
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:50,600
Yeah.

2638
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:55,240
Cause after PAX East and Castle Point, we're gearing up for another con this

2639
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:57,000
weekend and another one after that.

2640
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:57,560
Oh God.

2641
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:58,520
What's this weekend?

2642
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:00,520
Uh, Zenkai con.

2643
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:04,680
It's a local con out in Philly, Lancaster County area.

2644
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:08,360
And after that as a con, I think the entire OLR staff should go to call it

2645
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:13,480
as a 21 plus convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

2646
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:16,760
Oh, this could be a fun convention.

2647
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:19,400
No, not a con is not Otacon.

2648
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:20,840
Oh sure.

2649
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:21,080
Okay.

2650
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:22,040
All right.

2651
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:23,160
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2652
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:28,040
Well, we're talking about something a little bit different now, just out of

2653
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:33,320
curiosity, have you ever heard of record store day only this year?

2654
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:38,040
Yeah, I heard about it this year.

2655
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:41,240
I didn't know about it from years past, but apparently this is the fifth or sixth

2656
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:41,640
year.

2657
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:45,320
I think it's, it's a similar thing to like free comic book day, right?

2658
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:49,880
Where they try to entice people to go, you know, fuck iTunes and, and, uh,

2659
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:52,120
Amazon MP3 stores and all that.

2660
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:57,080
And, and go back to the roots of the, of a retail music store, I believe is the,

2661
02:27:57,080 --> 02:27:58,280
the concept behind it, right?

2662
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,280
Yeah, that, yeah.

2663
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,320
Which is pretty cool.

2664
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:05,400
I didn't even know about it till late Friday night till a couple of the nerd

2665
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:10,200
core rappers I follow on Facebook linked me to a special album that was coming

2666
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,040
out as part of record store day.

2667
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:12,280
Yeah.

2668
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:16,760
Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to play a quick track from it.

2669
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:18,680
Cause I think everybody here knows it.

2670
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:19,640
Okay.

2671
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:21,560
Can you hear it?

2672
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:24,120
No.

2673
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:25,720
Yeah.

2674
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:28,280
Well, if you can't hear it, then my system sucks.

2675
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:28,920
Well, anyway.

2676
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:31,720
Is that the Manamanaguchi song?

2677
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:32,760
Oh, yup.

2678
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:34,360
There we go.

2679
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:37,360
Yeah.

2680
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:42,760
I heard that there was something involved in the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack and them put

2681
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:46,760
out on LP, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game.

2682
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:48,920
Hmm.

2683
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,040
That's awesome though.

2684
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:52,840
But yeah, a lot of people are saying they missed out on it.

2685
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:56,440
Even Bobby and chat right now is saying they didn't allocate any of the video game releases

2686
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:57,320
to my local store.

2687
02:28:57,960 --> 02:29:03,800
So, cause what happened was when I first heard about it, I pull up the list and I'm like,

2688
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:07,080
okay, I'm going to do some side questing and find it.

2689
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:09,720
Cause I got four requests on Facebook to find this.

2690
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:12,040
One person never got back to me.

2691
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:17,080
Another person found it in Ohio and our friendly neighborhood Mexicans getting the other copy

2692
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:18,360
I was able to track down for him.

2693
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,240
Well, you can always buy it on eBay for like 50 bucks.

2694
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:22,840
That's okay.

2695
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:24,680
I'm keeping my copy sealed.

2696
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:27,800
I went to like three different stores called two.

2697
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,640
Most of them all said we didn't get it.

2698
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:31,800
So I found a place called turntable lab that had it.

2699
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:34,300
Huh.

2700
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:36,680
Well, congrats on your find.

2701
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:39,080
Thank you.

2702
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:43,080
I kind of wish I did have a turntable lab to be perfectly honest.

2703
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:46,360
I'm going to keep this sealed just for sentimental value.

2704
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:50,920
Cause when we have kids, when we pull this out, they're going to be like, what is that?

2705
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:55,240
And then we'll have to sit down and explain to him to them back in the day before it was

2706
02:29:55,240 --> 02:30:01,560
digital music, before it was CDs, you had cassettes, LPs, and we go back a little bit

2707
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:03,000
further eight track.

2708
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:06,600
Bobby Black Wolf says they only made like 2000 of them.

2709
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:09,240
And there were 1200 stores participating in record store day.

2710
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:11,240
So that's why they were kind of hard to find.

2711
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:15,080
I would show, you know, if you're going to show you talk to your grandkids about records,

2712
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:19,400
show them those pictures of like a record player and the needle in the record at like

2713
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:20,680
1000 magnified.

2714
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:24,040
Cause it's really cool what those things look like close up like that.

2715
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:26,600
That sounds like a great idea.

2716
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:30,760
It's like an old episode of three, two, one contact or something like that.

2717
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:31,560
Well, that's cool.

2718
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,880
I'm glad you were able to get out there on record store day.

2719
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,360
Anything else to share with listeners tonight?

2720
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:41,560
Let's see.

2721
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:46,840
Oh, besides the fact that Dr. Luigi and fan Mario were a smash hit at PAX East, I can't

2722
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:47,880
think of anything else.

2723
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:52,040
Are you getting to see some of those pictures as they go up on the internet from PAX East?

2724
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:53,400
Yeah.

2725
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:57,400
Me and Marco are in a couple of videos that are flowing around at PAX.

2726
02:30:57,400 --> 02:31:01,480
I shared on my Facebook page and I have to get my photos up as well.

2727
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:02,600
Very cool.

2728
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:03,640
Excuse me.

2729
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:04,120
Very cool.

2730
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:05,880
I'm glad to hear you guys had a good time at PAX East.

2731
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:10,680
I, I really need to get it back out there for some, one of the PAX is obviously my feathers

2732
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:16,760
were a little ruffled at some of the comments that they'd made and just the, how fast that

2733
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:17,560
shit sells out.

2734
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:19,800
And I'm usually working during the day when those tickets go on sale.

2735
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:21,880
So I'm gonna have to be a little more on it in the future.

2736
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:24,120
So well, do what I do.

2737
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:27,640
If you got friends at you that you, I got friends I have room with every year.

2738
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:29,400
It's like, we sit there and plan.

2739
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:34,120
One person handles the, the credit cards and the badges.

2740
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:38,520
Then I handle the credit cards and the hotel room because whoever has the best internet

2741
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:42,280
can handle, you know, and we just delegate like that and we get shit done.

2742
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:45,880
Well, I am, I am hoping to do something like that, at least for Dragon Con.

2743
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:49,560
I've kind of got some like that running and who knows, I'm hoping to get out properly

2744
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:53,400
to the, I would say the East coast, but Atlanta's really East coast to me.

2745
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:57,480
So to the Northeast coast soon, because it's been forever since I've been to NYC.

2746
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:58,200
Been forever.

2747
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:58,840
Yes.

2748
02:31:58,840 --> 02:32:03,320
You need to come and hang out for a weekend, have a good time with the, with the New York

2749
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:04,120
OL army.

2750
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:06,440
I will, I will make it a point to do so soon.

2751
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:11,400
And if nothing else, the motivation of Neil Patrick Harris's Hedwig is a huge, huge motivation.

2752
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:15,880
A friend of mine saw, saw that yesterday and got, got his autograph.

2753
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,520
Well, consider me a jealous bitch.

2754
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:23,560
Oh, Rob, what are we going to do with you?

2755
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:26,280
The same thing you've done with me for 12 years.

2756
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:26,840
All right, Rama.

2757
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:27,800
I'm going to let you go get more calls.

2758
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,320
That's illegal in 38 states.

2759
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:31,560
Not this one.

2760
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:31,880
All right.

2761
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:33,320
Hey, yo.

2762
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,280
Bye Rama.

2763
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:34,600
Bye.

2764
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:40,760
That's illegal in 38 states, but I thought the Supreme court, nevermind.

2765
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:41,080
All right.

2766
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:46,040
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2767
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,280
Give us a call and we'll talk.

2768
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:49,560
Whatever you'd like.

2769
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:51,240
I must apologize.

2770
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:53,160
I have lost my connection to the chat room.

2771
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:53,400
What?

2772
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:54,920
Unacceptable.

2773
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:55,240
I know.

2774
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:55,960
Just kidding.

2775
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:56,280
All right.

2776
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:58,920
We do, we do have more calls coming in, so let's get to it.

2777
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:00,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2778
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:00,520
Who's that?

2779
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:01,400
Who's this?

2780
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:01,960
Hello.

2781
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:04,920
Is this Marissa?

2782
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:06,600
Yes, it is.

2783
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:08,840
How you doing, girl?

2784
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:10,120
I'm good.

2785
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:10,760
How are you?

2786
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:14,840
I have nothing relevant or on topic to talk about, but I'm sure that we'll have a giggle

2787
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:15,800
fest anyway, right?

2788
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,680
Who gives a shit?

2789
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,120
It's Orange Lounge Radio.

2790
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:20,600
We don't have to talk.

2791
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,960
We'll talk about whatever we want.

2792
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:23,640
Damn it.

2793
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:24,200
Yeah.

2794
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:27,880
One of these days I will come up there and we'll do a series of episodes and then we'll

2795
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:30,520
like syndicate it and we'll be Robin Rose's giggle time.

2796
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:32,840
I have a computer good enough to do YouTubes now.

2797
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:34,280
We can, we can look at doing something like that.

2798
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:34,760
It'd be fun.

2799
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:38,360
Well, you're talking about cons earlier.

2800
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:38,760
It's funny.

2801
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:41,000
I wonder con has been going on down here.

2802
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I have not been able to sneak my way in.

2803
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,400
I didn't get a ticket at the last second and then a friend offered me one at the last second,

2804
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:49,640
which would require me driving two, three hours.

2805
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:54,040
You know, but by the time I got there, the ticket would have been useless, but it was

2806
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:54,520
just funny.

2807
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:59,960
Anyway, everyone that went there had a wonderful time and they had a great, um, uh, voice actor

2808
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:04,440
panel and you know, that, that's my shtick, but everyone has been saying good things about

2809
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:04,520
it.

2810
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:05,400
Yeah.

2811
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:10,200
It would do wonder con happened on two coasts at the same time or something because I know

2812
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:13,320
there were people going to LA, but I had some friends in the Northeast that were going to

2813
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:13,880
something too.

2814
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:17,880
So I guess there was like a bi-coastal con or something going on.

2815
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:20,360
Sweetheart, I live in Los Angeles.

2816
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,640
There's other parts of the world.

2817
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:24,680
Typical Los Angeles.

2818
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:33,160
I hadn't heard about that, uh, heard about that, but I was hearing the feedback and people

2819
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:34,280
were having a great time.

2820
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:35,000
Yeah.

2821
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:36,600
It's funny though.

2822
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:40,440
I wasn't able to go and I thought I was talking to Jamie about this might be able to appreciate

2823
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:45,960
it since you were talking about booze earlier as well since I can connect anything randomly.

2824
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:51,160
Um, I didn't get to go that, but I got to go to my friend, uh, uh, my long time friends

2825
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:57,080
since, uh, like, uh, elementary school, she had a birthday party and the Hollywood Hills

2826
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,760
were getting all glam up in this shit.

2827
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:05,480
And there were some actually people involved in, in the gaming and whatnot, but it overlooked

2828
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:09,480
the entire hall, you know, and I'm not used to getting into this, this type of glam stuff.

2829
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:12,840
You know, I'm like, well, I didn't make it to WonderCon, but at least this is fascinating.

2830
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:15,800
I can see all of LA and this beautiful house with the tower.

2831
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:20,120
And early on in the evening though, I decided to try rum.

2832
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,680
Oh yeah.

2833
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,200
I don't, I'm not a big drinker.

2834
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:28,600
So, you know, like I just, you know, like I say stupid shit without any assistance.

2835
02:35:29,400 --> 02:35:32,200
So, but here's the thing.

2836
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:33,080
Okay.

2837
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:36,840
So in my disappointment, not being able to make it to WonderCon, I'm like, okay, I'm

2838
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,640
going to have a good time.

2839
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:39,080
I'm going to get more social.

2840
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:41,960
I learned that rum makes me want to nap.

2841
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:48,040
I motherfucking power nap that bitch.

2842
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:48,760
Okay.

2843
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:54,040
You want to talk about stars and celebrity and shit and all the magic of Los Angeles.

2844
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:54,600
Yeah.

2845
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:56,840
I napped in every room of that house.

2846
02:35:57,560 --> 02:35:58,120
Oh yeah.

2847
02:35:58,760 --> 02:35:59,480
Uh huh.

2848
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:01,240
That's what I would do.

2849
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:04,920
That was, I used to be infamous at parties for drinking some Malibu and whatever, and

2850
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:06,440
then falling asleep under the table.

2851
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:09,160
That's just, that's just how we roll.

2852
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:09,880
Yeah, exactly.

2853
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:12,920
Look, I can't, I just geek at a party.

2854
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:14,280
Like I can't even do that normally.

2855
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,840
It's like, yeah, like friends, like, how'd you have that big glamorous time?

2856
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:18,360
Like, Oh honey, the couch upstairs.

2857
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:21,720
Perfect.

2858
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:23,480
Look at our chat room.

2859
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:26,200
Look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2860
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:29,560
Fifth dream in chat says her voice reminds me of someone a lot, but I can't think of

2861
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:31,480
who an anime character maybe.

2862
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:33,800
Oh, I do that sometimes.

2863
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:34,680
Oh, I don't know.

2864
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:40,760
I love it when you slip into the voices.

2865
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:41,320
It's great.

2866
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:46,520
You know, the funny thing was that I, I, you know, I, I studied this intently and I, and

2867
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:50,600
I love it, but the first time I ever, um, did anything with regard to anime, I was kind

2868
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:53,640
of nervous in the class and I wasn't sure what to do.

2869
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:55,320
So I thought, you know what?

2870
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:56,620
Fuck it.

2871
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:01,160
I'm going to do like the stereotype.

2872
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:07,400
And, um, I fully expected to be scolded, but I was just having a drop the mic moment.

2873
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:08,760
I was like, just fuck this.

2874
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:09,320
I'm nervous.

2875
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:11,320
I'm just going to go in and I'm going to going to do that.

2876
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:16,440
And I fully expected them to just drop their pens, you know, and go, this is very serious

2877
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:21,000
business and there is so much more to this and you can't just stereotype.

2878
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,120
This is an art.

2879
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:25,880
But I went up there and like the last bite of the popsicle and I just did a round of

2880
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:26,280
applause.

2881
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:27,720
Like, yes, bravo.

2882
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:32,280
That's such an LA story.

2883
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:40,360
I was so expecting to be reamed about the arts and everything, but brilliant.

2884
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:40,920
Brilliant.

2885
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:41,240
Yes.

2886
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:41,720
Oscar.

2887
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:45,560
Fuck it.

2888
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:46,360
Where's my check?

2889
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:50,360
When in doubt, stereotypes.

2890
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:56,040
Although there weren't two people in that room that found it a little too erotic.

2891
02:37:56,680 --> 02:38:02,520
So, man, I'm just pissing off everyone.

2892
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:09,400
Marissa, I can't wait for the day that, you know, I find some Yuri video online and you're

2893
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:10,280
one of the voices.

2894
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:14,680
I would love that.

2895
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:19,080
But until then, everything probably for me, it seems to be like one nine hundred girls

2896
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:19,640
dot com.

2897
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:24,360
That's like, what's going to be a tone app for me when I'm having that not so fresh

2898
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:24,840
feeling.

2899
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:27,400
That's what happened.

2900
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:31,400
I tried to record like a professional sounding answering machine for myself.

2901
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,880
And you know how much like cell phone reception sucks.

2902
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:34,280
Yeah.

2903
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:37,720
And but I just I just record it like bam, done.

2904
02:38:37,720 --> 02:38:38,600
I didn't listen to it.

2905
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:43,240
But the message I found out later sounded like, hi, this is Marissa.

2906
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:46,920
I can't come to the phone right now, but I'd sure love to hear from you.

2907
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:52,680
And then my doctor leaves me a message one day, you know, calling to say like, oh, you

2908
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:54,440
know, you're healthy from your physical and everything.

2909
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:58,520
Just Marissa, what's just a sounding answering machine you have?

2910
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:02,040
Which made sense.

2911
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:04,840
Looking back at the types of messages I received.

2912
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:13,160
Marissa, you know, yes, you need to do a stand up comedy show where you just talk about your

2913
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:13,400
life.

2914
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:14,600
And that is a compliment.

2915
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:20,280
I'm not like, not like saying like, Marissa, you're a crazy hoe.

2916
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:21,400
Like, I'm not saying that.

2917
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:24,360
Like, you're really funny when you tell these nuts.

2918
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,880
You got to put this shit on tape.

2919
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:28,920
No, I love you.

2920
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:32,360
Marissa, I love you, too.

2921
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:33,480
Thanks for calling in the show.

2922
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,480
I don't give a fuck that had nothing to do with games.

2923
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,520
It's always good to hear from you.

2924
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:39,000
All right.

2925
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,480
Well, it's always great to talk to you guys, too.

2926
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:42,440
Miss Jamie, my love.

2927
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:48,200
Getting a little your reaction going on right now.

2928
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:48,600
All right.

2929
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:56,440
Consistently here that interestingly enough, voice actors talk about video games being

2930
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:57,720
the most challenging.

2931
02:39:57,720 --> 02:39:59,080
I found that really interesting.

2932
02:39:59,080 --> 02:39:59,480
Really?

2933
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:03,000
Yeah, this well, apparently doesn't pay as well either.

2934
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
But they're trying to work on that in the union.

2935
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,120
But well, aren't you normally like in a booth by yourself instead of around with other people?

2936
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:16,280
Well, only American, you know, like only American animation is traditionally when you work with

2937
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:20,680
other people, which is considered like the height and the best, you know, the best art.

2938
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:24,520
But with video games, you know, they rush to push it out so much.

2939
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:27,320
And yeah, you are often separated from the other actors.

2940
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:29,480
And sometimes they give you little context.

2941
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:31,480
And then you have to do all the various efforts.

2942
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:34,040
It's very hard on actors vocal chords as well, too.

2943
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:37,080
I bet with all the voice that goes into it.

2944
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:39,960
You know, you've got offers in our chair, by the way, over at live.voguenetwork.com

2945
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:43,320
Bonds006 says I need Marissa to make a voicemail for my cell now.

2946
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,400
Who said that?

2947
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:47,400
Bonds006.

2948
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:50,200
Oh, Bonds006, hi.

2949
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:51,480
He's the sexiest guy ever.

2950
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:54,040
You have to leave him answering machine messages as soon as possible.

2951
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:57,960
Get back to him.

2952
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:58,460
Yes.

2953
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:00,360
Now hold on.

2954
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,880
You got to charge listeners for this.

2955
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:03,320
We got a fun vog somehow.

2956
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:06,040
Pay $10 get sexy Marissa talk.

2957
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:07,240
All right, Marissa.

2958
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:09,960
I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

2959
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:11,240
But thank you so much, Marissa.

2960
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:12,840
A great night, you guys.

2961
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:13,480
I love you.

2962
02:41:13,480 --> 02:41:13,980
Take care.

2963
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:16,120
Oh, God.

2964
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:17,480
Always great to hear from her.

2965
02:41:17,480 --> 02:41:18,600
You know, here's the thing, though.

2966
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:22,360
I know Marissa is a big fan of the thief series of video games.

2967
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:26,200
So seeing as that new thief just came out, she probably didn't want to talk about it.

2968
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:28,040
She probably didn't want to talk about it.

2969
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:30,520
Based on what I've heard about that, she probably didn't want to talk about that, actually.

2970
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:33,400
I don't think that was a topic out of discussion.

2971
02:41:33,400 --> 02:41:36,280
So, so we get, we get voicemail messages instead.

2972
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:37,320
I don't mind whatsoever.

2973
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:38,540
All right.

2974
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:41,960
Now people in chat.

2975
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:42,520
Now me.

2976
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:42,760
Yeah.

2977
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:43,560
Okay, now me.

2978
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:47,740
I love it.

2979
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:49,100
All right.

2980
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:49,800
Let's see.

2981
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:54,200
I'm trying to go to the Twitter while we wait for some more calls over at 1-877-GAME-OLR

2982
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:56,760
or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2983
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:59,240
Bonds006 says, I'll lose my job with that.

2984
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:03,080
Let's see.

2985
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:07,560
DarkTetsuya tweeted us saying, I found an interesting homebrew MSX game this week.

2986
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:09,480
It's called Blue Warrior.

2987
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:12,520
It's a scrolling shooter with an amazing soundtrack.

2988
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:13,640
We'll have to check that out.

2989
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:17,560
I like, I like, I like homebrew games for old systems.

2990
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:19,960
Like, I love it when people make Atari 2600 games.

2991
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:20,600
It's like, why?

2992
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:22,360
Because.

2993
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:23,000
Why not?

2994
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:23,480
Why not?

2995
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:24,680
Exactly.

2996
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:26,280
Let's see.

2997
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:33,880
DaBlueGuy tweeted us and said, PlayStation 4 still outsold Xbox One in March, even though

2998
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:34,920
with Titanfall.

2999
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:38,040
Yeah, that was news that was getting a bit of steam this week.

3000
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:42,280
And if I'm not mistaken, haven't they sold worldwide?

3001
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:44,920
Haven't they sold more Wii Us than Xbox Ones?

3002
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:47,320
I mean, granted, Wii U has had a year up on it.

3003
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:49,000
But they're already almost tied.

3004
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
And like you said, they've had a year head start.

3005
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:51,640
That's true.

3006
02:42:51,640 --> 02:42:52,920
But there's nothing to brag about.

3007
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:54,200
There's that cynical side of me.

3008
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:57,400
That's like, well, when's EA going to stop making games for Xbox One then?

3009
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:59,400
If that's, you know, little bastards.

3010
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:02,440
Yeah, I'm not trying to shade Nintendo.

3011
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:04,440
I'm trying to shade everybody that abandoned ship.

3012
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:09,800
But in all seriousness, it's the price difference straight up.

3013
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,840
Everybody's been saying this till they're blue in the face.

3014
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:13,640
And it's true.

3015
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:16,040
Like they're charging the extra money for Kinect.

3016
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:18,120
Nobody understands why Kinect is needed.

3017
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:20,280
I mean, I'm sure there's the Xbox loyalists.

3018
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:21,640
There's probably some Xbox fans out there

3019
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:23,560
screaming at me on their podcast right now.

3020
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:25,000
Like, you don't understand.

3021
02:43:25,560 --> 02:43:28,200
But it's like, no, most people don't give a shit.

3022
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:31,160
Well, shouldn't all that really matters in the end be the money?

3023
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:32,360
If they're selling it for a higher price,

3024
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:35,640
they've probably made almost as much money as Sony has, right?

3025
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:36,680
That's true.

3026
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:38,040
But there's $100 more.

3027
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:41,240
They've sold what we say two or three million fewer units.

3028
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:45,560
But that $100 for those millions of units adds up quick.

3029
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:47,960
And can equal a lot of Sony sales, I would think.

3030
02:43:47,960 --> 02:43:48,520
I don't know.

3031
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:53,240
There's that fuzzy math too where Xbox sold to stores,

3032
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:56,360
but Sony sold through to homes.

3033
02:43:56,360 --> 02:43:57,400
Yeah, I read that too.

3034
02:43:57,400 --> 02:44:00,120
There's a bit of a difference between the numbers that are being reported.

3035
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:03,320
But I don't think it's doom and gloom for Microsoft

3036
02:44:03,320 --> 02:44:07,240
because a lot of systems have a slow first quarter.

3037
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,920
Sony's just in a good position.

3038
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:12,360
This is where Final Fantasy XIV worked out well for him.

3039
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:14,520
Sitting on Infamous Second Son and Drive Club

3040
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:16,600
are going to help them get through the year and some of those.

3041
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:19,240
So I think this is where that's paying off for them a little bit.

3042
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:23,400
I would say if we're at the holiday season and Xbox is still struggling,

3043
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:24,760
then we've got a story.

3044
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:27,240
But for right now, a lot can still happen.

3045
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,720
Microsoft could come out in E3 and pronounce a price reduction.

3046
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:31,960
Yeah.

3047
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:33,720
I mean, it's not like they're doing poorly.

3048
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:37,880
Like you said, they've already sold, or like if you say to stores,

3049
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:42,360
they've still gotten close to you in a very smaller amount of time.

3050
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:43,800
Exactly.

3051
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:44,360
Exactly.

3052
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:49,960
But again, I don't want to also dump on Wii U is dead and all that

3053
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:53,640
because Mario Kart 8 is a big deal and Smash Brothers is going to be huge too.

3054
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:54,360
I've got a Wii U now.

3055
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:57,560
Of course, I didn't really help them out because I bought a used one.

3056
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:01,560
Let's see.

3057
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:05,480
I think a lot of this other stuff is news that we covered earlier in the show.

3058
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:09,080
But if you want to tweet us sometime, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3059
02:45:09,080 --> 02:45:11,880
I'll put out one more call for calls.

3060
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:17,320
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

3061
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:19,000
Um, let's see.

3062
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:24,200
Bonds double 06 says my brother-in-law came over today to help me upgrade my iMac.

3063
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:26,520
And he also asked why I don't have an Xbox one.

3064
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:29,960
And my reply was I won't buy it at the current price.

3065
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:34,360
Akuma JP says Xbox is dead to me though.

3066
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:35,720
Yeah, but you live in Japan.

3067
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:37,240
Xbox was always dead over there.

3068
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:39,080
Like, did they ever sell a lot of 360s?

3069
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:41,000
I mean, you think the Wii U sells bad here?

3070
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:43,480
Check the 360 sales in Japan.

3071
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:43,980
Okay.

3072
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:47,720
And then, um, you know, the ones not even out there yet.

3073
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:53,080
So, you know, I'd be curious though, if they are going to make a big push in Japan, that's

3074
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:53,800
what the rumors are.

3075
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:57,640
Xbox one is supposed to be making a big push in Japan when they launch in the holiday.

3076
02:45:57,640 --> 02:46:03,720
So you would expect to see at E3, what is that big Japanese based game exclusive going

3077
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:06,360
to be that they have in their back pocket?

3078
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,480
Is it Shenmue 3?

3079
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:09,960
No, it's probably not.

3080
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:14,680
Cause even though that's the game that most people want on Xbox, Sega is in bed with Nintendo

3081
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:19,960
right now is seems to be where, you know, which is so weird being the eighties gamer,

3082
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:21,560
but Sega and Nintendo are besties.

3083
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:24,360
So I would expect any exclusives like that would be on Wii U.

3084
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,880
So anything's possible.

3085
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:27,000
Anything's possible, certainly.

3086
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:28,200
All right.

3087
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:32,360
Um, well, I guess, I guess that's it.

3088
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,720
I guess nobody else is going to call in.

3089
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:38,120
Well, it is a slow, it is a bit of a slower night just because, you know, it's, it's a

3090
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:40,840
holiday and stuff and people are doing their dinners and things like that.

3091
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:46,280
But if you are listening to the show after the fact, and you want to send us something

3092
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:48,840
to talk about on a future show, you can always send us an email.

3093
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:53,560
Participate at orange down orange, lounge, radio.com is our email address.

3094
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:56,840
And that's another great way you can participate with the show, or you can send us a tweet

3095
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:57,720
or anything else like that.

3096
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:03,560
Anyhow, it's about time we get around to wrapping up the show and going around and closing out

3097
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:04,760
shop for the night.

3098
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:07,640
Flaco, thank you so much for being here tonight, especially on short notice.

3099
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,360
I guess I gave you the short notice.

3100
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:10,840
That's okay.

3101
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:15,400
I got back home and like, Hey, I wonder, I, I haven't even finished last week.

3102
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:19,400
So LR, cause like I said, I've had the week off, haven't really been commuting or going

3103
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:20,200
to work and listening.

3104
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:23,320
I've just been, you know, hanging out with the family and going to San Francisco, having

3105
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:24,040
fun times there.

3106
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:28,440
So yeah, but I heard pretty much right where I got to, he's like, Oh, we don't have anybody

3107
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:28,840
next week.

3108
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:30,280
I'm like, I wonder if they ever found someone.

3109
02:47:30,280 --> 02:47:31,880
So send you a message.

3110
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:32,760
No, I was totally planning.

3111
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:35,000
I'll just be Jamie and I will just do a quick hour long show.

3112
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:37,160
Three hour show.

3113
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:37,800
Let's go.

3114
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:42,760
That would be and me, not, and I object object.

3115
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:43,800
I don't even care.

3116
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:44,120
All right.

3117
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:45,640
You know what?

3118
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:47,960
I don't butcher grammar as bad as MTV.

3119
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:48,280
All right.

3120
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:51,080
Anyway, Flaco, thank you for being here.

3121
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:52,040
You are always welcome.

3122
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:53,320
You didn't break the show tonight.

3123
02:47:53,320 --> 02:47:53,800
I didn't.

3124
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:56,360
Well, I did with the Rebecca black stuff.

3125
02:47:56,360 --> 02:48:01,080
Apparently that was, that was all you and not chat at all or Jamie or anything.

3126
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:02,680
It's all me, all you 100%.

3127
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:06,680
But you're always welcome here and you did a great job tonight.

3128
02:48:06,680 --> 02:48:07,000
Cool.

3129
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,920
I loved being here and I like the new place.

3130
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:09,880
It's awesome.

3131
02:48:09,880 --> 02:48:10,520
Me too.

3132
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:10,920
Hello.

3133
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:16,200
I know it is still a little echoey in here, but we're working on it.

3134
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:16,680
All right.

3135
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:18,200
Your final thought tonight for us, please.

3136
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:19,160
Oh, my final thought?

3137
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:21,240
My beer is good.

3138
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:22,360
I've sweated it all out.

3139
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:22,840
I'm good to go.

3140
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:24,280
All right.

3141
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,760
I want to thank you guys for listening to the show.

3142
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:31,080
And remember, if you do like orange on radio, all we ask is tell a friend or two about the

3143
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:31,240
show.

3144
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:32,760
You know, word of mouth is all we have.

3145
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:36,760
Even if you can't think of anybody to tell right off the top of your head, please leave

3146
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:41,000
us a nice review on Stitcher or iTunes or any place that you may have found this show

3147
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,160
because those kind reviews go a long way in helping for exposure.

3148
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:49,000
My final thought for tonight before, and then we'll go over to Jamie.

3149
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,200
My final thought tonight is I can't wait for the first time in my life.

3150
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:55,880
I can't wait to edit tonight's show because, you know, I try to edit the show, which I

3151
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:57,480
don't, I don't really edit it.

3152
02:48:57,480 --> 02:48:58,680
I don't edit it for content.

3153
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:03,400
I just crop it, clean it up and say, I can't wait to edit tonight's show on the new computer

3154
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:08,680
because usually like saving the YouTube file alone because YouTube is encoded at a different

3155
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:09,000
quality.

3156
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,680
It's 96 44 for YouTube.

3157
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:13,880
That file alone will take me 10 minutes to save.

3158
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:17,320
And I'm thinking on the new computer, maybe only a couple.

3159
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:18,520
I'm so excited to try.

3160
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:19,880
I'm going to be a time saver.

3161
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:22,600
Yeah, money well spent because my time is valuable.

3162
02:49:22,600 --> 02:49:23,080
Damn it.

3163
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,200
That's my final thought tonight.

3164
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:25,080
My time is valuable.

3165
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:25,480
Damn it.

3166
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:27,000
Dark Sakura.

3167
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,160
Once again, happy birthday.

3168
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:29,640
Thank you.

3169
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:30,600
Thank you for the game.

3170
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:31,320
You're welcome.

3171
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:31,880
Enjoy it.

3172
02:49:31,880 --> 02:49:32,760
Play it this week.

3173
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:34,120
I want a full report next week.

3174
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:34,680
Okay.

3175
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:35,240
All right.

3176
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:37,400
And your final thoughts tonight are talker.

3177
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:39,480
I'm, I'm actually hungry.

3178
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:44,920
And if Adilberto's is open, I'm getting a burrito and then tomorrow back on track.

3179
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:52,280
And I'm going to actually be visible with what I'm doing at the gym and do a regular report.

3180
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:54,600
So I'm actually making my own N seven challenge.

3181
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:55,960
Are you going to do gym selfies?

3182
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:58,840
No, I'm not doing gym selfies.

3183
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:06,040
I'm going to actually, unless they're me sweating and red and sore after having dead lifted 110

3184
02:50:06,040 --> 02:50:06,680
pounds.

3185
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:09,160
I have a friend on Facebook that does gym selfies.

3186
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,640
And that's the way he says, if you don't see me take a gym selfie today,

3187
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:12,360
that means I didn't go.

3188
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:13,320
So I need to get yelled at.

3189
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:15,800
So that's like his whole little, like he needs Facebook to police him.

3190
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:21,480
Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, um, everybody, I have a tumblr called dieting can bite me.

3191
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:24,040
My picture is King hippo.

3192
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:30,040
And you're going to, well, yeah.

3193
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:32,520
And you're going to see, you're going to see activity on there.

3194
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:37,640
And I made them making it public on the show because I, I need to play.

3195
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:41,320
I need to put things where people are going to see it for the purpose of accountability.

3196
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:44,680
But it's dieting can bite me dot tumblr.com.

3197
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:49,880
And I will, I'm going to make this a thing.

3198
02:50:49,880 --> 02:50:50,440
All right.

3199
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:57,720
And I'm going to try to, maybe I will be playing bravely default as my reward for gym time.

3200
02:50:58,520 --> 02:50:59,320
There you go.

3201
02:50:59,320 --> 02:51:00,280
You can play at the gym.

3202
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:02,920
No, I can't because I don't do hamster wheel stuff.

3203
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:04,440
Oh, I lift.

3204
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:05,400
I lift heavy weights.

3205
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:05,720
Fine.

3206
02:51:06,520 --> 02:51:07,880
I like hamster wheel stuff.

3207
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:08,760
Yeah.

3208
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:11,960
But all that does is build up your endurance is it doesn't actually make you stronger.

3209
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:16,600
If I can lose fat doing it, it's something I need to be doing.

3210
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:17,800
Weights are better for that.

3211
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:18,200
We'll see.

3212
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:18,600
We'll see.

3213
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:18,920
All right.

3214
02:51:19,720 --> 02:51:20,520
That's it, everybody.

3215
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:23,640
Thank you very much for tuning into the show and we'll see you again next week.

3216
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:24,040
Next week.

3217
02:51:24,040 --> 02:51:26,280
I guess, I guess kind of a big number next week.

3218
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:26,680
I don't know.

3219
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:31,560
Like you hit your 10th episode, your 50th episode, your 100th episode, your 500th episode.

3220
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:32,920
And then it's like, well, what else?

3221
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:35,400
I guess there's always episode 1000.

3222
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:40,680
But can you believe we'll be in our fifties when we hit episode 1000.

3223
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:44,120
But tomorrow is episode or tomorrow.

3224
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:47,880
What the hell is wrong with you?

3225
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:52,440
Rob Roberts, next week, we will be hitting episode 550.

3226
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:54,280
So that's me.

3227
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:56,600
That's an episode of, or that's a multiple of 50.

3228
02:51:57,320 --> 02:52:01,240
We need to actually celebrate episode 555 because we're just a little bit less than evil.

3229
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:04,440
I think, you know, what's funny is I think we joked like way back in the day.

3230
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:05,800
We were like at episode 200.

3231
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:09,960
We're like, we're going to hit episode 666 in like 2016.

3232
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:11,800
And we always joked, Oh, we'll never get that far.

3233
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:16,600
And now I'm like, we might actually get to episode 666 at this rate we're going.

3234
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:17,240
So we'll see.

3235
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:19,400
I think that we should never stop.

3236
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:21,480
That's the hope.

3237
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:26,520
I mean, it has to end someday, but no, I never, I don't.

3238
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:31,480
We're going to be dead and our voices will be digitized and we'll have, we'll be glad

3239
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:31,960
us.

3240
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:32,520
Hello.

All right, that's it.

3248
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:55,080
No, we're really closing up shop.

3249
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:55,640
We're done.

3250
02:52:55,640 --> 02:52:56,360
