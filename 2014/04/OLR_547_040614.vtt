WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
April Fools is always a hoot now that we are Google Map Pokemon Masters and own our own flux capacitors

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
But the top joke this week was Amazon taking over our TV

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Music, movies, and TV shows aren't new but they said it would play games too

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Tell us your favorite joke on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Wait, what? That wasn't on April 1st?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I guess I'm the fool

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Yes, Jason, that actually happened

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
That is an actual, actual thing we'll get into later

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Hi everybody, hi internet

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this April the 6th of 2014 with episode number 547 of our show

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Here with you guys at vognetwork.com

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
That's vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm here with you, I'm Rob Roberts

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
And joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hi

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Hi, how are you?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Less frustrated, very happy

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I just noticed, I'm like, yay, DarkSakura was able to get in the chatroom after all

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, just still got a little bit of a headache from my movie adventures today

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, what did you go see today?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I went to see Captain America, Winter Soldier

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It seems like everybody in the nation went and saw you

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, it was just really freaking loud and the 3D hurt my eyes

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
It was just sort of too much of everything at once, so I figured that next time I go to a movie, I'm just going to start bringing earplugs and sunglasses

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
But was it good?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
It was really good, but make sure that you stay not just for the after the special part of the credits, but after the all of the credits

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Because trust me, it's a Marvel movie, it's safe for everything

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Exactly, absolutely right

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
There it is, alright, well also joining us as he does every week, here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Hey, Loki, and you're not doing so well from what I understand, right?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, starting to get a little sick?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I hear you, you're your stay-at-home dad right now, right?

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Just for a few weeks with the whole, they let you have leave when you have a new kid and all that stuff, right?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
How's it going?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, is your, are we not hearing Loki?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Sorry guys

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Oops, Loki was muted, sorry about that Loki, try again, that's the joys of live radio everybody

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Try again, Loki, how are you doing?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Congested

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Congested in your home with the baby

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes, I'm home with the baby

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Let's see, so yeah, he just doesn't want to take a bottle

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
So I have to try to feed him and that usually takes about, I don't know, maybe an hour to get him to take an ounce

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
So it's like, come on, take the damn bottle

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
You need to get one of those fake boobies that dads get to be able to feed

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
There's no amount of niggling that's going to get that baby to take anything

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I've had to do syringes just to get him to take something

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't know, it's just because he's breastfed

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
We were doing both, we were feeding him a bottle at night and that kind of stuff

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And then we kind of backed off on that and so he's just confused

03:32.000 --> 03:42.000
That's fine, my son Josh wakes up at like 5.45 every day

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Even though he doesn't have to wake up for school until like 6.45

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
But I get up every day at 5.45 now

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
But there's a nice three hour break in between when he gets up and when the baby gets up

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
My son usually gets up at 8.30 so I work on my computer and stuff

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
Either doing programming in Unity or just playing games or something

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Until my son comes up and says, what are you doing? I want to watch that, do this

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I was watching a game video the other day and he was telling me how to play the game

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
He's like, go up, go up! I'm like, it's a video, I can't do anything

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So yeah, that's what it's been

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
And then I usually take him to Nellie for lunch and then he sleeps when they get back for an hour, hour, two hours

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
So is Josh at that age yet where he's actually, because you say he's standing up behind you while you're watching game videos

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Is he at that age where he's actually able to play games?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
No

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
No, he's not quite there yet?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
He doesn't know how to do anything

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I mean the best he can do is, I got him to play Forza Horizon a while back a little bit

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Just because I have the whole racing setup where he could steer and need the pedals and everything

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
But he doesn't have the dexterity to do it on his own

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And it's kind of hard to teach him because he's left handed

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So I don't know how he would feel

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
But he's interested in pictures and stuff

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
I had him watch a Mega Man video today, like I put that on while I went and did something

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
You need to get him to start like the rest of us started on Atari 2600

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't really remember playing games, probably about four years old at this release I remember, four or five for sure

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Five was when we got the Commodore 64, so I remember that

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
He likes Bubble Bubble on the arcade, Kevin, he just doesn't understand how to move the joystick and push the buttons at the same time

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
That was the thing about Atari 2600 games, they were easy

05:40.000 --> 05:50.000
There's one thing to them, combat, pinball, boxing, very one note, easy to do

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
If you are listening to us live, hello and welcome, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Again that's live.vognetwork.com, I know we're up against some big TV stuff going on tonight

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So if you are here live, I appreciate you being here

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
If you are listening to us on the podcast, you know what, that's okay too

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
If you decided to watch your wrestling and you're listening to us on Monday morning

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well that's okay too, we appreciate your support either way

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And yeah, this is a show where every gamer has a voice

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
If you can't be here live with us, be sure you send us an email

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Which you can do at participate at orangeonsready.com

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Or you can send us a tweet at OLR

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And we like to get your voices all on the show as well

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Going to our chat room, I see some folks talking about the old school games

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Dungeon Buster says Yars' Revenge, that was a little more complicated of a 2600 game

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
After they got all the simple stuff done, then it started getting a little weirder

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
If you look at Yars' Revenge and you have no idea what to do

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
It is kind of difficult to figure out what the hell that game is

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I don't know if you've ever seen Yars' Revenge, but Google it

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Make sure you're looking at the Atari 2600 version, not that weirdo remake they did a few years ago

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Which was nothing like the original

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
But you have that storm cloud that comes down the middle of the screen

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Which is actually like a safe zone I believe

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And then you have a wall around the gun

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And you try to shoot through the wall

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And then you have to touch the gun

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
And once you touch the gun, which is randomly shooting so you gotta be careful

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You get a bullet on the left side of the screen

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
You hit the fire button one more time and you blow up the gun

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
See that one's complicated, some of them get really complicated

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Because they did all the simple stuff

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
But Yars' Revenge was one of the greatest Atari 2600 games they ever did

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And then try to explain a game like E.T.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, don't bother

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Although I seem to remember a couple years ago somebody had hacked the E.T. ROM to make it playable

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
They changed collision detection and some other stuff to make E.T. playable

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Which is kind of funny

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Love that idea

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Speaking of hacks and joking and fooling around

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
For the kickoff topic tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about April Fools' Day

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Because April Fools' Day was this past week

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Some years we've done things here at OLR or VOG Network where our show is heard

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
This year we sat out

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Just because our show was nowhere close to April Fools' Day this year

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
And we were actually working on a new feature for the site at vognetwork.com

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Like a real thing that actually launched on April 2nd

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Because we want people to believe it's real

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's our new TV section

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Presented by the fantastic folks over at Critical Myth

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Which you can hear on VOG Network Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
They have a brand new TV review section over at VOG Network

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And you can access that at tv.vognetwork.com

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
What's really cool about it, it's got all the same gamification elements that the rest of the site has

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Meaning you can leave your response reviews right underneath the reviews of the shows that are there

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
You can comment and thumbs up, thumbs down, all that stuff

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So you can really participate with those reviews

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And it's TV so it's

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
A lot of people watch these shows and trust me

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
The guys over at Critical Myth, they have a pretty big staff

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
And so they review something like 40 shows

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Now they used to run their own website, criticalmyth.com

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
But due to some, and I have no better way to word this

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Than due to some fuckery

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Which is completely out of their hands and not their fault

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
But due to some fuckery, they don't have Crystal Myth

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Or did I say crystalmyth.com?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Criticalmyth.com

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Criticalmyth.com

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Or you know, Critical Myth, CrystalMyth.com

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It's even more popular

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I think somebody hacked their domain to sell it for meth

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I think that's what happened

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
But anyway, criticalmyth.com is not there in the same way

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I think he kind of has it to do some podcast hosting

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
But they unfortunately lost a bunch of reviews

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But they're starting anew over at VOG Network

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And they review a lot of shows

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
This isn't like Marvel Agents of SHIELD and one other show

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
You go over there, there's a ton of shows they're reviewing right now

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So probably one of your geeky favorites is up over there

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
So check that out

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Once again, tv.vognetwork.com

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Plug plug

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
So where was I? April Fools

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
April Fools

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Lots of April Fools jokes always happen around the game industry

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
We've had some real classic stuff in the past

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
But what did you guys think of this year's offerings?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
We had a few things this year

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
What did you think of this year's April Fools offerings?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Loki, is there any that...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I mean there was a few that kind of stood out

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
But a lot of them were just kind of eh

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I mean, I like the

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Spent new Smash Brothers character reveal which was Nester

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But see that's the thing though

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It's like, it kind of falls into two categories

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
There's April Fools jokes that are kind of like

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Okay haha that's funny

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And then there's those April Fools jokes where it's like

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh man that's really cool

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Why is this just an April Fools joke?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Why can't we have this actually be a real thing?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And so in that category there was

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The Nester reveal and then also

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The Optimus Prime

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
DLC for Titanfall

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Where you'd have Optimus Prime

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Which I gotta admit though he did kind of look a little derpy in that

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
But whatever

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I guess it was generation one but it looked

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
It looked like derpy generation one

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So that was kind of neat

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Wait let me cut in because I don't want you to name everything

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I want to give Jamie a chance

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't know if she was really following all the April Fools stuff

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But was there any gags that caught your eye this year Jamie

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
That you thought were funny? Or anything you thought was lame?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
After being reminded by Bobby I did the NPR stunt

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
That was really smart

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Do people actually pay attention?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That wasn't gaming per se

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But a great commentary on social media

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And the social game we play every day on Facebook

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's a great commentary on my Facebook

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
On everybody's Facebook

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I mean seriously

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
That's actually a great commentary on my mother

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And every conversation I ever have with her

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And just to recap

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I know a lot of people probably listen to Bobby's show

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
But just for those that are listening to our show first

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
For whatever reason on Monday

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They posted an article

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
That said something like

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Americans don't read as much as they used to

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Or something like that

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But you click in the article

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And it says this is our April Fools joke

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Hey you should like the post

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
But don't comment on it

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
To prove that you read it

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And all these people commenting on the post

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Saying what kind of travesty is this?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What are you talking about NPR?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
NPR you guys are full of crap

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
People who just made an impression

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Based off the headline

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Didn't bother to read the story

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Hilarious

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It sort of goes back to

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Something I've been pointing to before

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Through a couple of different shows

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Just how society itself

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Has become

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Can't be bothered to do anything

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And this

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Would never be true in the gaming industry

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Right Dark Sakura?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
The gaming fans never judge things based on headlines alone

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Do we?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You know what?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It's a human thing

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The path of least resistance

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
We would never have

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Like a click baiting website

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That would just try to get attention grabbing headlines

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
For people to share on Facebook

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
We would never have anything like that

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Right?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Website

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
April Fools

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah and who's the fool this time?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Who is the fool?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Dungeon Buster agrees

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
The Optimus DLC was very funny

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
The pagan Jew with one

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I can't believe Dark Sakura forgot about this

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I just wanted this to be real

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
The pagan Jew says the BioWare store stuff

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
The Garris body pillow

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
That was a big joke anyway

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
There were reviews up of it

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Besides that

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't want a Garris body pillow

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Unless it's like a full size plushie

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I could deal with that

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
But Dan would be completely freaked out

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Raginator

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Going to keep it at old school and saying

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
The best April Fools gag ever

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Was the EGM Shang Long joke

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
That is always interesting

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Back when you didn't really have the internet

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The way you have it now

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And gaming magazines were very prolific

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And in the April issue

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
There would always be some type of

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Joke

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And it was always really funny to me

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
When that stuff would cross over into actual

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Cannon

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The one that pops into my head is when they said

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Ermac was in Mortal Kombat

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
The red ninja Ermac was available

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You did all this crazy stuff

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And you could unlock it

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
What did the developers of Mortal Kombat do?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
They put a character called Ermac in one of the later games

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
We always knew it would happen

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
They started trolling people by putting

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Random text in the bios

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Or whatever

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Any jokes that you guys

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Have ever come across on April Fools day

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
In the gaming world or maybe in the tech world

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
That just weren't funny

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Because sometimes

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
What's the old adage?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I can only think of the RuPaul version

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Bear with me here

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
The RuPaul version is

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Throwing shade takes creativity

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Being a bitch takes none

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
And what I mean by that is that

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Some April Fools jokes are funny

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Because they're thought out

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
They're well executed and so forth

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
But there's so much sloppy shit that happens

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
On April Fools day that's just mean spirited

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And dumb

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So what do you guys think has happened in the game industry

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
And I pose this to our chat room as well

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
That was on that side of

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Bitchy that was just dumb

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
There was the Firefly one

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh Netflix is reviving Firefly

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I was like fuck all of you

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
That was kind of being a bitch

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
If it wasn't that you were doing the Jessica Jones

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And Luke Cage series I would just say fuck you

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Forever for the rest of the year

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Until you redeemed yourselves if that was at all possible

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Hitstun says that Nester

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Won this year was lame

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Disagrees with Loki

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
There was the

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Enter the dominatrix

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
April Fools joke

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh what would that tell us more about that

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That's for Saints Row

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
They were teasing it as an

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
April Fools joke originally

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
That became a thing

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Then it was going to become an expansion

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Saints Row 4

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
God having played the DLC

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It would have been fucking terrible

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Even more terrible than Saints Row 4 was

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I do have to say that

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The only getting into

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
April Fools that I did

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Was playing Animal Crossing

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And having to tell who was the right one

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And I'm very sad that I did not guess the correct

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Margie

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Because it made her sad and she better not move

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I forgot that April Fools was a thing

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
In Animal Crossing

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Blanca shows up

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And she impersonates another townsperson

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And so sometimes they'll give a clue by their

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Birthday or whatever

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But it's stupid

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
It's one of those like how much have you been paying attention

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And Margie's my favorite and I got her wrong

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
For a second there I thought you had a really epic

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Capcom crossover there

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Like oh Blanca shows up that's awesome

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
No she's the one that had the face

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
That you drew her face in before

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Blanca shows up and starts electrocuting your villagers

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I support this

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
He just

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
He spotted Ed and then launched himself

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
In the one of those

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Blanca balls at Ed's face

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And murdered him from Jamie's village

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah I did

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Let's see I got

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I got Groucho right

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I like Groucho so I have his picture

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And I got D.Va

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Which I just like her because her name is D.Va

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But she's a fucking frog

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So her eyes are sitting on top of her head and it's fucking weird

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You know I thought the meanest April Fools joke

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Where somebody was being a total bitch that was played

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Was when Notch

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Wrote that blog post

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
About how he wasn't gonna make Minecraft for the Oculus Rift

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Because Facebook bought them

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And then Yeti turned around and now they're gonna do

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You know, pocket Minecraft on the Amazon Fire

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I thought that was a really bitchy April Fools joke

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
But

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
That's because the Amazon Fire

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
They already have controller support for Minecraft Pocket

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You're just putting it on another damn console

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh wait wait you're saying that wasn't an April Fools joke?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
That wasn't an April Fools joke

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It's not technically in 3

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What a bitch

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It's kind of stupid to call it Minecraft

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Pocket on a fucking TV

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I can't fit that TV in my pocket

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Alright how big do you think my pocket is?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Alright

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I can't afford big fucking pockets

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Because I'm going to reach into your pocket

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And take out $7.99

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's for the people with the deep pockets

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Yes it's for people with deep pockets

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Alright

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You gotta have a pouch of holding for that shit

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Alright all bitchiness aside

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
We'll get to the Amazon Fire stuff

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I know it's on everybody's mind

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
We'll get to that in the news in a little bit

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But let's establish our frame of reference for the week

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
In a segment we call

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
How is your gaming week?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So DarkSakura what type of games have you been playing this week?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Animal Crossing

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I played some Final Fantasy 14

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I did some Mass Effect

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
But I really need to start over on my game again

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And for some reason

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
My mods aren't working again

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So whatever the fuck

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I was playing something else

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh yeah um

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I think I mentioned it last week I might have

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
That I started the Shiva

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Which um

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
It's actually

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's done in those old sprite

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You know point and click adventure games

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
But it's really

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
It's very Jewish

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I mean the Shiva

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
What a Shiva is

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Is if you don't know it's like a week long

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Period of mourning when someone dies

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Where the family in mourning

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Sits on the floor everyone brings them food

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
You know you're supposed to

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You don't have to do much to take care of yourself

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
You're supposed to get your grief out of your system

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And you know after you've buried the dead

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And so in this case

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It's a rabbi who

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Has a dwindling congregation about to lose

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
His synagogue and then

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Somebody that

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
He had actually

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Kicked out of his congregation

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Left him a whole bunch of money

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
But the guy was murdered

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So it's

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
This whole murder mystery

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Around

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Just around trying to get

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
To the bottom of it

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Why would this guy who he kicked out

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Leave him money

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Who's behind it

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
It's pretty

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
It's really actually more of an insight into

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I think into modern Jewish culture

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I've really been enjoying it

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And on top of that

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It's an old school point and click adventure game

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah it's called the shiva

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The pagan Jewish

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's a real game I need to look this up

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah it's really

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Good and it's actually not super expensive

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But I've been really getting into the story behind it

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Nice

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I played a little bit more

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Dominique Pablos

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
But the problem I have with it

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Is that I

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Have problems with hearing anything off pitch

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Not all of the singing is on pitch

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's a very intentional

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Sort of sing songy

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
That's

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I had this problem in band

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You know what perfect pitch is right

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
When you can hear pitch

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I saw pitch perfect

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I loved Fat Amy she was my favorite

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Well I have perfect pitch for listening

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And so I can hear when anything

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Is off it starts to sound like

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Instead of a constant sound

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
You hear all the sound waves between it

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And so for me it's just like

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
A cringe I can't even listen to myself sing

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
When I'm off pitch

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
So that's why I don't do karaoke

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Turn the volume down turn subtitles on

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Probably what I'm going to end up doing

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Except the songs are cute the music is cute

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So I've been enjoying what I'm playing of it

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And that's not anything having to do with the game

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
That's having to do with me

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
So I take it in bursts I'm having a good time

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It is such a little art film

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It is I love it it's so cute

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I just sort of want my own

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Dominique doll

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
We know people you can call

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
To maybe arrange that

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I might make one

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And thank you Dungeon Buster for doing a link to the

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Shiva in there because I would really like

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
To see more games like this

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I would love to see more people

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Explore this game and learn more

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
About you know the culture behind it

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Well and in a way you just brought up

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Dominique Pamplemousse too which is a very

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Similar sort of thing being able to explore

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
The mind of somebody

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You might not otherwise

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Have thought about relating to before

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And I love the main character

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I really do like Dominique

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But that being said

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I have to take it in doses

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And I'm actually kind of

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Considered getting Titanfall

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Except I would throw up so quickly

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
This doesn't sound like you at all

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I mean don't get me wrong Titanfall is pretty cool

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
But what's your attraction

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
To Titanfall? I want to see the story behind it

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Because I actually it was funny because we were

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Alright we were watching

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
At Captain America today we were watching

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The little commercials

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
They do in front of it they had a really

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Good one for Titanfall and I was like oh that's kind of

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Interesting and then you see the pilots bouncing

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
From wall to wall I was like oh my god

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It's like Attack on Titanfall

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I was like I'm kind of

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Interested now because it says it's got a story

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And it's multiplayer and I was like well

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
There will be people on the same learning curve as me I'm sure

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
The story is very short because

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
The game is only multiplayer and so there's

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Like multiplayer

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
multiplayer match oh something story related

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
multiplayer match and then that's it

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And then later on oh something else

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Story related oh whatever

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh and now you have to play the other side

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Maybe I'll just stick with drunken robot

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Pornography then

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
You can watch the story on YouTube

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Seriously I think it's short enough to where you could do that

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Well I don't know I've actually

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
When I gave up playing through

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Half Life 2

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I just watched the rest of the story online

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Well how do you think sites like Twitch TV

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Are a thing people like to watch

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
People play through stories but I do want

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
To have a mass effect multiplayer

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Night where we stream again

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I wonder if my game is up to date

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I don't even know because then I need to drink a lot

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
That'd be fun and play because drunken

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Mass effect multiplayer on bronze

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Is the funniest thing ever and for the record

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Ragenator I did get goat simulator

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Or as you said goat stimulator

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And it's fucked up

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Also

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Another comment in our chat room you may

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Not be alone in some of your music

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Things dark soccer

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
says when I hear death metal

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I lose my balance and I get dizzy right away

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I have the problem actually

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
With certain ones like okay I'm fine

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
With speed metal but anything

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
That's the super bass heavy and

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Screechy oh like through the fire and the flames

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Yeah I'm fine with speed metal because

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It actually is sort of melodic it has

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
A pattern and I mean if anyone

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Wants to okay the stuff that I listen

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
To to calm me down when I'm about you know at

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Meltdown phase is I listen to Philip Glass

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And believe it or not I've actually

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Found a little bit of correlation with

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Some of the patterns that come up in Philip Glass's music

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And certain types

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Of speed metal just the melodic

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And repetitive how it

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Builds and builds and builds on something so

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It's actually very calming to me but

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Death metal no I get sick actually get nauseous

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
If it's I've listened to too much

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So yeah

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Alright

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Well let's move on back to I don't know

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
How we got into talking about death metal from video games

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
We did Loki how was

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Your gaming week I've actually been listening to lots of music

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Not death metal but I've been trying

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
To find because the thing is

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I've been trying to find music that's of a

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Certain genre but I don't know what genre it is

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
It's you know like pendulum

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Where it's a cross between like heavy metal

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Drum and bass and electronica

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I guess but how do you say

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I want

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Heavy metal drum and bass

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Electronica music half pandora

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Or check like last.fm

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Well the problem is I'm looking for

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Indie music that's of that same genre

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And I've found a few things but it's just like

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
They have so many tags on it

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
There's no fucking way I'm gonna go find this

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Anyways the actual games I played

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Or I should say game

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I really only played goat simulator this week

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Because I haven't really played much at all

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
As far as games go I did

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Load up South Park for like

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Literally two minutes just to show my friend

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
And that was that

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
He proceeded to use all my

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Single day

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Summons so I had to

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Not save and you know

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Go back and actually

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Play that section again

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
But yeah goat simulator is fun

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I liked how they changed some of the things

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Probably for copyright issues

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
The Yoshi goat is now Italian dinosaur goat

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Which is funny

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
They added a dragon

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Shout goat which I haven't actually used yet

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
But there's a lot more

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Mods on there now

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Some new maps

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
So fun stuff

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Just got the achievement for doing all the flips

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
The trick is to go into the low

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Gravity area and you can flip forever

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
In there

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah so

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
That's all I played this week hopefully

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Gonna get in some Call of Duty

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Modern Warfare 2 later this week

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Got a ton of friends now

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
That are playing that so it'll be fun

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Alright

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
My gaming week I actually kept myself pretty busy

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I've played a few games this week

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Sadly none of it is really new things for me to talk about

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 10

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
The HD remake

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I played that a little bit towards the beginning of the week

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I got a copy of South Park

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
On Playstation 3

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
So I finally got a chance to play the South Park game

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm not super far into it

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I'm just like at the beginning still where you're going around town

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
With Butters trying to recruit the people for your

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
You know

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
For your army or whatever

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
And I'm like isn't this the same plot from the show

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
But that's alright

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
It's really funny of course the game is hilarious

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Because it's written by

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
The guys who do the actual show

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Matt Park or Trey Stone

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And I thought it was interesting how there's all these little side quests

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
The way the game plays

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Obviously it has the RPG elements

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
But it reminds me of

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
A 90's

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Click adventure game from the PC

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Like King's Quest or Loom or some shit

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I don't know why

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Maybe it's because you keep going from static scene to static scene

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And you interact with things in the scene

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Be it with your slingshot

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Or you're looking at things that are yellow

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Or things you can open up or whatever

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So I just kind of

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I don't know I thought that was kind of neat

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It kind of was a throwback to those games

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
But yeah the game is funny

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
And definitely worth a look at if you're a South Park fan

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Other games I've been playing this week

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Diablo 3

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Having an experience boost weekend

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So I'm still trying to beat Act 5

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Because I'm level 69 now

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So there's only one more level for me to gain

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
So I've got to be close to the end

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
But yeah I wanted to play that during the experience boost weekend

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So I've been playing a little bit of that

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Also this weekend Final Fantasy 14 is doing its

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Second beta on Playstation 4

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And this is the beta where you can use

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Your characters from the PC

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Or the Playstation 3

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
If you still haven't checked out the Final Fantasy 14

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Beta on Playstation 4

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I hate to say it I think you missed your chance

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean you can start the download now

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And depending on your connection you might be able to get

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
A couple hours in to at least get a feel for it

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
But at this point if you haven't played it

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Now is your chance to try out the game for free

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah it comes out in like a week

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah it's out the pre-order

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Starts on the 11th and those people can play

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
And I believe Playstation 3 users

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Who are converting their licenses

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Also get to start playing that day

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
And then the 14th is when the game comes out

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
SSJ 100 Matt by the way says

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
You need to play South Park in front of your mom

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I will I'll invite her over she loves South Park

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I have not seen your mom

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
In ages and she's wonderful

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Yeah I should invite her on the show sometime

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Maybe for Mother's Day or something

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
We'll have her on the show in the new studio

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It'll be fun

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Huh

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
That's a good idea

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
That's a good idea

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
And by the way

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
What?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Next week I will be doing another Blue Roses giveaway in Animal Crossing

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
You gonna work on farming those blue roses?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Oh I've got like a whole flower bed full now

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Alright stay tuned

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Blue roses the Animal Crossing equivalent of

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Crystal meth

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Apparently, apparently

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Uh see I've been playing the Final Fantasy 14 beta

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
On Playstation 4

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I am impressed with the technology in that little box

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I gotta say

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Because the game runs great

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It runs better than it does on my 5 year old PC

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Because my PC is 5 years old

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
But the frame rate is fantastic

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The game looks great

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And I can broadcast to Twitch

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Using the whole built in thing

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
And my network thing doesn't suffer

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
The graphics look good

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You know I actually played through

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
The 2.2 patch content last night

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I streamed it

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I really wish Twitch archived

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
The Playstation 4 stuff

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
It doesn't

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I'm kinda bummed out

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Because I did the Leviathan fight for the first time

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Last night on the feed with Shane

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
And uh

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I actually thought of a pretty clever way

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Cause you know when I do my live streams

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I almost always have somebody on Skype

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That I can kinda banter with

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
So it's not just watching my little head in the box

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Or listening to rock music

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Like I just

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I have to be different

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
So I always like to banter with somebody on Skype

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
So you know

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Usually Shane is almost always there

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Or Extifer

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Or Grandpa from Hoardouse

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Or somebody's

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Usually they're bantering with me

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Well

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
On the Playstation 4 it's a little more difficult right

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Cause you can't plug in a mixing board or anything right

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But what I figured out you can do

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I get my iPhone

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
And I call Shane on the Skype app on my iPhone

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And I set the iPhone right next to the camera

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So he can hear me when I'm talking

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
And then the listeners hear him

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Or the viewers hear him through the camera mic

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
And it works

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
So then the viewers are actually listeners too?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Yes, both

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Unless they're deaf

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Then they're just viewers

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
And they don't care about the banter

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Between Shane and I

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Cause there's no subtitles

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
We should find a way to subtitle the show by the way

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah I don't know

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It'd be a lot of work

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
So

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You could use one of those automated things

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That are kinda hit and miss

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
But yeah

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Final Fantasy XIV on Playstation 4 is great

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
And I'm probably gonna switch to playing on Playstation 4

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
When it comes out

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Since I got it on Playstation 3

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
And here's

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
If you're interested in the game

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I would really urge you to

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Try to find a cheap copy on Playstation 3 right now

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
And then just convert your license to Playstation 4

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
That's the cheapest way to do it

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
And get 30 days free with the game

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
You can probably find a copy for 15-20 bucks right now

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Out there

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Just make sure it's not used

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Cause you need to have a code

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
But

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
There you go

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
That was pretty much my gaming week honestly

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Lots of other stuff I need to try

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I've got an EverQuest Landmark beta code

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
That I'm waiting to use

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I gotta get in there and play that

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
And

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Let's see

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I'll describe it

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
And

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Let's see

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Elder Scrolls Online came out

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
But I lost my chance at that

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I didn't really play that

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
And

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Wild Stars in beta too

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
And I'm the one to test that out

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And I really want to try Wild Stars

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I really want

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And I doubt anybody from Blizzard

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Listens to this show

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
But if you do

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
If I happen to have a fan out there

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
That I did not know about

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
That's got the hookup at Blizzard

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Please flag my account

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
For the Heroes of the Storm alpha

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Thank you, thank you

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Kiss kiss hug hug

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
I really wanna

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I can't

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
I'm losing my resistance Rob

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
What?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Cause the space goats

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Oh you wanna go back to WoW?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I kinda do

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
When the expansion comes out

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Uh oh

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
That was the other one

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
That was really awesome

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I don't remember if it was League of Legends

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Or I think it was League of Legends

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
But they had

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And I'm assuming it's a joke

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
But they had

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
The

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Goat simulator goat in there

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
As a playable character

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
And it was

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I think it was one of those like

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
You know

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Dota type games or something

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
But

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I wanna say it was League of Legends

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Maybe it wasn't League of Legends

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
But

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
There's a lot of people doing a lot of goat simulator things

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
And that right there

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
That's the April Fools game right there

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
That just keeps on giving

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Because it's a legit game

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
You know MMOs do some of the best April Fools gags

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
They do some of the worst

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Oh my god

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
What was it?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Guild Wars 2

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Had the whole retro level last year

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
That was amazing

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Oh you know

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
There's something else that I did

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
It wasn't video game related

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
But it wasn't anime

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
I started Kill la Kill

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Is that the one that Rama told you to watch?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
No

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Oh

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Several many other people have told me to watch it

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And so finally I just broke down and started watching it

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh my god

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
That's all I have to say

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Going to our chat

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Going to our chat room at

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Live.vognetwork.com

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Dark Tetsuya says

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Well doesn't YouTube kind of have closed captioning?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Not sure it's 100% accurate

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
But anyway

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Yes it does

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
I don't know if our videos that Jason puts on the Orange Launch Radio channel at YouTube

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Has that like

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
That you can use that

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But I bet it's hilariously bad

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Because there's some really bad YouTube captioning out there

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Maybe we should check out

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm gonna check it out

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
You should check out a prior episode

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
See if that's there

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Also going to more chat

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Let's see

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Hitstun says

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Wildstar and Elder Scrolls Online were really big at PAX East last year

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
But they're still not out yet

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Elder Scrolls Online actually launched on Friday

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
So that is now out

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Wildstar I believe is June

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Is when that's coming out

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
S2100Matt says

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
We need to use our

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Tell a friend about the show duty

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And find a friend that is also a stenographer

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And get them hooked to OLR

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
That would be great

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
I'd love that

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Alright

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Anyhow

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
So that is it

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I believe for our gaming weeks

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
That's everybody

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Quick housekeeping

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And then we will get to the show

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
With the news and everything

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Add us on Twitter

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
You can also add us on Facebook

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And Google Plus

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
A couple shout outs

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I want to give here

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
At the top of the show

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I want to shout out the website

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Outcasts with a Z

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Outcasts.com

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Really awesome

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
This has not happened to me before

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
But they actually ran a feature on me

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
On their site

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
And it talked about

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It talked about the history of Orange Lounge Radio

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Talking about a little bit of my broadcast background

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
With Understation Live and everything

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
Outcasts.com is like a GLBT nerd gaming culture site

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And Jamie got a name drop even

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I mentioned you in the interview

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I am sorry you did not make the story

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I knew that was going to get called out

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
What happened? What was with me?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Because your name is in the interview

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because it talks about how OLR started

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So it talks about Rob and Jamie started OLR

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Da da da da da

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
But the problem is

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
I said in another part

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I talked about how Loki is with it now

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
But they didn't use that part of it

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Because technically

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Loki didn't start the show with us

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
But it's like

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
He just kept showing up

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah but it's one of those things

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Now how could we ever have the show without him

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
So I am very sorry Loki

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
But that was the interviewer's person

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I know Travis and Jessica got shout outs too

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
For the Understation Live stuff

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Loki none for Loki bye

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
The captioning is hilarious

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Is it?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
It's just like it's terrible

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
I mean it's got some

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay so Orange Lounge Radio

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You know the little intro part

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
The way they translate

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Way but sprawled hollow

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Let's see here

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Let's see here

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Let's see here

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
There was an

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Oh

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't even know what part this is

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Doing next

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
It's all Sky this week gonna kill the Bens

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And intriguing publishing Google recently

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm gonna kill the Bens y'all

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Look out if your name's Ben

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Oh man that's hilarious

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Yeah just watch it with the subtitles on it's hilarious

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
That's great

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
That's great

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Hey give me

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
There's actually a series of things

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
They do like that for Mass Effect 2 as well

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Oh yeah

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
The bad closed captioning

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Oh yeah

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Good stuff

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Yeah

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
I'm sure there's a lot of that out there

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
So anyway

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Shout out for our YouTube channel

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Check out the bad closed captioning

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
At Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Oh okay

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
So the

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
The Sky is Sweet thing

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
It's on this week

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You know something about Amazon

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Or something like that

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
That's what it

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
It's Jason's little

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah yeah

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
His little intro

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
The Sky this week gonna kill the Bens

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Gonna kill the Bens

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Alright

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Where was I?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Where was I?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Stop interrupting me

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Outkast

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Loki's just mad because he somehow was missing from the article

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Outkast.com and a big thanks to them

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
I really appreciate that

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Give them all your clicks

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Also another website to give all your clicks to

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
A fantastic little show called Troll in the Dungeon

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Which is a World of Warcraft focused podcast

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Had me on their show this past Saturday

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I don't think the episode is posted on the feed yet

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But it will be in the coming days

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
So check them out

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
That's Troll in the Dungeon over on iTunes and Stitcher and all that good stuff

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And that was the episode from just this past

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
What was April 6th

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Or no today is April 6th

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
April 5th would be the show I was on

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Oh my god Rob

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
What?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Not next weekend but the weekend after

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Gonna be older

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Your birthday

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
What's your birthday plans? Anything?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Hopefully going to Sakura, Matsuri

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I need to make sure it's that weekend

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But I wanna hang out in San Francisco

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
And eat all the food I don't normally eat

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Except the problem

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's also Passover

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Oh

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I was gonna say you should go to Dave and Busters

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And do your get drunk as hell thing

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
That means I'm just gonna have to eat nothing but mochi

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I'm voting that we change the name of our show

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
According to what it thinks our name of the show is

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
It's Orange Allow Injure Radio

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Alright put that thing away

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
That's because of how you pronounce lounge Rob

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You say lounge like

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Lounge

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
Cause you extra enunciate when you do the intro

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
That's not my voice in the intro

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
Well I mean but when you do another episode of Orange Lounger Radio

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
You say lounger

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Which is powerful

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You sound almost like you're an evil dictator

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
This is Orange Allow Injure Radio

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Orange Lounger Radio

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
I'll take it

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Dark soccer

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Dark soccer

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Close it

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Well you know I do have an affinity for kicking balls

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
There's her little clip in the next intro

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Alright let's get into gaming news

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Loki's gonna put away the closed captioning

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
And talk to us about what is going on in the gaming world

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Here at Orange Allow Injure Radio

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
So the ever rumored Amazon set top box type thing

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Was finally announced during a press event

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
They had it live blogged and everything

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And it's the Amazon Fire TV

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And it's actually a device that you know

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Like most of those set top boxes out there

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
That you can stream you know Netflix

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
And of course you know the Amazon Video stuff

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Hulu

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
All that sort of things

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
It runs Android so you can run different apps on it and stuff

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Remotes and all that fun stuff

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
But the other cool thing about it though

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Is it also

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Is a device that you can game on

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
So they actually have a controller that you can buy for 40 bucks

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
That looks like you know a console controller

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
And you can play games

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Of course you know they have the whole Amazon Game Studios

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
So there's that

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
It's kind of cool

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
The device is only $99

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
So there's your final nail in the coffin Uya

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You're irrelevant now

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Sounds like a big splat

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Some of the games of course

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Well hold up to be fair the Uya is $99 with a controller

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
If you want to play games on the Amazon Fire

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
You're telling me it's really $139

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Spec wise though it's way more powerful than Uya

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
And it's got one thing that the Uya doesn't have

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Which is Minecraft Pocket Edition

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Well here's the $139 question though

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Are you going to buy one?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Am I going to buy one?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I don't know if the wife would let me buy another set top box

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I wanted to

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Because we have the Boxee right now

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
But it's kind of crap

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah if my Boxee were to die somehow

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Some unforeseen accident

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Then yes I would totally pick one up

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm going to be honest why?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I can't see the need to get

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
I mean I get why this Amazon Fire exists

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
It's a great appealing thing for my mom and my dad

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Who are never going to buy a game console but want to have Netflix

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Like the people that buy Roku's and things like that

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
That's great for them

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
That's exactly why I'd buy it

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
I wouldn't buy it to play games on it

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Maybe Minecraft

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
I wouldn't even play Minecraft

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Why would you even play Minecraft?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I would buy it for games

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Well not games but maybe

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
I don't know

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
It would be kind of cool to publish something to that

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Well let's not forget

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Amazon bought a developer recently

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Yeah

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
So they're going to have something exclusive

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Well they do

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's a game called Sev Zero

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
It's a first person shooter type thing

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So they've got that

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Some of the things they're showing

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Asphalt 8 and Minecraft

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
And the other thing though is it does work with other Bluetooth controllers

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
So maybe it would work with a DualShock controller

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
If you have one already

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Andrew's pretty friendly with anything Bluetooth

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I don't know it's not a huge deal

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And also I think if you buy the controller

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You get like some

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
I don't know how it works but it's like Amazon coins or something like that

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's like a thousand of that

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Buy books or something

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Buy things with that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I don't know the ratio of coins to money

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
So they've got that

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And I don't know I'm kind of interested

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Like I said I would mainly use it for

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Just like TV stuff

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
It would be cool though because I didn't really get to see a lot of the interface thing

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Because I had friends over at the time

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But if it's

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Like I think it is where I think it might combine

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Like all the different

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Like you're not going into dedicated apps for different things

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
I think it's just like

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Okay I want to watch like

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Game of Thrones or something

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Maybe Game of Thrones is a bad example

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I want to watch

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The Office or something

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And it will bring up all the different

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Providers that have The Office

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And where you can watch that

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Or different movies and things

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
So it kind of aggregates it all together

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Instead of like

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Oh crap was that show on Netflix

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Or was it on Hulu

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I don't know I have to go browse Netflix

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Oh it's not here okay

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Browse Hulu

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Amazon has it

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
That's smart

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It's like a modern day TV guide

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah it's just instead of having

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
The Boxy tried doing that

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
It does it terribly

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
But they tried to do that

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
With a lot of the website streaming services and stuff

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And then of course

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah so it does work

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
With their Bluetooth controllers and stuff

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Let me read some chat comments real quick

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Tiger Claw says

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
What the Amazon Fire TV lacks

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Is the ability to shop and buy stuff

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
In the Amazon store

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
That does seem like a pretty

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Obviously missing thing right

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Well I mean you could

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Well I think

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Well I think even with Amazon

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Like when you're using the Amazon movies

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Or TV

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Like I know when you use the app on the Xbox 360

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
You're more than welcome to buy those things

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Right there in the app and watch them

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I think you can buy stuff

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
You're talking about like buying like off of amazon.com

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Yeah I think that's

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
They have mobile apps for them

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
And I'm pretty sure that's probably one of the apps

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's in the Amazon marketplace

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Which is not something they probably featured

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Well yeah I mean they're not gonna show

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Every single app that's available for you

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Here's a way you can give us more money

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Let's see

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Kaijuto with some strong opinions on Pocket Minecraft

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Pocket Minecraft blows

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
It's still in alpha

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Waste of money

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah I have no interest in Pocket Edition

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I do agree with you

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
I think it is kind of cheap

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
And it's just

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
You're saying that

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Ooh it runs Minecraft

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
It's Android it runs Minecraft

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I mean come on it's you know

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
All Android devices are a hell

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
You know all iOS devices run Minecraft

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
So

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
It's not a big deal

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
And because this device is based on one of those mobile platforms

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm very interested to see what the PlayStation 4 version brings to the table

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Now granted you know PC

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
But I know the console games have started to kind of go their direction

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
And the PC kind of has its direction or whatever

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
So I'm very curious what the extra oomph of the PlayStation 4 brings to Minecraft

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
And I'm not like I know people are going

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
But the graphics are never gonna get any better

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I get that

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I think they could actually

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
They could

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
And the space in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions is limited

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Which you know it's a huge space

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
It would be cool if you did like the Sonic ether you know

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Shaders or if you could select what type of shaders you want

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Cause the Sonic ether stuff looks fucking awesome

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Maybe they'll be able to have some of that stuff where you put your own skins

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
And things like that in there too

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Like cause you see a little

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
They'll sell you skins

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Yeah that's true

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You see a little bit of that in the 360 version

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
With the mass effect and the Skyrim

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
They have like the PS3 one now too

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh yeah

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah they don't have like you know dedicated packs

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Where you get like levels and stuff

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
But they had one like they had like a city texture pack and stuff

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And they have some character packs but

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Could be interesting

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
I mean I don't know it's

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Put it this way like for ninety nine bucks

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
That's about the price that you're gonna be paying for a lot of these set top boxes

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
They range around seventy nine to ninety nine anyways

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
And the fact that this one is about three times more powerful than those

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
It has a dedicated GPU in it

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
You might as well get this one even if you don't want a game on it

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Cause maybe there's something down the road you know

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
There'll be like some free apps on it or something that you want to try out

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Or who knows what people are gonna develop for

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
If it's popular enough

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Which I think at that price point it's pretty

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
It's almost an impulse buy for like you know tech stuff

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
Well and come Black Friday they're gonna slice it down to seventy nine dollars

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Or something even cheaper

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah I mean

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
For prime people I'm sure

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It's definitely like if I didn't have the boxy

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I would definitely consider picking that up

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Now will a drone fly it to my house?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
That's what I wanna know

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Oh I don't think that

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon but

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
It would be

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
I mean might as well

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
I mean cause it's more powerful

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
It's gonna be able to run even just video apps and stuff

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Better than some of these other systems

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Cause I gotta be honest like

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
My set top box is pretty old

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
And it shows it's really laggy

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
And just

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
I mean it does video okay

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
But you know the interfaces are just not very snappy

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
So it would be cool to check this out

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
That being said though

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I'm kinda curious to see then

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
If this is really popular how Apple kinda combats it with like a new Apple TV or something

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
So I mean cause

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
It's only a moment

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
It's only a matter of time before there's like

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Apple's overdue for a press conference I think

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
You know you'd be at an iPad update or

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Not the iPhones

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
iPhones would be later in the year but

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
We know there's gonna be like some Apple TV thing at some point

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah absolutely

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Alright well

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
There you go

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Well one game that will not be on the Amazon Fire

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Because you know what it just

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
It just needs

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
It needs more oomph behind it

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It needs the kind of oomph that the Wii U can deliver

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
And that is Mario Kart 8 is on the horizon

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
There was quite the information dump on Mario Kart 8 this week

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Because we're only what

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
We're about a month and a half out

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
I guess maybe two months

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But May 30th is the big day for Mario Kart 8

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
And there's new information coming out on the game

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Through some trailers this week

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
And it looks great

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
A lot of people very pumped for it

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Which is really good news for Wii U

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Cause there's nothing to get excited about

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
It does like it is

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
On the horizon

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
I gotta be honest so like

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
You know before

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
I was just like well

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
You know it's just Mario Kart

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
It doesn't look that much better

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
The new trailer is actually

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
It does look a lot better

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
I mean game play wise

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm not really sure

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
But the tracks look pretty

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And the engine looks nice

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
So

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Quickly some of the things that are new

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That were from this trailer

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
There's now a spin boost

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
So when you're racing upside down

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Or on walls

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Cause remember this is kind of the new thing

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
For Mario Kart

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Is that it's getting all F-Zero

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And you can be upside down on walls

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
You can bump into other racers

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
And certain obstacles

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
To get a speed boost

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And there's a spin boost

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
That will basically

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
They say is gonna change

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
The way players boost

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
And everything

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
So that could be very interesting

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Some new characters announced

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
That are returning from prior games

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Metal Mario

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Lakitu

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
And Shy Guy

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
All coming back

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Which is great

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I loved Shy Guy

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
He was a great racer

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
So I'm looking forward to that

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
This is joining the cast

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
With the Kooplings

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
And I'm sure a bunch of the other standards

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
There as well

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Some new items

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
In the game

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
The Piranha Plant

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Which will attach to the front of the car

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And then it chomps at other characters

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Or banana peels on the track

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
And even shells

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
No word if that

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Mother fucker blue shell

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Will get eaten by the Piranha Plant

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
And you know the blue shell

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Is gonna be invincible

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
And everybody's bane

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Well like I was reading some comments

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
On people talking about it

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
They said that if they had the blue shell

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Like they had it in Mario Kart 64

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Where it was pretty rare to get it

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Not just like

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Oh you're in last place

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
You're gonna get it every single time

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Yeah yeah yeah

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
That would have been a lot better

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Also a new item called the Boomerang Flower

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Which you know

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
The Boomerang Hammer Brothers and stuff

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
You've seen this item in the Mario games before

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
The Boomerang Flower

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Will let you throw a Boomerang at opponents

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
And it will stun them

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
And the arc that the Boomerang takes

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Will allow you to hit multiple players

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
You can throw it forward or backward three times

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
That sounds pretty powerful

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
They also showed off some remixed courses

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Such as Moo Moo Meadows

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
From Mario Kart Wii

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Toad's Turnpike from 64

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yes

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
That's really sweet

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
That's the best track

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Yes

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Donut Plains from Super Mario Kart redesigned

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
And instead of going with the retro looking graphics

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
They actually took that old course

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
And made it with the new graphics

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
I mean it definitely has that retro block look to it

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
But you'll see it when you see the video

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Live recorded music

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Which I think is kind of neat

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And yeah various control schemes

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
The Wii U gamepad

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
The Wii U Pro Controller

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
And the wheel

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Rainbow Road 64

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Yes

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Looks great

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Fantastic

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Now by the way

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
You know one of the kind of most people agree

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
This is the weakest game that ever came out in the series

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Maybe not everybody agrees

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
But you know not a lot of love for Mario Kart Double Dash

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Over the years

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Which was the GameCube version

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Where two people were racing at a time

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And a very interesting interview with IGN

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Where Hideki Kono said

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
Talking about possibly implementing this in the future titles

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Quote

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
It wasn't just a simple case of

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Hey we're not going to do that again

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
We really think the two racers together

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
In one kart of Double Dash was really unique

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
And we thought it worked really well

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
We've got that in our pocket

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
So if we come up with any new cool ideas

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
That utilize having two players racing together

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
We'll grab that

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And possibly bring it back out

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Having two players racing together

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
It does have a pretty high cost in terms of processing power

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So that's an obstacle

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
That being said

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
If we could come up with some ways around that processing cost

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
We may have two players

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Maybe even three players racing together

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
So they're not done with that idea yet

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Maybe I don't know

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
I wouldn't exert too much development staff time on that

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
So I'm pretty sure that we're not going to see this in Mario Kart 8

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That just might be something in the future

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
One other quick thing I want to drop in Nintendo News

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Because they did do the info dump on Mario Kart 8

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
And I mentioned it's really the only game on the horizon

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
That we have to look forward to

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Certainly there's a lot of stuff down the road

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
You know like the Bayonetta 2

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
And we know there's this stuff way down the road

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Way way down there

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
But one of the other games that's inching closer and closer

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Is the new Super Smash Brothers

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
They're having a big direct next week

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
I believe on Tuesday

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
It is a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Smash Brothers

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Some people thinking we're going to get the release date

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I'm thinking you might

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You might get the month

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday this year or next year

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I think you're going to get the name

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
The real name will finally be out there

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So I think that's the big thing that they're going to tell you

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Super Smash Brothers U

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Well it's on 3DS as well

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
So I don't know if that's the way they can go with it

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Super Smash Brothers U and 3DS

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
3DU? Who knows? Who knows?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Alright let's move on

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Dark Sakura

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
Well you know I have to say that kids are very resourceful

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
And sometimes find ways to make things happen

52:38.000 --> 52:44.000
And in this case a 5 year old found a security hole in the Xbox One account login

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
A little kid named Christopher

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
Tried to log into his dad's Xbox One

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And he didn't know the password

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
So all he did was keep entering spaces

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
After every time it failed

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And it let him in

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
So basically this was reported

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
And Microsoft thanked him for finding the security hole

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Which is actually funny

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It said his dad is a security researcher

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
But basically after they found it and recorded it

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
Microsoft sent them some gifts as a thank you

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
After of course they patched this out

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
So they gave the kid and his dad

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
They acknowledged them as Microsoft security researchers for March 2014

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
Gave them $50 for Xbox One games and a year of Xbox Live Gold

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
So I guess if a kid's gonna try to sneak into daddy's account

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
I guess there are worse things that could happen for it

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
But I don't know I think

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
It shouldn't have been that easy

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
But at least it's something that was when it was discovered

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It was reported and not used maliciously

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Of course then again the dad's also a security researcher

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
So that makes sense

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I don't know did you hear about that?

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
I heard about it but I mean if there's an exploit

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
That a 5 year old can accidentally find

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That's pretty bad

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I mean I don't know

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Why is anyone able to log into someone's account

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
By just hitting the space bar

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Or not the space bar but hitting space a bunch of times

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
That's just I don't know

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
It seems really lazy

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Well maybe it's just that they didn't figure that

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
I mean it could possibly be something that was put in for system testing at the time

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
And then they figured it out after the fact

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I don't know

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It just

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
So

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Anyways

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
So the Xbox One

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Oh one last thing Kajudo also said that kid broke into his dad's cell phone

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
That kid's gonna grow up to be a hacker

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Well he's just a little brat now isn't he

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
So the Xbox One

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
One of the things that it kind of lacked

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Compared to some of it's competition

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
Is the ability to upgrade it's internal storage

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
Well now they're gonna be adding some external storage options

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Coming soon

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
Apparently Major Nelson confirmed that

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
They will be adding external data support

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And apparently

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
At a later time

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Hopefully that means actual hard drives

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You know a lot of these Xbox One games

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Do require installations

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
And hell if you wanted to even go the whole digital route

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
If you're in my opinion dumb enough to do it

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
That takes up a lot of space

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
And you can only store so much in there in the first place

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
And hell they just I think added

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
The ability to see what you have on there as far as storage space goes

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Because before it was pretty convoluted

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
What they had on there

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I just don't understand how

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Something like that

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
A core piece of functionality is just

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Eh we'll just get to it later on

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
You know we don't really need to have the ability to

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
You know install your games on an external device or anything

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
In case you run out of space

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Eh screw that we'll just

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
We'll just leave you to fend with the 500 gigabyte hard drive

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Which you know 500 gigabytes is not that bad

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Like the Xbox 360 or something

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
But when the file sizes of these games

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Can be up to 10 times the size of an Xbox 360 game

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
That adds up pretty fast

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Are you, you don't even

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
Is Xbox One even on your radar to get low key so you can

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Oh fuck no

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Eh still not

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Not really ours either

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Unless they announced

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Even like let me put it this way

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Even if they announced that Grand Theft Auto 5

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Was coming next gen

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I would not buy an Xbox One

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
That's a pretty strong statement

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I'll get an Xbox One eventually

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
But it's just gonna take probably the next Halo

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
And Quantum Break

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Which I'm anticipating would be this holiday

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I don't see why they won't

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Or at least

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Even if Halo is not this holiday

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
I wonder if they'll do like

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Halo 2 Anniversary Edition or something

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
But to be fair though

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Like even the PlayStation 4

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
There's not really much that wants me

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
You know infamous Second Son looks pretty awesome

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I've heard a lot of good things about that one

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You know what might sell me on an Xbox One

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Is if the new Crackdown game was really awesome

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Like that might

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
You know the Crackdown is pretty awesome

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I kinda like that game but

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Right now there's just not anything upcoming

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Especially the multiplatform stuff

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
Nothing really says oh I need to get this on next gen

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
What if they cut the price for the holiday

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It would have to be by a lot

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Like a lot a lot

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Like we're talking down to $2.99 or something

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I would not

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Like even like that's the thing I was looking at

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
We use oh maybe I want Mario Kart 8

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
You know maybe

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Maybe I do want one of those systems

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
But

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
It's just not cheap enough for me

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Like I don't

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I'm not gonna really buy a system for one game

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
And

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
You know spending like $200 even

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Yeah $200 or more on it

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Just doesn't seem worth it to me

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
To register participation for this week's episode

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Going to our chatroom over at

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Live.vognetwork.com

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
VXChaseNXV says who the hell wants to plug in

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Mass storage into their game console

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I don't even like to do that with my computer

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I only do it begrudgingly

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
There's probably not a lot of reason for it right now

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
With so many limited games although the games are huge

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
But I do know like people like to download

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Especially when you're downloading like entire TV series

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Which you can do on Playstation 3

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And some people have done it

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
And Xbox as well

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
You need a place to put those files

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
The reason why they have it that you can't

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Fucking upgrade your drive in the Xbox

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
One or Xbox 360

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Without buying one that's officially

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
From Microsoft is because they have their

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Fucking stupid file system in there that's

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
What is it? FATX or XFAT

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Or something like that

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
It's just some really stupid

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
File system that they have that

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Is exclusive to those stupid consoles

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean they have

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
XFAT's not exclusive to a console

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Well they have ways to like you know format them

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
With like you know homemade programs

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And stuff like that but

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
It's not like it's running

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
You know FAT32

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Like the Playstation 3 was

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
They don't have just a standardized

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
File system in there

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
So you can't just pop in the hard drive

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
They want you to buy the 10 times more expensive

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Hard drive that's going to be exclusive

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
For that console

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Alright well moving on to more Xbox news

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
This news came out early in the week

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
That is certainly huge as

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
To the direction of Microsoft

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Phil Spencer who was formerly

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
The corporate vice president of

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Microsoft Studios is now the head of

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Xbox over at Microsoft

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And there was an interview that he did with

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Major Nelson or Larry Erb

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
The day that you know or the day after

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
It was announced there

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
They're talking a little bit about E3 already

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And you know some of the things hyping up there

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Some people warming up to Phil Spencer because

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It does seem like one of the first things

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
He's doing is he's making the conversation about the games

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And he also essentially said

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I mean I'm going to

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well I do have a quote here I'll say this

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I know a lot of times people give nods to the different forums

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Out there the different communities of people

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I will honestly say I learn a ton

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
From listening to the feedback

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Reading the forum ideas

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I saw just when I was announced in the position

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The first things that Phil Spencer should do as head of Xbox

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
There were a lot of great ideas there

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Oh yeah I saw that too

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
He better bring back Shenmue 3

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Which I think he said was like the number one most requested game

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
For Xbox

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's crazy which I don't even know how they would do that

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Without a massive Sega partnership

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Well then Sega let the trademark right now

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
They would just go up to Sega

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And Sega would be like

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh hey what the hell

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
What's all this money being thrown at me

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Hey you want to play a game of Lucky Hit?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Anyway

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So yeah you know

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
You notice that Phil Spencer

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Does seem to be in tune with

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
The internet critics for better or for worse

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't know if that's always necessarily a good thing

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
But he does definitely want to take the conversation

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
To games and he's talking about E3

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And how they're already you know

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
They don't want to have a bunch of suits up there

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
They want the game makers out on stage

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Talking about the games and you betcha

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They're already planning E3

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I mean they're already talking about you know

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
How many minutes are we going to give

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
What game and how's that all going to go

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
You bet all that stuff is being finalized right now

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
So

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I'm excited to see where Phil Spencer takes the company

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
He certainly qualified for the job

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So let's see what happens

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Hopefully

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
We'll appease the people that were not happy

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
With the movies movies movies

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Sports sports sports direction of the Xbox

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But you know what I

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I still think that

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know if Xbox really does

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Make this full fleshed

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Entertainment channel I think that's a huge

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Asset

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I don't think that's really been done

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Like as far as the whole TV integration

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Aside from being able to plug

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I'm not even talking about that I'm talking about original content

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Like the Halo thing with Spielberg and some of that stuff

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I don't know

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That's almost like the same stuff that we see on Netflix

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And Amazon where they have their own original shows

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I mean that's cool

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But Netflix has Emmy award winning

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Shows like Orange is the New Black

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And House of Cards I don't believe Halo is going to be

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Getting any sort of fucking Emmys

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Well but could they get nerd cred

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Equivalent

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I don't know I saw their

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Halo live action movie that they just

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Did or whatever someone did

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
They licensed to

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But I just

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Think though the whole point though is they were

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Focusing like oh it's going to be

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
This really integrated experience and stuff like that

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And it kind of reminded me a whole bunch when they were

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Talking about the whole

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Second screen experience that you would get

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
With the

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Xbox 360 even

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And even kind of bringing it back to the Xbox One

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Where it's like oh you can watch Game of Thrones

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And there's all this interactive material on there

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And where is that?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You know is that going to be happening

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You know today I mean

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Where is that stuff because

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
They talk a big game but

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
In the end it seemed like this is just

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
It's just like ooh

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I can plug in my cable boxes to the back of

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You know my game system like I could

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
A VCR

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Well it's going to be a very

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Interesting E3 to say the least

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So we will be staying tuned

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And the news is going to

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Start to dry up as we get a little closer to

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
E3 and then once we hit like mid-May

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Then all that news starts kind of leaking out so it's

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Going to be a very interesting ramp up

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Here to the June E3 show

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Anyway more news DarkSakura

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Well everyone knows I'm a big Treasure fan right?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Well this is something that's pretty happy

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So basically

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Treasure is actually working with Capcom to make

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
A sequel to

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The game that they did on 3DS

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Called Geist Crusher

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And they're actually doing a version called

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Geist Crusher God

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That is basically

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You go around and

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Hunt boss creatures and kill them

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That's the game but it's Treasure

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So you know it's always got a twist to it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Really neat game but I thought that this one

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Given that Treasure has done

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Nothing but awesome games

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Would definitely be something a lot of people would want to keep on their radar

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
The uh

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Just the voice acting though in the trailer

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Is pretty hilarious

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
This is Geist Crusher God

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
You know so it's like

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It sounds like they're really gonna

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Push for that level

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So yeah just a little something

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Alright well I'm sure that makes you happy

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
To hear about what's going on there

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I love Treasure

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Well let's talk about games that will be coming out a little bit

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Sooner as we travel around the world and look at

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The release dates

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Loki why don't you start off with the US

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Loki you're dead quiet again

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I think you turned the mic on

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Ok so anyways as I was saying

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The Xbox 360 version

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Of Titanfall was finally released

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
That is coming out

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And from what I hear

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's actually pretty good

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Except it runs at 30 frames per second

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
There's that I guess

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Also this week Lego The Hobbit

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Which is coming out on Playstation 3

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Xbox 360, Playstation 4

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Xbox One

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
3DS and Vita

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And PC

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The Wii U version

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Though not coming out yet

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Which is kind of surprising

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And then um

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Also later this week we've got

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
A game called Putty Squad

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
On Vita and Playstation 3

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Lego Friends on the DS

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Hopefully still coming out this week

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Not delayed again but Hello Kitty Cruisers

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
On the Wii U

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I guess that was released digitally already

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But the physical version is just

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Not out yet

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And also

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The one game I think that so far

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Is actually going to be utilizing the Kinect

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
In a non-danced way

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Kinect Sports Rivals coming to

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Xbox One this week

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Might be worth picking up

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
If you have that

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And Jamie

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
This is something that you might want to pick up

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Disney Magical World

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
For 3DS coming out on Friday

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
That's that game that crosses

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Kind of like Animal Crossing with Disney characters

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I need this in my life

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So there's that

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Alright well traveling to Japan

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Yay I'm traveling to Japan

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Looking at the releases there

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Hey there's a Playstation 4 game out in Japan this week

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It is Final Fantasy XIV Online

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000

Excuse me

On the 360 this week

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
On the Playstation Vita

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000

On April the 10th

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And on the Wii U this week

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Nothing, they don't have anything until a Monster Hunter

That comes out on April 23rd

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But the 3DS does have

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Crayon Shin-chan

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
From Bandai Namco

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That's a series that won't die

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
That is out on the 3DS this week

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And that is a series that won't die

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But you can make your own mini movies

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And stuff it looks like

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And look, there's Booty

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
In this little cartoon Booty

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
In the game

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Doesn't he usually have his pants down or something like that?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I think that's the joke

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
There you go, that's the releases for Japan

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Well on the 8th we have

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Looks like

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It's not actually in the name, I think it's 0

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
On PS4 and Xbox One

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And then Max The Curse of the Brotherhood

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
On April 9th

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
On the 10th is Family Guy The Quest

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
For Stuff

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
On iOS and Android

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Warlock II The Exiled

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And another one on PC

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That they're not giving me the name of

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Which I'm going to see if I can find out what it is

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Oh Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And then on the 11th

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
We have Football Manager Classic 2014

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Kinect Sports Rivals

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Lego The Hobbit

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
A bunch of Lego The Hobbit

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And a bunch more Lego The Hobbit

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So yeah, that's it

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Well good news for Lego The Hobbit fans

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This is the classic game of the week

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And it's a good one tonight

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Alright, so this is kind of disappointing

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But apparently the Resistance

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Games, they are going offline

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Starting April 8th

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And that is of course the online

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Multiplayer portion of the game

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You will not be able to play that anymore

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Come April 8th

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I don't know, I had a lot of fun

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Playing Resistance, the first one at least

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Split screen multiplayer

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That was kind of fun to be able to do that

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Didn't really get too much into

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Two or three of those

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Still disappointing to see that

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
They are taking that down

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Not a lot of people are playing it anymore

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Alright, well one more thing going offline

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Not just Resistance going offline

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
But this one is having a huge impact

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The GameSpy network is going offline

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
This is going offline

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
On May 31st

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
We sort of saw the hint of this coming

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
When Nintendo suddenly decided they were going to

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Pull the Wii online stuff

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And it was theorized that

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
There is probably something larger going on with GameSpy

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And that they are increasing fees

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And Nintendo didn't want to pay them

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Sure enough, the whole damn plug is getting pulled

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
On all of GameSpy

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
GameSpy technologies

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Closing the matchmaking service on May 31st

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
This is really the end of an era

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Because I remember using GameSpy to find a game of

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Quake to play online

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Correct me if I'm wrong though

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Aren't some modern games actually using GameSpy

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Borderlands does

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yes, Borderlands does use GameSpy

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
So there are some games that

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
We are out there

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That are no longer going to work anymore

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Now I don't think

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Anybody has used GameSpy since

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
2010

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Which is when Borderlands 1

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But Borderlands 2 uses it as well

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
No it doesn't, Borderlands 2 doesn't use GameSpy

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Are you sure about that?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I think it uses Steamworks

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Chatter can correct me if I'm wrong

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
So yeah, if the company doesn't have the funding

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Or the reason to go back and

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Make another network work with the game

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It's going to not work anymore

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So this shouldn't be a huge surprise

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
GameSpy stopped making editorial content

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
In 2013

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Glue Mobile, the mobile games publisher

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Actually bought this in 2012

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
They kind of just ran it into the ground

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Literally

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And Bobby Blackwolf confirmed that

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Borderlands 2 used GameSpy

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And what's funny is that Bobby said

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
When he interviewed them, I even asked them that

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And they were like, no, fuck GameSpy

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So I guess they're not too happy

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
About the first time around, who knows

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
So, yeah, again, the end of an era

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
GameSpy was originally launched actually

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
As a Quake server search program

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I used to use that to play Quake games

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Man, I miss those days

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Alright, well

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Let's see what we got here

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
So we've got

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Alright, well

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
You know, here on this show we like to

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Look back at an era long gone

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
With a segment we call the classic game of the week

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
DarkSakura's going to dive into the gaming vault

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And find a game that she thinks, hey

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You should play this game right now

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
If you can find it

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
DarkSakura, in the original form

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Good luck

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Game of the week?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
The classic game of the week

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The classic game of the week is

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
What?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Sorry, I was trying to get your attention offline

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
You okay over there?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
No, my mic got caught under the cord

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Oh no

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
The joys of live radio, there we go

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Alright, so

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
As we were saying, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Yep

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And of course the one with enough music

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
To actually play is the

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
1990 version

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I am specifically referring to the original

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That came out in 1985

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
When I was nine years old

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I would play the crap

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Out of this game

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And it was

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Released

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Like I said in 1985

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And distributed by the World

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Ominak and Books of Facts

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That was published by Feros Books

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It was

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Included with some versions

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Of the Amiga 500

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And there was also like I said

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
An enhanced version that came out in 1990

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That did not have the

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Ominak copy protection

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
But it had disc based copy protection

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
And there was a further deluxe

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Expanded version that came out in 1992

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So basically

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
You have to use your knowledge

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Of geography and clues

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
To chase down Carmen's henchmen

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Or henchwomen

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Because there were henchwomen

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Then eventually arrest Carmen herself

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So you'd have to go to the country

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
That the crime happened

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And then use hints about where to go next

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And you basically chase all over the world

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And some of the, there were some fun

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Jokes, you know there were definitely some puns

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Going about

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And some inaccuracies

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
For some of the pictures

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Like for example

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
When you go to Peru instead of

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Showing you a picture of Lima when you're there

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It actually shows you Machu Picchu

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
But at any rate

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
If you go to the incorrect location

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You get fake clues

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And you have to backtrack

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Until you can find which way

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The vile henchmen went to

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It's V-I-L-E

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And then your case will run

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Out of time

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And your culprit will escape

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And basically you're reporting to Interpol

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And everything

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
So eventually though if you do keep going

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Along the case you can basically

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Exclude all but one of the suspects

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And then you can

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Issue an arrest warrant which is actually really

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Inaccurate because

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I love some of the cheesy animations that were in the game

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Like you have a little burglar dancing across the screen right now

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's V-I-L-E henchmen

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
The arrest warrant thing

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Was actually super inaccurate because

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Interpol actually uses what's called red notices

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Which means that you have

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
The right to ask the local government

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
To arrest somebody instead of you

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Actually having an arrest warrant

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You have to go through the local governments

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Anyway, going back to the game world

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You can be promoted

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
If you answer different geography questions

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Right

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And you use the reference book that came with the program

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So it's really

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Edutainment

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
As far as some of the different locations

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
That are in the game

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
You had Buenos Aires

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You had Sydney

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
You had

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Bamako in Mali

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You had Tokyo

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You had

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Moscow

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
All kinds of places all over the world

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And there's something else

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
That really came along with this

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
There's been certain things

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Kept canon

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Through different versions of the game

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I think

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
It's been established that there are different universes

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
For the Carmen Sandiego franchise

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But there's one thing that's always

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Remained constant

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Is Carmen herself

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Her outfits have changed

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And they've changed her hair color like once

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But she's always been

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Latina

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And always

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Really strong and in control of the company

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And her vile group

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But the whole point of it was that

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
She was doing it for the challenge

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And not necessarily for any kind of

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Really overly malicious

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Purpose

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And the fact that she can keep all these people

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Under control

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Is a really tightly run, I'd say, organization

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's actually made her

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Kind of a role model

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
For young girls

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Even if, yeah, she's breaking the law

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
But still

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
There were, of course, many other games

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
In the series

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
We've had

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Multiple versions of

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
We've had the Treasures of Knowledge version

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
That came out in 2001

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And then

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
There were also

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Where in Time

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Is Carmen Sandiego

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
There were also various

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Other, there was Where in the USA

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Where in Space

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Junior Detective Where in America

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Has Passed

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Where in North Dakota, which was a prototype

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Where in Time is probably one of my favorites

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Because I was really good at it

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
There was Where in Europe

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Where in the USA

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Think Quick Challenge

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Great Chase Through Time World Detective

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Math Detective Treasures of Knowledge

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Secret of the Stolen Drums

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Uh, Mystéral Baud de Monde

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Wow, I didn't even know all these other ones

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Actually, you talking about the other versions

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I'm gonna use this opportunity to switch over

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
To some footage from the original

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Yeah

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Uh, there was also

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Um, the TV

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Show, which was Where in the World

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Where in Time, Where on Earth was an animation

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And Where in the Universe was a planetarium

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Show. There were also albums

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
That was Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And Out of This World

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So, uh, we've had

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Tons of, uh, different

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You know, pretty reputable, uh, publishers

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And distributors. We had PBS

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Uh, okay, I will

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Take anything with Fox

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
With a grain of salt, but it was Fox Family Channel

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And Fox Kids

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
But we've had, uh, BAM Entertainment

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Mindscape, uh, The Learning Company

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Broderbund, which was the original publisher

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Or developer, I should say

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Uh, just all kinds of, you know, really

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Good, I think, has come

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Out of, uh,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
You know, the franchise

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And, of course, you also worked for the

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
ACME Detective Agency

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
That worked worldwide

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
So

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But I'm trying to see

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Okay, ACME VILE

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Was, um, let's see if I can find what VILE

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Stood for, because that was the one

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Thing that's eluding me

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Um

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Okay, VILE was not an acronym

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It was just V-I-L-E

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But it didn't really

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It didn't really mean anything

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So that's probably why I didn't know what it meant

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
So, there you go

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And, of course, the leader of ACME is the chief

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Who was a sassy black lady

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
That didn't need no man

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
She was awesome

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
In the TV show, yes, which everybody in chat

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Talking about the TV show, dying for me to play the theme

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
But, well, you have to stay tuned

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
To the very end of the show

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
That's right, you just sit down and shut up and wait

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Maybe the same person who picks the classic game

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Also picks the fortune cookie

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But, yeah, that's

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Maybe in China, according to this player right now

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Who knows, so there it is, your classic game of the week

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Great series

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
One of the all-time best

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Vegetainment games from my youth

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
You've got Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Number Munchers

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Oregon Trail, that's about it

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Those are the huge ones from Oregon

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Oregon Trail

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Dungeon Buster says

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Do you think they retconned that in?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Through the Meaning has consistently been maintained

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Since 1985

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Well, see, I didn't realize that

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
It wasn't in any of my stuff

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
You learned something from our chat room today

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Well, I forgot anyway

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I haven't touched the game in like

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Probably since I was 11

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You know, Jamie, it's okay

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
It's okay to make mistakes

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You know what, I'm making the big W off

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The line because it's the whatevs

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Whatever

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Alright

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That is it for this

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Part of Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But don't go anywhere, you guys

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Break, we're going to talk to

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000

When we come back, right after this

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Live on this

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
April the 6th of 2014

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
With episode number 547 of our show

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And if

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I don't know, if

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Game of Swords or whatever's done

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And Rasslin' is done and all that stuff

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Is it Chair of Swords?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
By the way, Honest Game Trailer

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Or Honest Trailers, whatever

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Finally did a

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Chair of Swords one

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I like the compilation of

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
All the death scenes

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Featuring the most uncomfortable chair ever

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But anyway, all that stuff

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
All that is hopefully wrapping up

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
By now so some of you guys might be joining us

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Just after that

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Well you missed some chatter in the first

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
We were talking about April Fools Joke

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
The new Amazon Fire, Mario Kart 8

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So you're just going to have to

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Check this out on the podcast feed

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Which will be available

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Tomorrow morning

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Review, help spread the word about the show

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
We really appreciate it

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh Jason's telling me in chat, wrestling is not over

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Oh well

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I thought it was because people started showing up all of a sudden

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So I was like, oh maybe it's finished

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Fine, maybe it'll be done by the time phone calls start

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Alright

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
In the meantime, let's get some rapid fire

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
News

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Let's start with Loki

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Alright so this was a game I actually played

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
At least the second one in the series

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Metro

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
You may remember

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Well there was something that leaked

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Out that was apparently

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
An internal document from Deep Silver

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And it was showing

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
A title called Metro Redux

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Which is basically

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
A redo

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Or

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
An HDerfied

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
New version of those two games

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
For consoles for Playstation 4 and

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Xbox One

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
It was later confirmed

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Actually by 4A Games

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And Deep Silver

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
That it is a title that's in development

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And they're going to be sharing more

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
They say this side of E3

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Sometime before E3

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You'll find out more about it

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I don't know, I'd be excited about that

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Cause those games are pretty good

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Had really good storylines

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
The Grand Theft Auto 5

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
iFruit app

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Is now available on Vita

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
That was something that was released originally

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
On Windows Phone, iOS

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And Android

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
That was basically like a little fake

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
The iFruit is their

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Apple clone in the game

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And it had a bunch of different apps

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
On there for customizing your cars

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Customizing your license plates

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
And they even had a little Tamagotchi game

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
For Chop where you can kind of train

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And raise them

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Now you can do that if you have a Vita

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
That's kind of cool

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And it is free to download

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
It works with the Playstation 3 version of the game of course

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And last but not least

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The Call of Duty

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Ghost Devastation

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
DLC

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Is seriously Jump the Shark

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I gotta be honest

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I don't know what the fuck

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Other than having fun with the series

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Cool, that's awesome

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
But like

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
The stuff that they've done for Call of Duty

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Hasn't really made a lot of sense for ghosts

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
They have

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Basically the ability

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
To play as the predator in one of the maps

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And what they've done

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Kind of with

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Call of Duty Ghost is each map has its own

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Kind of like

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Basically it's like a killstreak that you get

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's exclusive to that map

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And one of them in this case is actually

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Playing as the predator

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And I think one of the other maps

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I think it was Ghost

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I don't think it was Black Ops 2

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
But Ghost had it

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I want to say where there was a map where you could play as Michael Myers

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
From Halloween

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
What do you mean William Shatner?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
So

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It's just

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I don't know, cool

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
They're having fun with it

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
People enjoy that kind of thing, that's cool

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
That actually launched last week

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
On Xbox One

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Xbox 360

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
The

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 versions

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I'm assuming are coming later on

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Oh and PC later on as well

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Xbox gets that exclusive window

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Alright well

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Moving on to a short

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Window of time for you to get tickets

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
For the Dota 2

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
International 2014

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
The Dota 2 International

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Championship for 2014

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Is taking place at the Key Arena in Seattle

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
It will be taking place from

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
July 18th to July 21st

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And if you wanted to go

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Well guess what, you're already out of luck

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Because the tickets sold out in an hour

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
So you had one hour window to catch that

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
10,000 tickets sold within an hour

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
So Dota 2

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
It's kind of popular there

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
So you can check that out in Seattle

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Huh? A bit

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Yeah you can check that out in Seattle at the Key Arena

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You can get your tickets on eBay

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
To go see that

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
The Key Arena, that's where the

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Supersonics used to play

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
But sadly Seattle doesn't have a team anymore

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And they were unsuccessful in taking ours

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So Key Arena, at least still able to have

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
These big events such as the Dota 2 International

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You can try to find the tickets on eBay

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
If you really want to go

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But I'm sure they'll sell the whole viewing passes

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Online and all that good stuff

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Blizzard

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Taking Hearthstone

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Finally to the iPad

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
They've been talking about doing this for a little bit

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
When they first announced the game

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And now that the game is live

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
It's time to start the 18 month beta process

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
That Blizzard will go through

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I'm exaggerating here

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
But with Hearthstone on the iPad

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But here's the catch, you can only download this

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
In Australia, Canada, and New Zealand

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Those are the only places where Hearthstone

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Is actually available on the store

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But some of you crafty people have figured out

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
How you make an account in another country

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
You can download the game to your device anyway

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
There's quite a few people that are doing that

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So there's all these walkthroughs out there

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It doesn't involve anything about having iTunes cards

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
For those countries, does it?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I don't think so

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I know that's the way that they do it for music

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
But don't quote me

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I don't care enough about Hearthstone

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
To go to the Canadian store and make a fake account

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And download it

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Neither do I, but

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
But with like a review, a review would be nice

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Well I reviewed it on the PC

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I mean hearing more from our listeners

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
In those countries, we would like reviews from them

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Oh sure, of course, of course

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I'd like to hear if you thought it was as mediocre as I did

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
There you go

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Hearthstone on the iPad

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I know there's some fans out there

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
That are gonna be angry at me for saying that

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But you know, I got my opinion

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
You got yours, email us if you want

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Participate at orangeslawnsradio.com

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Lastly, this was news

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
This is actually old news

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But it slipped under our radar

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So I need to bring this up

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Because this news came out the week that we had the short show

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Because I was moving

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So this completely was not on our radar

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But it was brought to my attention this week

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
That there is a Gauntlet reboot happening

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And there's a trailer out there now

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And you can actually check this out

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Maybe I'll play a little bit of this here in studio

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I don't remember

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
If there's narration or what have you

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
But just for Dark Soccer's sake

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
You can see there it's coming from WB Games

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
It better have the music

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I don't think it does have the original music

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Crying

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But you can see there it's very Diablo-esque in how it looks

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
So it looks like it's taking elements of Gauntlet

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
And mixing it with Diablo

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Okay

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
So that's what the new Gauntlet looks like

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And luckily they still call them

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
They try to give them names and all this stuff

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
This is Bob the Elf

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
We have Gertrude the Valkyrie

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
They're saying it is a completely modernized action RPG

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It's going to be direct to digital

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
WB Games vault

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Which means you're pretty much only going to be able to get it

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
On the Steam

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And those types of places

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
What is interesting about this though

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It's being made by Arrowhead as I mentioned

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
You may not know their other game

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But it's Magica

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Magica was cute

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah Magica was a huge game

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And it was pretty cool

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And the Tron Robes

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Yeah the Tron Robes and all that stuff

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So those are the people we can Gauntlet

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
So that's pretty exciting there

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
So there you go

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Gauntlet is being remade

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And supposedly out this summer

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
On digital platforms

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Which means the price should be right as well

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
We'll see

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Okay

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So yeah

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
As Loki said during the last part

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Disney's Magical World 3DS

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Is supposed to be coming out

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
But there is a

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
It's supposed to be an exclusive

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
The 3DS XL that goes with it

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Is an exclusive for Walmart

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
And I don't care enough to go to Walmart to get it

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
But there will also be coming out

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
There's the Mickey 3DS XL

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
There's also a Peach Pink Nintendo 2DS

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That's an exclusive for GameStop

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
That will be coming out to celebrate

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Disney's Magical World launch

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
The game will be out on April 11th

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
And you know my birthday is this month

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Just saying people

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Also there are Australian ratings out for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
F-Zero GP Legend

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I'm starting to get tongue tied

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And those are listed for the Wii U's Gameboy Advance store

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So we should be seeing those probably before too long

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And then last but not least

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
There is a statement from the Sonic Lost World producer

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Who wants to do more Nintendo DLC

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
That's Iizuka Takashi

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Who created Sonic Lost World

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Basically wants to do more levels

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Working with Nintendo

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
But that could be for Zelda or Yoshi levels

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It could use other Nintendo IPs

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
But it is just different things that they want to do

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Going out for Sonic Lost World

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And that's it

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Alright

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
That Sonic Lost World DLC sure looked interesting

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I didn't believe

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I thought it was like an April Fools Joker

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I didn't believe it was a thing until I actually was

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Seeing the screenshots and the videos in motion

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I was like wow

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I didn't think they were going to go that far with it

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But that's kind of neat

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Alright

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Every week we ask a question on our Facebook

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
And our Google Plus communities

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
You slam those words together and you get

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Foogle

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Let's get to the question

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Which has to do with that new fangled Amazon fire

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
We were talking about earlier

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
When we posted to our communities

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
A new challenger approaches

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
The long rumors

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Of Amazon jumping into the

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Gaming arena proved true this week

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
With the announcement of the Amazon fire

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
What did you think of the announcement?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Do you think the Amazon fire will impact gaming?

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And more importantly, are you getting one?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Let's get to some of the answers

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Our buddy Shane answered

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Shane Alinko answered

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And said is this not the Ouya 2.0

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
But maybe done better?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I have faith that Amazon will support it

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But I don't think it's going to be huge competition

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Let's get to the main three

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
No desire to get one because of that

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Critical Myth

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
The man behind tv.vognetwork.com

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
With his crew over at the Critical Myth show

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Says it's a bit closer

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
To what the Ouya claimed it would be

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But I still don't see a need for it

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Those already using the Amazon

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Fire services might feel differently

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Brett the Hayes says

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I like the idea that someone like Amazon

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Is trying this out despite their efforts

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
With the not so warm reception of the Fire tablets

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Since they have somewhat of an ecosystem

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
In place already

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I don't think they'll do anything for hardcore gaming

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Except maybe push Sony to bring Vita TV

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
To the US

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It is interesting that one Amazon

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Exec was making a distinction that this device

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Is not a gaming device

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
And probably shows their fear of ending up like

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Ouya and probably why they're marketing

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
The Fire TV as a set-top box

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
First

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Blood Drunk says

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Never really had any interest in those TV boxes

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
The announcement of Fire TV doesn't really change that

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I still think that having a laptop

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And desktop plugged in with wireless keyboard and mouse

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Is the way to go

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
More power and diversity

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Burr replied and said

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I think it has the best chance of making an Android

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
A credible console platform

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But in the end it's stuck in a hard place

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Where anything with wide enough appeal would probably play just as well

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
On a tablet or smartphone

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And anything that would get the hardcore gamer's attention

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Would have to compete with more established platforms

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Felipe A. replied

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I hope I said your name right

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Fire TV will be a great boost

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
To the local economies it is marketed in

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The amount of jobs created to dispose of them

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Will open up new positions in the waste management sector

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Not since the plastic guitars from Guitar Hero

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Or the Ouya

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Has a sizable increase in landfill size

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Been needed

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Anyone here owning a Zune or a Gizmondo

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Knows

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Well where things like this end up

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Welcome to your new home Fire TV

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
That was a sassy answer

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I don't think it's gonna go anywhere

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
He's saying it's going to the dump

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Going with your game.com

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
What the hell were those tacos

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Hey for the record we gave our game comms away

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
What were the taco phones called

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The Nokia

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
The Engage

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
We gave those away too and I think we sold one

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
It's because they didn't have Patrick Stewart as a pitchman

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
For that you know that's why that didn't end up working out

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Engage

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Alright

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Nemesis 47 replies and said

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Though this has potential it's not going to be enough

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
To beat the big three as far as gaming

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And will be the next Ouya

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I don't got any intention of buying the system

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I'll stick to my PlayStation 3

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Tech 2030 says

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I think this will have a better chance of being a third

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Console than something like Ouya or GameStick

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Considering it has great

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Video streaming functionality

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Our pal Tiara replies

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
And she says this will be the Philips

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
CDI of a new generation

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Ouch

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And Tigerclaw says

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It could do better than the Ouya

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
If the processing power is better

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Which we know it's going to be so

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
We'll see

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Going over to Google Plus I don't want to ignore our

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Pals over there on Google Plus

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Again you can follow us on Google Plus

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
If you just go to

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Google.com

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Slash plus orange lounge radio

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
We didn't get a single answer on Google Plus

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Hey Rob

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Confirmed you guys

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
No one's using Google Plus

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I was just thinking if we're calling it Fugal

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Would the opposite be Goobook

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We could call it Goobook I don't know

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Is that, it's a little

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
That's a little bit more even between Google and

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Facebook

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
But yeah not a single answer on our Google

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Where's actdeft and Flaco Jones

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Redertainment the guys that usually answer over there

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
They're eating a pizza

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You're all watching Wrestlemania

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Everyone's talking about trying to compete with

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Home consoles it's not

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It's trying to be a set top box

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It's trying to push Amazon shit

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
That they have on Android

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
And their services like their video streaming services

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
That's all it is

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
That being said though

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It's going to be way fucking better than the Ouya

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And I think they've already said

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
That they're probably going to get the

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Was it the

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Ouya the run on it anyway

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
So

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You know

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
What's interesting and I think very telling

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
About those answers I don't think a single person in there

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Said they're getting one

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Not a single one I mean granted

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Us gamers were not the target audience

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I suppose but I don't know

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Well like I wouldn't get it for any of the games that they have

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
On there cause like you know

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Had it come out like several years ago

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Before Minecraft

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Was on consoles then that would have been like

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Oh yeah I can play Minecraft on my

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
TV now but now it's just like

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Eh whatever

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Alright

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Well let's move on with some more news

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Low key

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So there's a survey sent out

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
About the Playstation 4 and mainly

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
The Playstation network services and stuff

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And there's some stuff that they were asking about

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
That

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Kind of leads people to believe that

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
They're going to be doing a reputation system

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Kind of like what they have on the Xbox One

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Which I think is a great idea

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Basically saying the system would assign

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Users reputation ratings

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Based on feedback from fellow players

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And mentions

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I guess an improved matchmaking system

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Also they were saying that

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
It was going to take reputation into

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Considerational appearance so basically

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
What I want to see is

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I want to see

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Amazon style reviews

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
For players like on your profile

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
This player

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Sucks one star

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
No that sounds like it would be horrible

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I can't even imagine

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Oh my gosh

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
You'd have the people that found it helpful

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
People that didn't find it helpful

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
You know

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
A metacritic score maybe

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Can you imagine what your profile would say

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
This guy is so angry and he kicked my ass

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
At grand theft auto 5

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I don't talk on my headset really

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
No because I'm in the room with

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Yes if my co-workers

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Were playing with me

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
They would probably fill me out

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And say quite negative things about me

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
They always say I'm hacking

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Even though

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I can play any

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
We've switched consoles so many times now

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
It's like oh he's hacking

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Fine I'll beat you on your console

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I'll play on yours you play on mine

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Oh he's just hacking that one now too

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
People

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Alright

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Let's go to

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Some more news

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
This is kind of interesting

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Where have your favorite franchises ended up?

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Going to

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Pachinko machines

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And the newest characters that will be coming

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
To Pachinko machines

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
What?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
These are Pachi's slot machines

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
That are headed for Japan

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Yeah SNK Playmore is using

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
The Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown names

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
To make these Japanese

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Slot machines which are I guess

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I've never played these but I guess it's kind of like Pachinko

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
They don't license anything

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I mean seriously remember when they were licensing

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
What was that I think

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I don't know if it was Samurai's Showdown

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Or King of Fighters or something

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
It was that Shmup game

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I think it was the King of Fighters Shmup game

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Well these series haven't had

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Games in a very very very long time

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
So Fatal Fury Premium

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Is one of the games

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And Samurai Spirits

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Because that's what it was always called overseas

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
There's actually trailers

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
For these I have not watched this yet

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I think I should what do you guys think should I watch this

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Trailer here? Alright let's take a look

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Let's do it where no one else can see it

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Well if you're watching OLR on YouTube

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
You can see the trailer here

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
What?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Wait wait wait wait wait wait stop

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I'm stopping? Okay stop

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Pause

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Black Wolf just said RIP Mickey Rooney

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Did Mickey Rooney die?

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I thought

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Didn't he die a long time ago?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
No?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Oh

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Hold on

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Okay play it I'm gonna look this up

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
You stopped that trailer just to say

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
That a celebrity had passed away?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Dude it's fucking Mickey Rooney

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Yeah I know but I kind of thought he was already dead

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
No offense I mean

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You also thought Shirley Temple was dead

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I did think she was dead

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Girl

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
There's a lot of people I think are dead

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Speaking of dead let's go back to the franchise

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
For these uh

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
For these series

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Let's go back to the trailer for these franchises that are super dead

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Uh oh yeah TMZ reporting that Mickey Rooney died

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
That's what everybody's saying in the chat

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Well

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Sad

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
When was the last time Mickey Rooney was out in public?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Well he was in a night at the museum and

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Alright anyhow here it is

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Uh going to back to the trailer

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Oh man this is so rude because when you see this

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You're like oh man it's gonna be a new game

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
But you see all the characters

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
It's got the rock music and all this stuff

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
You're like oh my god

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Geese Howard

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
So like yeah you're like thinking new game

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
And then it's

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I just love the little power ballad playing in the back

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Yeah next gen fighting game

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I know right

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Doesn't it look like oh my god it's gonna be a next gen Fatal Fury

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I'm so fucking excited and then it's like

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Oh wait but he's in a casino

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
What's he doing in a casino

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I wanna see how long into this trailer it takes

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Before it's given away that it's a slot machine

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Oh not until the end I'm guessing

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Oh that's so rude

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Boom

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Yeah we're already like three quarters of the way through the trailer

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I will be willing but yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Do we get to see some balls?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Cause you know Pachinko

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Do we get to see some balls?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Cause you know Pachinko

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Cause you know Pachinko

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It's Pachinko

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
And yeah next level

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
There it is

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
They show one little machine

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
What a troll

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Jerks

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Alright Dark Sakura

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Do you have some better news for us?

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
John Panette died too

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
He's funny

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Is everybody dying today? What's going on with that?

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Well you know Game of Thrones was on

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
It's become self aware

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
It's killing people outside of the show now

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Bye

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Bye everybody

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
What do you have for us?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I have growling

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Well speaking of things that I guess

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I'm not even gonna go there

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I'm not gonna say things that are dead

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Things that are gonna be dug up years from now?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I...

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Come on you were thinking it

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Literally cannot even

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Oh what was the joke?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Things in the ground? Was that the joke?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Things that should stay dead

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Listen

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That's not fair

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
They're not buried yet

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I'm sorry

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Are you guys done?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I'm waiting to hear about these cartridges

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's all I'm talking about

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
These were cartridges

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
You just spoiled the story Mr. Spoilerbutt

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I didn't say none

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Mr. I'm gonna spoil the Hunger Games for Jamie

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Earlier even though I asked you to

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Whatever

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
It's true

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Good to know that my powers of deduction

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Are accurate

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Anyway, so remember that group that was trying to dig up ET?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Okay sorry

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Oh my god they're digging up Elizabeth Taylor?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Elizabeth Taylor?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
God she just died

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
She didn't just die

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
That's so rude

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Oh you mean the game ET

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
The Atari 2600 version of ET

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
There was a group that was gonna film

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
A documentary about trying to

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Dig it up out of the dump in New Mexico

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And they got

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
The

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
OKs from the NMEB

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Environmental Protection Division of Solid Waste Bureau

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
They approved

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
A waste evacuation

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And it was submitted by

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Xbox Entertainment Studios

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Who is going to apparently

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I guess be publishing this documentary

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And filming it

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
So we have efforts from Lightbox Entertainment

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And Xbox Entertainment

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
To let the dig happen

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
This is gonna be about as

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
You know as

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Okay did anyone remember

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Anybody remember

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
When Geraldo

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Tried to go into Al Capone's

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Vault or whatever the fuck it was

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
This is gonna end up just like that you know what's gonna be in there

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Nothing

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
They're gonna find shit

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
They will actually find shit

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Now it would be funny though if they actually find like

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Neat relics from the 80s

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
That are broken

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
No it's gonna be nothing

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
They might find like some like decomposed

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Cabbage patch kids and like maybe a speaking

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Spell that still works in there somewhere

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I suppose Cabbage Patch Kid be

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
A garbage pail kid at that point

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Might possibly be

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
For the record

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Bobby I'm not watching the movies

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Yet I'm reading the books

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
But when you do watch the movies

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Bobby will be quick to point out that the second one

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Catching Fire the Capitol

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Is one of the Dragon Con hotels

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And it really is

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
It's pretty awesome to be in there and be like

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Oh I'm at the Capitol

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
At any rate I'm reading the books first

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Alright fair enough fair enough

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So you could be let down by the movies

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
No I'm just kidding the movies are great

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Loki what politically incorrect thing do you have for us next

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Well let's see

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I've got basically

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Just

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Wolfenstein

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
You know they have that Doom beta planned

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
For just PlayStation 4, Xbox One

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And PC and I remember

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Correctly and I wanted to say I looked it up

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But then I saw something shiny and I

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Forgot to look it up but I want to say that

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
That whole Doom beta thing is actually

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
On all the box art for

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
All the games

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
So that's kind of a little misleading if you think about it

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
That they're only doing the beta for

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
You know select versions of the game

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
But

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
They're going to feature it on the box

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Yep there it is Xbox 360 preorder

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
For Doom beta access

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Asterix

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
These certain systems here

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
I guess it could be very far out

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
You'd expect that you're going to have a

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Brand new console

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I'm willing to bet that the next Doom game

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Is only going to be

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
For the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Which is probably why the beta is not on the current gen

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I don't see why it wouldn't be

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I think the current gen

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Stuff is starting to sunset a little bit

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I'm sorry last gen at this point

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Well yeah

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
We're kind of in between now so yeah

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I think the 360 PlayStation 3 era

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You're starting to see the sunset on it

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I think we still have some big games this year

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I mean we still know that the Kingdom Hearts 2

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Remake is happening at some point

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
That was announced before

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
There's some other little things here and there

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
That will probably take us into 2015

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I think especially by next holiday

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Will be like the last

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Stuff you see on those consoles

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And even this holiday it's going to start

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
To thin out because they want you to buy the new stuff

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
So that's where all the games are

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
And I'm sure the Doom game is only on those consoles

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So yeah I think that's why they have it

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
They figure between now and whenever

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
That beta comes out

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Because that could either be the end of this year or next year

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Who knows

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
A lot of people will have

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Another console by then

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Alright well speaking of

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Betas and things that ended up launching

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
On the current

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
No actually it's on your current PCs

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And it will be on the next gen hardware

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Soon enough

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Scrolls Online was released

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
On the PC this week

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
And they had some hiccups going into

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The launch but the game is now out

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And kind of the

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Resounding

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
There's some people that are really into it

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
That are really enjoying it

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
But I'm hearing a lot of resounding feedback

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And this has been true on Horde House leading up to the show too

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
That

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Why are we paying for this?

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
That it's not

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Able to compete with some of the other pay MMOs right now

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Now I don't know

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I kind of think that's the way

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
All these games tend to be when they announce a pay subscription

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
You know Final Fantasy 14

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Has a subscription right now

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
World of Warcraft still has a subscription right now

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
That's how these games kind of go

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I think Elder Scrolls will be able to ride it out for a little bit

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
But it's all about can they

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Bring the players in

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
And can they catch that buzz wave

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Right now there's been a lot of people that have tried it

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
That have been like meh

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I'd rather just play Skyrim

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
When they first announced

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I was like oh yeah Skyrim

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But it's going to be online and stuff

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
That's going to be awesome

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
And then it was just kind of from there

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Just kind of a downward slope

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
The more and more I saw about the game

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
The less and less interested I was in the game

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And then I played the beta and I was like nope

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And why was that?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Why were you turned off?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
It just wasn't engaging

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
It was very

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I don't know it just didn't feel like Elder Scrolls to me

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I was just trying to shoehorn Elder Scrolls into an MMO

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I just didn't like it

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Also another big pet peeve

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It didn't support controllers

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Well I think it's going to have to if they put it out on Playstation 4

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Well yeah

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
But it just wasn't very interesting

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Once again I

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Don't want to pay for an MMO

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Because I just don't

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
The amount of time I get to play that kind of stuff

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Is just very mixed

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
So I just can't dedicate $15

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
A month to something that I probably

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You know I may not play that month

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat room

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Elder Scrolls Online should have spent a bit more time

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
In beta from what I've read

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Some bugs and broken quests I've seen in the beta

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Were still issues

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Uh oh, that's not good

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
So there it is Elder Scrolls

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Is out, you know if you feel

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Differently if you're really enjoying the game let us know

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
You know I gotta be honest I haven't really played it

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
But I don't really

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
There's no demo right now or there's no way to like

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Download it and play free to level 10

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Or anything like that because it's new

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I assume that'll happen in the coming months or there'll be the Playstation 4 beta

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
So I'll check it out at that point

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
But for now I just don't see the reason

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I'm juggling Final Fantasy 14

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I know I'm going to get sucked back into World of Warcraft

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
When Warlords of Draenor comes out

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
There's still Diablo 3

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
In the interim which technically isn't an MMO

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
But close enough

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I just don't got time for it

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And nobody got time for that Elder Scrolls

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I think people want the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
But with

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Some way to play co-op or something

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I think people want Elder Scrolls 6

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Is what they really want

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
If the next Elder Scrolls game comes out

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
If Elder Scrolls 6 comes out and it has

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Like 4 player co-op or even 2 player co-op

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I think that people are just not going to care

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Well Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be announced for a while

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
You're still going to have Fallout 4

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Yeah Fallout's next

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Or Doom I guess

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Alright well let's go

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Go to the mailbag

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Every week you guys send us emails

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Sometimes we have wrong opinions on things

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
And you want to set us on the right path

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
So you can do that

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000

Is the place where you can participate with the show

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Again our email address participate at orangelaungeradio.com

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Darsakra dives into the mailbag head first

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And pulls out

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
She finds Carmen Sandiego in there

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Yeah she's hiding right there

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
But I'm busy talking about food with Ikuma-san

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Well you're going to have to take a break

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And we're going to be sharing our emails with our listeners

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com right now

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Alright well first email

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Comes from

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I'm going to say Jonathan

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Because that's all I get

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Hey OLR crew

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
My only problem with Oculus Rift

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Is that Kickstarter is for

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Indies that can't get a company to fund them

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Let be real

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Oculus Rift could

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Have been funded from the start

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I think the typing on here

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Why are the little Kickstarter

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Pledgers money not worth any returns

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
In the end it's the backers fault though

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Thanks Jonathan

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I kind of think Oculus did try to get

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
The other type of funding in the start

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
But people laughed at it because we all laughed at the

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Virtual reality stuff in the 90's

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
You know the lawn mower man

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Came and went

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Kickstarter was how this thing got funded

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And I think it did

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I mean if you look at Facebook

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Buying them for 2 billion dollars

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
This investment was successful

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The only problem is it's Kickstarter

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
You don't own any equity in it

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
If you don't like that don't

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Kickstart companies

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
They got a return

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
They got a dev kit win

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
That's true

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You get whatever prize you pledge for

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Or perk

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So this one comes from Robert M

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I was going to ask this in chat last week

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
But was out late so are you worried

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
That the negative reaction to the Facebook

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Acquisition of Oculus may be a

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Self-fulfilling prophecy

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
When Zynga bought the developer of Draw Something

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Those hating the publisher for valid

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Reasons and those joining the outcry

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Stopped supporting the game

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Seeing less for the profit than forecast

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Zynga closed down OMG Pop

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Detractors told you so

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
This view may be over simplistic

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
And perhaps come across as apologetic

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
But could a similar relatively unwarranted

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Exodus endanger the rift

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Sorry if Bobby Black Wolf has already covered this

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
This is from Robert M

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
What was the question in there?

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Okay if

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
If Facebook purchasing

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Oculus

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And people saying well I'm not going to support

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
This and stop adding their support to it

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Is going to make it fail

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
The way that when Zynga

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Acquired Draw Something

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Ah sort of

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Like is the

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Internet damming it without

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Necessarily giving it a chance

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Exactly I have a feeling

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
And here's something to keep in mind

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Facebook

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Wants to target non-gamers

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
As well

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And that's a huge wild card

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But when you look at

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
What Zuckerberg said about the Oculus Rift

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And the big plan for it

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
I mean games are in there too don't get me wrong

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
But he

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I don't want to put words in his mouth

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But I get the sense that they don't need

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
To be successful

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Not really

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
There's plenty of other applications for the technology

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
But um

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I think also the proof is in the pudding

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I would bet

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I would bet money

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Because this is the internet and this is gaming culture

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I would bet a large sum of money

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That at least 75%

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
If not more

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Of the people bitching about Oculus Rift

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And how they're never going to play one

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Never have

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Or never intended to anyway

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Or never intended to anyway

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Or there's also this let's go back to NPR's

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Little prank never bothered to read

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Anything about the acquisition either

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Or still will buy it when it comes out

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
So I think

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
There I mean

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
The comparison to draw

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Something and Zynga is interesting

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
But I think we have to remember

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
That iPhone games especially

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Tend to be very flash in the pan

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And you know it's popular

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
One week you're in, one week you're out

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
You know

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
One week you're

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Threes

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Then your 2048

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Goes out for free

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And kind of bites into those sales

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I mean that's the nature of the iPhone

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Gaming the very volatile free

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And 99 cent market

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Well I would like to read what Bobby said in chat

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Please

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Zuckerberg said Oculus will do the game stuff first

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And then he'd use the Facebook power to do

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
The non-game stuff

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
It basically lets the Oculus concentrate on gaming

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
And further said most of the Reddit

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Most of the Reddit bitching

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Were from people who never posted on the

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Oculus subreddit before

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
They all left and it's back to normal now

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
But I mean it goes back to the people

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Just wanting something to bitch about and not actually

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Doing any research on it

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Basically like a conversation with my mom

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Well that's interesting though

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
That they are still going to focus on gaming first

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Okay so I'm corrected a little bit there

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But I still think the point stands that they are

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Looking at doing more than

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Just gaming

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And you know what? At the end of the day

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
If gaming doesn't end up making

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Them money

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
But premium events

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Using the Oculus Rift to be able to attend

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Premium events live and selling it as an

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Entertainment device if that works for them

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Then guess where they're going to end up focusing

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
When I was a teenager

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
A young teenager

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
We used to pay for pay per views

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
So that we could watch new kids on the block concerts

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
You know I think there's a lot of people

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Out there who bought a pay per view this evening

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Yes they did

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I wonder

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
How many people would be interested in watching an event

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Like Wrestlemania on the Oculus Rift

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Good for thought

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
At any rate

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
The next email actually has something to do with

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
The wrestling

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
It says Oculus idea

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Dearest peoples

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
As you were talking about the possible future of

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Facebook infused Oculus Rift

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I had an idea as to what the future could be

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
It's not video games, it's a different experience entirely

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
As you read this

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Wrestlemania

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
30 is streaming live

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
On the WWE network

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
WWE's exclusive online platform

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Is not the only place where live events

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Are streamed

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I watched Nine Inch Nails perform live at Lollapalooza

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Via YouTube

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
WWE has streamed their pre-shows on Facebook

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
For over a year now and you can watch UFC PPV

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Events live on Ustream

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
What is the next experience?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Imagine if you could be in a crowd during a concert

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
And by this I don't mean the broadcast slash concert

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Film experience you get now

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I mean actually being in the crowd for a concert

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Or a sporting event

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
This is what I think could be done with the

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Facebook infused Oculus Rift

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Selling concert tickets for people

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
To be able to see live events

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
From the comfort of their own home

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
If you could see something live

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And where I say the Rolling Stones last tour

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Or the upcoming Monty Python performances

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Or a concert from a performer

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Who thinks your city is too small to perform in

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I'm looking at you Kanye

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
You could bet people

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Would buy tickets to see that event

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Also you could sell different tickets

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
In different parts of the arena enabling the corporation

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Providing the event to make more money

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Off the live stream than the one size fits all

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Approach they get now

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
That makes the experience appealing for consumers

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And way profitable for corporations

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Yay!

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Stay black entertainment

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
This message has been brought to you by Tacos

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
You know one idea

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
That pops in my mind too

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Is that sometimes you have those one night

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Only shows somewhere in the world

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
That maybe doesn't necessarily

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Tour or anything like that

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Right now maybe get a Blu Ray

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Or a movie out of it

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
But imagine being able to be there live for the experience

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
One thing that pops into my mind

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
When he passed away he was prepping to do those shows

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
At the London O2 arena or whatever

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
He was going to do a bunch of shows

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And then this is it right

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I'm done no more

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
He's going to retire just like Cher

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
But that was supposed to be it

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
If I could turn back time

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
There would have been a lot of people

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
That would have paid to see that

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
There's a problem

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
With this

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
There's a big problem with this one

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Is that to make it work

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
In that type of area

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
You would have to have multiple rendering cameras

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Open at all times

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
That would be unobstructed by

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
The other concert goers

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
You could do it

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
The issue being

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Is that they would all have to still

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Re-render that data

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Into the oculus

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Including the ground, including the ceiling

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
The various sides

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And make it look seamless and also

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Not cause someone to have a seizure

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
He's not there yet but I bet it will be Sunday

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Well they had even back on PlayStation

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I want to say it's PlayStation 2

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
They had something with Britney Spears

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Where it was an interactive video

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
That you could change the view on it

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
You could actually rotate the camera around

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Was that Britney's dance beat?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
No it was actually a video

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I think it was Britney Spears

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
It may have been some other group

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
But there was somebody

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Those are filled with a special type of panoramic camera

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I'm sure they could come out with something

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Get two panoramic cameras

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That's ten years ago at this point

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
What's going to be ten years from now?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I don't care what it's called, I'm not getting one

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
And I was

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Reading emails

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
So whatever

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Everyone else is calling

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Bobby's huffy because he didn't get

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Any emails about the oculus

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And I'm not the one calling it anything

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Oculus is the company

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I know that

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Don't mansplain shit to me

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Do we have more emails on

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Yes we got one more

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
On the Oculus Rift, hopefully

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I don't know, I really don't care if it is

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Hi guys and gal, thank you

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Thank you for being

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Equal opportunity in your greeting

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Greetings from your other Mexican

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Listener, Dr. Noir

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
From Quito

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Is it Quito? Is that how it's pronounced?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
In Ecuador

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I just want to recommend a delightful platformer

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Called Sortigo

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I have hours on my android phone

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
All for the price of free

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
And there's a link to it at the Google store

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
It reminds me of classic Mega Man and Metroid

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Because of the platforming and ability acquisition

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
With a nod to Zelda and the gameplay and currency

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Gems that spawn from mowed plants

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
It is exactly the kind of game

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I want to see more of even though I can't

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
For the love of all understand

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
For the love of all understand how they're making money

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Hope you like it, adios amigos

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Well sadly I am

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Not an android phone user

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
So I can't check out this game myself

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Did they pay you to send this email?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
No, I'm okay with it

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Because this guy's emailed us plenty of times

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Before I know he's a good guy so I trust his recommendation

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
But I kind of laughed

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Because I was like, is this a paid email?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So what was the name of the game again?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Sortigo

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Sortigo, Dr. Noir approved

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Yes

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Oh Bobby okay I forgive you for not trying to mansplain

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Alright

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Alright

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Is that it for the emails?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Do you know I had to actually tell somebody what mansplaining was?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Well I don't think that's what Bobby was doing at all

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Well no I know that's not what Bobby was doing

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I was poking back

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I wasn't over

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Good lord can I not tell a remote teasing

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Giving someone shit when I get shit in return?

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I suppose

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I'm allowed to give shit

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
I'm human

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And humans shit

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Can I make another joke about Makeruini dying?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
This is your house

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So I can't kick you out

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000
No I actually had to explain to somebody what mansplaining was

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
It was very sad

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Well what if a listener doesn't know

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
You might as well explain it

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
It's when a man's trying to explain something to a woman

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
And talks down to her as if it's something she shouldn't know anything about

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Oh I got you

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
So that would be like me going like

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
You see that is an Xbox

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Behind you and that's what we use

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
To play video games

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Sit and spin

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Now would you like me to show you how to access the food network

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
On that?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Would you like for me to shove this so far

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Up your ass

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That you start tasting fingernails

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
And I was indicating with my middle finger

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Thank you

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Alright

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Oh hi bones you missed some

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Stuff

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Raginator says

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
If there's mansplaining there's probably

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Womansplaining too right?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Yes I would argue yes

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I'm gonna tell you

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
There is womansplaining yes there is

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
You tell me what you believe womansplaining is

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I'm gonna tell you what I believe it is

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
That's when the guy is completely

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Acting uninterested in what you're saying

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
And you're trying to explain something

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
As thoroughly as possible and he's completely

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Overlooking everything that you're saying

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And you come off being a nag

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Okay I believe that womansplaining

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Is when you know you are

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Hovering too much and you're being annoying

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
And you're around a woman so a woman

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Just starts talking about her period

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
So that you'll go away

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
That's womansplaining

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
No that's called defense mechanism

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
It's called

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
You know what I'm really sick of hearing you talk about football

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
So how about I tell you about

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
How once a month I you know

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
My vagina does this

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
And cramps are the

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Worst

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Not on the show

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
What have they done to you?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
What have they done to you?

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
We need the subscribers

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
We need more women

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
You know when I first looked at chat

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I thought it said manscaping

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And I was like well that's a whole other episode

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
That's after the womansplaining

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Moving on to the FUs

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Of the week

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
How appropriate it would be this time

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
To get to the FUs of the week

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Here is justice

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Here is punishment

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Here is

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
This is fucked up

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
FU to the movie theater

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
For being so fucking loud

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And this is sad

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I actually do like going to 3D movies

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
But it's like the way that

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
The Winter Soldier was filmed for its 3D

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Was just completely

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
My eyes ended up hurting and the theater was

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
So loud that I actually

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
My neck stiffened up

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And I had like a killer

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Headache you know before I came in

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
So um

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It was just that and then of course

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
You know getting bitched at because it put me in a bad mood

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
And therefore I was

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
You know saying hey my neck hurts

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Would you mind rubbing my neck?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Complaining

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Fine

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Soon

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yeah

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Happy in the cold

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
And finally getting four hours of sleep

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
You're so quiet this week I bet your

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Listers can probably barely hear you because you're just

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
It's taking all the energy out of you

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Compared to previous weeks

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I'm sorry I feel better

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Hey I made the death jokes so you know

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I've got the energy for that

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Uh I don't know

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
My FU of the week goes to

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Oh the fact that

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Our washer and dryer

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
That came with the house as is

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
That the landlord took great

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Care to mention that the washer and dryer

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Would be as is

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
We knew kind of in the back of our mind

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Oh yeah this means they're not going to last very long

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Well very long ended up being

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Three weeks and the dryer broke

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
So FU did the fact that I just dropped

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
$100

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Plus on

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
A new washer and dryer

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
It's pretty disgusting isn't it

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
It costs a lot of money to keep your clothes

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Smelling spring fresh

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I'll tell you I'm going to pass on

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
A little bit of advice to everybody

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
That when you go to buy

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
A new washer and dryer or fridge

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Or another appliance look at the returns

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Because typically returns are for

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Cosmetic damage and it's

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Like for a fridge if the side of it is dented

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Who's going to look at the fucking side of the fridge

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
It's usually shoved in an alcove or

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
In between something

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Our washer and dryer had a big dent in it

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Now our washer and dryer

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Were $500 and $600 each

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
We got $300 knocked down off the price of each of them

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Nice

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I'll say it at Best Buy

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
But because we had damaged returns

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
We went there first

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And I'll say it

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
And nobody was around to help

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
So we went somewhere else where we ended up dropping

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
A large sum of money

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
You know what? Write them

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Give them feedback

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Oh really?

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
I'm all for coupons

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Oh we're sorry we lost your business

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Thanks for letting us know

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
By the way

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Now the FUs of the week are done

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I have to read this hilarious comment from AkumaJP

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Although DarkSaga's not going to like it

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
But I love AkumaJP's idea of woman-splaining

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Did you get that?

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Did you hear me? Are you listening?

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
That's my mother

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I countered with

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I don't woman-splain, I bitch

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Bitch please

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I give disapproving looks

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Including the ADS

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
The absolute death stare

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Which thankfully

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
You've never received the absolute death stare

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
My husband has lots though

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Alright

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Just a few more stories for you guys

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And then we're going to open up the skype line

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
If you want a man-splain

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Or a woman-splain

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Or they-splain

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Whatever you are-splain

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Tell us what you're thinking

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
In gaming culture this week

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
But first, a story from Loki

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Sadly

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
We don't have great news

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
But apparently the producer

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Or music producer of Rhythm Heaven

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
He has cancer

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Unfortunately

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
It was

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Was it

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Sunku I guess

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Is that guy's name?

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
He has been diagnosed with

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Laryngeal

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
cancer

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
So throat cancer

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
And of course

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Being a singer

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
That's not great news either

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
It's like hey you have cancer

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Oh hey you can't sing anymore

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
So hopefully

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Hopefully he's able to beat that

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Because that sucks

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Yeah

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Our thoughts go out definitely

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Play some Rhythm Heaven this week

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Well I mean he's still

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
He's just diagnosed he hasn't passed away or anything

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
So he's still fighting it but

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Our thoughts definitely go out to him

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And we'll play some Rhythm Heaven this week

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Alright going over to one story

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
That is sad

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
And I know I was

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Cracking some jokes about Mickey Rooney earlier

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
But look Mickey Rooney was in his 90's

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
It's very tragic to report on

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Somebody who died in their 40's

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And that's unfortunately what happened this week

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Masuda passed away at the age of 48

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Now you may not

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Recognize that name but Masuda

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Actually designed the game

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Pro Wrestling by himself

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
This ties into WrestleMania tonight folks

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Pro Wrestling by himself with another

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Developer doing the game's graphics

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
This was all released for the Famicom

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
In 1986

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Which ended up being released for the NES

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
You remember the old school Pro Wrestling

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Like before WrestleMania and the licensed stuff

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
There was the original Pro Wrestling game

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
That was by this guy Masato Masuda

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
He also created the series

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Fire Pro Wrestling

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
So yeah very sad to hear about this

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
But then you hear he's 48

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Now do the math you guys

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
This Pro Wrestling

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
The original came out in 1986

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
That means when he made this game

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
He was like 19 or 20

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
And it just makes you go

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Wow what was I doing at 19 or 20

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Moving to California

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Right or just you know

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Like I wasn't doing this kind of stuff

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
But then you know this guy went and made

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
You know a real classic video game

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Was making video games at least he accomplished a lot

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So rest in peace

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Masato Masuda

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
So sorry to hear about that

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
48 is young

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Very very very young

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Alright one 877

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Game OLR or a username on Skype

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Orange Lounge Radio is the place to call us

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
If you would like to participate with our show

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
The phone lines are open

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Right now

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Do we have any last minute stories while we wait

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I know I've seen some tweets come in over at twitter.com

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Slash OLR so I'll pull those up

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
But in the meantime

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Loki any last minute stories?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Unfortunately no

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I don't have any last minute stories

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
It was kind of a slower news week

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
That's the thing about April Fools day

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
It really cuts into like the actual news

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Oh we do have a phone call coming in though

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
So we will go to it

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
And hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
It's your local residential convention

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Hora Ranma

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Hey Ranma how you doing

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
I'm a little tired, my feet hurt

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
My back hurts but other than that I'm doing good

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yeah but let me think though

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Were you here for the entire show

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Or were you cheating on us with some pro wrestlers

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Umm

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Better things to spend my money on

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
If I'm cheating on OLR

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I'm cheating on OLR with a bunch of hot cosplayers

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I mean come on

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Give me some kind of credit

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Alright fair enough Ranma fair enough

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
So what's on your mind tonight buddy

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I want to talk about where in the world

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Is Carmen Sandiego

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
F yes the classic game of the week

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
The dark soccer pick this week

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
What do you want to talk about with it

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
When I was in junior high after school

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
There was about 10 of us we actually had

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
The Acme Detective Agency club

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Okay we would sit there

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
On our Apple IIe's and just

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Play the game and we would just

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Go through it and they would put our names

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
On the board and like

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Who can do the most

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Umm cases and rank

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Up and so forth

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
And that was pretty fun

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And it's like we're looking at

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Each other trying to figure out where one person

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Is where one person's at and

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Back then

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
There was maybe

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Two copies of the game

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
And the disc was

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Copied several times but only two

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Almanacs so pretty much

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
At the end of the school that you had to run

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
To the computer lab be the first one to

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Grab the disc and the almanac

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Rama don't copy that floppy

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Psssh

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
No I know I think

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
A lot of people did back in the day that's why they had

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
The copy protection

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Yeah but that's why also Manning

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Created tape

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
What

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Don't forget

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Well for the

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Disc copy protection to get around it you just cover

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
The red notch with a piece of tape

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Oh yeah that whole thing I do remember that

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Oh my god that's right or yeah

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
You can flip the little thing on the three and a half

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Floppy or yeah you get covered with the tape

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Oh my god that's old school

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Definitely yeah sorry it took me

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
A minute to like remember that and then I just suddenly had

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
The image of my childhood of like get the masking tape

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
It's

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Quite alright and then you used to have

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
The thing that you could actually a little hole punch that you could

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Actually punch the discs to put that notch in it

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
It's crazy

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Anyway

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
So any other

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Copy floppy stories from your childhood

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
You want to share with us?

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
That's the only one and by the way

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
For thinking

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
For the fact you thought these celebrities were already dead Rob

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
That was bad and you should feel bad

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
It was funny as hell

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And you know it

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Yeah I know especially what Loki said I was like

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I was ready to walk out of my house

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Right there

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
That was just terrible

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I'm going to go under where Loki sits just for next time

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
He needs to drop the mic and walk away

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Are you going to use that Mario pillow?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I might

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
That's a good use for it

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I use that pillow for my back a lot actually

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So Rob's butt is closer to it

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
That's right Mario can smell my butt

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Are you pretty much telling Mario to kiss your ass?

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I guess so

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Because

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I'm a Luigi fan Rama

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I'm a Luigi fan

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
And you know my favorite

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
My favorite is black Luigi

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
By the way

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Ronchon

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
You know I'm going to be back in the cosplay circuit

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Come July

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Are you doing Ugyo?

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
No

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
You're going to be so sad

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
So very very sad

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Sailor Venus?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
No

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
I'm doing two homestuck cosplays

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I've learned to

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Love and tolerate the homestuck fandom

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
As Marco said in My Little Pony

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I will learn to love and tolerate

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Respect and understanding

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
The gaming community needs more of it

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I have given My Little Pony a chance

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
And I found some of it amusing

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
That's good

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Even though Applejack's accent is horrible

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
But I have developed

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
A love of Rainbow Dash

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Because

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
20% cooler

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Yes

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
And don't forget

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
They had the figures at McDonald's this week

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
I'm not that into it

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
No thank you

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Alright

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Well Rama I'm going to let you go

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
So we can get some more calls

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
But listen to Anime Jam Session or You Suck

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Right?

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
We'll be talking about Castle Point this week

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
A convention we hit up today

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
And after that we're getting ready for PAX East

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Oh boy, big weekend coming up

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
You're telling me

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I'm just glad I got the time off for it

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Have fun at PAX East

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Bye my friend

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
1877 Game OLR

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Or a username on Skype

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you would like to give the show a call

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
The phone lines are once again open

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Again that's 1877 Game OLR

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Or a username on Skype

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I'm trying to go to the Twitters

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
To see what's going on here on Twitter

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Tigerclaw sending us a tweet

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
The Wreck-It Ralph sequel is officially in the works

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
According to the composer

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
We haven't had any official confirmation

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
But Wreck-It Ralph of course the Disney movie

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
From last year that was great with all its throwbacks

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
To classic gaming

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Very happy to hear about the sequel

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I just hope it's not direct to video

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
That would be very sad

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
But yeah I'm excited to hear about it

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I hope we get maybe a new Wreck-It Ralph game

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
That isn't exclusive to the Nintendo

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Platforms

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I'd like to see it out there in more places

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It's Shane

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
How are you doing?

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I'm good

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Hi Shane

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Wow you're making the rounds on every podcast that I co-host this week

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Right? I have no life

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
You even guessed it on Reading is Fundamental

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
And now you're here what's up?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I just want to do my

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Due diligence as a

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
DJ Max fan and put out the PSA

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
That on the iOS

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Platform we now have

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
The Technica game finally

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
In America

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
And it's expensive

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
So don't buy it

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Wait a minute so you're doing your due diligence to tell us

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
That it's out there but then you're saying don't buy it

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Yes

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Why not?

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Because you get the base game for free

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
And it comes with like six songs

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
I think seven maybe

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
And a couple of them

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Are pretty decent songs

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
And then you have to buy

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
The rest of them you can earn

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
The credit stuff

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
To buy the songs by playing the games

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
But you don't really earn a whole lot

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Each song is like 20 of these credits

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
So they want you to pay real money

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
If you want every single

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Song that they have there

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
And they're sold in packs

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
You can also buy them individually but that's not as good

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
You have to pay 96 bucks

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
For a phone game

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
But does it have flea?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
It does not

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Fuck it then

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
It has one of the exclusives from the

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
What's it called?

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
DJ Max Ray on the iPhone

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And it's not bad

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
But they are really asking

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
For a lot of money for songs

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
That don't translate as well to

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
The iPhone and probably iPad

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
As they do like in the arcade

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
But there will be some people that buy it

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Right Shane?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Yep there will be

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Not me though I did not buy any

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Wow

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
So I don't have the money for it

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Or else I'll buy it

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
But yeah

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Everybody has to know

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
So they can download it and get the free version

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
And then eventually

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
If you are drunk

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Or just

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Dumb

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
You buy the other songs

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Well if you have some more disposable income

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Out there and you want to drop the money on this

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
And some of the songs

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Let us know how it is

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
There are some good songs

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I earned enough to buy

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
One of my own songs

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Without paying money

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
And

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I don't know

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
It has a two line mode and a three line mode

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
And it's okay

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I bet this is much better on an iPad

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Than a little dinky iPhone

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
But you know

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
If you need a DJ Max fix

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Go play portable on PSP

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And not this

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Any other game reviews

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
You want to share with us tonight?

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I have already professed my love for Infamous

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Because it's amazing

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Did you hear that Loki?

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Loki said he wasn't sure on

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Infamous Second Sign

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
No I said that was the only one that looked interesting

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
It is really interesting

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
It's got a decent story

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I don't think the other ones supposedly have that great of stories

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I really got invested

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Into this one

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
And I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Because of Leviathan

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
And his mid 90's alternative

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Rock song

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
It's the best

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Playing that fight over and over

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Jamie if you get that far don't play it

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
You might get motion sick

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
It does a lot of bobbing up and down

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I'll probably wait for you guys to do it anyway

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
You fight Leviathan on a barge

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
And during the fight

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Leviathan will fly up in the air

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And land on the barge

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Which causes the barge to tilt

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
And you all fly down the barge

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Whatever way

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It's really fun

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Actually it's a rad mechanic

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I'll just wait until I have you guys to do it with me

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
There you go

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
You can pretty much sleep through it once you get there

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
It's really not hard whatsoever

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
If you can get past Titan hard mode

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Then shit anything is easy after that

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
The only reason I got past Titan at all

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Was because of you guys while I slept in the fire

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
That was just regular mode

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Wait until you see hard mode

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
It'll make you cry

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
You have no idea how angry I was that night

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I was angry enough that I was in tears

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
And I got up and left my computer

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
I was that angry

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Remember when I said

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Fuck it, just finish it

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
After that I got up and left

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
No video games worth getting that

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I was already in a really bad mood

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
I did that

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I was already in a really bad mood that night

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
But just having all that happen

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
After I had put off doing

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
The fight for three games until there were people

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
To do it with me

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I was just so frustrated

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I'm going to warn you

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
It gets worse

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
The hard mode is extremely unforgiving

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I would love to try it again

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
If I can

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
But I was so mad

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Sure

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Well Shane I'm going to let you go

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
See if we get any other callers

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Thanks for the call

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
I'm going to play more Leviathan

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Leviathan

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
That's not even the good part

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Bye

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
This is a tweet from SSJ100Matt

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Sometimes you guys want to bring stories

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
That might have slipped off of our radar

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
You want to bring that to our attention

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Let's see

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Washington State University researchers

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Programmed a computer to teach another how to play

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Ms. Pac-Man

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Let's see

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Right now robots are quote very dumb

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Saying Matthew E. Taylor at WSU

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Who is a professor of artificial intelligence

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
And so as robots become

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
More common it will be easier if they're capable

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Of learning how to perform tasks from

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Other robots

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
We don't want this information to be lost

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Once your home robot knows how you like your bath

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
How you like your house cleaned

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
You don't want to lose that information

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
So huh that's interesting

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
And there's a whole little YouTube that goes with it

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I'm not going to play it right now

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
But that's really neat

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
So they use Ms. Pac-Man as a way

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Now can you teach me how to play?

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Because I get killed in that game really easy

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Alright

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Akuma JP in our chatroom

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
At live.vognetware.com talking about

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Final Fantasy 14 saying

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
The reason I left Final Fantasy 14 is because I got

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Kicked from the server while in a fight with

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Odin

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
That Odin fight will kill servers

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Like there's so many people that show up for those fights

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
It kind of can't handle it

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Which is not okay

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
They need to fix that somehow

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So no MMO

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Is perfect and that's where Square Enix is struggling

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Is with some of those server issues

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And they encourage every single player

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
On the damn server to show up in one zone

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
All at the same time

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
So I will put out one more call

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
For phone calls at 1877 game OLR

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Or username on Skype orange lounge radio

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
I'm trying to look back

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Sometimes I miss tweets that were sent early in the week

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
If I don't scroll back

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
So I'm going to do that right now

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
But unfortunately

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
There's no last minute stories to help

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Give me time here

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
And stuff is

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Let's see code man had sent us that same story

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
About the five year old and the security flaw

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
With Xbox one

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
But you know that story is like making the rounds

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
It's everywhere because I'm sure the associated press

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Picked it up and it's a hilarious story to put

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
On the front of

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Your local newspaper and things like that

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Five year old that hacks Xbox

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Oh Pete Caruno had sent some tweets

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
At the beginning of the week when he was listening to the show

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Saying I believe it's illegal to

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Rent games in Japan

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
That's why there's a thriving second hand market

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
To replace it

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Renting CDs is legal

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
We were talking about that a little bit on the show last week

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I think we were talking about red box and all that stuff

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
And Pete Caruno said

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I successfully used the money in my Xbox account

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
To buy DJ Hero DLC yesterday

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Even managing to partly pay with points

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
And credit card

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Well you're doing better

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Did you do that though through the website?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
He didn't say

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
It was a tweet

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Through the website

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
No

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I do need to figure out

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
What I'm going to spend the rest of that on

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
I was hoping the DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Would come out but nope

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Not yet

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Alright

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
That's it I guess we're going to close up the Skype line

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
No other calls are coming in

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Alas

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
And AkumaJP by the way is verifying

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Yes it's illegal to rent games

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
They tried to do that here

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It happened Nintendo was not a fan of that

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
But no this is Murica

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
So anyway

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
If you want to participate with the show

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
If you were too busy with WrestleMania or Game of Thrones

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Or what else was tonight something else tonight

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Too busy

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Simpsons with a Minecraft intro

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Who cares

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
If you were too busy with any of that stuff you can always email us

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Or you can send us a tweet twitter.com

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Slash O L R

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
But with that we are going to wrap up the show here tonight

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
I want to thank you guys for listening and tuning into the show

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Thank you as always for your support

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lawn Tradio

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
We don't ask for your money

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Although I will say just a heads up you guys

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
We are going to be looking at ways here in the coming

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Weeks and months and so forth

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
And these are things you guys have been asking for

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Can I get a shirt

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Can I get Orange Lawn Tradio merchandise

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Will you sign something and send it to us

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
We are looking at ways to do that

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
But again totally optional

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Stuff that will be out there if you want to get it

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
And support the show that is fucking awesome

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
And you rule for it but you know we are not going to be like

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
We are not going to record our show

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
For a month if you don't do it

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I am still planning on doing VOG the book

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Which I do need to speak with some of our people

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
That would be very hilarious

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Kickstart the most expensive episode of Orange Lawn Tradio ever

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
To one episode

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
And then we donate the money to charity

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Namely the Jamie needs art supplies

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And candy

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Actually the donate to charity is against the rules

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
So you can't do that

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Can you do it on InigoGo

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
At any rate

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Bobby also makes a point that Cosmos

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Was on

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
And Cosmos is fucking amazing

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Well there you go

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000

Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I'll start

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Because you know Loki when you bring Carl's Jr.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
To the studio you make me crave Chris cut fries

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
You're a jerk

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
And I didn't even get the Chris cut fries

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I ate their natural cut fries

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
You know what Rob we could get pinkberry

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
I gotta go get Allen

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I was going to have pinkberry today

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
But my son had to fucking have an accident

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
After he was sitting there

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Bouncing up down like you have to go to the bathroom

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Let's go to the bathroom, no I don't have to go to the bathroom

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Two seconds later

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Oh I have to go to the bathroom

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Get him in the, okay let's go to the pinkberry

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Get him in the car, hey wait a second

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Pants are wet

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Thanks

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Womp womp

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Dark soccer your final thought tonight

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I'm glad I only have to deal with my cat

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And last but not least

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Loki your final thought tonight

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
I hope I can get some more programming done this week

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
My brain has been mushed the last few days

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
That's what I get for staying up

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Well feel better dammit

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
It's actually, I can only code with Red Bull

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I have to drink lots of Red Bull

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
And then that actually works out

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
The problem is though I'm getting to the point though

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Where it's like okay what do I work on next

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
What part do I work on next

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
It's just deciding what the best thing to work on

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
I don't know

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
I'm trying to like set myself goals and stuff

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
But it's just like a lot of stuff

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
That I need to work on

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
You know I gotta do everything

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
