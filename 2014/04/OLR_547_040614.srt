00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
April Fools is always a hoot now that we are Google Map Pokemon Masters and own our own flux capacitors

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But the top joke this week was Amazon taking over our TV

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Music, movies, and TV shows aren't new but they said it would play games too

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Tell us your favorite joke on the show where every gamer has a voice

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wait, what? That wasn't on April 1st?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I guess I'm the fool

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, Jason, that actually happened

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That is an actual, actual thing we'll get into later

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hi everybody, hi internet

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this April the 6th of 2014 with episode number 547 of our show

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here with you guys at vognetwork.com

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm here with you, I'm Rob Roberts

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hi

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hi, how are you?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Less frustrated, very happy

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I just noticed, I'm like, yay, DarkSakura was able to get in the chatroom after all

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, just still got a little bit of a headache from my movie adventures today

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, what did you go see today?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I went to see Captain America, Winter Soldier

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It seems like everybody in the nation went and saw you

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, it was just really freaking loud and the 3D hurt my eyes

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was just sort of too much of everything at once, so I figured that next time I go to a movie, I'm just going to start bringing earplugs and sunglasses

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But was it good?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was really good, but make sure that you stay not just for the after the special part of the credits, but after the all of the credits

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because trust me, it's a Marvel movie, it's safe for everything

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly, absolutely right

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There it is, alright, well also joining us as he does every week, here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey, Loki, and you're not doing so well from what I understand, right?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, starting to get a little sick?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I hear you, you're your stay-at-home dad right now, right?

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Just for a few weeks with the whole, they let you have leave when you have a new kid and all that stuff, right?

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How's it going?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, is your, are we not hearing Loki?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry guys

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oops, Loki was muted, sorry about that Loki, try again, that's the joys of live radio everybody

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Try again, Loki, how are you doing?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Congested

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Congested in your home with the baby

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, I'm home with the baby

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's see, so yeah, he just doesn't want to take a bottle

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I have to try to feed him and that usually takes about, I don't know, maybe an hour to get him to take an ounce

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it's like, come on, take the damn bottle

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You need to get one of those fake boobies that dads get to be able to feed

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There's no amount of niggling that's going to get that baby to take anything

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've had to do syringes just to get him to take something

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know, it's just because he's breastfed

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We were doing both, we were feeding him a bottle at night and that kind of stuff

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then we kind of backed off on that and so he's just confused

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's fine, my son Josh wakes up at like 5.45 every day

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Even though he doesn't have to wake up for school until like 6.45

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I get up every day at 5.45 now

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But there's a nice three hour break in between when he gets up and when the baby gets up

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My son usually gets up at 8.30 so I work on my computer and stuff

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Either doing programming in Unity or just playing games or something

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Until my son comes up and says, what are you doing? I want to watch that, do this

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was watching a game video the other day and he was telling me how to play the game

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's like, go up, go up! I'm like, it's a video, I can't do anything

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So yeah, that's what it's been

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then I usually take him to Nellie for lunch and then he sleeps when they get back for an hour, hour, two hours

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So is Josh at that age yet where he's actually, because you say he's standing up behind you while you're watching game videos

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is he at that age where he's actually able to play games?

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, he's not quite there yet?

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He doesn't know how to do anything

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean the best he can do is, I got him to play Forza Horizon a while back a little bit

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just because I have the whole racing setup where he could steer and need the pedals and everything

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But he doesn't have the dexterity to do it on his own

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And it's kind of hard to teach him because he's left handed

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I don't know how he would feel

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But he's interested in pictures and stuff

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I had him watch a Mega Man video today, like I put that on while I went and did something

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You need to get him to start like the rest of us started on Atari 2600

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't really remember playing games, probably about four years old at this release I remember, four or five for sure

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Five was when we got the Commodore 64, so I remember that

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He likes Bubble Bubble on the arcade, Kevin, he just doesn't understand how to move the joystick and push the buttons at the same time

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That was the thing about Atari 2600 games, they were easy

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's one thing to them, combat, pinball, boxing, very one note, easy to do

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you are listening to us live, hello and welcome, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Again that's live.vognetwork.com, I know we're up against some big TV stuff going on tonight

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So if you are here live, I appreciate you being here

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you are listening to us on the podcast, you know what, that's okay too

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you decided to watch your wrestling and you're listening to us on Monday morning

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well that's okay too, we appreciate your support either way

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And yeah, this is a show where every gamer has a voice

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you can't be here live with us, be sure you send us an email

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Which you can do at participate at orangeonsready.com

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or you can send us a tweet at OLR

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And we like to get your voices all on the show as well

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Going to our chat room, I see some folks talking about the old school games

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Dungeon Buster says Yars' Revenge, that was a little more complicated of a 2600 game

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
After they got all the simple stuff done, then it started getting a little weirder

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you look at Yars' Revenge and you have no idea what to do

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It is kind of difficult to figure out what the hell that game is

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know if you've ever seen Yars' Revenge, but Google it

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Make sure you're looking at the Atari 2600 version, not that weirdo remake they did a few years ago

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Which was nothing like the original

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But you have that storm cloud that comes down the middle of the screen

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which is actually like a safe zone I believe

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then you have a wall around the gun

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And you try to shoot through the wall

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then you have to touch the gun

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And once you touch the gun, which is randomly shooting so you gotta be careful

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You get a bullet on the left side of the screen

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You hit the fire button one more time and you blow up the gun

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
See that one's complicated, some of them get really complicated

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because they did all the simple stuff

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But Yars' Revenge was one of the greatest Atari 2600 games they ever did

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then try to explain a game like E.T.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, don't bother

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Although I seem to remember a couple years ago somebody had hacked the E.T. ROM to make it playable

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They changed collision detection and some other stuff to make E.T. playable

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Which is kind of funny

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Love that idea

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Speaking of hacks and joking and fooling around

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
For the kickoff topic tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about April Fools' Day

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because April Fools' Day was this past week

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Some years we've done things here at OLR or VOG Network where our show is heard

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This year we sat out

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just because our show was nowhere close to April Fools' Day this year

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And we were actually working on a new feature for the site at vognetwork.com

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like a real thing that actually launched on April 2nd

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because we want people to believe it's real

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's our new TV section

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Presented by the fantastic folks over at Critical Myth

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Which you can hear on VOG Network Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They have a brand new TV review section over at VOG Network

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you can access that at tv.vognetwork.com

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's really cool about it, it's got all the same gamification elements that the rest of the site has

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Meaning you can leave your response reviews right underneath the reviews of the shows that are there

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can comment and thumbs up, thumbs down, all that stuff

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So you can really participate with those reviews

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And it's TV so it's

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A lot of people watch these shows and trust me

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The guys over at Critical Myth, they have a pretty big staff

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so they review something like 40 shows

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now they used to run their own website, criticalmyth.com

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But due to some, and I have no better way to word this

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Than due to some fuckery

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Which is completely out of their hands and not their fault

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But due to some fuckery, they don't have Crystal Myth

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or did I say crystalmyth.com?

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Criticalmyth.com

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Criticalmyth.com

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Or you know, Critical Myth, CrystalMyth.com

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's even more popular

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think somebody hacked their domain to sell it for meth

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think that's what happened

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But anyway, criticalmyth.com is not there in the same way

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think he kind of has it to do some podcast hosting

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But they unfortunately lost a bunch of reviews

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But they're starting anew over at VOG Network

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And they review a lot of shows

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This isn't like Marvel Agents of SHIELD and one other show

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You go over there, there's a ton of shows they're reviewing right now

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So probably one of your geeky favorites is up over there

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So check that out

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Once again, tv.vognetwork.com

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Plug plug

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So where was I? April Fools

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
April Fools

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Lots of April Fools jokes always happen around the game industry

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We've had some real classic stuff in the past

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But what did you guys think of this year's offerings?

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We had a few things this year

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What did you think of this year's April Fools offerings?

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Loki, is there any that...

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean there was a few that kind of stood out

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But a lot of them were just kind of eh

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean, I like the

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Spent new Smash Brothers character reveal which was Nester

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But see that's the thing though

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's like, it kind of falls into two categories

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's April Fools jokes that are kind of like

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay haha that's funny

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then there's those April Fools jokes where it's like

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh man that's really cool

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why is this just an April Fools joke?

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why can't we have this actually be a real thing?

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And so in that category there was

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Nester reveal and then also

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The Optimus Prime

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
DLC for Titanfall

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Where you'd have Optimus Prime

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Which I gotta admit though he did kind of look a little derpy in that

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But whatever

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I guess it was generation one but it looked

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It looked like derpy generation one

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So that was kind of neat

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Wait let me cut in because I don't want you to name everything

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I want to give Jamie a chance

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't know if she was really following all the April Fools stuff

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But was there any gags that caught your eye this year Jamie

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That you thought were funny? Or anything you thought was lame?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
After being reminded by Bobby I did the NPR stunt

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That was really smart

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do people actually pay attention?

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That wasn't gaming per se

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But a great commentary on social media

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And the social game we play every day on Facebook

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's a great commentary on my Facebook

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
On everybody's Facebook

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I mean seriously

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's actually a great commentary on my mother

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And every conversation I ever have with her

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And just to recap

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I know a lot of people probably listen to Bobby's show

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But just for those that are listening to our show first

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
For whatever reason on Monday

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They posted an article

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That said something like

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Americans don't read as much as they used to

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Or something like that

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But you click in the article

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it says this is our April Fools joke

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hey you should like the post

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But don't comment on it

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
To prove that you read it

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And all these people commenting on the post

226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Saying what kind of travesty is this?

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are you talking about NPR?

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
NPR you guys are full of crap

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
People who just made an impression

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Based off the headline

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Didn't bother to read the story

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hilarious

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It sort of goes back to

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Something I've been pointing to before

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Through a couple of different shows

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just how society itself

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Has become

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Can't be bothered to do anything

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And this

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Would never be true in the gaming industry

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right Dark Sakura?

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The gaming fans never judge things based on headlines alone

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do we?

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know what?

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a human thing

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The path of least resistance

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We would never have

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Like a click baiting website

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That would just try to get attention grabbing headlines

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For people to share on Facebook

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We would never have anything like that

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right?

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Website

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
April Fools

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah and who's the fool this time?

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who is the fool?

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Dungeon Buster agrees

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The Optimus DLC was very funny

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The pagan Jew with one

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't believe Dark Sakura forgot about this

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I just wanted this to be real

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The pagan Jew says the BioWare store stuff

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The Garris body pillow

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That was a big joke anyway

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There were reviews up of it

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Besides that

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't want a Garris body pillow

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Unless it's like a full size plushie

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I could deal with that

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But Dan would be completely freaked out

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Raginator

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Going to keep it at old school and saying

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The best April Fools gag ever

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Was the EGM Shang Long joke

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That is always interesting

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Back when you didn't really have the internet

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The way you have it now

279
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And gaming magazines were very prolific

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And in the April issue

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There would always be some type of

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Joke

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it was always really funny to me

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When that stuff would cross over into actual

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Cannon

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The one that pops into my head is when they said

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Ermac was in Mortal Kombat

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The red ninja Ermac was available

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You did all this crazy stuff

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And you could unlock it

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What did the developers of Mortal Kombat do?

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They put a character called Ermac in one of the later games

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We always knew it would happen

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They started trolling people by putting

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Random text in the bios

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Or whatever

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Any jokes that you guys

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Have ever come across on April Fools day

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In the gaming world or maybe in the tech world

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That just weren't funny

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because sometimes

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What's the old adage?

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can only think of the RuPaul version

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Bear with me here

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The RuPaul version is

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Throwing shade takes creativity

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Being a bitch takes none

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And what I mean by that is that

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Some April Fools jokes are funny

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because they're thought out

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They're well executed and so forth

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But there's so much sloppy shit that happens

313
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
On April Fools day that's just mean spirited

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And dumb

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So what do you guys think has happened in the game industry

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And I pose this to our chat room as well

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That was on that side of

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Bitchy that was just dumb

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There was the Firefly one

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh Netflix is reviving Firefly

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was like fuck all of you

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That was kind of being a bitch

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If it wasn't that you were doing the Jessica Jones

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And Luke Cage series I would just say fuck you

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Forever for the rest of the year

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Until you redeemed yourselves if that was at all possible

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hitstun says that Nester

328
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Won this year was lame

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Disagrees with Loki

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There was the

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Enter the dominatrix

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
April Fools joke

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh what would that tell us more about that

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's for Saints Row

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They were teasing it as an

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
April Fools joke originally

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That became a thing

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then it was going to become an expansion

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Saints Row 4

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
God having played the DLC

341
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It would have been fucking terrible

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Even more terrible than Saints Row 4 was

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I do have to say that

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The only getting into

345
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
April Fools that I did

346
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Was playing Animal Crossing

347
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And having to tell who was the right one

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And I'm very sad that I did not guess the correct

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Margie

350
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because it made her sad and she better not move

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I forgot that April Fools was a thing

352
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In Animal Crossing

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Blanca shows up

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And she impersonates another townsperson

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And so sometimes they'll give a clue by their

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Birthday or whatever

357
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it's stupid

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's one of those like how much have you been paying attention

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And Margie's my favorite and I got her wrong

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For a second there I thought you had a really epic

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Capcom crossover there

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like oh Blanca shows up that's awesome

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No she's the one that had the face

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That you drew her face in before

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Blanca shows up and starts electrocuting your villagers

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I support this

368
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He just

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He spotted Ed and then launched himself

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In the one of those

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Blanca balls at Ed's face

372
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And murdered him from Jamie's village

373
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah I did

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's see I got

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I got Groucho right

376
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I like Groucho so I have his picture

377
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And I got D.Va

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Which I just like her because her name is D.Va

379
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But she's a fucking frog

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So her eyes are sitting on top of her head and it's fucking weird

381
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You know I thought the meanest April Fools joke

382
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Where somebody was being a total bitch that was played

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Was when Notch

384
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Wrote that blog post

385
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
About how he wasn't gonna make Minecraft for the Oculus Rift

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because Facebook bought them

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then Yeti turned around and now they're gonna do

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You know, pocket Minecraft on the Amazon Fire

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I thought that was a really bitchy April Fools joke

390
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's because the Amazon Fire

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They already have controller support for Minecraft Pocket

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're just putting it on another damn console

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh wait wait you're saying that wasn't an April Fools joke?

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That wasn't an April Fools joke

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not technically in 3

397
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What a bitch

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's kind of stupid to call it Minecraft

399
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Pocket on a fucking TV

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't fit that TV in my pocket

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Alright how big do you think my pocket is?

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Alright

403
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't afford big fucking pockets

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because I'm going to reach into your pocket

405
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And take out $7.99

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's for the people with the deep pockets

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes it's for people with deep pockets

408
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Alright

409
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You gotta have a pouch of holding for that shit

410
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Alright all bitchiness aside

411
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We'll get to the Amazon Fire stuff

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I know it's on everybody's mind

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We'll get to that in the news in a little bit

414
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But let's establish our frame of reference for the week

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
In a segment we call

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How is your gaming week?

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So DarkSakura what type of games have you been playing this week?

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Animal Crossing

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I played some Final Fantasy 14

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I did some Mass Effect

421
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But I really need to start over on my game again

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And for some reason

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My mods aren't working again

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So whatever the fuck

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was playing something else

426
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh yeah um

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think I mentioned it last week I might have

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That I started the Shiva

429
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Which um

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's actually

431
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's done in those old sprite

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You know point and click adventure games

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But it's really

434
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's very Jewish

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I mean the Shiva

436
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What a Shiva is

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Is if you don't know it's like a week long

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Period of mourning when someone dies

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Where the family in mourning

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Sits on the floor everyone brings them food

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You know you're supposed to

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You don't have to do much to take care of yourself

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You're supposed to get your grief out of your system

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And you know after you've buried the dead

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And so in this case

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's a rabbi who

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Has a dwindling congregation about to lose

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
His synagogue and then

449
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Somebody that

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He had actually

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Kicked out of his congregation

452
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Left him a whole bunch of money

453
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But the guy was murdered

454
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it's

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This whole murder mystery

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Around

457
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Just around trying to get

458
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
To the bottom of it

459
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why would this guy who he kicked out

460
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Leave him money

461
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Who's behind it

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's pretty

463
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's really actually more of an insight into

464
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think into modern Jewish culture

465
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've really been enjoying it

466
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And on top of that

467
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's an old school point and click adventure game

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah it's called the shiva

469
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The pagan Jewish

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's a real game I need to look this up

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah it's really

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Good and it's actually not super expensive

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But I've been really getting into the story behind it

474
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Nice

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I played a little bit more

476
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Dominique Pablos

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But the problem I have with it

478
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Is that I

479
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Have problems with hearing anything off pitch

480
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And

481
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Not all of the singing is on pitch

482
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a very intentional

483
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Sort of sing songy

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's

485
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I had this problem in band

486
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You know what perfect pitch is right

487
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
When you can hear pitch

488
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I saw pitch perfect

489
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I loved Fat Amy she was my favorite

490
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well I have perfect pitch for listening

491
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And so I can hear when anything

492
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is off it starts to sound like

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Instead of a constant sound

494
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You hear all the sound waves between it

495
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And so for me it's just like

496
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
A cringe I can't even listen to myself sing

497
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When I'm off pitch

498
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So that's why I don't do karaoke

499
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Turn the volume down turn subtitles on

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Probably what I'm going to end up doing

501
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Except the songs are cute the music is cute

502
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So I've been enjoying what I'm playing of it

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And that's not anything having to do with the game

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's having to do with me

505
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I take it in bursts I'm having a good time

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It is such a little art film

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It is I love it it's so cute

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I just sort of want my own

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Dominique doll

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We know people you can call

511
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
To maybe arrange that

512
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I might make one

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And thank you Dungeon Buster for doing a link to the

514
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Shiva in there because I would really like

515
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
To see more games like this

516
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I would love to see more people

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Explore this game and learn more

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
About you know the culture behind it

519
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Well and in a way you just brought up

520
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Dominique Pamplemousse too which is a very

521
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Similar sort of thing being able to explore

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The mind of somebody

523
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You might not otherwise

524
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Have thought about relating to before

525
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And I love the main character

526
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I really do like Dominique

527
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But that being said

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I have to take it in doses

529
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I'm actually kind of

530
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Considered getting Titanfall

531
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Except I would throw up so quickly

532
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
This doesn't sound like you at all

533
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean don't get me wrong Titanfall is pretty cool

534
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But what's your attraction

535
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
To Titanfall? I want to see the story behind it

536
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Because I actually it was funny because we were

537
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Alright we were watching

538
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
At Captain America today we were watching

539
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The little commercials

540
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They do in front of it they had a really

541
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Good one for Titanfall and I was like oh that's kind of

542
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Interesting and then you see the pilots bouncing

543
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
From wall to wall I was like oh my god

544
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's like Attack on Titanfall

545
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was like I'm kind of

546
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Interested now because it says it's got a story

547
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And it's multiplayer and I was like well

548
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There will be people on the same learning curve as me I'm sure

549
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The story is very short because

550
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The game is only multiplayer and so there's

551
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Like multiplayer

552
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
multiplayer match oh something story related

553
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
multiplayer match and then that's it

554
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then later on oh something else

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Story related oh whatever

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh and now you have to play the other side

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Maybe I'll just stick with drunken robot

558
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Pornography then

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You can watch the story on YouTube

560
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Seriously I think it's short enough to where you could do that

561
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well I don't know I've actually

562
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When I gave up playing through

563
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Half Life 2

564
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I just watched the rest of the story online

565
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Well how do you think sites like Twitch TV

566
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Are a thing people like to watch

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
People play through stories but I do want

568
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
To have a mass effect multiplayer

569
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Night where we stream again

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I wonder if my game is up to date

571
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't even know because then I need to drink a lot

572
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That'd be fun and play because drunken

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Mass effect multiplayer on bronze

574
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Is the funniest thing ever and for the record

575
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ragenator I did get goat simulator

576
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Or as you said goat stimulator

577
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And it's fucked up

578
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Also

579
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Another comment in our chat room you may

580
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Not be alone in some of your music

581
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Things dark soccer

582
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
says when I hear death metal

583
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I lose my balance and I get dizzy right away

584
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I have the problem actually

585
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
With certain ones like okay I'm fine

586
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
With speed metal but anything

587
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That's the super bass heavy and

588
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Screechy oh like through the fire and the flames

589
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah I'm fine with speed metal because

590
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It actually is sort of melodic it has

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
A pattern and I mean if anyone

592
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Wants to okay the stuff that I listen

593
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
To to calm me down when I'm about you know at

594
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Meltdown phase is I listen to Philip Glass

595
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And believe it or not I've actually

596
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Found a little bit of correlation with

597
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Some of the patterns that come up in Philip Glass's music

598
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And certain types

599
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Of speed metal just the melodic

600
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And repetitive how it

601
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Builds and builds and builds on something so

602
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's actually very calming to me but

603
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Death metal no I get sick actually get nauseous

604
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If it's I've listened to too much

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So yeah

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright

607
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Well let's move on back to I don't know

608
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
How we got into talking about death metal from video games

609
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We did Loki how was

610
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Your gaming week I've actually been listening to lots of music

611
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Not death metal but I've been trying

612
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
To find because the thing is

613
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I've been trying to find music that's of a

614
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Certain genre but I don't know what genre it is

615
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's you know like pendulum

616
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Where it's a cross between like heavy metal

617
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Drum and bass and electronica

618
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I guess but how do you say

619
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I want

620
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Heavy metal drum and bass

621
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Electronica music half pandora

622
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or check like last.fm

623
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well the problem is I'm looking for

624
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Indie music that's of that same genre

625
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And I've found a few things but it's just like

626
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They have so many tags on it

627
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There's no fucking way I'm gonna go find this

628
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Anyways the actual games I played

629
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Or I should say game

630
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I really only played goat simulator this week

631
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because I haven't really played much at all

632
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
As far as games go I did

633
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Load up South Park for like

634
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Literally two minutes just to show my friend

635
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And that was that

636
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He proceeded to use all my

637
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Single day

638
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Summons so I had to

639
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Not save and you know

640
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Go back and actually

641
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Play that section again

642
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But yeah goat simulator is fun

643
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I liked how they changed some of the things

644
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Probably for copyright issues

645
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The Yoshi goat is now Italian dinosaur goat

646
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Which is funny

647
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
They added a dragon

648
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Shout goat which I haven't actually used yet

649
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But there's a lot more

650
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Mods on there now

651
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Some new maps

652
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So fun stuff

653
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Just got the achievement for doing all the flips

654
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The trick is to go into the low

655
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Gravity area and you can flip forever

656
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In there

657
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah so

658
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's all I played this week hopefully

659
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Gonna get in some Call of Duty

660
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Modern Warfare 2 later this week

661
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Got a ton of friends now

662
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That are playing that so it'll be fun

663
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Alright

664
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
My gaming week I actually kept myself pretty busy

665
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I've played a few games this week

666
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Sadly none of it is really new things for me to talk about

667
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 10

668
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The HD remake

669
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I played that a little bit towards the beginning of the week

670
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I got a copy of South Park

671
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
On Playstation 3

672
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So I finally got a chance to play the South Park game

673
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm not super far into it

674
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm just like at the beginning still where you're going around town

675
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
With Butters trying to recruit the people for your

676
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know

677
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
For your army or whatever

678
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I'm like isn't this the same plot from the show

679
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But that's alright

680
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's really funny of course the game is hilarious

681
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because it's written by

682
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The guys who do the actual show

683
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Matt Park or Trey Stone

684
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I thought it was interesting how there's all these little side quests

685
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The way the game plays

686
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Obviously it has the RPG elements

687
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But it reminds me of

688
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
A 90's

689
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Click adventure game from the PC

690
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Like King's Quest or Loom or some shit

691
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know why

692
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Maybe it's because you keep going from static scene to static scene

693
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And you interact with things in the scene

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Be it with your slingshot

695
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Or you're looking at things that are yellow

696
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Or things you can open up or whatever

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So I just kind of

698
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't know I thought that was kind of neat

699
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It kind of was a throwback to those games

700
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But yeah the game is funny

701
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And definitely worth a look at if you're a South Park fan

702
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Other games I've been playing this week

703
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Diablo 3

704
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Having an experience boost weekend

705
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So I'm still trying to beat Act 5

706
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Because I'm level 69 now

707
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So there's only one more level for me to gain

708
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So I've got to be close to the end

709
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But yeah I wanted to play that during the experience boost weekend

710
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I've been playing a little bit of that

711
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Also this weekend Final Fantasy 14 is doing its

712
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Second beta on Playstation 4

713
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And this is the beta where you can use

714
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Your characters from the PC

715
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Or the Playstation 3

716
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If you still haven't checked out the Final Fantasy 14

717
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Beta on Playstation 4

718
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I hate to say it I think you missed your chance

719
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean you can start the download now

720
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And depending on your connection you might be able to get

721
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
A couple hours in to at least get a feel for it

722
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But at this point if you haven't played it

723
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now is your chance to try out the game for free

724
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah it comes out in like a week

725
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah it's out the pre-order

726
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Starts on the 11th and those people can play

727
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And I believe Playstation 3 users

728
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Who are converting their licenses

729
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Also get to start playing that day

730
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then the 14th is when the game comes out

731
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
SSJ 100 Matt by the way says

732
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You need to play South Park in front of your mom

733
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I will I'll invite her over she loves South Park

734
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I have not seen your mom

735
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
In ages and she's wonderful

736
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah I should invite her on the show sometime

737
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Maybe for Mother's Day or something

738
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We'll have her on the show in the new studio

739
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It'll be fun

740
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Huh

741
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's a good idea

742
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That's a good idea

743
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And by the way

744
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What?

745
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Next week I will be doing another Blue Roses giveaway in Animal Crossing

746
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You gonna work on farming those blue roses?

747
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh I've got like a whole flower bed full now

748
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Alright stay tuned

749
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Blue roses the Animal Crossing equivalent of

750
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Crystal meth

751
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Apparently, apparently

752
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Uh see I've been playing the Final Fantasy 14 beta

753
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
On Playstation 4

754
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I am impressed with the technology in that little box

755
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I gotta say

756
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Because the game runs great

757
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It runs better than it does on my 5 year old PC

758
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Because my PC is 5 years old

759
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But the frame rate is fantastic

760
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The game looks great

761
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I can broadcast to Twitch

762
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Using the whole built in thing

763
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And my network thing doesn't suffer

764
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The graphics look good

765
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You know I actually played through

766
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The 2.2 patch content last night

767
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I streamed it

768
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I really wish Twitch archived

769
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The Playstation 4 stuff

770
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It doesn't

771
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm kinda bummed out

772
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Because I did the Leviathan fight for the first time

773
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Last night on the feed with Shane

774
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And uh

775
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I actually thought of a pretty clever way

776
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Cause you know when I do my live streams

777
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I almost always have somebody on Skype

778
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That I can kinda banter with

779
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So it's not just watching my little head in the box

780
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Or listening to rock music

781
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Like I just

782
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I have to be different

783
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So I always like to banter with somebody on Skype

784
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So you know

785
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Usually Shane is almost always there

786
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Or Extifer

787
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or Grandpa from Hoardouse

788
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Or somebody's

789
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Usually they're bantering with me

790
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well

791
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
On the Playstation 4 it's a little more difficult right

792
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Cause you can't plug in a mixing board or anything right

793
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But what I figured out you can do

794
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I get my iPhone

795
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I call Shane on the Skype app on my iPhone

796
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I set the iPhone right next to the camera

797
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So he can hear me when I'm talking

798
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And then the listeners hear him

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Or the viewers hear him through the camera mic

800
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And it works

801
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So then the viewers are actually listeners too?

802
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, both

803
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Unless they're deaf

804
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Then they're just viewers

805
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And they don't care about the banter

806
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Between Shane and I

807
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Cause there's no subtitles

808
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We should find a way to subtitle the show by the way

809
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah I don't know

810
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It'd be a lot of work

811
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So

812
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You could use one of those automated things

813
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That are kinda hit and miss

814
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But yeah

815
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Final Fantasy XIV on Playstation 4 is great

816
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I'm probably gonna switch to playing on Playstation 4

817
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
When it comes out

818
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Since I got it on Playstation 3

819
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And here's

820
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If you're interested in the game

821
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I would really urge you to

822
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Try to find a cheap copy on Playstation 3 right now

823
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And then just convert your license to Playstation 4

824
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's the cheapest way to do it

825
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And get 30 days free with the game

826
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You can probably find a copy for 15-20 bucks right now

827
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Out there

828
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Just make sure it's not used

829
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Cause you need to have a code

830
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But

831
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
There you go

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That was pretty much my gaming week honestly

833
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Lots of other stuff I need to try

834
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I've got an EverQuest Landmark beta code

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That I'm waiting to use

836
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I gotta get in there and play that

837
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And

838
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Let's see

839
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll describe it

840
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And

841
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's see

842
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Elder Scrolls Online came out

843
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But I lost my chance at that

844
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I didn't really play that

845
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And

846
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Wild Stars in beta too

847
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And I'm the one to test that out

848
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And I really want to try Wild Stars

849
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I really want

850
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And I doubt anybody from Blizzard

851
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Listens to this show

852
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But if you do

853
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If I happen to have a fan out there

854
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That I did not know about

855
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's got the hookup at Blizzard

856
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Please flag my account

857
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
For the Heroes of the Storm alpha

858
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Thank you, thank you

859
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Kiss kiss hug hug

860
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I really wanna

861
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I can't

862
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm losing my resistance Rob

863
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What?

864
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Cause the space goats

865
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh you wanna go back to WoW?

866
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I kinda do

867
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
When the expansion comes out

868
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Uh oh

869
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That was the other one

870
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That was really awesome

871
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't remember if it was League of Legends

872
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Or I think it was League of Legends

873
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But they had

874
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And I'm assuming it's a joke

875
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But they had

876
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The

877
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Goat simulator goat in there

878
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
As a playable character

879
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And it was

880
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think it was one of those like

881
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You know

882
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Dota type games or something

883
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But

884
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I wanna say it was League of Legends

885
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Maybe it wasn't League of Legends

886
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But

887
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
There's a lot of people doing a lot of goat simulator things

888
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And that right there

889
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That's the April Fools game right there

890
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That just keeps on giving

891
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Because it's a legit game

892
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know MMOs do some of the best April Fools gags

893
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They do some of the worst

894
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh my god

895
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What was it?

896
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Guild Wars 2

897
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Had the whole retro level last year

898
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That was amazing

899
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Oh you know

900
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
There's something else that I did

901
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It wasn't video game related

902
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But it wasn't anime

903
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I started Kill la Kill

904
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is that the one that Rama told you to watch?

905
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
No

906
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh

907
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Several many other people have told me to watch it

908
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And so finally I just broke down and started watching it

909
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh my god

910
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's all I have to say

911
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Going to our chat

912
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Going to our chat room at

913
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Live.vognetwork.com

914
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Dark Tetsuya says

915
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well doesn't YouTube kind of have closed captioning?

916
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Not sure it's 100% accurate

917
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But anyway

918
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes it does

919
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't know if our videos that Jason puts on the Orange Launch Radio channel at YouTube

920
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Has that like

921
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That you can use that

922
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But I bet it's hilariously bad

923
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Because there's some really bad YouTube captioning out there

924
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Maybe we should check out

925
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm gonna check it out

926
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You should check out a prior episode

927
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
See if that's there

928
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Also going to more chat

929
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Let's see

930
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Hitstun says

931
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Wildstar and Elder Scrolls Online were really big at PAX East last year

932
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But they're still not out yet

933
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Elder Scrolls Online actually launched on Friday

934
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So that is now out

935
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Wildstar I believe is June

936
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Is when that's coming out

937
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
S2100Matt says

938
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We need to use our

939
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Tell a friend about the show duty

940
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And find a friend that is also a stenographer

941
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And get them hooked to OLR

942
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That would be great

943
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'd love that

944
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Alright

945
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Anyhow

946
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So that is it

947
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I believe for our gaming weeks

948
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's everybody

949
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Quick housekeeping

950
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And then we will get to the show

951
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
With the news and everything

952
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Add us on Twitter

953
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

954
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You can also add us on Facebook

955
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

956
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And Google Plus

957
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio

958
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
A couple shout outs

959
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I want to give here

960
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
At the top of the show

961
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I want to shout out the website

962
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Outcasts with a Z

963
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Outcasts.com

964
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Really awesome

965
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This has not happened to me before

966
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But they actually ran a feature on me

967
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
On their site

968
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And it talked about

969
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It talked about the history of Orange Lounge Radio

970
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Talking about a little bit of my broadcast background

971
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
With Understation Live and everything

972
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Outcasts.com is like a GLBT nerd gaming culture site

973
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And Jamie got a name drop even

974
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I mentioned you in the interview

975
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I am sorry you did not make the story

976
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I knew that was going to get called out

977
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What happened? What was with me?

978
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Because your name is in the interview

979
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because it talks about how OLR started

980
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So it talks about Rob and Jamie started OLR

981
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Da da da da da

982
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But the problem is

983
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I said in another part

984
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I talked about how Loki is with it now

985
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But they didn't use that part of it

986
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because technically

987
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Loki didn't start the show with us

988
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But it's like

989
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He just kept showing up

990
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah but it's one of those things

991
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Now how could we ever have the show without him

992
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So I am very sorry Loki

993
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But that was the interviewer's person

994
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I know Travis and Jessica got shout outs too

995
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
For the Understation Live stuff

996
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Loki none for Loki bye

997
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The captioning is hilarious

998
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Is it?

999
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's just like it's terrible

1000
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I mean it's got some

1001
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay so Orange Lounge Radio

1002
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You know the little intro part

1003
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The way they translate

1004
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Way but sprawled hollow

1005
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Let's see here

1006
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's see here

1007
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's see here

1008
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There was an

1009
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh

1010
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't even know what part this is

1011
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Doing next

1012
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's all Sky this week gonna kill the Bens

1013
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And intriguing publishing Google recently

1014
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm gonna kill the Bens y'all

1015
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Look out if your name's Ben

1016
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh man that's hilarious

1017
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah just watch it with the subtitles on it's hilarious

1018
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's great

1019
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's great

1020
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Hey give me

1021
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There's actually a series of things

1022
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
They do like that for Mass Effect 2 as well

1023
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh yeah

1024
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The bad closed captioning

1025
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh yeah

1026
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Good stuff

1027
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah

1028
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm sure there's a lot of that out there

1029
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So anyway

1030
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Shout out for our YouTube channel

1031
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Check out the bad closed captioning

1032
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
At Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube

1033
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh okay

So the

1035
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The Sky is Sweet thing

1036
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's on this week

1037
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know something about Amazon

1038
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Or something like that

1039
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's what it

1040
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's Jason's little

1041
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah yeah

1042
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
His little intro

1043
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The Sky this week gonna kill the Bens

1044
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Gonna kill the Bens

1045
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Alright

1046
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Where was I?

1047
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Where was I?

1048
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Stop interrupting me

1049
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Outkast

1050
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Loki's just mad because he somehow was missing from the article

1051
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Outkast.com and a big thanks to them

1052
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I really appreciate that

1053
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Give them all your clicks

1054
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Also another website to give all your clicks to

1055
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
A fantastic little show called Troll in the Dungeon

1056
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Which is a World of Warcraft focused podcast

1057
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Had me on their show this past Saturday

1058
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I don't think the episode is posted on the feed yet

1059
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But it will be in the coming days

1060
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So check them out

1061
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's Troll in the Dungeon over on iTunes and Stitcher and all that good stuff

1062
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And that was the episode from just this past

1063
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What was April 6th

1064
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Or no today is April 6th

1065
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
April 5th would be the show I was on

1066
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh my god Rob

1067
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What?

1068
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Not next weekend but the weekend after

1069
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Gonna be older

1070
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Your birthday

1071
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What's your birthday plans? Anything?

1072
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Hopefully going to Sakura, Matsuri

1073
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I need to make sure it's that weekend

1074
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But I wanna hang out in San Francisco

1075
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And eat all the food I don't normally eat

1076
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Except the problem

1077
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's also Passover

1078
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh

1079
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I was gonna say you should go to Dave and Busters

1080
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And do your get drunk as hell thing

1081
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That means I'm just gonna have to eat nothing but mochi

1082
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm voting that we change the name of our show

1083
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
According to what it thinks our name of the show is

1084
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's Orange Allow Injure Radio

1085
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Alright put that thing away

1086
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That's because of how you pronounce lounge Rob

1087
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You say lounge like

1088
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Lounge

1089
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Cause you extra enunciate when you do the intro

1090
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's not my voice in the intro

1091
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Well I mean but when you do another episode of Orange Lounger Radio

1092
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You say lounger

1093
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh

1094
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Which is powerful

1095
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You sound almost like you're an evil dictator

1096
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
This is Orange Allow Injure Radio

1097
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Orange Lounger Radio

1098
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'll take it

1099
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Dark soccer

1100
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Dark soccer

1101
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Close it

1102
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Well you know I do have an affinity for kicking balls

1103
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
There's her little clip in the next intro

1104
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Alright let's get into gaming news

1105
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Loki's gonna put away the closed captioning

1106
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And talk to us about what is going on in the gaming world

1107
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Here at Orange Allow Injure Radio

1108
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So the ever rumored Amazon set top box type thing

1109
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Was finally announced during a press event

1110
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
They had it live blogged and everything

1111
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And it's the Amazon Fire TV

1112
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And it's actually a device that you know

1113
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Like most of those set top boxes out there

1114
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That you can stream you know Netflix

1115
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And of course you know the Amazon Video stuff

1116
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Hulu

1117
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
All that sort of things

1118
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It runs Android so you can run different apps on it and stuff

1119
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Remotes and all that fun stuff

1120
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But the other cool thing about it though

1121
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Is it also

1122
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Is a device that you can game on

1123
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So they actually have a controller that you can buy for 40 bucks

1124
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That looks like you know a console controller

1125
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And you can play games

1126
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Of course you know they have the whole Amazon Game Studios

1127
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So there's that

1128
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's kind of cool

1129
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The device is only $99

1130
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So there's your final nail in the coffin Uya

1131
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You're irrelevant now

1132
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Sounds like a big splat

1133
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Some of the games of course

1134
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Well hold up to be fair the Uya is $99 with a controller

1135
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
If you want to play games on the Amazon Fire

1136
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You're telling me it's really $139

1137
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Spec wise though it's way more powerful than Uya

1138
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And it's got one thing that the Uya doesn't have

1139
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Which is Minecraft Pocket Edition

1140
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Well here's the $139 question though

1141
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Are you going to buy one?

1142
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Am I going to buy one?

1143
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I don't know if the wife would let me buy another set top box

1144
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I wanted to

1145
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Because we have the Boxee right now

1146
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But it's kind of crap

1147
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah if my Boxee were to die somehow

1148
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Some unforeseen accident

1149
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Then yes I would totally pick one up

1150
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm going to be honest why?

1151
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I can't see the need to get

1152
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I mean I get why this Amazon Fire exists

1153
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's a great appealing thing for my mom and my dad

1154
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Who are never going to buy a game console but want to have Netflix

1155
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Like the people that buy Roku's and things like that

1156
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's great for them

1157
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's exactly why I'd buy it

1158
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I wouldn't buy it to play games on it

1159
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Maybe Minecraft

1160
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I wouldn't even play Minecraft

1161
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Why would you even play Minecraft?

1162
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I would buy it for games

1163
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Well not games but maybe

1164
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't know

1165
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It would be kind of cool to publish something to that

1166
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well let's not forget

1167
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Amazon bought a developer recently

1168
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah

1169
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So they're going to have something exclusive

1170
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Well they do

1171
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's a game called Sev Zero

1172
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's a first person shooter type thing

1173
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So they've got that

1174
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Some of the things they're showing

1175
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Asphalt 8 and Minecraft

1176
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And the other thing though is it does work with other Bluetooth controllers

1177
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So maybe it would work with a DualShock controller

1178
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
If you have one already

1179
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Andrew's pretty friendly with anything Bluetooth

1180
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I don't know it's not a huge deal

1181
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And also I think if you buy the controller

1182
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You get like some

1183
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't know how it works but it's like Amazon coins or something like that

1184
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's like a thousand of that

1185
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Buy books or something

1186
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Buy things with that

1187
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't know the ratio of coins to money

1188
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So they've got that

1189
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And I don't know I'm kind of interested

1190
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like I said I would mainly use it for

1191
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Just like TV stuff

1192
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It would be cool though because I didn't really get to see a lot of the interface thing

1193
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Because I had friends over at the time

1194
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But if it's

1195
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Like I think it is where I think it might combine

1196
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Like all the different

1197
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like you're not going into dedicated apps for different things

1198
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think it's just like

1199
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Okay I want to watch like

1200
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Game of Thrones or something

1201
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Maybe Game of Thrones is a bad example

1202
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I want to watch

1203
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The Office or something

1204
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And it will bring up all the different

1205
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Providers that have The Office

1206
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And where you can watch that

1207
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Or different movies and things

1208
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So it kind of aggregates it all together

1209
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Instead of like

1210
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Oh crap was that show on Netflix

1211
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Or was it on Hulu

1212
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't know I have to go browse Netflix

1213
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh it's not here okay

1214
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Browse Hulu

1215
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Amazon has it

1216
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's smart

1217
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's like a modern day TV guide

1218
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah it's just instead of having

1219
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The Boxy tried doing that

1220
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It does it terribly

1221
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But they tried to do that

1222
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
With a lot of the website streaming services and stuff

1223
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And then of course

1224
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah so it does work

1225
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
With their Bluetooth controllers and stuff

1226
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Let me read some chat comments real quick

1227
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

1228
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Tiger Claw says

1229
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What the Amazon Fire TV lacks

1230
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Is the ability to shop and buy stuff

1231
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
In the Amazon store

1232
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That does seem like a pretty

1233
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Obviously missing thing right

1234
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Well I mean you could

1235
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Well I think

1236
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well I think even with Amazon

1237
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Like when you're using the Amazon movies

1238
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Or TV

1239
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Like I know when you use the app on the Xbox 360

1240
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You're more than welcome to buy those things

1241
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Right there in the app and watch them

1242
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I think you can buy stuff

1243
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah

1244
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You're talking about like buying like off of amazon.com

1245
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah I think that's

1246
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They have mobile apps for them

1247
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And I'm pretty sure that's probably one of the apps

1248
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's in the Amazon marketplace

1249
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah

1250
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Which is not something they probably featured

1251
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Well yeah I mean they're not gonna show

1252
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Every single app that's available for you

1253
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Here's a way you can give us more money

1254
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Let's see

1255
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Kaijuto with some strong opinions on Pocket Minecraft

1256
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Pocket Minecraft blows

1257
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's still in alpha

1258
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Waste of money

1259
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah I have no interest in Pocket Edition

1260
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I do agree with you

1261
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I think it is kind of cheap

1262
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And it's just

1263
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You're saying that

1264
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Ooh it runs Minecraft

1265
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's Android it runs Minecraft

1266
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I mean come on it's you know

1267
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
All Android devices are a hell

1268
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You know all iOS devices run Minecraft

1269
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So

1270
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's not a big deal

1271
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And because this device is based on one of those mobile platforms

1272
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm very interested to see what the PlayStation 4 version brings to the table

1273
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Now granted you know PC

1274
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But I know the console games have started to kind of go their direction

1275
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And the PC kind of has its direction or whatever

1276
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So I'm very curious what the extra oomph of the PlayStation 4 brings to Minecraft

1277
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And I'm not like I know people are going

1278
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But the graphics are never gonna get any better

1279
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I get that

1280
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think they could actually

1281
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
They could

1282
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And the space in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions is limited

1283
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Which you know it's a huge space

1284
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It would be cool if you did like the Sonic ether you know

1285
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Shaders or if you could select what type of shaders you want

1286
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Cause the Sonic ether stuff looks fucking awesome

1287
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Maybe they'll be able to have some of that stuff where you put your own skins

1288
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And things like that in there too

1289
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Like cause you see a little

1290
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They'll sell you skins

1291
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah that's true

1292
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You see a little bit of that in the 360 version

1293
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
With the mass effect and the Skyrim

1294
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They have like the PS3 one now too

1295
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh yeah

1296
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah they don't have like you know dedicated packs

1297
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Where you get like levels and stuff

1298
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But they had one like they had like a city texture pack and stuff

1299
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And they have some character packs but

1300
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Could be interesting

1301
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I mean I don't know it's

1302
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Put it this way like for ninety nine bucks

1303
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That's about the price that you're gonna be paying for a lot of these set top boxes

1304
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
They range around seventy nine to ninety nine anyways

1305
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And the fact that this one is about three times more powerful than those

1306
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It has a dedicated GPU in it

1307
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You might as well get this one even if you don't want a game on it

1308
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Cause maybe there's something down the road you know

1309
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There'll be like some free apps on it or something that you want to try out

1310
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Or who knows what people are gonna develop for

1311
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
If it's popular enough

1312
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Which I think at that price point it's pretty

1313
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's almost an impulse buy for like you know tech stuff

1314
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Well and come Black Friday they're gonna slice it down to seventy nine dollars

1315
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Or something even cheaper

1316
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah I mean

1317
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
For prime people I'm sure

1318
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's definitely like if I didn't have the boxy

1319
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I would definitely consider picking that up

1320
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Now will a drone fly it to my house?

1321
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's what I wanna know

1322
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh I don't think that

1323
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon but

1324
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It would be

1325
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I mean might as well

1326
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I mean cause it's more powerful

1327
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's gonna be able to run even just video apps and stuff

1328
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Better than some of these other systems

1329
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Cause I gotta be honest like

1330
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
My set top box is pretty old

1331
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And it shows it's really laggy

1332
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And just

1333
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I mean it does video okay

1334
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But you know the interfaces are just not very snappy

1335
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So it would be cool to check this out

1336
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That being said though

1337
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm kinda curious to see then

1338
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
If this is really popular how Apple kinda combats it with like a new Apple TV or something

1339
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So I mean cause

1340
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's only a moment

1341
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's only a matter of time before there's like

1342
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Apple's overdue for a press conference I think

1343
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You know you'd be at an iPad update or

1344
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Not the iPhones

1345
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
iPhones would be later in the year but

1346
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
We know there's gonna be like some Apple TV thing at some point

1347
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah absolutely

1348
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Alright well

1349
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There you go

1350
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Well one game that will not be on the Amazon Fire

1351
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because you know what it just

1352
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It just needs

1353
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It needs more oomph behind it

1354
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It needs the kind of oomph that the Wii U can deliver

1355
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And that is Mario Kart 8 is on the horizon

1356
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
There was quite the information dump on Mario Kart 8 this week

1357
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Because we're only what

1358
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
We're about a month and a half out

1359
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I guess maybe two months

1360
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But May 30th is the big day for Mario Kart 8

1361
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And there's new information coming out on the game

1362
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Through some trailers this week

1363
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And it looks great

1364
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
A lot of people very pumped for it

1365
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Which is really good news for Wii U

1366
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Cause there's nothing to get excited about

1367
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It does like it is

1368
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
On the horizon

1369
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I gotta be honest so like

1370
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You know before

1371
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I was just like well

1372
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You know it's just Mario Kart

1373
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It doesn't look that much better

1374
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The new trailer is actually

1375
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It does look a lot better

1376
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I mean game play wise

1377
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm not really sure

1378
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But the tracks look pretty

1379
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And the engine looks nice

1380
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So

1381
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Quickly some of the things that are new

1382
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That were from this trailer

1383
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
There's now a spin boost

1384
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So when you're racing upside down

1385
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Or on walls

1386
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Cause remember this is kind of the new thing

1387
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
For Mario Kart

1388
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Is that it's getting all F-Zero

1389
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And you can be upside down on walls

1390
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You can bump into other racers

1391
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And certain obstacles

1392
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
To get a speed boost

1393
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And there's a spin boost

1394
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That will basically

1395
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
They say is gonna change

1396
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The way players boost

1397
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And everything

1398
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So that could be very interesting

1399
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Some new characters announced

1400
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
That are returning from prior games

1401
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Metal Mario

1402
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Lakitu

1403
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And Shy Guy

1404
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
All coming back

1405
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Which is great

1406
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I loved Shy Guy

1407
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
He was a great racer

1408
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So I'm looking forward to that

1409
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
This is joining the cast

1410
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
With the Kooplings

1411
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And I'm sure a bunch of the other standards

1412
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There as well

1413
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Some new items

1414
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
In the game

1415
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The Piranha Plant

1416
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Which will attach to the front of the car

1417
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And then it chomps at other characters

1418
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Or banana peels on the track

1419
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And even shells

1420
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
No word if that

1421
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Mother fucker blue shell

1422
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Will get eaten by the Piranha Plant

1423
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And you know the blue shell

1424
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Is gonna be invincible

1425
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And everybody's bane

1426
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well like I was reading some comments

1427
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
On people talking about it

1428
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
They said that if they had the blue shell

1429
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Like they had it in Mario Kart 64

1430
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Where it was pretty rare to get it

1431
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Not just like

1432
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh you're in last place

1433
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You're gonna get it every single time

1434
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah yeah yeah

1435
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That would have been a lot better

1436
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Also a new item called the Boomerang Flower

1437
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Which you know

1438
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The Boomerang Hammer Brothers and stuff

1439
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You've seen this item in the Mario games before

1440
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The Boomerang Flower

1441
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Will let you throw a Boomerang at opponents

1442
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And it will stun them

1443
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And the arc that the Boomerang takes

1444
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Will allow you to hit multiple players

1445
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You can throw it forward or backward three times

1446
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That sounds pretty powerful

1447
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They also showed off some remixed courses

1448
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Such as Moo Moo Meadows

1449
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
From Mario Kart Wii

1450
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Toad's Turnpike from 64

1451
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yes

1452
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That's really sweet

1453
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's the best track

1454
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yes

1455
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Donut Plains from Super Mario Kart redesigned

1456
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And instead of going with the retro looking graphics

1457
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
They actually took that old course

1458
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And made it with the new graphics

1459
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I mean it definitely has that retro block look to it

1460
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But you'll see it when you see the video

1461
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Live recorded music

1462
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Which I think is kind of neat

1463
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And yeah various control schemes

1464
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The Wii U gamepad

1465
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
The Wii U Pro Controller

1466
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And the wheel

1467
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Rainbow Road 64

1468
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes

1469
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Looks great

1470
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Fantastic

1471
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Now by the way

1472
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You know one of the kind of most people agree

1473
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This is the weakest game that ever came out in the series

1474
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Maybe not everybody agrees

1475
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But you know not a lot of love for Mario Kart Double Dash

1476
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Over the years

1477
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Which was the GameCube version

1478
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Where two people were racing at a time

1479
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And a very interesting interview with IGN

1480
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Where Hideki Kono said

1481
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Talking about possibly implementing this in the future titles

1482
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Quote

1483
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It wasn't just a simple case of

1484
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Hey we're not going to do that again

1485
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We really think the two racers together

1486
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
In one kart of Double Dash was really unique

1487
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And we thought it worked really well

1488
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We've got that in our pocket

1489
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So if we come up with any new cool ideas

1490
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That utilize having two players racing together

1491
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
We'll grab that

1492
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And possibly bring it back out

1493
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Having two players racing together

1494
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It does have a pretty high cost in terms of processing power

1495
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So that's an obstacle

1496
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That being said

1497
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
If we could come up with some ways around that processing cost

1498
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
We may have two players

1499
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Maybe even three players racing together

1500
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So they're not done with that idea yet

1501
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Maybe I don't know

1502
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I wouldn't exert too much development staff time on that

1503
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So I'm pretty sure that we're not going to see this in Mario Kart 8

1504
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
That just might be something in the future

1505
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
One other quick thing I want to drop in Nintendo News

1506
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Because they did do the info dump on Mario Kart 8

1507
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And I mentioned it's really the only game on the horizon

1508
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That we have to look forward to

1509
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Certainly there's a lot of stuff down the road

1510
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You know like the Bayonetta 2

1511
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And we know there's this stuff way down the road

1512
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Way way down there

1513
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But one of the other games that's inching closer and closer

1514
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Is the new Super Smash Brothers

1515
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They're having a big direct next week

1516
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I believe on Tuesday

1517
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It is a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Smash Brothers

1518
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Some people thinking we're going to get the release date

1519
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm thinking you might

1520
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You might get the month

1521
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday

1522
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday this year or next year

1523
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I think you're going to get the name

1524
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The real name will finally be out there

1525
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So I think that's the big thing that they're going to tell you

1526
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Super Smash Brothers U

1527
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Well it's on 3DS as well

1528
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So I don't know if that's the way they can go with it

1529
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Super Smash Brothers U and 3DS

1530
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
3DU? Who knows? Who knows?

1531
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Alright let's move on

1532
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Dark Sakura

1533
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Well you know I have to say that kids are very resourceful

1534
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And sometimes find ways to make things happen

1535
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And in this case a 5 year old found a security hole in the Xbox One account login

1536
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
A little kid named Christopher

1537
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Tried to log into his dad's Xbox One

1538
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And he didn't know the password

1539
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So all he did was keep entering spaces

1540
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
After every time it failed

1541
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And it let him in

1542
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So basically this was reported

1543
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And Microsoft thanked him for finding the security hole

1544
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Which is actually funny

1545
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It said his dad is a security researcher

1546
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But basically after they found it and recorded it

1547
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Microsoft sent them some gifts as a thank you

1548
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
After of course they patched this out

1549
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So they gave the kid and his dad

1550
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
They acknowledged them as Microsoft security researchers for March 2014

1551
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Gave them $50 for Xbox One games and a year of Xbox Live Gold

1552
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So I guess if a kid's gonna try to sneak into daddy's account

1553
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I guess there are worse things that could happen for it

1554
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But I don't know I think

1555
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It shouldn't have been that easy

1556
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But at least it's something that was when it was discovered

1557
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It was reported and not used maliciously

1558
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Of course then again the dad's also a security researcher

1559
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So that makes sense

1560
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I don't know did you hear about that?

1561
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I heard about it but I mean if there's an exploit

1562
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That a 5 year old can accidentally find

1563
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That's pretty bad

1564
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I mean I don't know

1565
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Why is anyone able to log into someone's account

1566
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
By just hitting the space bar

1567
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Or not the space bar but hitting space a bunch of times

1568
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That's just I don't know

1569
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It seems really lazy

1570
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Well maybe it's just that they didn't figure that

1571
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I mean it could possibly be something that was put in for system testing at the time

1572
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And then they figured it out after the fact

1573
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I don't know

1574
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It just

1575
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So

1576
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Anyways

1577
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So the Xbox One

1578
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh one last thing Kajudo also said that kid broke into his dad's cell phone

1579
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That kid's gonna grow up to be a hacker

1580
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Well he's just a little brat now isn't he

1581
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So the Xbox One

1582
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
One of the things that it kind of lacked

1583
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Compared to some of it's competition

1584
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Is the ability to upgrade it's internal storage

1585
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Well now they're gonna be adding some external storage options

1586
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Coming soon

1587
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Apparently Major Nelson confirmed that

1588
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They will be adding external data support

1589
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And apparently

1590
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
At a later time

1591
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Hopefully that means actual hard drives

1592
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You know a lot of these Xbox One games

1593
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Do require installations

1594
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And hell if you wanted to even go the whole digital route

1595
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
If you're in my opinion dumb enough to do it

1596
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That takes up a lot of space

1597
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And you can only store so much in there in the first place

1598
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And hell they just I think added

1599
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The ability to see what you have on there as far as storage space goes

1600
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Because before it was pretty convoluted

1601
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
What they had on there

1602
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I just don't understand how

1603
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Something like that

1604
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
A core piece of functionality is just

1605
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Eh we'll just get to it later on

1606
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You know we don't really need to have the ability to

1607
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You know install your games on an external device or anything

1608
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
In case you run out of space

1609
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Eh screw that we'll just

1610
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We'll just leave you to fend with the 500 gigabyte hard drive

1611
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Which you know 500 gigabytes is not that bad

1612
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Like the Xbox 360 or something

1613
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But when the file sizes of these games

1614
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Can be up to 10 times the size of an Xbox 360 game

1615
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That adds up pretty fast

1616
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Are you, you don't even

1617
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Is Xbox One even on your radar to get low key so you can

1618
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Oh fuck no

1619
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Eh still not

1620
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Not really ours either

1621
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Unless they announced

1622
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Even like let me put it this way

1623
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Even if they announced that Grand Theft Auto 5

1624
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Was coming next gen

1625
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I would not buy an Xbox One

1626
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's a pretty strong statement

1627
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'll get an Xbox One eventually

1628
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
But it's just gonna take probably the next Halo

1629
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And Quantum Break

1630
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Which I'm anticipating would be this holiday

1631
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't see why they won't

1632
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Or at least

1633
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Even if Halo is not this holiday

1634
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I wonder if they'll do like

1635
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Halo 2 Anniversary Edition or something

1636
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But to be fair though

1637
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Like even the PlayStation 4

1638
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There's not really much that wants me

1639
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know infamous Second Son looks pretty awesome

1640
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I've heard a lot of good things about that one

1641
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You know what might sell me on an Xbox One

1642
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Is if the new Crackdown game was really awesome

1643
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Like that might

1644
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You know the Crackdown is pretty awesome

1645
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I kinda like that game but

1646
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Right now there's just not anything upcoming

1647
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Especially the multiplatform stuff

1648
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Nothing really says oh I need to get this on next gen

1649
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
What if they cut the price for the holiday

1650
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It would have to be by a lot

1651
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Like a lot a lot

1652
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Like we're talking down to $2.99 or something

1653
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I would not

1654
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like even like that's the thing I was looking at

1655
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
We use oh maybe I want Mario Kart 8

1656
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You know maybe

1657
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Maybe I do want one of those systems

1658
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But

1659
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It's just not cheap enough for me

1660
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Like I don't

1661
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm not gonna really buy a system for one game

1662
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And

1663
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You know spending like $200 even

1664
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah $200 or more on it

1665
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Just doesn't seem worth it to me

1666
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1667
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com

1668
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Going to our chatroom over at

1669
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1670
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
VXChaseNXV says who the hell wants to plug in

1671
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Mass storage into their game console

1672
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I don't even like to do that with my computer

1673
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I only do it begrudgingly

1674
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There's probably not a lot of reason for it right now

1675
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
With so many limited games although the games are huge

1676
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But I do know like people like to download

1677
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Especially when you're downloading like entire TV series

1678
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Which you can do on Playstation 3

1679
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And some people have done it

1680
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And Xbox as well

1681
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You need a place to put those files

1682
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The reason why they have it that you can't

1683
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Fucking upgrade your drive in the Xbox

1684
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
One or Xbox 360

1685
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Without buying one that's officially

1686
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
From Microsoft is because they have their

1687
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Fucking stupid file system in there that's

1688
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
What is it? FATX or XFAT

1689
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Or something like that

1690
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's just some really stupid

1691
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
File system that they have that

1692
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Is exclusive to those stupid consoles

1693
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean they have

1694
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
XFAT's not exclusive to a console

1695
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Well they have ways to like you know format them

1696
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
With like you know homemade programs

1697
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And stuff like that but

1698
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's not like it's running

1699
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know FAT32

1700
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Like the Playstation 3 was

1701
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
They don't have just a standardized

1702
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
File system in there

1703
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So you can't just pop in the hard drive

1704
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
They want you to buy the 10 times more expensive

1705
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Hard drive that's going to be exclusive

1706
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
For that console

1707
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Alright well moving on to more Xbox news

1708
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
This news came out early in the week

1709
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That is certainly huge as

1710
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
To the direction of Microsoft

1711
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Phil Spencer who was formerly

1712
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
The corporate vice president of

1713
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Microsoft Studios is now the head of

1714
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Xbox over at Microsoft

1715
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And there was an interview that he did with

1716
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Major Nelson or Larry Erb

1717
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The day that you know or the day after

1718
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It was announced there

1719
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
They're talking a little bit about E3 already

1720
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And you know some of the things hyping up there

1721
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Some people warming up to Phil Spencer because

1722
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It does seem like one of the first things

1723
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He's doing is he's making the conversation about the games

1724
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And he also essentially said

1725
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I mean I'm going to

1726
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Well I do have a quote here I'll say this

1727
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I know a lot of times people give nods to the different forums

1728
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Out there the different communities of people

1729
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I will honestly say I learn a ton

1730
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
From listening to the feedback

1731
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Reading the forum ideas

1732
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I saw just when I was announced in the position

1733
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The first things that Phil Spencer should do as head of Xbox

1734
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
There were a lot of great ideas there

1735
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh yeah I saw that too

1736
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
He better bring back Shenmue 3

1737
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Which I think he said was like the number one most requested game

1738
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
For Xbox

1739
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It's crazy which I don't even know how they would do that

1740
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Without a massive Sega partnership

1741
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Well then Sega let the trademark right now

1742
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
They would just go up to Sega

1743
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And Sega would be like

1744
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh hey what the hell

1745
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
What's all this money being thrown at me

1746
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Hey you want to play a game of Lucky Hit?

1747
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Anyway

1748
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So yeah you know

1749
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You notice that Phil Spencer

1750
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Does seem to be in tune with

1751
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
The internet critics for better or for worse

1752
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't know if that's always necessarily a good thing

1753
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But he does definitely want to take the conversation

1754
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
To games and he's talking about E3

1755
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And how they're already you know

1756
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They don't want to have a bunch of suits up there

1757
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
They want the game makers out on stage

1758
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Talking about the games and you betcha

1759
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They're already planning E3

1760
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I mean they're already talking about you know

1761
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
How many minutes are we going to give

1762
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
What game and how's that all going to go

1763
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
You bet all that stuff is being finalized right now

1764
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So

1765
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm excited to see where Phil Spencer takes the company

1766
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
He certainly qualified for the job

1767
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So let's see what happens

1768
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Hopefully

1769
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We'll appease the people that were not happy

1770
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
With the movies movies movies

1771
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Sports sports sports direction of the Xbox

1772
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But you know what I

1773
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I still think that

1774
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know if Xbox really does

1775
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Make this full fleshed

1776
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Entertainment channel I think that's a huge

1777
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Asset

1778
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I don't think that's really been done

1779
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Like as far as the whole TV integration

1780
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Aside from being able to plug

1781
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'm not even talking about that I'm talking about original content

1782
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Like the Halo thing with Spielberg and some of that stuff

1783
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I don't know

1784
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's almost like the same stuff that we see on Netflix

1785
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And Amazon where they have their own original shows

1786
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I mean that's cool

1787
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But Netflix has Emmy award winning

1788
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Shows like Orange is the New Black

1789
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And House of Cards I don't believe Halo is going to be

1790
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Getting any sort of fucking Emmys

1791
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Well but could they get nerd cred

1792
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Equivalent

1793
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't know I saw their

1794
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Halo live action movie that they just

1795
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Did or whatever someone did

1796
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
They licensed to

1797
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But I just

1798
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Think though the whole point though is they were

1799
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Focusing like oh it's going to be

1800
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
This really integrated experience and stuff like that

1801
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And it kind of reminded me a whole bunch when they were

1802
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Talking about the whole

1803
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Second screen experience that you would get

1804
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
With the

1805
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Xbox 360 even

1806
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And even kind of bringing it back to the Xbox One

1807
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Where it's like oh you can watch Game of Thrones

1808
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And there's all this interactive material on there

1809
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And where is that?

1810
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You know is that going to be happening

1811
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You know today I mean

1812
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Where is that stuff because

1813
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
They talk a big game but

1814
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
In the end it seemed like this is just

1815
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's just like ooh

1816
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I can plug in my cable boxes to the back of

1817
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You know my game system like I could

1818
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
A VCR

1819
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Well it's going to be a very

1820
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Interesting E3 to say the least

1821
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So we will be staying tuned

1822
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And the news is going to

1823
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Start to dry up as we get a little closer to

1824
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
E3 and then once we hit like mid-May

1825
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Then all that news starts kind of leaking out so it's

1826
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Going to be a very interesting ramp up

1827
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Here to the June E3 show

1828
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Anyway more news DarkSakura

1829
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Well everyone knows I'm a big Treasure fan right?

1830
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Well this is something that's pretty happy

1831
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So basically

1832
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Treasure is actually working with Capcom to make

1833
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
A sequel to

1834
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The game that they did on 3DS

1835
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Called Geist Crusher

1836
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And they're actually doing a version called

1837
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Geist Crusher God

1838
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That is basically

1839
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You go around and

1840
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Hunt boss creatures and kill them

1841
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's the game but it's Treasure

1842
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So you know it's always got a twist to it

1843
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Really neat game but I thought that this one

1844
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Given that Treasure has done

1845
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Nothing but awesome games

1846
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Would definitely be something a lot of people would want to keep on their radar

1847
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
The

1848
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
The uh

1849
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Just the voice acting though in the trailer

1850
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Is pretty hilarious

1851
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This is Geist Crusher God

1852
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You know so it's like

1853
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It sounds like they're really gonna

1854
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Push for that level

1855
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So yeah just a little something

1856
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Alright well I'm sure that makes you happy

1857
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
To hear about what's going on there

1858
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I love Treasure

1859
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Well let's talk about games that will be coming out a little bit

1860
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Sooner as we travel around the world and look at

1861
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The release dates

1862
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Loki why don't you start off with the US

1863
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Loki you're dead quiet again

1864
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I think you turned the mic on

1865
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Ok so anyways as I was saying

1866
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The Xbox 360 version

1867
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Of Titanfall was finally released

1868
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That is coming out

1869
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And from what I hear

1870
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's actually pretty good

1871
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Except it runs at 30 frames per second

1872
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
There's that I guess

1873
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Also this week Lego The Hobbit

1874
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Which is coming out on Playstation 3

1875
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Xbox 360, Playstation 4

1876
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Xbox One

1877
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
3DS and Vita

1878
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And PC

1879
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The Wii U version

1880
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Though not coming out yet

1881
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Which is kind of surprising

1882
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And then um

1883
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Also later this week we've got

1884
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
A game called Putty Squad

1885
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
On Vita and Playstation 3

1886
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Lego Friends on the DS

1887
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And

1888
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Hopefully still coming out this week

1889
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Not delayed again but Hello Kitty Cruisers

1890
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
On the Wii U

1891
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I guess that was released digitally already

1892
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But the physical version is just

1893
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Not out yet

1894
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And also

1895
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The one game I think that so far

1896
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Is actually going to be utilizing the Kinect

1897
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
In a non-danced way

1898
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Kinect Sports Rivals coming to

1899
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Xbox One this week

1900
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Might be worth picking up

1901
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
If you have that

1902
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And Jamie

1903
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
This is something that you might want to pick up

1904
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Disney Magical World

1905
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
For 3DS coming out on Friday

1906
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That's that game that crosses

1907
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Kind of like Animal Crossing with Disney characters

1908
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I need this in my life

1909
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So there's that

1910
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Alright well traveling to Japan

1911
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Yay I'm traveling to Japan

1912
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Looking at the releases there

1913
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Hey there's a Playstation 4 game out in Japan this week

1914
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000

So

1932
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
A few games there on the Playstation 3

1933
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
On the Xbox 360 this week just Titanfall

1934
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Titanfall gets its Japanese release as well

1935
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
On the 360 this week

1936
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
On the Playstation Vita

1937
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Some similar games there

1938
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The Oretache ni Subasa wa Nai

1939
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Under the Innocent Sky is out there

1940
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
As is the Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters game

1941
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Those are both out on the Vita this week

1942
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
On April the 10th

1943
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And on the Wii U this week

1944
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Nothing, they don't have anything until a Monster Hunter

1945
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
That comes out on April 23rd

1946
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But the 3DS does have

1947
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Crayon Shin-chan

1948
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Crayon Shin-chan still

1949
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Arashi wo Yobu

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Kasukabe Iga Stars

1951
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
From Bandai Namco

1952
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That's a series that won't die

1953
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
That is out on the 3DS this week

1954
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And that is a series that won't die

1955
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But you can make your own mini movies

1956
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And stuff it looks like

1957
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And look, there's Booty

1958
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
In this little cartoon Booty

1959
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
In the game

1960
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Doesn't he usually have his pants down or something like that?

1961
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I think that's the joke

1962
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
There you go, that's the releases for Japan

1963
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

1964
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Well on the 8th we have

1965
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Looks like

1966
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It's not actually in the name, I think it's 0

1967
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
On PS4 and Xbox One

1968
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000

And another one on PC

1975
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That they're not giving me the name of

1976
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Which I'm going to see if I can find out what it is

1977
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Oh Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online

1978
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Well good news for Lego The Hobbit fans

1986
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys

1987
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
This is the classic game of the week

1988
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it's a good one tonight

1989
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Alright, so this is kind of disappointing

1990
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But apparently the Resistance

1991
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Games, they are going offline

1992
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Starting April 8th

1993
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And that is of course the online

1994
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Multiplayer portion of the game

1995
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You will not be able to play that anymore

1996
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Come April 8th

1997
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't know, I had a lot of fun

1998
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Playing Resistance, the first one at least

1999
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Split screen multiplayer

2000
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That was kind of fun to be able to do that

2001
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Didn't really get too much into

2002
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Two or three of those

2003
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Still disappointing to see that

2004
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
They are taking that down

2005
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Not a lot of people are playing it anymore

2006
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Alright, well one more thing going offline

2007
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Not just Resistance going offline

2008
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But this one is having a huge impact

2009
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
The GameSpy network is going offline

2010
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
This is going offline

2011
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
On May 31st

2012
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
We sort of saw the hint of this coming

2013
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
When Nintendo suddenly decided they were going to

2014
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Pull the Wii online stuff

2015
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And it was theorized that

2016
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
There is probably something larger going on with GameSpy

2017
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And that they are increasing fees

2018
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And Nintendo didn't want to pay them

2019
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Sure enough, the whole damn plug is getting pulled

2020
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
On all of GameSpy

2021
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
GameSpy technologies

2022
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Closing the matchmaking service on May 31st

2023
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
This is really the end of an era

2024
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Because I remember using GameSpy to find a game of

2025
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Quake to play online

2026
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Correct me if I'm wrong though

2027
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Aren't some modern games actually using GameSpy

2028
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Borderlands does

2029
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Yes, Borderlands does use GameSpy

2030
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So there are some games that

2031
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
We are out there

2032
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That are no longer going to work anymore

2033
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Now I don't think

2034
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Anybody has used GameSpy since

2035
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
2010

2036
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Which is when Borderlands 1

2037
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But Borderlands 2 uses it as well

2038
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
No it doesn't, Borderlands 2 doesn't use GameSpy

2039
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Are you sure about that?

2040
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I think it uses Steamworks

2041
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Chatter can correct me if I'm wrong

2042
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So yeah, if the company doesn't have the funding

2043
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Or the reason to go back and

2044
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Make another network work with the game

2045
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It's going to not work anymore

2046
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So this shouldn't be a huge surprise

2047
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
GameSpy stopped making editorial content

2048
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
In 2013

2049
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Glue Mobile, the mobile games publisher

2050
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Actually bought this in 2012

2051
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
They kind of just ran it into the ground

2052
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Literally

2053
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And Bobby Blackwolf confirmed that

2054
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Borderlands 2 used GameSpy

2055
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And what's funny is that Bobby said

2056
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
When he interviewed them, I even asked them that

2057
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And they were like, no, fuck GameSpy

2058
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So I guess they're not too happy

2059
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
About the first time around, who knows

2060
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So, yeah, again, the end of an era

2061
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
GameSpy was originally launched actually

2062
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
As a Quake server search program

2063
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I used to use that to play Quake games

2064
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Man, I miss those days

2065
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So

2066
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Alright, well

2067
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Let's see what we got here

2068
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
So we've got

2069
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright, well

2070
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
You know, here on this show we like to

2071
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Look back at an era long gone

2072
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
With a segment we call the classic game of the week

2073
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
DarkSakura's going to dive into the gaming vault

2074
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And find a game that she thinks, hey

2075
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You should play this game right now

2076
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
If you can find it

2077
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
DarkSakura, in the original form

2078
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Good luck

2079
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic

2080
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Game of the week?

2081
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The classic game of the week

2082
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
The classic game of the week is

2083
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

2084
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
What?

2085
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Sorry, I was trying to get your attention offline

2086
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You okay over there?

2087
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
No, my mic got caught under the cord

2088
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Oh no

2089
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The joys of live radio, there we go

2090
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Alright, so

2091
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
As we were saying, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

2092
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yep

2093
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And of course the one with enough music

2094
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
To actually play is the

2095
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
1990 version

2096
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I am specifically referring to the original

2097
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That came out in 1985

2098
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
When I was nine years old

2099
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I would play the crap

2100
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Out of this game

2101
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And it was

2102
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Released

2103
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Like I said in 1985

2104
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And distributed by the World

2105
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Ominak and Books of Facts

2106
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That was published by Feros Books

2107
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It was

2108
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Included with some versions

2109
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Of the Amiga 500

2110
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And there was also like I said

2111
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
An enhanced version that came out in 1990

2112
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
That did not have the

2113
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Ominak copy protection

2114
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But it had disc based copy protection

2115
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And there was a further deluxe

2116
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Expanded version that came out in 1992

2117
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So basically

2118
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
You have to use your knowledge

2119
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Of geography and clues

2120
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
To chase down Carmen's henchmen

2121
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Or henchwomen

2122
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Because there were henchwomen

2123
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Then eventually arrest Carmen herself

2124
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So you'd have to go to the country

2125
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
That the crime happened

2126
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And then use hints about where to go next

2127
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And you basically chase all over the world

2128
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And some of the, there were some fun

2129
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Jokes, you know there were definitely some puns

2130
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Going about

2131
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And some inaccuracies

2132
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
For some of the pictures

2133
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Like for example

2134
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
When you go to Peru instead of

2135
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Showing you a picture of Lima when you're there

2136
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It actually shows you Machu Picchu

2137
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But at any rate

2138
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
If you go to the incorrect location

2139
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You get fake clues

2140
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And you have to backtrack

2141
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Until you can find which way

2142
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
The vile henchmen went to

2143
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's V-I-L-E

2144
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And then your case will run

2145
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Out of time

2146
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And your culprit will escape

2147
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And basically you're reporting to Interpol

2148
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And everything

2149
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So eventually though if you do keep going

2150
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Along the case you can basically

2151
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Exclude all but one of the suspects

2152
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then you can

2153
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Issue an arrest warrant which is actually really

2154
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Inaccurate because

2155
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I love some of the cheesy animations that were in the game

2156
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Like you have a little burglar dancing across the screen right now

2157
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's V-I-L-E henchmen

2158
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
The arrest warrant thing

2159
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Was actually super inaccurate because

2160
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Interpol actually uses what's called red notices

2161
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Which means that you have

2162
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
The right to ask the local government

2163
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
To arrest somebody instead of you

2164
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Actually having an arrest warrant

2165
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
You have to go through the local governments

2166
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Anyway, going back to the game world

2167
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You can be promoted

2168
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
If you answer different geography questions

2169
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Right

2170
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And you use the reference book that came with the program

2171
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So it's really

2172
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Edutainment

2173
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
As far as some of the different locations

2174
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
That are in the game

2175
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You had Buenos Aires

2176
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You had Sydney

2177
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You had

2178
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Bamako in Mali

2179
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You had Tokyo

2180
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You had

2181
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Moscow

2182
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
All kinds of places all over the world

2183
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And there's something else

2184
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That really came along with this

2185
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
There's been certain things

2186
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Kept canon

2187
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Through different versions of the game

2188
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I think

2189
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's been established that there are different universes

2190
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
For the Carmen Sandiego franchise

2191
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But there's one thing that's always

2192
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Remained constant

2193
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Is Carmen herself

2194
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Her outfits have changed

2195
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And they've changed her hair color like once

2196
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But she's always been

2197
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Latina

2198
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And always

2199
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Really strong and in control of the company

2200
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And her vile group

2201
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
But the whole point of it was that

2202
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
She was doing it for the challenge

2203
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And not necessarily for any kind of

2204
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Really overly malicious

2205
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Purpose

2206
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And the fact that she can keep all these people

2207
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Under control

2208
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Is a really tightly run, I'd say, organization

2209
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's actually made her

2210
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Kind of a role model

2211
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
For young girls

2212
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Even if, yeah, she's breaking the law

2213
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
But still

2214
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
There were, of course, many other games

2215
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In the series

2216
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
We've had

2217
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Multiple versions of

2218
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

2219
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We've had the Treasures of Knowledge version

2220
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
That came out in 2001

2221
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And then

2222
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
There were also

2223
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Where in Time

2224
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Is Carmen Sandiego

2225
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There were also various

2226
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Other, there was Where in the USA

2227
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Where in Space

2228
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Junior Detective Where in America

2229
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Has Passed

2230
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Where in North Dakota, which was a prototype

2231
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Where in Time is probably one of my favorites

2232
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Because I was really good at it

2233
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
There was Where in Europe

2234
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Where in the USA

2235
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Think Quick Challenge

2236
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Great Chase Through Time World Detective

2237
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Math Detective Treasures of Knowledge

2238
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Secret of the Stolen Drums

2239
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Uh, Mystéral Baud de Monde

2240
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Wow, I didn't even know all these other ones

2241
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Actually, you talking about the other versions

2242
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I'm gonna use this opportunity to switch over

2243
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
To some footage from the original

2244
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

2245
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yeah

2246
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Uh, there was also

2247
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Um, the TV

2248
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Show, which was Where in the World

2249
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Where in Time, Where on Earth was an animation

2250
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And Where in the Universe was a planetarium

2251
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Show. There were also albums

2252
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
That was Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

2253
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And Out of This World

2254
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So, uh, we've had

2255
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Tons of, uh, different

2256
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You know, pretty reputable, uh, publishers

2257
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And distributors. We had PBS

2258
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Uh, okay, I will

2259
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Take anything with Fox

2260
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
With a grain of salt, but it was Fox Family Channel

2261
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And Fox Kids

2262
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But we've had, uh, BAM Entertainment

2263
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Mindscape, uh, The Learning Company

2264
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Broderbund, which was the original publisher

2265
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Or developer, I should say

2266
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Uh, just all kinds of, you know, really

2267
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Good, I think, has come

2268
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Out of, uh,

2269
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
You know, the franchise

2270
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And, of course, you also worked for the

2271
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
ACME Detective Agency

2272
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That worked worldwide

2273
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So

2274
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But I'm trying to see

2275
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Okay, ACME VILE

2276
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Was, um, let's see if I can find what VILE

2277
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Stood for, because that was the one

2278
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Thing that's eluding me

2279
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Um

2280
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Okay, VILE was not an acronym

2281
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It was just V-I-L-E

2282
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But it didn't really

2283
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It didn't really mean anything

2284
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So that's probably why I didn't know what it meant

2285
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So, there you go

2286
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And, of course, the leader of ACME is the chief

2287
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Who was a sassy black lady

2288
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That didn't need no man

2289
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
She was awesome

2290
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
In the TV show, yes, which everybody in chat

2291
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Talking about the TV show, dying for me to play the theme

2292
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But, well, you have to stay tuned

2293
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
To the very end of the show

2294
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
That's right, you just sit down and shut up and wait

2295
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Maybe the same person who picks the classic game

2296
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Also picks the fortune cookie

2297
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So

2298
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But, yeah, that's

2299
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

2300
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

2301
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Maybe in China, according to this player right now

2302
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Who knows, so there it is, your classic game of the week

2303
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

2304
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Great series

2305
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
One of the all-time best

2306
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Vegetainment games from my youth

2307
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You've got Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

2308
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Number Munchers

2309
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And

2310
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Oregon Trail, that's about it

2311
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Those are the huge ones from Oregon

2312
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Oregon Trail

2313
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Dungeon Buster says

2314
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Do you think they retconned that in?

2315
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Through the Meaning has consistently been maintained

2316
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Since 1985

2317
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Well, see, I didn't realize that

2318
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It wasn't in any of my stuff

2319
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So

2320
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
You learned something from our chat room today

2321
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Well, I forgot anyway

2322
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I haven't touched the game in like

2323
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Probably since I was 11

2324
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You know, Jamie, it's okay

2325
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It's okay to make mistakes

2326
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
You know what, I'm making the big W off

2327
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The line because it's the whatevs

2328
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Whatever

2329
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Alright

2330
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000

Game of Swords or whatever's done

01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Finally did a

2355
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Chair of Swords one

2356
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I like the compilation of

2357
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
All the death scenes

2358
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Featuring the most uncomfortable chair ever

2359
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But anyway, all that stuff

2360
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
All that is hopefully wrapping up

2361
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
By now so some of you guys might be joining us

2362
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Just after that

2363
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Well you missed some chatter in the first

2364
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We were talking about April Fools Joke

2365
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
The new Amazon Fire, Mario Kart 8

2366
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So you're just going to have to

2367
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Check this out on the podcast feed

2368
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Which will be available

2369
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Tomorrow morning

2370
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Both on iTunes Store

2371
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And of course Stitcher Radio

2372
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And if you do listen to us, wherever it is

2373
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
You listen to our show on the podcast

2374
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Or what have you, be sure to leave us a nice

2375
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Review, help spread the word about the show

2376
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
We really appreciate it

2377
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh Jason's telling me in chat, wrestling is not over

2378
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Oh well

2379
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I thought it was because people started showing up all of a sudden

2380
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So I was like, oh maybe it's finished

2381
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Fine, maybe it'll be done by the time phone calls start

2382
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Alright

2383
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
In the meantime, let's get some rapid fire

2384
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
News

2385
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Let's start with Loki

2386
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Alright so this was a game I actually played

2387
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
At least the second one in the series

2388
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Metro

2389
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
You may remember

2390
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light

2391
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Well there was something that leaked

2392
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Out that was apparently

2393
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
An internal document from Deep Silver

2394
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
And it was showing

2395
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
A title called Metro Redux

2396
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Which is basically

2397
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
A redo

2398
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Or

2399
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
An HDerfied

2400
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
New version of those two games

2401
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
For consoles for Playstation 4 and

2402
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Xbox One

2403
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It was later confirmed

2404
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Actually by 4A Games

2405
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And Deep Silver

2406
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That it is a title that's in development

2407
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And they're going to be sharing more

2408
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
They say this side of E3

2409
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Sometime before E3

2410
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
You'll find out more about it

2411
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And

2412
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I don't know, I'd be excited about that

2413
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Cause those games are pretty good

2414
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Had really good storylines

2415
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
The Grand Theft Auto 5

2416
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
iFruit app

2417
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Is now available on Vita

2418
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
That was something that was released originally

2419
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
On Windows Phone, iOS

2420
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And Android

2421
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
That was basically like a little fake

2422
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
The iFruit is their

2423
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Apple clone in the game

2424
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And it had a bunch of different apps

2425
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
On there for customizing your cars

2426
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Customizing your license plates

2427
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And they even had a little Tamagotchi game

2428
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
For Chop where you can kind of train

2429
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And raise them

2430
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Now you can do that if you have a Vita

2431
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That's kind of cool

2432
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And it is free to download

2433
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It works with the Playstation 3 version of the game of course

2434
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And last but not least

2435
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
The Call of Duty

2436
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Ghost Devastation

2437
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
DLC

2438
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Is seriously Jump the Shark

2439
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I gotta be honest

2440
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I don't know what the fuck

2441
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Other than having fun with the series

2442
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Cool, that's awesome

2443
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
But like

2444
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
The stuff that they've done for Call of Duty

2445
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Hasn't really made a lot of sense for ghosts

2446
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
They have

2447
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Basically the ability

2448
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
To play as the predator in one of the maps

2449
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And what they've done

2450
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Kind of with

2451
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Call of Duty Ghost is each map has its own

2452
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Kind of like

2453
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Basically it's like a killstreak that you get

2454
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
That's exclusive to that map

2455
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And one of them in this case is actually

2456
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Playing as the predator

2457
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And I think one of the other maps

2458
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I think it was Ghost

2459
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I don't think it was Black Ops 2

2460
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
But Ghost had it

2461
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I want to say where there was a map where you could play as Michael Myers

2462
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
From Halloween

2463
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
What do you mean William Shatner?

2464
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
So

2465
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It's just

2466
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I don't know, cool

2467
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
They're having fun with it

2468
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
People enjoy that kind of thing, that's cool

2469
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That actually launched last week

2470
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
On Xbox One

2471
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Xbox 360

2472
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
The

2473
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 versions

2474
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I'm assuming are coming later on

2475
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Oh and PC later on as well

2476
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Xbox gets that exclusive window

2477
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Alright well

2478
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Moving on to a short

2479
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Window of time for you to get tickets

2480
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
For the Dota 2

2481
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
International 2014

2482
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The Dota 2 International

2483
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Championship for 2014

2484
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Is taking place at the Key Arena in Seattle

2485
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It will be taking place from

2486
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
July 18th to July 21st

2487
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And if you wanted to go

2488
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Well guess what, you're already out of luck

2489
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Because the tickets sold out in an hour

2490
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So you had one hour window to catch that

2491
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
10,000 tickets sold within an hour

2492
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So Dota 2

2493
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It's kind of popular there

2494
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
So you can check that out in Seattle

2495
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Huh? A bit

2496
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Yeah you can check that out in Seattle at the Key Arena

2497
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
You can get your tickets on eBay

2498
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
To go see that

2499
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
The Key Arena, that's where the

2500
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Supersonics used to play

2501
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But sadly Seattle doesn't have a team anymore

2502
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And they were unsuccessful in taking ours

2503
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So Key Arena, at least still able to have

2504
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
These big events such as the Dota 2 International

2505
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
You can try to find the tickets on eBay

2506
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If you really want to go

2507
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
But I'm sure they'll sell the whole viewing passes

2508
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Online and all that good stuff

2509
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Blizzard

2510
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Taking Hearthstone

2511
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Finally to the iPad

2512
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
They've been talking about doing this for a little bit

2513
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
When they first announced the game

2514
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And now that the game is live

2515
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
It's time to start the 18 month beta process

2516
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
That Blizzard will go through

2517
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I'm exaggerating here

2518
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
But with Hearthstone on the iPad

2519
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But here's the catch, you can only download this

2520
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
In Australia, Canada, and New Zealand

2521
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Those are the only places where Hearthstone

2522
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Is actually available on the store

2523
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But some of you crafty people have figured out

2524
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
How you make an account in another country

2525
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
You can download the game to your device anyway

2526
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
There's quite a few people that are doing that

2527
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So there's all these walkthroughs out there

2528
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It doesn't involve anything about having iTunes cards

2529
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
For those countries, does it?

2530
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I don't think so

2531
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I know that's the way that they do it for music

2532
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
But don't quote me

2533
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I don't care enough about Hearthstone

2534
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
To go to the Canadian store and make a fake account

2535
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And download it

2536
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Neither do I, but

2537
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
But with like a review, a review would be nice

2538
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Well I reviewed it on the PC

2539
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I mean hearing more from our listeners

2540
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
In those countries, we would like reviews from them

2541
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh sure, of course, of course

2542
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I'd like to hear if you thought it was as mediocre as I did

2543
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
There you go

2544
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Hearthstone on the iPad

2545
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I know there's some fans out there

2546
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
That are gonna be angry at me for saying that

2547
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But you know, I got my opinion

2548
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
You got yours, email us if you want

2549
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Participate at orangeslawnsradio.com

2550
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Lastly, this was news

2551
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
This is actually old news

2552
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
But it slipped under our radar

2553
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So I need to bring this up

2554
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Because this news came out the week that we had the short show

2555
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Because I was moving

2556
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So this completely was not on our radar

2557
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
But it was brought to my attention this week

2558
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
That there is a Gauntlet reboot happening

2559
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And there's a trailer out there now

2560
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And you can actually check this out

2561
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Maybe I'll play a little bit of this here in studio

2562
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I don't remember

2563
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
If there's narration or what have you

2564
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
But just for Dark Soccer's sake

2565
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
You can see there it's coming from WB Games

2566
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It better have the music

2567
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I don't think it does have the original music

2568
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Crying

2569
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But you can see there it's very Diablo-esque in how it looks

2570
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So it looks like it's taking elements of Gauntlet

2571
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And mixing it with Diablo

2572
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Okay

2573
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
So that's what the new Gauntlet looks like

2574
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And luckily they still call them

2575
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf

2576
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
They try to give them names and all this stuff

2577
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
This is Bob the Elf

2578
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
We have Gertrude the Valkyrie

2579
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
They're saying it is a completely modernized action RPG

2580
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's going to be direct to digital

2581
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
WB Games vault

2582
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Which means you're pretty much only going to be able to get it

2583
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
On the Steam

2584
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And those types of places

2585
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
What is interesting about this though

2586
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It's being made by Arrowhead as I mentioned

2587
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
You may not know their other game

2588
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But it's Magica

2589
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Magica was cute

2590
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah Magica was a huge game

2591
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And it was pretty cool

2592
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And the Tron Robes

2593
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yeah the Tron Robes and all that stuff

2594
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So those are the people we can Gauntlet

2595
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So that's pretty exciting there

2596
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
So there you go

2597
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Gauntlet is being remade

2598
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And supposedly out this summer

2599
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
On digital platforms

2600
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Which means the price should be right as well

2601
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
We'll see

2602
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

2603
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney

2604
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Okay

2605
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So yeah

2606
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
As Loki said during the last part

2607
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Disney's Magical World 3DS

2608
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Is supposed to be coming out

2609
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
But there is a

2610
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
It's supposed to be an exclusive

2611
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
The 3DS XL that goes with it

2612
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Is an exclusive for Walmart

2613
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And I don't care enough to go to Walmart to get it

2614
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But there will also be coming out

2615
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
There's the Mickey 3DS XL

2616
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
There's also a Peach Pink Nintendo 2DS

2617
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That's an exclusive for GameStop

2618
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
That will be coming out to celebrate

2619
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Disney's Magical World launch

2620
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
The game will be out on April 11th

2621
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And you know my birthday is this month

2622
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Just saying people

2623
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Also there are Australian ratings out for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

2624
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
F-Zero GP Legend

2625
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I'm starting to get tongue tied

2626
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And those are listed for the Wii U's Gameboy Advance store

2627
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So we should be seeing those probably before too long

2628
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And then last but not least

2629
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
There is a statement from the Sonic Lost World producer

2630
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Who wants to do more Nintendo DLC

2631
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
That's Iizuka Takashi

2632
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Who created Sonic Lost World

2633
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Basically wants to do more levels

2634
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Working with Nintendo

2635
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But that could be for Zelda or Yoshi levels

2636
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
It could use other Nintendo IPs

2637
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
But it is just different things that they want to do

2638
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Going out for Sonic Lost World

2639
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And that's it

2640
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Alright

2641
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
That Sonic Lost World DLC sure looked interesting

2642
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I didn't believe

2643
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I thought it was like an April Fools Joker

2644
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I didn't believe it was a thing until I actually was

2645
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Seeing the screenshots and the videos in motion

2646
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I was like wow

2647
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I didn't think they were going to go that far with it

2648
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
But that's kind of neat

2649
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Alright

2650
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

2651
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Every week we ask a question on our Facebook

2652
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And our Google Plus communities

2653
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
You slam those words together and you get

2654
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Foogle

2655
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Let's get to the question

2656
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Which has to do with that new fangled Amazon fire

2657
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
We were talking about earlier

2658
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
When we posted to our communities

2659
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
A new challenger approaches

2660
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
The long rumors

2661
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Of Amazon jumping into the

2662
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Gaming arena proved true this week

2663
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
With the announcement of the Amazon fire

2664
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
What did you think of the announcement?

2665
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Do you think the Amazon fire will impact gaming?

2666
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And more importantly, are you getting one?

2667
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Let's get to some of the answers

2668
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Our buddy Shane answered

2669
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Shane Alinko answered

2670
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And said is this not the Ouya 2.0

2671
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
But maybe done better?

2672
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I have faith that Amazon will support it

2673
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But I don't think it's going to be huge competition

2674
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Let's get to the main three

2675
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
No desire to get one because of that

2676
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Critical Myth

2677
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
The man behind tv.vognetwork.com

2678
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
With his crew over at the Critical Myth show

2679
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Says it's a bit closer

2680
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
To what the Ouya claimed it would be

2681
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
But I still don't see a need for it

2682
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Those already using the Amazon

2683
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Fire services might feel differently

2684
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Brett the Hayes says

2685
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I like the idea that someone like Amazon

2686
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Is trying this out despite their efforts

2687
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
With the not so warm reception of the Fire tablets

2688
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Since they have somewhat of an ecosystem

2689
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
In place already

2690
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I don't think they'll do anything for hardcore gaming

2691
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Except maybe push Sony to bring Vita TV

2692
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
To the US

2693
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It is interesting that one Amazon

2694
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Exec was making a distinction that this device

2695
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Is not a gaming device

2696
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And probably shows their fear of ending up like

2697
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Ouya and probably why they're marketing

2698
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
The Fire TV as a set-top box

2699
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
First

2700
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Blood Drunk says

2701
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Never really had any interest in those TV boxes

2702
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
The announcement of Fire TV doesn't really change that

2703
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I still think that having a laptop

2704
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And desktop plugged in with wireless keyboard and mouse

2705
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Is the way to go

2706
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
More power and diversity

2707
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Burr replied and said

2708
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I think it has the best chance of making an Android

2709
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
A credible console platform

2710
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But in the end it's stuck in a hard place

2711
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Where anything with wide enough appeal would probably play just as well

2712
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
On a tablet or smartphone

2713
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And anything that would get the hardcore gamer's attention

2714
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Would have to compete with more established platforms

2715
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Felipe A. replied

2716
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I hope I said your name right

2717
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Fire TV will be a great boost

2718
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
To the local economies it is marketed in

2719
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The amount of jobs created to dispose of them

2720
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Will open up new positions in the waste management sector

2721
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Not since the plastic guitars from Guitar Hero

2722
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Or the Ouya

2723
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Has a sizable increase in landfill size

2724
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Been needed

2725
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Anyone here owning a Zune or a Gizmondo

2726
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Knows

2727
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Well where things like this end up

2728
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Welcome to your new home Fire TV

2729
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That was a sassy answer

2730
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I don't think it's gonna go anywhere

2731
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
He's saying it's going to the dump

2732
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Going with your game.com

2733
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What the hell were those tacos

2734
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Hey for the record we gave our game comms away

2735
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
What were the taco phones called

2736
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The Nokia

2737
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The Engage

2738
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
We gave those away too and I think we sold one

2739
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
It's because they didn't have Patrick Stewart as a pitchman

2740
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
For that you know that's why that didn't end up working out

2741
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Engage

2742
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Alright

2743
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Nemesis 47 replies and said

2744
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Though this has potential it's not going to be enough

2745
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
To beat the big three as far as gaming

2746
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And will be the next Ouya

2747
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I don't got any intention of buying the system

2748
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I'll stick to my PlayStation 3

2749
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Tech 2030 says

2750
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I think this will have a better chance of being a third

2751
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Console than something like Ouya or GameStick

2752
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Considering it has great

2753
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Video streaming functionality

2754
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Our pal Tiara replies

2755
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And she says this will be the Philips

2756
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
CDI of a new generation

2757
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Ouch

2758
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And Tigerclaw says

2759
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It could do better than the Ouya

2760
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
If the processing power is better

2761
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Which we know it's going to be so

2762
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
We'll see

2763
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Going over to Google Plus I don't want to ignore our

2764
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Pals over there on Google Plus

2765
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Again you can follow us on Google Plus

2766
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
If you just go to

2767
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Google.com

2768
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Slash plus orange lounge radio

2769
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
And

2770
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
We didn't get a single answer on Google Plus

2771
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Hey Rob

2772
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Confirmed you guys

2773
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
No one's using Google Plus

2774
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I was just thinking if we're calling it Fugal

2775
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Would the opposite be Goobook

2776
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
We could call it Goobook I don't know

2777
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Is that, it's a little

2778
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That's a little bit more even between Google and

2779
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Facebook

2780
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
But yeah not a single answer on our Google

2781
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Where's actdeft and Flaco Jones

2782
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Redertainment the guys that usually answer over there

2783
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
They're eating a pizza

2784
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You're all watching Wrestlemania

2785
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Everyone's talking about trying to compete with

2786
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Home consoles it's not

2787
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It's trying to be a set top box

2788
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It's trying to push Amazon shit

2789
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
That they have on Android

2790
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
And their services like their video streaming services

2791
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
That's all it is

2792
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That being said though

2793
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It's going to be way fucking better than the Ouya

2794
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And I think they've already said

2795
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That they're probably going to get the

2796
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Was it the

2797
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Ouya the run on it anyway

2798
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So

2799
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You know

2800
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
What's interesting and I think very telling

2801
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
About those answers I don't think a single person in there

2802
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Said they're getting one

2803
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Not a single one I mean granted

2804
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Us gamers were not the target audience

2805
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I suppose but I don't know

2806
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Well like I wouldn't get it for any of the games that they have

2807
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
On there cause like you know

2808
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Had it come out like several years ago

2809
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Before Minecraft

2810
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Was on consoles then that would have been like

2811
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Oh yeah I can play Minecraft on my

2812
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
TV now but now it's just like

2813
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Eh whatever

2814
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Alright

2815
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Well let's move on with some more news

2816
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Low key

2817
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So there's a survey sent out

2818
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
About the Playstation 4 and mainly

2819
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
The Playstation network services and stuff

2820
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And there's some stuff that they were asking about

2821
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
That

2822
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Kind of leads people to believe that

2823
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
They're going to be doing a reputation system

2824
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Kind of like what they have on the Xbox One

2825
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Which I think is a great idea

2826
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Basically saying the system would assign

2827
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Users reputation ratings

2828
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Based on feedback from fellow players

2829
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And mentions

2830
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I guess an improved matchmaking system

2831
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Also they were saying that

2832
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It was going to take reputation into

2833
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Considerational appearance so basically

2834
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
What I want to see is

2835
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I want to see

2836
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Amazon style reviews

2837
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
For players like on your profile

2838
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
This player

2839
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Sucks one star

2840
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
No that sounds like it would be horrible

2841
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I can't even imagine

2842
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Oh my gosh

2843
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You'd have the people that found it helpful

2844
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
People that didn't find it helpful

2845
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
You know

2846
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
A metacritic score maybe

2847
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Can you imagine what your profile would say

2848
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
This guy is so angry and he kicked my ass

2849
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
At grand theft auto 5

2850
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I don't talk on my headset really

2851
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
No because I'm in the room with

2852
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yes if my co-workers

2853
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Were playing with me

2854
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
They would probably fill me out

2855
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And say quite negative things about me

2856
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
They always say I'm hacking

2857
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Even though

2858
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I can play any

2859
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
We've switched consoles so many times now

2860
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's like oh he's hacking

2861
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Fine I'll beat you on your console

2862
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I'll play on yours you play on mine

2863
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Oh he's just hacking that one now too

2864
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
People

2865
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Alright

2866
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Let's go to

2867
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Some more news

2868
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
This is kind of interesting

2869
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Where have your favorite franchises ended up?

2870
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Going to

2871
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Pachinko machines

2872
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And the newest characters that will be coming

2873
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
To Pachinko machines

2874
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown

2875
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
What?

2876
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
These are Pachi's slot machines

2877
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That are headed for Japan

2878
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Yeah SNK Playmore is using

2879
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
The Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown names

2880
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
To make these Japanese

2881
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Slot machines which are I guess

2882
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I've never played these but I guess it's kind of like Pachinko

2883
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
They don't license anything

2884
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I mean seriously remember when they were licensing

2885
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
What was that I think

2886
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I don't know if it was Samurai's Showdown

2887
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Or King of Fighters or something

2888
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It was that Shmup game

2889
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I think it was the King of Fighters Shmup game

2890
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Well these series haven't had

2891
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Games in a very very very long time

2892
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
So Fatal Fury Premium

2893
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Is one of the games

2894
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And Samurai Spirits

2895
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Because that's what it was always called overseas

2896
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
There's actually trailers

2897
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
For these I have not watched this yet

2898
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I think I should what do you guys think should I watch this

2899
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Trailer here? Alright let's take a look

2900
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Let's do it where no one else can see it

2901
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Well if you're watching OLR on YouTube

2902
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
You can see the trailer here

2903
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
What?

2904
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Wait wait wait wait wait wait stop

2905
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I'm stopping? Okay stop

2906
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Pause

2907
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Black Wolf just said RIP Mickey Rooney

2908
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Did Mickey Rooney die?

2909
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I thought

2910
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Didn't he die a long time ago?

2911
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
No?

2912
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Oh

2913
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Hold on

2914
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Okay play it I'm gonna look this up

2915
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
You stopped that trailer just to say

2916
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
That a celebrity had passed away?

2917
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Dude it's fucking Mickey Rooney

2918
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Yeah I know but I kind of thought he was already dead

2919
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
No offense I mean

2920
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You also thought Shirley Temple was dead

2921
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I did think she was dead

2922
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Girl

2923
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
There's a lot of people I think are dead

2924
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Speaking of dead let's go back to the franchise

2925
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
For these uh

2926
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
For these series

2927
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Let's go back to the trailer for these franchises that are super dead

2928
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Uh oh yeah TMZ reporting that Mickey Rooney died

2929
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
That's what everybody's saying in the chat

2930
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Well

2931
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Sad

2932
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
When was the last time Mickey Rooney was out in public?

2933
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Well he was in a night at the museum and

2934
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Alright anyhow here it is

2935
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Uh going to back to the trailer

2936
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Oh man this is so rude because when you see this

2937
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
You're like oh man it's gonna be a new game

2938
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
But you see all the characters

2939
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It's got the rock music and all this stuff

2940
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
You're like oh my god

2941
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Geese Howard

2942
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So like yeah you're like thinking new game

2943
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And then it's

2944
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I just love the little power ballad playing in the back

2945
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Yeah next gen fighting game

2946
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I know right

2947
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Doesn't it look like oh my god it's gonna be a next gen Fatal Fury

2948
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm so fucking excited and then it's like

2949
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Oh wait but he's in a casino

2950
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
What's he doing in a casino

2951
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I wanna see how long into this trailer it takes

2952
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Before it's given away that it's a slot machine

2953
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Oh not until the end I'm guessing

2954
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Oh that's so rude

2955
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Boom

2956
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah we're already like three quarters of the way through the trailer

2957
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I will be willing but yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

2958
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Do we get to see some balls?

2959
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Cause you know Pachinko

2960
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

2961
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer

2962
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Do we get to see some balls?

2963
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Cause you know Pachinko

2964
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Cause you know Pachinko

2965
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's Pachinko

2966
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
And yeah next level

2967
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
There it is

2968
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
They show one little machine

2969
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
What a troll

2970
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Jerks

2971
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Alright Dark Sakura

2972
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Do you have some better news for us?

2973
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
John Panette died too

2974
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
He's funny

2975
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Is everybody dying today? What's going on with that?

2976
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Well you know Game of Thrones was on

2977
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It's become self aware

2978
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
It's killing people outside of the show now

2979
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Bye

2980
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Bye everybody

2981
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
What do you have for us?

2982
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I have growling

2983
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Well speaking of things that I guess

2984
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I'm not even gonna go there

2985
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I'm not gonna say things that are dead

2986
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Things that are gonna be dug up years from now?

2987
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I...

2988
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Come on you were thinking it

2989
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Literally cannot even

2990
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Oh what was the joke?

2991
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Things in the ground? Was that the joke?

2992
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Things that should stay dead

2993
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Listen

2994
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That's not fair

2995
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
They're not buried yet

2996
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I'm sorry

2997
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Are you guys done?

2998
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm waiting to hear about these cartridges

2999
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's all I'm talking about

3000
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
These were cartridges

3001
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You just spoiled the story Mr. Spoilerbutt

3002
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I didn't say none

3003
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Mr. I'm gonna spoil the Hunger Games for Jamie

3004
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Earlier even though I asked you to

3005
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Whatever

3006
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
It's true

3007
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Good to know that my powers of deduction

3008
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Are accurate

3009
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Anyway, so remember that group that was trying to dig up ET?

3010
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Okay sorry

3011
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Oh my god they're digging up Elizabeth Taylor?

3012
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Elizabeth Taylor?

3013
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
God she just died

3014
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
She didn't just die

3015
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
That's so rude

3016
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Oh you mean the game ET

3017
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
The Atari 2600 version of ET

3018
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
There was a group that was gonna film

3019
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
A documentary about trying to

3020
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Dig it up out of the dump in New Mexico

3021
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And they got

3022
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
The

3023
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
OKs from the NMEB

3024
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Environmental Protection Division of Solid Waste Bureau

3025
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
They approved

3026
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
A waste evacuation

3027
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And it was submitted by

3028
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Xbox Entertainment Studios

3029
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Who is going to apparently

3030
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I guess be publishing this documentary

3031
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And filming it

3032
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
So we have efforts from Lightbox Entertainment

3033
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And Xbox Entertainment

3034
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
To let the dig happen

3035
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
This is gonna be about as

3036
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
You know as

3037
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Okay did anyone remember

3038
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Anybody remember

3039
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
When Geraldo

3040
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Tried to go into Al Capone's

3041
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Vault or whatever the fuck it was

3042
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
This is gonna end up just like that you know what's gonna be in there

3043
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Nothing

3044
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
They're gonna find shit

3045
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And

3046
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
They will actually find shit

3047
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Now it would be funny though if they actually find like

3048
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Neat relics from the 80s

3049
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
That are broken

3050
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
No it's gonna be nothing

3051
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
They might find like some like decomposed

3052
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Cabbage patch kids and like maybe a speaking

3053
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Spell that still works in there somewhere

3054
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I suppose Cabbage Patch Kid be

3055
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
A garbage pail kid at that point

3056
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Might possibly be

3057
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
For the record

3058
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Bobby I'm not watching the movies

3059
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Yet I'm reading the books

3060
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
But when you do watch the movies

3061
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Bobby will be quick to point out that the second one

3062
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Catching Fire the Capitol

3063
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Is one of the Dragon Con hotels

3064
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And it really is

3065
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It's pretty awesome to be in there and be like

3066
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh I'm at the Capitol

3067
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
At any rate I'm reading the books first

3068
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Alright fair enough fair enough

3069
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So you could be let down by the movies

3070
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
No I'm just kidding the movies are great

3071
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Loki what politically incorrect thing do you have for us next

3072
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Well let's see

3073
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I've got basically

3074
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Just

3075
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Wolfenstein

3076
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
You know they have that Doom beta planned

3077
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
For just PlayStation 4, Xbox One

3078
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And PC and I remember

3079
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Correctly and I wanted to say I looked it up

3080
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
But then I saw something shiny and I

3081
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Forgot to look it up but I want to say that

3082
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
That whole Doom beta thing is actually

3083
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
On all the box art for

3084
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
All the games

3085
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So that's kind of a little misleading if you think about it

3086
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
That they're only doing the beta for

3087
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You know select versions of the game

3088
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
But

3089
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
They're going to feature it on the box

3090
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Yep there it is Xbox 360 preorder

3091
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
For Doom beta access

3092
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Asterix

3093
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
These certain systems here

3094
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I guess it could be very far out

3095
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You'd expect that you're going to have a

3096
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Brand new console

3097
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I'm willing to bet that the next Doom game

3098
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Is only going to be

3099
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
For the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC

3100
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Which is probably why the beta is not on the current gen

3101
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I don't see why it wouldn't be

3102
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I think the current gen

3103
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Stuff is starting to sunset a little bit

3104
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm sorry last gen at this point

3105
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Well yeah

3106
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
We're kind of in between now so yeah

3107
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I think the 360 PlayStation 3 era

3108
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
You're starting to see the sunset on it

3109
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I think we still have some big games this year

3110
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I mean we still know that the Kingdom Hearts 2

3111
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Remake is happening at some point

3112
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That was announced before

3113
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
There's some other little things here and there

3114
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That will probably take us into 2015

3115
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I think especially by next holiday

3116
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Will be like the last

3117
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Stuff you see on those consoles

3118
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And even this holiday it's going to start

3119
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
To thin out because they want you to buy the new stuff

3120
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So that's where all the games are

3121
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
And I'm sure the Doom game is only on those consoles

3122
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So yeah I think that's why they have it

3123
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
They figure between now and whenever

3124
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
That beta comes out

3125
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Because that could either be the end of this year or next year

3126
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Who knows

3127
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
A lot of people will have

3128
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Another console by then

3129
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Alright well speaking of

3130
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Betas and things that ended up launching

3131
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
On the current

3132
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
No actually it's on your current PCs

3133
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And it will be on the next gen hardware

3134
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Soon enough

3135
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Scrolls Online was released

3136
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
On the PC this week

3137
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And they had some hiccups going into

3138
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
The launch but the game is now out

3139
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And kind of the

3140
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Resounding

3141
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
There's some people that are really into it

3142
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
That are really enjoying it

3143
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
But I'm hearing a lot of resounding feedback

3144
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
And this has been true on Horde House leading up to the show too

3145
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
That

3146
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Why are we paying for this?

3147
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
That it's not

3148
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Able to compete with some of the other pay MMOs right now

3149
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Now I don't know

3150
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I kind of think that's the way

3151
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
All these games tend to be when they announce a pay subscription

3152
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
You know Final Fantasy 14

3153
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Has a subscription right now

3154
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
World of Warcraft still has a subscription right now

3155
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
That's how these games kind of go

3156
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I think Elder Scrolls will be able to ride it out for a little bit

3157
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
But it's all about can they

3158
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Bring the players in

3159
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
And can they catch that buzz wave

3160
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Right now there's been a lot of people that have tried it

3161
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
That have been like meh

3162
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I'd rather just play Skyrim

3163
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
When they first announced

3164
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I was like oh yeah Skyrim

3165
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
But it's going to be online and stuff

3166
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
That's going to be awesome

3167
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
And then it was just kind of from there

3168
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Just kind of a downward slope

3169
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
The more and more I saw about the game

3170
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
The less and less interested I was in the game

3171
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And then I played the beta and I was like nope

3172
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And why was that?

3173
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Why were you turned off?

3174
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
It just wasn't engaging

3175
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
It was very

3176
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I don't know it just didn't feel like Elder Scrolls to me

3177
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I was just trying to shoehorn Elder Scrolls into an MMO

3178
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And

3179
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I just didn't like it

3180
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Also another big pet peeve

3181
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
It didn't support controllers

3182
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Well I think it's going to have to if they put it out on Playstation 4

3183
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Well yeah

3184
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
But it just wasn't very interesting

3185
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Once again I

3186
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Don't want to pay for an MMO

3187
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Because I just don't

3188
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
The amount of time I get to play that kind of stuff

3189
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Is just very mixed

3190
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So I just can't dedicate $15

3191
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
A month to something that I probably

3192
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
You know I may not play that month

3193
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Dungeonbuster in our chat room

3194
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

3195
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Elder Scrolls Online should have spent a bit more time

3196
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
In beta from what I've read

3197
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Some bugs and broken quests I've seen in the beta

3198
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Were still issues

3199
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Uh oh, that's not good

3200
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So there it is Elder Scrolls

3201
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Is out, you know if you feel

3202
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Differently if you're really enjoying the game let us know

3203
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
You know I gotta be honest I haven't really played it

3204
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
But I don't really

3205
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
There's no demo right now or there's no way to like

3206
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Download it and play free to level 10

3207
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Or anything like that because it's new

3208
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I assume that'll happen in the coming months or there'll be the Playstation 4 beta

3209
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So I'll check it out at that point

3210
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
But for now I just don't see the reason

3211
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I'm juggling Final Fantasy 14

3212
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I know I'm going to get sucked back into World of Warcraft

3213
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
When Warlords of Draenor comes out

3214
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
There's still Diablo 3

3215
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
In the interim which technically isn't an MMO

3216
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
But close enough

3217
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I just don't got time for it

3218
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And nobody got time for that Elder Scrolls

3219
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I think people want the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

3220
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
But with

3221
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Some way to play co-op or something

3222
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I think people want Elder Scrolls 6

3223
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Is what they really want

3224
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
If the next Elder Scrolls game comes out

3225
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
If Elder Scrolls 6 comes out and it has

3226
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Like 4 player co-op or even 2 player co-op

3227
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I think that people are just not going to care

3228
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Well Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be announced for a while

3229
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You're still going to have Fallout 4

3230
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Yeah Fallout's next

3231
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Or Doom I guess

3232
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Alright well let's go

3233
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Go to the mailbag

3234
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Every week you guys send us emails

3235
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Sometimes we have wrong opinions on things

3236
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
And you want to set us on the right path

3237
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So you can do that

3238
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com

3239
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Is the place where you can participate with the show

3240
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Again our email address participate at orangelaungeradio.com

3241
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Darsakra dives into the mailbag head first

3242
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And pulls out

3243
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
She finds Carmen Sandiego in there

3244
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Yeah she's hiding right there

3245
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
But I'm busy talking about food with Ikuma-san

3246
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Well you're going to have to take a break

3247
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And we're going to be sharing our emails with our listeners

3248
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com right now

3249
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Alright well first email

3250
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Comes from

3251
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I'm going to say Jonathan

3252
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Because that's all I get

3253
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Hey OLR crew

3254
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
My only problem with Oculus Rift

3255
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Is that Kickstarter is for

3256
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Indies that can't get a company to fund them

3257
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Let be real

3258
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Oculus Rift could

3259
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Have been funded from the start

3260
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I think the typing on here

3261
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Why are the little Kickstarter

3262
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Pledgers money not worth any returns

3263
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
In the end it's the backers fault though

3264
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Thanks Jonathan

3265
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I kind of think Oculus did try to get

3266
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
The other type of funding in the start

3267
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
But people laughed at it because we all laughed at the

3268
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Virtual reality stuff in the 90's

3269
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
You know the lawn mower man

3270
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Came and went

3271
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Kickstarter was how this thing got funded

3272
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And I think it did

3273
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I mean if you look at Facebook

3274
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Buying them for 2 billion dollars

3275
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
This investment was successful

3276
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
The only problem is it's Kickstarter

3277
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You don't own any equity in it

3278
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
If you don't like that don't

3279
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Kickstart companies

3280
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
They got a return

3281
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
They got a dev kit win

3282
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
That's true

3283
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
You get whatever prize you pledge for

3284
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Or perk

3285
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
So this one comes from Robert M

3286
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I was going to ask this in chat last week

3287
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But was out late so are you worried

3288
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
That the negative reaction to the Facebook

3289
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Acquisition of Oculus may be a

3290
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Self-fulfilling prophecy

3291
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
When Zynga bought the developer of Draw Something

3292
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Those hating the publisher for valid

3293
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Reasons and those joining the outcry

3294
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Stopped supporting the game

3295
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Seeing less for the profit than forecast

3296
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Zynga closed down OMG Pop

3297
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Detractors told you so

3298
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
This view may be over simplistic

3299
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
And perhaps come across as apologetic

3300
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
But could a similar relatively unwarranted

3301
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Exodus endanger the rift

3302
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Sorry if Bobby Black Wolf has already covered this

3303
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
This is from Robert M

3304
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
What was the question in there?

3305
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Okay if

3306
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
If Facebook purchasing

3307
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Oculus

3308
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And people saying well I'm not going to support

3309
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
This and stop adding their support to it

3310
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Is going to make it fail

3311
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
The way that when Zynga

3312
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Acquired Draw Something

3313
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Ah sort of

3314
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Like is the

3315
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Internet damming it without

3316
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Necessarily giving it a chance

3317
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Exactly I have a feeling

3318
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
And here's something to keep in mind

3319
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Facebook

3320
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Wants to target non-gamers

3321
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
As well

3322
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And that's a huge wild card

3323
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
But when you look at

3324
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
What Zuckerberg said about the Oculus Rift

3325
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And the big plan for it

3326
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I mean games are in there too don't get me wrong

3327
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But he

3328
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I don't want to put words in his mouth

3329
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But I get the sense that they don't need

3330
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
To be successful

3331
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Not really

3332
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
There's plenty of other applications for the technology

3333
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
But um

3334
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I think also the proof is in the pudding

3335
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I would bet

3336
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I would bet money

3337
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Because this is the internet and this is gaming culture

3338
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I would bet a large sum of money

3339
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That at least 75%

3340
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
If not more

3341
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Of the people bitching about Oculus Rift

3342
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
And how they're never going to play one

3343
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Never have

3344
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Or never intended to anyway

3345
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Or never intended to anyway

3346
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Or there's also this let's go back to NPR's

3347
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Little prank never bothered to read

3348
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Anything about the acquisition either

3349
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Or still will buy it when it comes out

3350
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
So I think

3351
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
There I mean

3352
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
The comparison to draw

3353
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Something and Zynga is interesting

3354
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
But I think we have to remember

3355
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
That iPhone games especially

3356
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Tend to be very flash in the pan

3357
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And you know it's popular

3358
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
One week you're in, one week you're out

3359
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
You know

3360
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
One week you're

3361
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Threes

3362
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Then your 2048

3363
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Goes out for free

3364
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And kind of bites into those sales

3365
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I mean that's the nature of the iPhone

3366
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Gaming the very volatile free

3367
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And 99 cent market

3368
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Well I would like to read what Bobby said in chat

3369
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Please

3370
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Zuckerberg said Oculus will do the game stuff first

3371
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And then he'd use the Facebook power to do

3372
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
The non-game stuff

3373
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It basically lets the Oculus concentrate on gaming

3374
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
And further said most of the Reddit

3375
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Most of the Reddit bitching

3376
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Were from people who never posted on the

3377
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Oculus subreddit before

3378
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
They all left and it's back to normal now

3379
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
But I mean it goes back to the people

3380
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Just wanting something to bitch about and not actually

3381
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Doing any research on it

3382
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Basically like a conversation with my mom

3383
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Well that's interesting though

3384
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
That they are still going to focus on gaming first

3385
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Okay so I'm corrected a little bit there

3386
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
But I still think the point stands that they are

3387
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Looking at doing more than

3388
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Just gaming

3389
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And you know what? At the end of the day

3390
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
If gaming doesn't end up making

3391
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Them money

3392
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
But premium events

3393
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Using the Oculus Rift to be able to attend

3394
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Premium events live and selling it as an

3395
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Entertainment device if that works for them

3396
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Then guess where they're going to end up focusing

3397
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
When I was a teenager

3398
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
A young teenager

3399
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
We used to pay for pay per views

3400
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
So that we could watch new kids on the block concerts

3401
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
You know I think there's a lot of people

3402
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Out there who bought a pay per view this evening

3403
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Yes they did

3404
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I wonder

3405
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
How many people would be interested in watching an event

3406
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Like Wrestlemania on the Oculus Rift

3407
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Good for thought

3408
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
At any rate

3409
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
The next email actually has something to do with

3410
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
The wrestling

3411
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
It says Oculus idea

3412
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Dearest peoples

3413
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
As you were talking about the possible future of

3414
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Facebook infused Oculus Rift

3415
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I had an idea as to what the future could be

3416
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
It's not video games, it's a different experience entirely

3417
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
As you read this

3418
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Wrestlemania

3419
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
30 is streaming live

3420
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
On the WWE network

3421
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
WWE's exclusive online platform

3422
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Is not the only place where live events

3423
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Are streamed

3424
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I watched Nine Inch Nails perform live at Lollapalooza

3425
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Via YouTube

3426
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
WWE has streamed their pre-shows on Facebook

3427
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
For over a year now and you can watch UFC PPV

3428
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Events live on Ustream

3429
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
What is the next experience?

3430
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Imagine if you could be in a crowd during a concert

3431
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
And by this I don't mean the broadcast slash concert

3432
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Film experience you get now

3433
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I mean actually being in the crowd for a concert

3434
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Or a sporting event

3435
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
This is what I think could be done with the

3436
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Facebook infused Oculus Rift

3437
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Selling concert tickets for people

3438
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
To be able to see live events

3439
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
From the comfort of their own home

3440
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
If you could see something live

3441
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
And where I say the Rolling Stones last tour

3442
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Or the upcoming Monty Python performances

3443
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Or a concert from a performer

3444
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Who thinks your city is too small to perform in

3445
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I'm looking at you Kanye

3446
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
You could bet people

3447
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Would buy tickets to see that event

3448
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Also you could sell different tickets

3449
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
In different parts of the arena enabling the corporation

3450
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Providing the event to make more money

3451
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Off the live stream than the one size fits all

3452
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Approach they get now

3453
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
That makes the experience appealing for consumers

3454
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And way profitable for corporations

3455
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Yay!

3456
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Stay black entertainment

3457
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
This message has been brought to you by Tacos

3458
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
You know one idea

3459
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
That pops in my mind too

3460
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Is that sometimes you have those one night

3461
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Only shows somewhere in the world

3462
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
That maybe doesn't necessarily

3463
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Tour or anything like that

3464
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Right now maybe get a Blu Ray

3465
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Or a movie out of it

3466
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
But imagine being able to be there live for the experience

3467
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
One thing that pops into my mind

3468
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
When he passed away he was prepping to do those shows

3469
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
At the London O2 arena or whatever

3470
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
He was going to do a bunch of shows

3471
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And then this is it right

3472
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm done no more

3473
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
He's going to retire just like Cher

3474
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
But that was supposed to be it

3475
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
If I could turn back time

3476
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
There would have been a lot of people

3477
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
That would have paid to see that

3478
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
There's a problem

3479
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
With this

3480
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
There's a big problem with this one

3481
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Is that to make it work

3482
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
In that type of area

3483
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
You would have to have multiple rendering cameras

3484
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Open at all times

3485
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
That would be unobstructed by

3486
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
The other concert goers

3487
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
You could do it

3488
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
The issue being

3489
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Is that they would all have to still

3490
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Re-render that data

3491
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Into the oculus

3492
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Including the ground, including the ceiling

3493
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
The various sides

3494
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And make it look seamless and also

3495
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Not cause someone to have a seizure

3496
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
He's not there yet but I bet it will be Sunday

3497
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Well they had even back on PlayStation

3498
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I want to say it's PlayStation 2

3499
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
They had something with Britney Spears

3500
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Where it was an interactive video

3501
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
That you could change the view on it

3502
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You could actually rotate the camera around

3503
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Was that Britney's dance beat?

3504
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
No it was actually a video

3505
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I think it was Britney Spears

3506
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
It may have been some other group

3507
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
But there was somebody

3508
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Those are filled with a special type of panoramic camera

3509
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I'm sure they could come out with something

3510
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Get two panoramic cameras

3511
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That's ten years ago at this point

3512
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
What's going to be ten years from now?

3513
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I don't care what it's called, I'm not getting one

3514
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
And I was

3515
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Reading emails

3516
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So whatever

3517
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Everyone else is calling

3518
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Bobby's huffy because he didn't get

3519
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Any emails about the oculus

3520
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And I'm not the one calling it anything

3521
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Oculus is the company

3522
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I know that

3523
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Don't mansplain shit to me

3524
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Do we have more emails on

3525
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Yes we got one more

3526
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
On the Oculus Rift, hopefully

3527
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I don't know, I really don't care if it is

3528
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Hi guys and gal, thank you

3529
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Thank you for being

3530
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Equal opportunity in your greeting

3531
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Greetings from your other Mexican

3532
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Listener, Dr. Noir

3533
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
From Quito

3534
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Is it Quito? Is that how it's pronounced?

3535
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
In Ecuador

3536
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I just want to recommend a delightful platformer

3537
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Called Sortigo

3538
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I have hours on my android phone

3539
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
All for the price of free

3540
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
And there's a link to it at the Google store

3541
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
It reminds me of classic Mega Man and Metroid

3542
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Because of the platforming and ability acquisition

3543
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
With a nod to Zelda and the gameplay and currency

3544
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Gems that spawn from mowed plants

3545
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
It is exactly the kind of game

3546
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I want to see more of even though I can't

3547
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
For the love of all understand

3548
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
For the love of all understand how they're making money

3549
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Hope you like it, adios amigos

3550
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Well sadly I am

3551
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Not an android phone user

3552
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
So I can't check out this game myself

3553
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Did they pay you to send this email?

3554
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
No, I'm okay with it

3555
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Because this guy's emailed us plenty of times

3556
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Before I know he's a good guy so I trust his recommendation

3557
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
But I kind of laughed

3558
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Because I was like, is this a paid email?

3559
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So what was the name of the game again?

3560
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Sortigo

3561
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Sortigo, Dr. Noir approved

3562
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Yes

3563
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Oh Bobby okay I forgive you for not trying to mansplain

3564
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Alright

3565
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Alright

3566
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Is that it for the emails?

3567
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Do you know I had to actually tell somebody what mansplaining was?

3568
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Well I don't think that's what Bobby was doing at all

3569
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Well no I know that's not what Bobby was doing

3570
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I was poking back

3571
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I wasn't over

3572
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Good lord can I not tell a remote teasing

3573
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Giving someone shit when I get shit in return?

3574
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I suppose

3575
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I'm allowed to give shit

3576
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I'm human

3577
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And humans shit

3578
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Can I make another joke about Makeruini dying?

3579
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
This is your house

3580
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
So I can't kick you out

3581
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
No I actually had to explain to somebody what mansplaining was

3582
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
It was very sad

3583
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Well what if a listener doesn't know

3584
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
You might as well explain it

3585
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
It's when a man's trying to explain something to a woman

3586
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And talks down to her as if it's something she shouldn't know anything about

3587
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Oh I got you

3588
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
So that would be like me going like

3589
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
You see that is an Xbox

3590
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Behind you and that's what we use

3591
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
To play video games

3592
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Sit and spin

3593
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Now would you like me to show you how to access the food network

3594
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
On that?

3595
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Would you like for me to shove this so far

3596
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Up your ass

3597
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
That you start tasting fingernails

3598
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
And I was indicating with my middle finger

3599
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Thank you

3600
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Alright

3601
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Oh hi bones you missed some

3602
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Stuff

3603
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Raginator says

3604
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
If there's mansplaining there's probably

3605
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Womansplaining too right?

3606
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Yes I would argue yes

3607
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I'm gonna tell you

3608
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
There is womansplaining yes there is

3609
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
You tell me what you believe womansplaining is

3610
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I'm gonna tell you what I believe it is

3611
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
That's when the guy is completely

3612
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Acting uninterested in what you're saying

3613
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
And you're trying to explain something

3614
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
As thoroughly as possible and he's completely

3615
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Overlooking everything that you're saying

3616
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
And you come off being a nag

3617
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Okay I believe that womansplaining

3618
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Is when you know you are

3619
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Hovering too much and you're being annoying

3620
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And you're around a woman so a woman

3621
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Just starts talking about her period

3622
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
So that you'll go away

3623
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
That's womansplaining

3624
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
No that's called defense mechanism

3625
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
It's called

3626
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
You know what I'm really sick of hearing you talk about football

3627
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
So how about I tell you about

3628
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
How once a month I you know

3629
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
My vagina does this

3630
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
And cramps are the

3631
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Worst

3632
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Not on the show

3633
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
What have they done to you?

3634
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
What have they done to you?

3635
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
We need the subscribers

3636
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
We need more women

3637
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You know when I first looked at chat

3638
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I thought it said manscaping

3639
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And I was like well that's a whole other episode

3640
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
That's after the womansplaining

3641
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Moving on to the FUs

3642
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Of the week

3643
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
How appropriate it would be this time

3644
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
To get to the FUs of the week

3645
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Here is justice

3646
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Here is punishment

3647
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Here is

3648
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
This is fucked up

3649
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
FU to the movie theater

3650
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
For being so fucking loud

3651
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And this is sad

3652
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I actually do like going to 3D movies

3653
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
But it's like the way that

3654
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
The Winter Soldier was filmed for its 3D

3655
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Was just completely

3656
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
My eyes ended up hurting and the theater was

3657
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
So loud that I actually

3658
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
My neck stiffened up

3659
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
And I had like a killer

3660
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Headache you know before I came in

3661
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
So um

3662
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
It was just that and then of course

3663
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
You know getting bitched at because it put me in a bad mood

3664
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And therefore I was

3665
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
You know saying hey my neck hurts

3666
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Would you mind rubbing my neck?

3667
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Complaining

3668
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Fine

3669
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Soon

3670
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Yeah

3671
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Happy in the cold

3672
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
And finally getting four hours of sleep

3673
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
You're so quiet this week I bet your

3674
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Listers can probably barely hear you because you're just

3675
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
It's taking all the energy out of you

3676
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Compared to previous weeks

3677
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I'm sorry I feel better

3678
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Hey I made the death jokes so you know

3679
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I've got the energy for that

3680
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Uh I don't know

3681
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
My FU of the week goes to

3682
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Oh the fact that

3683
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Our washer and dryer

3684
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
That came with the house as is

3685
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
That the landlord took great

3686
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Care to mention that the washer and dryer

3687
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Would be as is

3688
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
We knew kind of in the back of our mind

3689
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Oh yeah this means they're not going to last very long

3690
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Well very long ended up being

3691
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Three weeks and the dryer broke

3692
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
So FU did the fact that I just dropped

3693
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
$100

3694
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Plus on

3695
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
A new washer and dryer

3696
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It's pretty disgusting isn't it

3697
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
It costs a lot of money to keep your clothes

3698
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Smelling spring fresh

3699
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I'll tell you I'm going to pass on

3700
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
A little bit of advice to everybody

3701
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
That when you go to buy

3702
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
A new washer and dryer or fridge

3703
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Or another appliance look at the returns

3704
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Because typically returns are for

3705
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Cosmetic damage and it's

3706
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Like for a fridge if the side of it is dented

3707
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Who's going to look at the fucking side of the fridge

3708
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
It's usually shoved in an alcove or

3709
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
In between something

3710
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Our washer and dryer had a big dent in it

3711
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Now our washer and dryer

3712
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Were $500 and $600 each

3713
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
We got $300 knocked down off the price of each of them

3714
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Nice

3715
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I'll say it at Best Buy

3716
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
But because we had damaged returns

3717
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
We went there first

3718
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And I'll say it

3719
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
And nobody was around to help

3720
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So we went somewhere else where we ended up dropping

3721
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
A large sum of money

3722
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
You know what? Write them

3723
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Give them feedback

3724
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Oh really?

3725
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I'm all for coupons

3726
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Oh we're sorry we lost your business

3727
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Thanks for letting us know

3728
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
By the way

3729
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Now the FUs of the week are done

3730
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I have to read this hilarious comment from AkumaJP

3731
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Although DarkSaga's not going to like it

3732
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
But I love AkumaJP's idea of woman-splaining

3733
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Did you get that?

3734
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Did you hear me? Are you listening?

3735
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
That's my mother

3736
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I countered with

3737
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I don't woman-splain, I bitch

3738
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Bitch please

3739
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I give disapproving looks

3740
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Including the ADS

3741
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
The absolute death stare

3742
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Which thankfully

3743
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
You've never received the absolute death stare

3744
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
My husband has lots though

3745
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Alright

3746
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Just a few more stories for you guys

3747
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
And then we're going to open up the skype line

3748
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
If you want a man-splain

3749
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Or a woman-splain

3750
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Or they-splain

3751
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Whatever you are-splain

3752
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Tell us what you're thinking

3753
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
In gaming culture this week

3754
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
But first, a story from Loki

3755
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Sadly

3756
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
We don't have great news

3757
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
But apparently the producer

3758
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Or music producer of Rhythm Heaven

3759
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
He has cancer

3760
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Unfortunately

3761
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
It was

3762
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Was it

3763
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Sunku I guess

3764
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Is that guy's name?

3765
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
He has been diagnosed with

3766
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Laryngeal

3767
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
cancer

3768
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
So throat cancer

3769
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
And of course

3770
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Being a singer

3771
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
That's not great news either

3772
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
It's like hey you have cancer

3773
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Oh hey you can't sing anymore

3774
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So hopefully

3775
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Hopefully he's able to beat that

3776
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Because that sucks

3777
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Yeah

3778
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Our thoughts go out definitely

3779
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Play some Rhythm Heaven this week

3780
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Well I mean he's still

3781
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
He's just diagnosed he hasn't passed away or anything

3782
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
So he's still fighting it but

3783
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Our thoughts definitely go out to him

3784
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And we'll play some Rhythm Heaven this week

3785
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Alright going over to one story

3786
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
That is sad

3787
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
And I know I was

3788
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Cracking some jokes about Mickey Rooney earlier

3789
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
But look Mickey Rooney was in his 90's

3790
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
It's very tragic to report on

3791
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Somebody who died in their 40's

3792
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And that's unfortunately what happened this week

3793
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Masuda passed away at the age of 48

3794
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Now you may not

3795
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Recognize that name but Masuda

3796
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Actually designed the game

3797
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Pro Wrestling by himself

3798
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
This ties into WrestleMania tonight folks

3799
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Pro Wrestling by himself with another

3800
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Developer doing the game's graphics

3801
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
This was all released for the Famicom

3802
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
In 1986

3803
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Which ended up being released for the NES

3804
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
You remember the old school Pro Wrestling

3805
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Like before WrestleMania and the licensed stuff

3806
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
There was the original Pro Wrestling game

3807
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
That was by this guy Masato Masuda

3808
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
He also created the series

3809
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Fire Pro Wrestling

3810
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
So yeah very sad to hear about this

3811
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
But then you hear he's 48

3812
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Now do the math you guys

3813
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
This Pro Wrestling

3814
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
The original came out in 1986

3815
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
That means when he made this game

3816
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
He was like 19 or 20

3817
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And it just makes you go

3818
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Wow what was I doing at 19 or 20

3819
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Moving to California

3820
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Right or just you know

3821
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Like I wasn't doing this kind of stuff

3822
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
But then you know this guy went and made

3823
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
You know a real classic video game

3824
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Was making video games at least he accomplished a lot

3825
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So rest in peace

3826
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Masato Masuda

3827
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
So sorry to hear about that

3828
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
48 is young

3829
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Very very very young

3830
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Alright one 877

3831
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Game OLR or a username on Skype

3832
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Orange Lounge Radio is the place to call us

3833
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
If you would like to participate with our show

3834
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
The phone lines are open

3835
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Right now

3836
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Do we have any last minute stories while we wait

3837
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I know I've seen some tweets come in over at twitter.com

3838
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Slash OLR so I'll pull those up

3839
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
But in the meantime

3840
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Loki any last minute stories?

3841
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Unfortunately no

3842
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I don't have any last minute stories

3843
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
It was kind of a slower news week

3844
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
That's the thing about April Fools day

3845
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
It really cuts into like the actual news

3846
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Oh we do have a phone call coming in though

3847
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
So we will go to it

3848
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
And hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

3849
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It's your local residential convention

3850
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Hora Ranma

3851
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Hey Ranma how you doing

3852
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I'm a little tired, my feet hurt

3853
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
My back hurts but other than that I'm doing good

3854
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yeah but let me think though

3855
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Were you here for the entire show

3856
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Or were you cheating on us with some pro wrestlers

3857
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Umm

3858
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Better things to spend my money on

3859
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
If I'm cheating on OLR

3860
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I'm cheating on OLR with a bunch of hot cosplayers

3861
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I mean come on

3862
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Give me some kind of credit

3863
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Alright fair enough Ranma fair enough

3864
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
So what's on your mind tonight buddy

3865
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I want to talk about where in the world

3866
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Is Carmen Sandiego

3867
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
F yes the classic game of the week

3868
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
The dark soccer pick this week

3869
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
What do you want to talk about with it

3870
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
When I was in junior high after school

3871
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
There was about 10 of us we actually had

3872
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
The Acme Detective Agency club

3873
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Okay we would sit there

3874
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
On our Apple IIe's and just

3875
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Play the game and we would just

3876
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Go through it and they would put our names

3877
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
On the board and like

3878
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Who can do the most

3879
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Umm cases and rank

3880
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Up and so forth

3881
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
And that was pretty fun

3882
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And it's like we're looking at

3883
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Each other trying to figure out where one person

3884
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Is where one person's at and

3885
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Back then

3886
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
There was maybe

3887
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Two copies of the game

3888
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
And the disc was

3889
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Copied several times but only two

3890
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Almanacs so pretty much

3891
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
At the end of the school that you had to run

3892
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
To the computer lab be the first one to

3893
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Grab the disc and the almanac

3894
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Rama don't copy that floppy

3895
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Psssh

3896
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
No I know I think

3897
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
A lot of people did back in the day that's why they had

3898
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
The copy protection

3899
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Yeah but that's why also Manning

3900
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Created tape

3901
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
What

3902
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Don't forget

3903
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Well for the

3904
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Disc copy protection to get around it you just cover

3905
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
The red notch with a piece of tape

3906
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Oh yeah that whole thing I do remember that

3907
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Oh my god that's right or yeah

3908
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
You can flip the little thing on the three and a half

3909
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Floppy or yeah you get covered with the tape

3910
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Oh my god that's old school

3911
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Definitely yeah sorry it took me

3912
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
A minute to like remember that and then I just suddenly had

3913
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
The image of my childhood of like get the masking tape

3914
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
It's

3915
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Quite alright and then you used to have

3916
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
The thing that you could actually a little hole punch that you could

3917
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Actually punch the discs to put that notch in it

3918
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
It's crazy

3919
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Anyway

3920
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
So any other

3921
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Copy floppy stories from your childhood

3922
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
You want to share with us?

3923
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
That's the only one and by the way

3924
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
For thinking

3925
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
For the fact you thought these celebrities were already dead Rob

3926
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
That was bad and you should feel bad

3927
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
It was funny as hell

3928
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And you know it

3929
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Yeah I know especially what Loki said I was like

3930
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I was ready to walk out of my house

3931
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Right there

3932
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
That was just terrible

3933
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I'm going to go under where Loki sits just for next time

3934
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
He needs to drop the mic and walk away

3935
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Are you going to use that Mario pillow?

3936
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I might

3937
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
That's a good use for it

3938
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I use that pillow for my back a lot actually

3939
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
So Rob's butt is closer to it

3940
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
That's right Mario can smell my butt

3941
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Are you pretty much telling Mario to kiss your ass?

3942
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I guess so

3943
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Because

3944
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm a Luigi fan Rama

3945
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I'm a Luigi fan

3946
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And you know my favorite

3947
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
My favorite is black Luigi

3948
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
By the way

3949
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Ronchon

3950
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
You know I'm going to be back in the cosplay circuit

3951
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Come July

3952
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Are you doing Ugyo?

3953
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
No

3954
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
You're going to be so sad

3955
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
So very very sad

3956
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Sailor Venus?

3957
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
No

3958
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I'm doing two homestuck cosplays

3959
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I've learned to

3960
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Love and tolerate the homestuck fandom

3961
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
As Marco said in My Little Pony

3962
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I will learn to love and tolerate

3963
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Respect and understanding

3964
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
The gaming community needs more of it

3965
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I have given My Little Pony a chance

3966
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
And I found some of it amusing

3967
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
That's good

3968
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Even though Applejack's accent is horrible

3969
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
But I have developed

3970
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
A love of Rainbow Dash

3971
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Because

3972
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
20% cooler

3973
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Yes

3974
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And don't forget

3975
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
They had the figures at McDonald's this week

3976
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I'm not that into it

3977
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
No thank you

3978
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Alright

3979
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Well Rama I'm going to let you go

3980
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
So we can get some more calls

3981
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
But listen to Anime Jam Session or You Suck

3982
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Right?

3983
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
We'll be talking about Castle Point this week

3984
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
A convention we hit up today

3985
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
And after that we're getting ready for PAX East

3986
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Oh boy, big weekend coming up

3987
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
You're telling me

3988
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I'm just glad I got the time off for it

3989
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Have fun at PAX East

3990
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Bye my friend

3991
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
1877 Game OLR

3992
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Or a username on Skype

3993
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you would like to give the show a call

3994
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
The phone lines are once again open

3995
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Again that's 1877 Game OLR

3996
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Or a username on Skype

3997
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3998
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I'm trying to go to the Twitters

3999
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
To see what's going on here on Twitter

4000
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Tigerclaw sending us a tweet

4001
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
The Wreck-It Ralph sequel is officially in the works

4002
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
According to the composer

4003
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
We haven't had any official confirmation

4004
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
But Wreck-It Ralph of course the Disney movie

4005
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
From last year that was great with all its throwbacks

4006
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
To classic gaming

4007
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Very happy to hear about the sequel

4008
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I just hope it's not direct to video

4009
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
That would be very sad

4010
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
But yeah I'm excited to hear about it

4011
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I hope we get maybe a new Wreck-It Ralph game

4012
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
That isn't exclusive to the Nintendo

4013
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Platforms

4014
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I'd like to see it out there in more places

4015
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

4016
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It's Shane

4017
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
How are you doing?

4018
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I'm good

4019
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Hi Shane

4020
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Wow you're making the rounds on every podcast that I co-host this week

4021
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Right? I have no life

4022
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
You even guessed it on Reading is Fundamental

4023
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
And now you're here what's up?

4024
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I just want to do my

4025
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Due diligence as a

4026
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
DJ Max fan and put out the PSA

4027
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
That on the iOS

4028
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Platform we now have

4029
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
The Technica game finally

4030
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
In America

4031
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
And it's expensive

4032
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So don't buy it

4033
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Wait a minute so you're doing your due diligence to tell us

4034
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
That it's out there but then you're saying don't buy it

4035
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Yes

4036
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Why not?

4037
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Because you get the base game for free

4038
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And it comes with like six songs

4039
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I think seven maybe

4040
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
And a couple of them

4041
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Are pretty decent songs

4042
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
And then you have to buy

4043
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
The rest of them you can earn

4044
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
The credit stuff

4045
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
To buy the songs by playing the games

4046
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
But you don't really earn a whole lot

4047
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Each song is like 20 of these credits

4048
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
So they want you to pay real money

4049
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
If you want every single

4050
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Song that they have there

4051
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
And they're sold in packs

4052
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
You can also buy them individually but that's not as good

4053
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
You have to pay 96 bucks

4054
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
For a phone game

4055
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
But does it have flea?

4056
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
It does not

4057
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Fuck it then

4058
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
It has one of the exclusives from the

4059
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
What's it called?

4060
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
DJ Max Ray on the iPhone

4061
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
And it's not bad

4062
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
But they are really asking

4063
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
For a lot of money for songs

4064
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
That don't translate as well to

4065
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
The iPhone and probably iPad

4066
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
As they do like in the arcade

4067
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
But there will be some people that buy it

4068
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Right Shane?

4069
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Yep there will be

4070
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Not me though I did not buy any

4071
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Wow

4072
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
So I don't have the money for it

4073
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Or else I'll buy it

4074
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
But yeah

4075
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Everybody has to know

4076
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
So they can download it and get the free version

4077
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And then eventually

4078
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
If you are drunk

4079
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Or just

4080
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Dumb

4081
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
You buy the other songs

4082
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Well if you have some more disposable income

4083
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Out there and you want to drop the money on this

4084
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
And some of the songs

4085
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Let us know how it is

4086
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
There are some good songs

4087
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I earned enough to buy

4088
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
One of my own songs

4089
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Without paying money

4090
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And

4091
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I don't know

4092
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
It has a two line mode and a three line mode

4093
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
And it's okay

4094
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
I bet this is much better on an iPad

4095
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Than a little dinky iPhone

4096
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
But you know

4097
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
If you need a DJ Max fix

4098
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Go play portable on PSP

4099
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And not this

4100
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Any other game reviews

4101
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
You want to share with us tonight?

4102
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I have already professed my love for Infamous

4103
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Because it's amazing

4104
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Did you hear that Loki?

4105
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Loki said he wasn't sure on

4106
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Infamous Second Sign

4107
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
No I said that was the only one that looked interesting

4108
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
It is really interesting

4109
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
It's got a decent story

4110
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I don't think the other ones supposedly have that great of stories

4111
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I really got invested

4112
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Into this one

4113
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
And I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14

4114
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Because of Leviathan

4115
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
And his mid 90's alternative

4116
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Rock song

4117
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
It's the best

4118
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Playing that fight over and over

4119
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Jamie if you get that far don't play it

4120
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
You might get motion sick

4121
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
It does a lot of bobbing up and down

4122
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I'll probably wait for you guys to do it anyway

4123
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
You fight Leviathan on a barge

4124
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
And during the fight

4125
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Leviathan will fly up in the air

4126
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And land on the barge

4127
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Which causes the barge to tilt

4128
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And you all fly down the barge

4129
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Whatever way

4130
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
It's really fun

4131
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Actually it's a rad mechanic

4132
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I'll just wait until I have you guys to do it with me

4133
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
There you go

4134
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You can pretty much sleep through it once you get there

4135
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
It's really not hard whatsoever

4136
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
If you can get past Titan hard mode

4137
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Then shit anything is easy after that

4138
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
The only reason I got past Titan at all

4139
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Was because of you guys while I slept in the fire

4140
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
That was just regular mode

4141
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Wait until you see hard mode

4142
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
It'll make you cry

4143
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
You have no idea how angry I was that night

4144
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I was angry enough that I was in tears

4145
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
And I got up and left my computer

4146
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I was that angry

4147
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Remember when I said

4148
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Fuck it, just finish it

4149
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
After that I got up and left

4150
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
No video games worth getting that

4151
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I was already in a really bad mood

4152
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I did that

4153
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I was already in a really bad mood that night

4154
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
But just having all that happen

4155
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
After I had put off doing

4156
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
The fight for three games until there were people

4157
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
To do it with me

4158
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I was just so frustrated

4159
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I'm going to warn you

4160
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
It gets worse

4161
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
The hard mode is extremely unforgiving

4162
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I would love to try it again

4163
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
If I can

4164
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
But I was so mad

4165
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Sure

4166
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Well Shane I'm going to let you go

4167
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
See if we get any other callers

4168
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Thanks for the call

4169
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I'm going to play more Leviathan

4170
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Leviathan

4171
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
That's not even the good part

4172
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Bye

4173
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
This is a tweet from SSJ100Matt

4174
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Sometimes you guys want to bring stories

4175
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
That might have slipped off of our radar

4176
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
You want to bring that to our attention

4177
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Let's see

4178
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Washington State University researchers

4179
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Programmed a computer to teach another how to play

4180
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Ms. Pac-Man

4181
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Let's see

4182
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Right now robots are quote very dumb

4183
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Saying Matthew E. Taylor at WSU

4184
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Who is a professor of artificial intelligence

4185
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
And so as robots become

4186
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
More common it will be easier if they're capable

4187
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Of learning how to perform tasks from

4188
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Other robots

4189
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
We don't want this information to be lost

4190
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Once your home robot knows how you like your bath

4191
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
How you like your house cleaned

4192
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
You don't want to lose that information

4193
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
So huh that's interesting

4194
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
And there's a whole little YouTube that goes with it

4195
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I'm not going to play it right now

4196
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
But that's really neat

4197
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
So they use Ms. Pac-Man as a way

4198
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Now can you teach me how to play?

4199
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Because I get killed in that game really easy

4200
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Alright

4201
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Akuma JP in our chatroom

4202
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
At live.vognetware.com talking about

4203
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Final Fantasy 14 saying

4204
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
The reason I left Final Fantasy 14 is because I got

4205
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Kicked from the server while in a fight with

4206
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Odin

4207
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
That Odin fight will kill servers

4208
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Like there's so many people that show up for those fights

4209
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
It kind of can't handle it

4210
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Which is not okay

4211
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
They need to fix that somehow

4212
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
So no MMO

4213
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Is perfect and that's where Square Enix is struggling

4214
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Is with some of those server issues

4215
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And they encourage every single player

4216
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
On the damn server to show up in one zone

4217
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
All at the same time

4218
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
So I will put out one more call

4219
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
For phone calls at 1877 game OLR

4220
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Or username on Skype orange lounge radio

4221
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I'm trying to look back

4222
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Sometimes I miss tweets that were sent early in the week

4223
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
If I don't scroll back

4224
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
So I'm going to do that right now

4225
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
But unfortunately

4226
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
There's no last minute stories to help

4227
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Give me time here

4228
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
And stuff is

4229
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Let's see code man had sent us that same story

4230
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
About the five year old and the security flaw

4231
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
With Xbox one

4232
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But you know that story is like making the rounds

4233
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It's everywhere because I'm sure the associated press

4234
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Picked it up and it's a hilarious story to put

4235
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
On the front of

4236
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Your local newspaper and things like that

4237
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Five year old that hacks Xbox

4238
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Oh Pete Caruno had sent some tweets

4239
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
At the beginning of the week when he was listening to the show

4240
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Saying I believe it's illegal to

4241
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Rent games in Japan

4242
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
That's why there's a thriving second hand market

4243
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
To replace it

4244
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Renting CDs is legal

4245
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
We were talking about that a little bit on the show last week

4246
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
I think we were talking about red box and all that stuff

4247
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
And Pete Caruno said

4248
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I successfully used the money in my Xbox account

4249
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
To buy DJ Hero DLC yesterday

4250
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Even managing to partly pay with points

4251
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
And credit card

4252
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Well you're doing better

4253
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Did you do that though through the website?

4254
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
He didn't say

4255
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
It was a tweet

4256
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Through the website

4257
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
No

4258
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I do need to figure out

4259
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
What I'm going to spend the rest of that on

4260
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I was hoping the DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5

4261
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Would come out but nope

4262
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Not yet

4263
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Alright

4264
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
That's it I guess we're going to close up the Skype line

4265
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
No other calls are coming in

4266
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Alas

4267
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
And AkumaJP by the way is verifying

4268
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Yes it's illegal to rent games

4269
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
They tried to do that here

4270
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
It happened Nintendo was not a fan of that

4271
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
But no this is Murica

4272
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
So anyway

4273
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
If you want to participate with the show

4274
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
If you were too busy with WrestleMania or Game of Thrones

4275
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Or what else was tonight something else tonight

4276
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Too busy

4277
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Simpsons with a Minecraft intro

4278
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Who cares

4279
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
If you were too busy with any of that stuff you can always email us

4280
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com

4281

Or you can send us a tweet twitter.com

4282
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Slash O L R

4283
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
But with that we are going to wrap up the show here tonight

4284
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I want to thank you guys for listening and tuning into the show

4285
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Thank you as always for your support

4286
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lawn Tradio

4287
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show

4288
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
We don't ask for your money

4289
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Although I will say just a heads up you guys

4290
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
We are going to be looking at ways here in the coming

4291
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Weeks and months and so forth

4292
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
And these are things you guys have been asking for

4293
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Can I get a shirt

4294
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Can I get Orange Lawn Tradio merchandise

4295
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Will you sign something and send it to us

4296
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
We are looking at ways to do that

4297
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
But again totally optional

4298
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Stuff that will be out there if you want to get it

4299
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
And support the show that is fucking awesome

4300
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
And you rule for it but you know we are not going to be like

4301
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
We are not going to record our show

4302
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
For a month if you don't do it

4303
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I am still planning on doing VOG the book

4304
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Which I do need to speak with some of our people

4305
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
That would be very hilarious

4306
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Kickstart the most expensive episode of Orange Lawn Tradio ever

4307
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
To one episode

4308
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
And then we donate the money to charity

4309
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Namely the Jamie needs art supplies

4310
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And candy

4311
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Actually the donate to charity is against the rules

4312
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
So you can't do that

4313
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Can you do it on InigoGo

4314
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
At any rate

4315
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Bobby also makes a point that Cosmos

4316
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Was on

4317
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
And Cosmos is fucking amazing

4318
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Well there you go

4319
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Well that's going to do it

4320
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show

4321
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show

4322
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

4323
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I'll start

4324
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Because you know Loki when you bring Carl's Jr.

4325
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
To the studio you make me crave Chris cut fries

4326
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
You're a jerk

4327
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
And I didn't even get the Chris cut fries

4328
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I ate their natural cut fries

4329
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
You know what Rob we could get pinkberry

4330
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
I gotta go get Allen

4331
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I was going to have pinkberry today

4332
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
But my son had to fucking have an accident

4333
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
After he was sitting there

4334
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Bouncing up down like you have to go to the bathroom

4335
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Let's go to the bathroom, no I don't have to go to the bathroom

4336
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Two seconds later

4337
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Oh I have to go to the bathroom

4338
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Get him in the, okay let's go to the pinkberry

4339
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Get him in the car, hey wait a second

4340
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Pants are wet

4341
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Thanks

4342
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Womp womp

4343
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Dark soccer your final thought tonight

4344
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I'm glad I only have to deal with my cat

4345
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And last but not least

4346
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Loki your final thought tonight

4347
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
I hope I can get some more programming done this week

4348
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
My brain has been mushed the last few days

4349
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
That's what I get for staying up

4350
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Well feel better dammit

4351
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
It's actually, I can only code with Red Bull

4352
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I have to drink lots of Red Bull

4353
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
And then that actually works out

4354
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
The problem is though I'm getting to the point though

4355
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Where it's like okay what do I work on next

4356
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
What part do I work on next

4357
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
It's just deciding what the best thing to work on

4358
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
I don't know

4359
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I'm trying to like set myself goals and stuff

4360
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
But it's just like a lot of stuff

4361
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
That I need to work on

4362
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000

4363
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
