7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	26000	Tonight's episode is 30 years in the making as the expedition to New Mexico has unearthed and confirmed a video gaming's oldest urban legend. And it wasn't just one infamous game. We'll explain why a certain alienated game is so memorable this week on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange, Lounge, Radio. Episode number 550 for this April the 27th of 2014.
45000	55000	Let's talk about video games over the next few hours and what's going on in gaming life and so on. My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	59000	You completely ignored me balancing an empty cup on my forehead for 10 minutes.
60000	65000	I did because I was so focused on you know making sure I didn't miss Bobby's call and the other stuff that's going on here personally.
66000	71000	Well it could be more important than me balancing a cup on my forehead. I did preserve it for eternity on my Facebook.
72000	79000	I was going to say I saw you taking a picture so I know I know I can look it up anytime I want that yes you balanced a cup on your forehead. Here's the question. Was it full?
80000	82000	No. Well that's not talent. I could do it right now.
82000	88000	Don't spill the coffee. Don't spill the coffee. That shit's valuable. How are you doing? How was your week?
89000	92000	It was okay. Yeah it was okay? I was damnless most of the week so it was alright.
93000	96000	But you have Dan. Well you mean you don't have him right this minute but you will go home.
97000	100000	I'll have him soon. Soonish. Sooner than anticipated.
101000	110000	So DarkSakura tonight is wearing a shirt and on her shirt it says no with a period. I think it's important to say it's no period. Like that is the full sentence.
110000	120000	Well what if I said yes? No. What do you say no to? No. Everything? No. I don't know.
121000	133000	No this is my shirt of non-consent. The answer is always no. I see. Well what if I'm going to give you $500? Oh you said no. She just put her hand over it.
134000	145000	I turned upside down where it says on. Alright. What if I asked do you refuse my consent? No? Okay. Cool.
146000	152000	There he is. His mic's always on. Say hello to Techmaster Loki everybody. Hi. How you doing? Pretty good.
153000	159000	And of course the listeners at home love to play along with the what is Loki eating tonight game. And so what did Loki bring to the show tonight?
159000	166000	It was a last minute McDonald's. I tried to go Togo's. I was going to eat because on the way here I'm like oh damn Togo's. I love Togo's.
167000	177000	Sandwich place if you're not familiar with. It's a local chain I think. Which actually they're owned by the same people that own Baskin Robbins and Dunkin Donuts but for some reason they're only in California.
177000	187000	Yeah it's weird. But it's a really good sandwich place. And so I'm like okay cool I'm going to go there. They close at 5. I was there at 5.45 so. Don't.
188000	194000	I had to go. I'm like ah I'm so hungry I gotta go eat. Okay I know there's a McDonald's around here at least. So I went to McDonald's and they were retarded.
195000	204000	Womp womp. Sorry. No that's an insult to retarded people. Don't use the R word. Alright. Anyhow we are also joined by you guys in our chat room.
204000	216000	No I used it correctly because they were slow. That's what I meant. Live dot vog network dot com where you can join us every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
217000	224000	And looking in the chat it sounds like they're all they're all talking about Togo's now. Jason says it sounds interesting since I've been on a sandwich kick lately.
225000	231000	Dark Tetsuya says I miss Quiznos actually frown face. I still have one that's open next to my house which is fantastic.
231000	238000	Yeah there's one. I just don't go there anymore so they probably won't be open very long. I found a blimpie. For you local people there's a blimpie downtown in downtown SAC.
239000	247000	There's one on Florin. There's a Quiznos for you local people it's over on Greenback and the Hazel. That's the one yeah. Tell them this is where you live lucky.
248000	254000	You know what I miss though from the south is I miss Sub King. Because I'm like it's the Sub King. That's right.
254000	264000	Alright anyhow we are going to get into video game discussion tonight. We're going to start off with the topic that everybody's talking about.
265000	273000	Everybody's talking about this and it's probably going to be on every podcast you listen to this week and yes we want to talk about ET getting dug up in the landfill.
274000	279000	Look I realize most of you that subscribe to the show probably heard about this. But I thought he went home.
280000	287000	What happened? It wasn't his corpse Loki. They did not find his corpse in New Mexico. That would have been over in Roswell. That's like three towns over.
288000	289000	Well I mean they got to dump it somewhere.
290000	300000	Okay so here's the thing. There's this story that we all heard as kids that Atari they made so many copies of ET that didn't sell because the game was poop.
301000	306000	They made so many copies of the game that they had to throw them in a landfill and put concrete on top of it so people wouldn't go digging for it.
306000	314000	Oops. And I don't. Here's the thing. This story was all over the Internet and you know it was all over Facebook it was all over CNN.
315000	319000	And I got to admit my first reaction was what's the big fucking deal.
320000	322000	That is still my reaction. I just don't care.
323000	328000	Who cares. I can go to the flea market and find ratty old copies of ET for 50 cents. Who the F cares.
329000	335000	But I was thinking about it more and more and I was like alright well I do remember hearing this stuff when I was a kid like this is the stuff of legend.
336000	341000	But I don't I don't think this was ever really like urban legends usually aren't true.
342000	354000	And there was many press reports in the mid 80s that yeah Atari did so crappy and had so many cartridges they printed more copies of ET than there were actual Atari 2600 systems.
355000	361000	I mean poor management decisions are not something new to the gaming industry. I mean I know they're around now but they were around 30 years ago too.
361000	367000	And if you don't know why here's why ET was so horrible. They didn't set out to make a bad game.
368000	373000	In fact the guy who did it because back in the Atari 2600 days one guy made a game maybe two.
374000	377000	Or a girl could make a game too I'm just saying. One guy made a game.
378000	382000	And in this case it was Howard Scott Warshaw was the guy that made ET.
383000	389000	Now nothing against Howard Scott Warshaw because he also made some pretty flipping amazing Atari 2600 games like Yars Revenge if you ever played that.
389000	398000	One of the very best they ever did on Atari 2600. But here's the problem with ET. With ET they had six weeks to make it.
399000	403000	Yeah. Six weeks to make ET because of licensing deals and other things going on.
404000	412000	Horrible horrible horrible short notice. Yes exactly. And again this is management couldn't get the licensing and da da da.
413000	418000	You know it's just like oh well we can just poop. Literally we can crap out a video game and it'll be great and sell millions of copies.
419000	427000	It'll sell Atari 2600 consoles and all this stuff. Is it the same reason why Pac-Man on the 2600 was garbage?
428000	436000	Because it has to be a four bit cartridge to be on cost. It has to be four bits. We have to shove Pac-Man into four bits because that way it's cheaper and da da da da da.
437000	441000	And well they made Pac-Man fit on four bits by drawing one ghost each frame.
442000	448000	What was it? As a discerning four year old at the time playing Pac-Man I didn't care.
449000	457000	Right. But then you play Ms. Pac-Man and you're like why is this so much better? Like this actually plays like the Arcadia because it was an eight bit cartridge.
458000	460000	It was like double the size so you were able to actually put the game in there.
461000	466000	And it says I was too busy playing Kangaroo. Yes. Kangaroo is a lot better. Kangaroo is the best Atari game. I don't care.
466000	475000	So anyway I totally digress. Despite the fact that this wasn't exactly like I mean it was never a fake story.
476000	484000	We knew they did not sell this game. We knew they ditched them somewhere. They didn't throw them in an incinerator. They threw them in the ground because burning it wouldn't be safe for the environment.
485000	491000	So they threw them on which I guess throwing them in the ground isn't really much safer but in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Sorry to our friends in Alamogordo.
491000	501000	I'm told Jason grew up there actually. Our friend Jason who was on the show a few months ago and is continuing in our intro and passphrase and all that actually grew up in Alamogordo but it is literally the middle of nowhere.
502000	509000	So anyway they threw them all on the ground, poured the concrete on top of it. The reason why they poured it on the ground.
510000	515000	The reason why they poured the concrete on top of it was because kids were going out there and getting the copies.
516000	518000	Including the mayor of the city who admitted it.
518000	529000	So here's the thing. It was never a lie. So that's why I was kind of like well what's the big effing deal. But we all thought it was when we were a kid and to be real none of us ever really saw the receipts.
530000	546000	I think we have some of not we as 35 year olds but we as 7 year olds have this image in our heads of you find the door to Narnia and Alamogordo and you go into the ground and it's ET. ET everywhere.
546000	564000	I don't think first off I ever thought that because I had a copy of ET but I don't know it just seems really dumb that you would even think about going to steal a copy of ET or something.
565000	566000	Free games in the ground.
567000	570000	It's like you get it and you bring it home and you're like oh well that's why it's buried here.
571000	573000	Don't forget about the re-release that they did of the game. You know about that right?
573000	575000	I know there was a ROM hack not that long ago.
576000	580000	Where they replaced all of the guns with cell phones and I was making a bad joke.
581000	586000	In our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. I thought you were talking about the movie for a minute.
587000	592000	Hitstun in our chatroom says plenty of good games are still being coded by one person. Just look at Let Em Dare this weekend.
592000	601000	Especially in the indie scene. There's a lot of games still made by one person but you're right Hitstun. I should have qualified that comment.
602000	610000	The big budget titles are usually these huge teams of many many people and back in the day ET was a big budget title because of what was riding on it.
611000	612000	But it was still made by just one person.
613000	620000	Let's see also in our chatroom Dark Tetsuya says I know there was a ROM hack out there based on Ms. Pac-Man's engine for the original Pac-Man which was actually good.
620000	627000	Well yeah because the guy who coded the original Pac-Man game was like I need more space and they said no it would make it too expensive.
628000	633000	So when they had the extra space I'm sure the guys was like I told you so you can do look there's the game now it looks right right?
634000	636000	Let's see.
637000	638000	That was my husband.
639000	641000	That was Dan. While Dan approaches throw a pokeball.
642000	644000	People wonder where I get my line from.
645000	646000	Sup bitches.
647000	654000	Alright so anyway I'll go to our chatroom as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
655000	659000	Tiger Claw says the Angry Video Game Nerd movie is basically about the whole ET at a landfill.
660000	666000	Yeah which was I may say actually a fun movie to watch because of how they did all the effects in it.
666000	677000	So everything is all weaved into gaming culture but I'm also with SSG100Matt in our chatroom who said what bothers me is that some people feel this is the quote gaming version of finding the Titanic.
678000	682000	Come on. Yeah because people died on the Titanic. Nobody died in making a VT.
683000	688000	They didn't talk about bodies of old Atari executives that are buried in there as well.
689000	693000	And the broken fingers of programmers that were replaced with cybernetic parts.
693000	702000	So I mean there it is. They dug it up. It's coming out. They got cartridges. They found more than just ET in there.
703000	709000	Now that was the part I was like oh okay I didn't know that. They had a bunch of other stuff in there too like centipede which I don't think was necessarily a poor seller.
710000	713000	They show a copy of that. Now I believe from what I was reading.
714000	716000	Well they could have been thrown away like defective carts or something in there as well.
717000	720000	I had always heard there were other prototypes down there.
720000	729000	Yeah but that's going to be literally finding a needle in a haystack. Again I don't know what story to believe but supposedly 14 truckloads.
730000	736000	Imagine the trucks on the freeway. 14 of them full of cartridges. I mean you're literally finding a needle in a haystack at that point.
737000	743000	So I don't think they're ever going to find necessarily the prototypes besides what they've already found.
743000	752000	But it's interesting to me this whole fact that they're making a movie out of it which actually the movie I don't think the movie is necessarily about the landfill only.
753000	757000	I would bet the movie is about the rise and fall of Atari and maybe we're going to hear about why ET was a failure.
758000	768000	I think the movie stands to be pretty good. We'll see. But it's all an Xbox thing. It's going to be part of Microsoft's little movie on demand thing.
768000	773000	I'm sure they're trying to start building their network and everything. So the movie is going to be on that.
774000	778000	But here's what gets me. This so gets me. I'm irritated.
779000	785000	So Microsoft clearly has a boner for this whole Atari 2600 landfill story and all this stuff.
786000	794000	Yet Microsoft Game Room pulled off life support after 9 months before ET is playable on it.
794000	799000	Explain that to me Microsoft. Explain that to me.
800000	811000	Why is your retro tickle bone enough that you're going to pay all this money for a movie that may or may not work but you won't keep a small team of people there to help keep Game Room afloat?
812000	819000	I don't get it. Of course those of you that have been listening to OLR for a while now know that I was really peeved at the early closure of Game Room.
819000	829000	Because I loved the idea of thousands of games being available on this thing. I liked that they were doing a little more than Virtual Console where you had the replays of high scores.
830000	838000	You had the stuff where you could even play some of it over the internet and all that. It took some of the ideas of Virtual Console and took it to the next level.
839000	847000	The reason why I liked Game Room so much is I was hoping it would be a little competition for Nintendo to really improve their Virtual Console service. But it didn't work out that way.
847000	862000	Well originally when they were talking before Game Room even came out it was supposed to be some sort of avatar version of Playstation Home where you would be walking around your little avatar and have your arcade and stuff all set up and cool stuff like that.
863000	871000	Even though it didn't really work out that way but still it was better than nothing. It was the beginning of something that could have been better through patches and improvements.
871000	873000	Let me imagine it on Xbox One. It could have even been something else.
874000	884000	Let's see. Go into our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says ET wasn't even a huge contributor. They actually made something like a small profit percentage during the crash if I recall correctly.
884000	901000	The video game crash alone was not solely ET. The video game crash happened because ET, Pac-Man, and games like it, these huge budget games that they were making way more than they were actually selling, and the marketplace became flooded.
902000	916000	This is why when Nintendo showed up in America there was that whole Nintendo seal of quality and there's that rule you've probably heard of about that third party Nintendo game makers were limited to three games a year.
917000	927000	That whole rule existed to prevent what happened to the 2600 from happening all over again. Because what happened is because anybody could make an Atari 2600 game they were literally cranking out shit.
928000	942000	And it was a lot of commercial shit. Wasn't there like a Purina dog chow game? There was some really bad stuff on the 2600. Especially during the end of its life. They're trying to charge all this money for it and it just bins and bins full of cartridges nobody wanted.
943000	950000	So that's why Nintendo tried to take that different approach where they really tried to control what was going to flow out in the market. And, love it or hate it, it worked.
950000	962000	And now the game industry is where it's at today. And now gaming is such a part of our culture because many of us grew up on the Atari 2600, the Nintendo, and so on and so on.
963000	966000	So where's the landfill with all those Tony Hawk ride controllers?
967000	968000	And all the Guitar Hero, Band Hero.
969000	971000	Band Hero. No, Rock Revolution.
972000	974000	Those landfills are called Dollar Tree, I believe.
975000	976000	No, they're called Dimple.
976000	982000	Oh man, if there's ever Rock Revolution and a Dollar Tree, I'm taking that thing. I don't care what system it's for.
983000	989000	I think I saw a copy of Rock Revolution for 48 cents at a GameStop, actually. It was just the game though, no peripherals.
990000	996000	And I was like, that shelf space is worth more than 48 cents. You really need to just throw that in the landfill.
996000	1008000	Alright. Anyhow, we're going to talk more about the whole E.T. and the landfill and gaming urban legends a little later on when we get into our FUGL Question of the Week.
1009000	1019000	But for now, let's talk about what games, modern games, we've been playing this week and the types of video games we've been playing before we throw them away this week.
1020000	1021000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1021000	1030000	Sorry, it was allergy-riffic, apparently. I did start playing Bravely Default, which, thank you for my birthday present, Mr. Rab.
1031000	1036000	And I've been playing a crap load of Animal Crossing. I finally have every song in Animal Crossing.
1037000	1050000	I have blue violets and I have a shitload of blue roses, so really, if anyone needs any rose of any color except gold, I'm going to be turning off my city ordinance so that I can get gold roses next and then grow a shit-ton of them.
1051000	1061000	I played a crap load of Final Fantasy XIV this week for me, a crap load for me. So now I am about halfway through 39 going to 40.
1062000	1071000	And, holy crap, I forgot what else I did. I did play some Mass Effect because, like I said, I've got my mods working again.
1071000	1083000	And I really, really want to start getting a good playthrough of Dragon Age 2 again because, to be perfectly honest, so far I like it so much better than the first one.
1084000	1091000	And Thenris. That and I'm probably going to get Inquisition when it comes out.
1091000	1112000	And. Well, it's not video game related. I did actually go ahead and swallow my doubt and I've started reading the Chair of Swords books after having finished all of the Hunger Games books in, what did it take me, a week?
1113000	1115000	Are you watching the show at all? Because that's Shane's thing right now.
1116000	1117000	I will not watch the show.
1118000	1119000	Until you read the books or are you just never going to watch it?
1119000	1129000	I'm probably not going to watch the show at all. I might watch scenes just to give myself a good extra visual but I don't really think I want to watch the show because I hate just sitting down and watching a show.
1130000	1133000	I'm behind on Supernatural. And you know, that's my thing.
1134000	1147000	So I have gotten to, without being spoilery for people who have the intention later on of going up and catching up, I have gotten to where someone has dropped out of a window.
1148000	1151000	I won't say who or how or what and who did it. But that's the part that I'm on in the book now.
1151000	1161000	And so far I'm like, actually, the first time I started reading it I got almost as far as politics and put the book away.
1162000	1167000	Because I hate medieval politics. But actually I've started focusing on the characters more and now I'm really liking it better.
1168000	1171000	So I'm adding that to my list. I will not watch the show but I will read the books.
1172000	1179000	Alright. Before we get to Loki's Gaming Week, over at live.vognetwork.com, I felt Loki should know ActDeft said,
1180000	1187000	Loki, a friend of mine got a copy of Rock Revolution from a Dollar Tree store. It was a dollar. So you really can get it there apparently. I was just making shit up but apparently you really can.
1188000	1200000	That's to be expected I guess. The only thing I've seen out of the Dollar Tree were those kind of unnecessary accessory packs for the Wii to make your Wii Sports experience a little bit more involved I guess.
1201000	1210000	You can sometimes find games there. Very rarely that it happens. I usually see them not so much at the dollar store but at those clearance stores like Wise Buys.
1211000	1212000	Like at Big Lots or something.
1213000	1217000	Yeah, Big Lots. That kind of stuff. Dude, I found Mass Effect toys at Big Lots. I was excited.
1218000	1219000	Why didn't you get me any?
1220000	1221000	This was before you were into it.
1222000	1223000	Why didn't you get me any? Why couldn't you read the future?
1224000	1226000	This was in that short period before you were into it but I was really into it.
1227000	1230000	I still need to get my Miranda Pop figure so I can turn it into a thumb chip.
1231000	1239000	It was the Big Lots not far from where I live over yonder so you can always check their shelves. It might still be there. They had Tron toys too. I know, right?
1240000	1241000	I have a recognizer.
1242000	1243000	Okay, Loki. How was your gaming week?
1244000	1251000	I didn't play that much. The only thing I played this week was just a little bit of Modern Warfare 2 and it was very little because I only had three people join in this week.
1251000	1261000	Which is unusual. You usually have like about eight or more. So we just played for maybe like an hour. So I'm Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer and that's about it.
1262000	1263000	Alright.
1264000	1265000	I didn't do anything else.
1266000	1267000	Well, a full time dad.
1268000	1271000	Yeah, any other free time that I have I'm just sitting here coding.
1272000	1276000	Oh yeah. Are you going to give us an update on your coding adventure and all that?
1276000	1284000	Not really too much update. I put a little video up just because I was working on something. Actually I had worked on that a while ago.
1285000	1290000	Last night I was like I want to make a video because I like looking at these missiles. They're funny.
1291000	1301000	So I went ahead and did that but I've been working on the manager scripts for running basically levels and scoring and all that stuff.
1302000	1313000	And so I've had to figure out like how I want to store the actual data, what data I want to store like actually as a save file and stuff and do all the serialization to write save files and that kind of fun stuff.
1314000	1324000	And then figure out how I want it. I'm trying to think of it in a way that I can do it so that it's flexible enough for what I want to do with everything.
1325000	1334000	It sounds very vague and I can't really go into detail on stuff but I'm doing all the boring stuff now so I can get to the fun stuff later. Basically.
1335000	1336000	Alright.
1337000	1338000	All the coding stuff out of the way so I can make the assets.
1339000	1342000	I can't wait to play. So how much longer? When do I get to play?
1343000	1345000	Do you have an estimated release date?
1346000	1362000	No. See like okay well originally I wanted to have like a one level demo thing done by the end of this month but well actually it was going to be done by the end of the last month and then it's just not going to happen because it's a lot more complicated than you think about a lot of these things.
1363000	1369000	So no I don't have any estimates of when anything playable is going to be ready to go. Hopefully sooner than later.
1370000	1371000	It'll be done when it's done.
1371000	1375000	It'll be done when it's done but I will at some point make like a one level playable thing.
1376000	1378000	You work on the Blizzard timeframe of soon.
1379000	1395000	It's also like how much time do I have to actually code because some days I have zero time and some days I have like a couple hours and some days I have a lot longer than that. It's all about the baby and whether he takes his naps.
1396000	1399000	Fair enough. Understand. Being a full time dad is an important job.
1399000	1406000	Alright I'm going to talk about my gaming week and actually this week I have a variety of new games to talk about. I'm going to talk about three games.
1407000	1416000	Two of them brand spanking new. One of them a few months old and two of them are decent. One of them I'm about to go off and we'll get to that one last.
1417000	1422000	So first up this week I played NES Remix 2 which is available on the Wii U.
1422000	1429000	Thank you Nintendo for giving me a reason to plug in my Wii U for the first time in two months since I think NES Remix 1 was out. It was probably the last time I played it.
1430000	1436000	But I did have an opportunity to get into NES Remix 2 which is a little bit kind of what you would expect.
1437000	1441000	It's NES Remix 1 but this time with games that I actually enjoy playing.
1441000	1449000	Last night I went through all the stages in Super Mario Bros. 3 which by the way if you don't know what NES Remix is all about.
1450000	1460000	A lot of people call it WarioWare meets classic Nintendo games but I don't think that's quite accurate because WarioWare was literally micro games.
1461000	1469000	It was like one button push or whatever. It's more like with NES Remix you're using all these ROM save states to play a few seconds of a game.
1469000	1475000	And you have the classic games which would have anywhere between 5 to 20 stages in them.
1476000	1481000	And then you have the remix level which will have really interesting mish matches of games.
1482000	1489000	For example there was one where you're having to beat one of the bosses in Kirby but there's a big boo from Mario Bros. out on the screen.
1490000	1495000	So every time you look away the boo gets closer to eating you. So you have to kind of be able to look both ways. It was kind of a neat little spin on it.
1496000	1504000	Another one which I thought was awesome was that it had the Princess Peach from Super Mario Bros. 2 playable in Super Mario Bros. 3.
1505000	1511000	And you have to play a stage as Princess Peach in Mario 3. That kind of shit's really cool and that's like my favorite parts of NES Remix.
1512000	1521000	Is when it's like oh my god why can't this be a thing in virtual console games. Like oh my god this is fun. I'm playing the princess in Mario 3. Worlds collide. It's crazy.
1522000	1533000	But a typical type of stage that you would play in say Mario Bros. 3, one of the last stages, you have to beat Bowser as Frog Mario.
1534000	1539000	Which is a lot harder than it sounds because you can't get hit once. Because if you get hit once you lose the frog suit and you lose the stage.
1540000	1543000	And it's all about who can do this in the fastest amount of time.
1543000	1552000	So I mean I like NES Remix 2 a lot better than 1 because the games are games where I am going like oh yeah I loved Mario 3 and oh I never thought.
1553000	1559000	I was playing Mario 3 and one of those stages again is to beat a boss in the frog suit and I never realized. Never until this day.
1560000	1566000	If you beat that boss in the frog suit and you get the wand and you turn the king back because remember that was the whole thing in Mario 3.
1567000	1571000	You got the wands and you untransformed the kings back to what they were supposed to look like.
1571000	1579000	If you kill one of those guys in the frog suit when the king thanks you he says oh it appears you've been transformed.
1580000	1586000	Shall I use this magic wand to remove the curse? I never knew that was a thing that could happen until I played NES Remix 2.
1587000	1599000	So I thought for that I thought it was like really rad. So I was into NES Remix 2 again I think it's very much like virtual console demos, Nintendo nostalgia.
1599000	1608000	But I think it's good enough especially if you're a Nintendo fan. The parts that get me that I really wish they could do better, motherfucking online.
1609000	1616000	It's always something with online that bugs me about Nintendo and this time it's that championship mode you get when you have NES Remix 1 and you have NES Remix 2.
1617000	1627000	Well the championship mode is fun enough you know get 50 coins in Mario 1 then get I think 25 coins in Mario 3 then get as much of a score as you can in Dr. Mario with the time you have left.
1627000	1632000	That's fun enough although I wish maybe every week there'd be a different challenge that would be even more interesting.
1633000	1641000	But here's what gets me. Okay so you get a high score great you can post it to Miiverse and then you can look at the global leaderboards for that day.
1642000	1652000	And that's it. That's it. No lifetime leaderboards, no comparing with my friends leaderboard which is the one I really want to see.
1652000	1660000	I mean I guess I could go into Miiverse and I could look at all the posts to figure that out but that's not intuitive.
1661000	1670000	Is that a difficult thing Nintendo? Is that a hard thing? I want a friend's leaderboard? Is that a hard thing to do?
1671000	1681000	You have to understand they're just a little teeny bit slow. I mean they just now announced their first game that's actually going to have a season pass with it for DLC.
1682000	1688000	I mean hell they just had their first game with DLC last year. Things like that I'm okay with them being behind the curve.
1689000	1693000	No I understand that but this is still part of online and they just don't get it.
1694000	1701000	Agdeft in chat kind of sums it up over at live.vognetware.com says NES Remix 2 is better than 1 but it's not that much different from 1.
1702000	1704000	It's just you know better games. That's the crux of it.
1705000	1716000	I wish there was actually third party games in there like Blaster Master or Fester's Quest would be kind of a licensing thing but Rad Racer would be awesome.
1717000	1718000	Yeah right?
1718000	1730000	I mean can't you just go hey Square Enix or whoever the hell has it Square I guess. Come on. Come on. Was that ever on Virtual Console? Rad Racer?
1731000	1741000	I don't think so. I could be wrong but I don't believe so. I think 3D World Runner was though oddly enough because I think they actually did that in 3D.
1742000	1750000	Anyhow. Let's see. Thank you. Paganju in the chat room says applause. Nice rant. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Appreciate it.
1751000	1756000	Alright. Let's talk about game number 2 that I played this week that was decent.
1757000	1766000	I played Marvel Puzzle Quest which is a free to play game available on Steam. Apparently it's available on iPod and iPad and all that stuff as well.
1766000	1775000	But I can only really get it on Steam because that's what I wanted. I wanted to play with my new computer and all that and I didn't want to fill up my iPad with all this stuff.
1776000	1782000	Plus I was invited by Robababababa one of our listeners sent me a little Steam message like hey you should really check this out.
1783000	1789000	And I was like you know I have been meaning to check that out because hey it's free and hey I like puzzle games and okay Marvel characters are in it. Cool.
1789000	1795000	Which met all my expectations. Hey it's free. Hey it's a puzzle game and hey Marvel characters are in it.
1796000	1806000	My only things where I was a little bit like eh this is a little weird. Playing in Steam it definitely feels like I'm playing a tablet game with some of the interface and the way things are in the interface.
1807000	1816000	Some awkward things like I didn't like you have to click on Iron Man's glowing hand to start the game and I don't know some of that was weird.
1816000	1828000	There's just some of the free to play elements are a little bit irksome like you know having to buy the purple. I mean you don't have to buy these purple gems to level up your characters.
1829000	1838000	But having to buy the extra slots so you can have more than one stock character when you really want to collect these characters and if you don't put them in your party they'll disappear in five days.
1838000	1847000	Some of that stuff was a little bit irksome but the core game itself is Puzzle Quest if you remember and I think I even asked on this show like two weeks ago.
1848000	1853000	Maybe this is why Rob Bubba recommended it to me but I think I asked on the show a couple weeks ago whatever happened to Puzzle Quest?
1854000	1858000	We had Puzzle Quest 1, we had Puzzle Quest 2, we had Puzzle Quest The Galactus and it disappeared. Oh thank you this is what happened to it.
1858000	1868000	It is now Marvel Puzzle Quest and it's that whole match three where sometimes you're the one person and you go versus somebody else and they take a turn and you take a turn.
1869000	1874000	And you can form these little teams of 10 and earn some of the currency that's in games and all that's nice.
1875000	1882000	So again even though some of the free to play elements are a little bit eye roll worthy the core game itself is Puzzle Quest.
1882000	1891000	So if you like those match three type of games and you like free games I'm going to recommend this 25 times before I ever recommend you go play Candy Crush.
1892000	1898000	So take that. So there you go Marvel Puzzle Quest that's the second game I liked that was decent.
1898000	1911000	Now let's talk about another game this week that pissed me off because nothing bothers me more than seeing a great franchise have a colossal shit taken on it.
1912000	1919000	And that's what I feel happened this week with the release of Soul Calibur Lost Swords on the PlayStation 3.
1920000	1927000	Now I don't know if you guys know but Namco has a few free to play games on the PlayStation 3 and the ones I've played so far were pretty good.
1928000	1932000	Tekken resurrection or whatever the hell it's called yeah that one Tekken that was pretty good.
1933000	1938000	I remember talking about that on the show the only reason I deleted that from my PlayStation 3 is I needed room for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.
1939000	1945000	Now that I've moved Realm Reborn to PlayStation 4 I have all this room on my PlayStation 3 again so I'm checking out more of the free to play games.
1946000	1953000	So I was like great I have this 3.5 gig download for Soul Calibur Lost Swords I'm like okay great I'll download this and check it out.
1953000	1957000	Let's talk about some of the problems with Soul Calibur Lost Swords.
1958000	1967000	A. The game didn't fucking work the day it came out you tried to connect to the lobby server error 37 or you know whatever error code it was can't get into the game.
1968000	1971000	And you might have seen this on some of the gaming blog websites that the game doesn't work.
1972000	1977000	So I tried to play it a little later in the day I was able to get in but it was slow as hell.
1977000	1984000	And it's slow because loading loading loading loading loading loading menu screen.
1985000	1992000	Okay I'm gonna select new quest press the button to go to the quest connecting connecting connecting connecting loading loading loading loading loading.
1993000	1996000	Oh here's your here's your design a character screen with your three characters you can pick from.
1997000	2004000	Alright I want to be Mitsurugi click loading loading loading loading loading connecting connecting is this game not on my fucking hard drive?
2004000	2010000	Why is it having to load every few seconds for so long at a time?
2011000	2020000	And the amount that it talks to the server god damn every little thing you do connecting connecting connecting connecting hourglass hourglass hourglass hourglass.
2021000	2026000	It is a it is a slog fest just to do anything in the game.
2027000	2029000	And what is it you get to do in the Soul Calibur game?
2029000	2038000	You get a single player experience where you fight NPCs that's right there's no versus mode in Soul Calibur Lost Swords.
2039000	2044000	Well that's probably a good thing because the way it sounds right now there wouldn't be a versus mode anyways because you wouldn't be able to do anything.
2045000	2050000	Which is fine but isn't versus the soul of Soul Calibur?
2051000	2055000	What in the actual fuck were they thinking in the design of this game?
2055000	2064000	They have the Barbie mode in there oh fantastic I can build these characters with these pay to pay to win clothes items.
2065000	2067000	What's it need to be on the server for if it's single player?
2068000	2073000	Great fucking question Loki. Fantastic. I don't know.
2073000	2083000	Oh wait I do know because in lieu of there being a versus player mode what happens is that you can have your little team of people.
2084000	2090000	And every time you go into a match you get three random people and you can select one of them to be on your team.
2091000	2095000	And when you fill up a meter you can press L1 to use that person for five seconds.
2096000	2099000	So it's like a little tag team fighting game that sounds really cool right?
2099000	2106000	Okay so the same three characters I can pick everybody else picks.
2107000	2113000	So essentially I'm Mitsurugi and I'm picking this guy who's Mitsurugi in a green outfit to be on my team for the match.
2114000	2116000	Boring.
2118000	2123000	So what the hell is the point of Barbie mode if I don't show off these characters to anybody?
2123000	2129000	Because they're literally complete strangers. I can't go onto my friends list and say oh I want these friends to be in my alliance.
2130000	2136000	I want them to be a part of it. No that's just not there. It's too cell phone game for that.
2137000	2147000	Soul Calibur Lost Swords is a 3.5 gigabyte cell phone game for your Playstation 3 and it is garbage from the ground up.
2147000	2156000	I cannot believe I'm sitting here telling you a free to play game rates so low on the scale not worth your time to download.
2157000	2166000	Not worth it. Especially in the state it's in now. I might have been a little more forgiving had the servers and all that stuff actually worked.
2167000	2170000	But I'm sorry there's no reason for it to be talking to the server that much.
2171000	2174000	I don't care if they're trying to protect the hacking or the integrity of the potions.
2175000	2176000	Who hacks a free to play game like that?
2177000	2183000	Well I don't think people actually hack free to play games on the PS3. I mean PCXC may be doing that or iOS or something like that.
2184000	2194000	Then talk to the server once a day. But what's the fuck? Loki, there's no versus mode in Soul Calibur Lost Swords. Why would I need to hack the system?
2195000	2199000	Because I'm guessing that there's going to be some in game purchases.
2200000	2206000	Oh yeah there's plenty of those Loki. Oh yeah you want to buy a 2-2 for your character? Sure you can take that. That's fine.
2207000	2212000	You get all these little elemental rocks to put in your sword. Do you have like a time limit in a day where you can only play that game once?
2213000	2221000	Oh absolutely and you can buy the potions to fill it all up and all that. But again Loki, if I hack the game and get all that stuff for free, who else's game is that going to impact?
2222000	2226000	Nobody's? Nobody's! That's right.
2226000	2244000	Whoever designed this game, you made a horrible mistake. You took a dump on the Soul Calibur franchise which is a franchise that I graciously respect and I love.
2245000	2252000	And I am there at the feeding bar hitting it for a single pellet of any Soul Calibur game that comes out. I'm going to think twice next time.
2252000	2264000	This is the road Namco's going on. Well yeah exactly. Remember not too long ago, I mean it seems like it was so long ago, but remember that they decided to do something similar except it wasn't free to play.
2265000	2275000	Although it sure played like it was a free to play demo or something like that. The Vita version of Ridge Racer. Remember Ridge Racer? The game that awesomely launched systems and stuff like that?
2275000	2288000	Well it came out for the Vita and had like two cars or four cars and two tracks. Oh but if you want the rest you have to pay for DLC. Oh well that's not so bad. Maybe the game's free and I can download the rest of that stuff.
2289000	2297000	Oh no I'm sorry the game's actually $40. But you gotta buy all the extra tracks and cars because reasons.
2297000	2309000	Akuma JP in the chat room says Sky Namco, all Japanese company, is still trying to understand online. Well chalk this one up to learning lesson I guess. I just wish you hadn't done it with your...
2310000	2317000	But that doesn't make any sense so they understand online because the other Soul Calibur games were online. Oh and Tekken, Tekken was great. Tekken's great online. I mean I don't...
2318000	2323000	The free to play Tekken is fine. I was expecting that was Soul Calibur and I was so disappointed.
2323000	2335000	What is it that they don't understand? Maybe I'm guessing, you know, let's not blame Namco because they are the publisher. It is the developer that probably doesn't understand online. But yes it is Namco's fault that they let this kind of garbage go through.
2336000	2351000	Okay I gotta, I gotta... Bobby Black Wolf shading you in chat. Loki I've gotta read this one from our pal Bobby Black Wolf says quote, who hacks a free to play game? From Loki. Today. Quote, I hacked Tiny Tower and got bored with it. Loki three years ago.
2352000	2370000	I was never gonna pay for anything in Tiny Tower. And I'm glad I got bored with it because how long did everyone else play Tiny Tower for? Yeah exactly. I have more time that I could dedicate to other things like Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row or something like that. And I hacked those games too. So I don't care. Well Saints Row I do at least. But as a mod.
2371000	2380000	I'm just reading the chat. I'm just now, because I've been turned around the whole time while I was ranting and I'm seeing everybody in chat going Rob needs a drink. Or when did Rob take on the Loki rant role on this show?
2381000	2403000	Yeah, well, Jujuda actually made a good point where they do understand online in Japan back in the 90s. You could trade Pokemon on your cell phone. There were also the Digimon battler things which they came out over here too. But those were fun. I mean not necessarily like online in that sense because it would have been a little bit more difficult to do over dial-up.
2403000	2413000	But certainly with using some sort of interactive wireless play. You know those concepts were well understood. All they have to do is just keep integrating stuff like that. I miss the barcode scanner.
2414000	2417000	I'm not saying Japan doesn't understand online. I'm saying the people who made this game don't understand online.
2418000	2421000	It sounds like though that your game's on dial-up by the way you describe it.
2422000	2427000	I mean that in itself is unforgivable but then you really start to realize like what am I doing?
2427000	2432000	It's like when is there an online only game that actually works correctly when it comes out?
2433000	2439000	The last Warcraft expansion had a really smooth launch. I'll give it that.
2440000	2451000	Alright, let's see. Bobby Blackpool says I still think the best part is that they use a friend code system to add allies. It's not even Dash like the Wii friend codes. It's just a mess of numbers.
2451000	2457000	What were you thinking? I'm wondering if they're going to tie it to an iPad game but then I'm like they can't do that.
2458000	2463000	I mean when you are doing the single player fighting it is essentially Soul Calibur 5. Essentially.
2464000	2475000	Here's the nice thing I'll say about Soul Calibur Lost Swords. Once you can take the 3 minutes to get into your 30 second fight you get 30 seconds of Soul Calibur 5 action.
2475000	2486000	With Soul Calibur 5 music. But I'm going to go with Tigerclaw in the chat room who says I still have Soul Calibur 5 just haven't been playing it as much.
2487000	2495000	And then what does he say? Something about you should just go play Soul Calibur 5. Oh yeah, why not bring out your copy of Soul Calibur 5 and play that instead? It has online.
2495000	2505000	My thoughts exactly. So I will say the place where Soul Calibur Lost Swords succeeded is it made me go I'm going to delete this shit and I'm going to go play Soul Calibur 5.
2506000	2512000	Because I need to erase this from my memory. And their mission is complete. I guess so. That catalog of Soul Calibur 5 is sold.
2513000	2521000	If that's what Namco is trying to do. Congratulations. I guess. But at what cost Namco? At what cost?
2524000	2534000	I'm done with my rant. I just as a Soul Calibur fan I was just so irritated with that. 3.5 gigs for what? A game that doesn't even work and is flawed fundamentally.
2534000	2549000	Anyhow. Battlefield 4 is still broken. I did play Marvel Puzzle Quest a few times this week though. That's not a broken free to play game. I mean some of the transactions are a little weird but I had fun with it.
2550000	2559000	I liked NES Remix 2 even though that wasn't free. Does it have problems too? Yeah. Anyway. That's that.
2560000	2573000	Nemesis 47 in chat says or get Soul Calibur 6. Yes please get Soul Calibur 6 but please make sure this particular game has nothing on it. You need to turn away and never look back from Soul Calibur Lost Swords.
2574000	2590000	Alright. Let's get into some housekeeping tonight. Tonight's housekeeping. I don't have a lot. We still have shows on the horizon for the next few weeks. No cancellations in the future. We're getting on into May. I think the next show we'll probably have off is whenever GamerX is. Since Jamie and I are both going we probably won't be back in time for a show.
2590000	2602000	This will be us. Hi. We're broadcasting from grandpa's place. I can't feel my face. We've actually talked about doing that so that is a possibility. You never know.
2603000	2612000	That'd be great having Victoria on the show. It would be fun even though she doesn't really play video games. Don't care. We still need Victoria on the show. Some of our greatest guests were not gamers. You know it's great.
2612000	2635000	Also even though he's probably not listening to the show because he made out like a bandit as far as I'm aware. Happy birthday Julian who is 7 years old. 7? 7. This many Rob. Awesome. Well happy birthday Julian. Although Becky would be out celebrating with Julian right? Probably. I'm getting him Legos. Julian I'm getting you more Legos.
2636000	2651000	Also in housekeeping tonight Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio to follow us on Facebook. Black Wolf in chat says Rob can't even. Can't even. Next he'll bitch about the casting of the Jem and the Holograms movie.
2652000	2662000	Look. The Jem and the Holograms movie is just one of those things where I'm like oh it's happening. I won't see it. There's the Jem and the Holograms. I hear it's truly outrageous. There's a movie? Truly outrageous.
2663000	2669000	There just comes a point where you realize they're going to make movies out of everything you love for me to use. Rob you're going to see it. You know how I know this? You have Josie and the Pussycats.
2670000	2692000	You see here. You jumped ahead because I was going to say if the Jem and the Holograms movie is as awesomely good bad as Josie and the Pussycats is and I mean good bad where Josie and the Pussycats was actually like a really bad movie but it's so quotable and it's so over the top stupid like it's made for 7 year old girls but there's that subtle layer of humor that only the parents are going to get.
2693000	2699000	I mean come on. The boy band in the opening minutes of the movie has a song called Back Door Lover. That's funny.
2700000	2705000	Yeah. It's like watching. It's like the equivalent of watching Rocky and Bulldog would have been in the 60s.
2706000	2712000	My point is put Parker Posey in the Jem and the Holograms movie and we'll be fine. Okay? We'll be fine.
2712000	2722000	Honk if you love Pussycats. Alright. Anyway. Let's get into some gaming news.
2723000	2724000	I need to watch that movie again, Rob.
2725000	2728000	That's so good. It's so good. But don't get the DVD that's actually like the PG version.
2729000	2730000	No. No. No. No. No.
2731000	2737000	Because they cut out all the good jokes. Get the PG-13 one. Alright. Anyway. That's why that movie flopped you know. It was rated PG-13 yet it was made for 7 year old girls. Oops.
2737000	2747000	So the only people that went and saw it were people like me. Anyway. Let's get to some actual video game news.
2748000	2752000	Maybe they'll make a video game to go to the Jem and the Holograms movie. Who knows? But in the meantime we've got what's going on this week.
2753000	2754000	We'll only give them 6 weeks to program it.
2755000	2758000	Well they'll be on bargain bin shelves at some point.
2761000	2766000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at VoGnetwork.com use the passphrase silver.
2767000	2775000	Well GameStop. You know they have a ton of stores. Probably thanks to their acquisitions of the EB Games and that kind of stuff.
2776000	2783000	I mean they've got a lot. A lot of stores. And it's not a really big surprise that they're setting it up to close 120 of those stores.
2784000	2793000	Probably because I mean shit. They've done reductions of their stores but like there was literally GameStops like you know a couple.
2794000	2798000	Like there was an EB and a GameStop in a mall or something like that and now you have like two GameStops there.
2799000	2804000	Hell we have a mall by us. There's a GameStop in the mall and across the street there's a GameStop. So it's kind of redundant.
2805000	2806000	But yeah they're going to be.
2807000	2813000	Not anymore Loki. I know nobody in town actually goes to said mall anymore. By the way we're talking about something.
2814000	2819000	For you SAC locals. The hip and cool Sunrise Mall. The GameStop. They're closed. Go figure.
2820000	2824000	But you're right. I mean there still are some malls in America where it's like there's two GameStops in the mall.
2825000	2826000	Yeah. So you know.
2827000	2831000	It's kind of ridiculous. I mean they don't even serve pretzels. So I mean why would you need two of them.
2831000	2838000	So they're basically doing this GameStop 3.0 initiative. I didn't know there was a 2.0 initiative so that must be new.
2839000	2845000	I think the 2.0 initiative was them changing from the polos and slacks to gamer t-shirts and jeans.
2846000	2852000	The 2.0 initiative was when they murdered Funco Land and buried its body in a landfill in New Mexico.
2853000	2856000	Remember when Dan started for GameStop he actually started a Funco Land.
2856000	2865000	Well GameStop 3.0. It's basically this brand new thing that they're actually going to push more mobile.
2866000	2871000	So you know I guess the reselling of mobile phones and stuff like that's been really popular.
2872000	2880000	So they're going to have 200 to 250 spring mobile stores and 20 to 25 simply Mac locations.
2881000	2883000	And yes 100 to 150 cricket stores. What the hell are those.
2883000	2887000	For towns too small for an Apple store is that what Simply Mac is for.
2888000	2891000	I guess. When your town can't have an Apple store you can have Simply Mac.
2892000	2903000	Actually one thing I can say is that there are actually quite a number of certified retailers and repair places that actually will do a lot more for people than the Apple store will.
2904000	2906000	Best Buy is one of them isn't it.
2906000	2911000	Best Buy's have like Apple shops in them. But I mean there's other places that are just on their own.
2912000	2913000	Makes sense.
2914000	2924000	And of course you know they do have 6600 stores right now so 120 is not a whole ton compared to that stuff.
2925000	2928000	And I guess I don't know I'm just surprised that people buy mobile devices.
2928000	2936000	Well I'm sorry to our listeners if you worked at one of those 120 stores but you know let's turn lemons into lemonade.
2937000	2939000	Maybe there'll be another opportunity somewhere else.
2940000	2942000	You burn their house down with combustible lemons.
2943000	2950000	I don't know. I guess when they're that size you know it's not a surprise that they're going to be downsized.
2951000	2958000	But hey you know if one of these leaves you know some people get enterprising and they decide hey I'm going to open up my own independent game store.
2959000	2962000	Because GameStop's gone and so now I'm going to take the place.
2963000	2965000	There's another place you could possibly work.
2966000	2970000	Is there going to be game stores in 10 years?
2970000	2971000	Yes.
2971000	2973000	Or is GameStop going to go the way of Blockbuster?
2974000	2975000	No I don't think. See here's the problem.
2976000	2980000	It's like with Blockbuster though I mean that's all movie rental stuff.
2981000	2985000	I mean streaming video is something that's pretty easy to do streaming games.
2986000	2988000	I mean we haven't really seen a whole ton of that.
2988000	2993000	Yeah they're starting to work on that but I just don't think that bandwidth wise.
2993000	3002000	I mean if you download a movie you know it's not as big as if you download an Xbox One game that's you know several it's like 50 gigs.
3003000	3007000	And then you're waiting for that download over you know your really slow internet.
3008000	3012000	Here's the thing Loki. I get that technology is not 100% there right now but in 10 years it's going to be.
3013000	3014000	I mean technology is moving that fast.
3015000	3017000	You can stream high definition movies now.
3018000	3020000	Now there is still a market for Blu-rays and there's still a market for DVDs.
3020000	3024000	That all exists but there are so few specialty stores anymore.
3025000	3028000	All the Suncoast, did FYE's close? One of those guys closed.
3029000	3033000	Suncoast and everything closed and the places that really specialize in that stuff are gone.
3034000	3037000	You know now it's if I want a Blu-ray I buy it on Amazon or I go to Target, Wal-Mart.
3038000	3039000	It's just because it's become a lot more accessible.
3040000	3047000	Like I remember I used to go to Suncoast because I was looking for anime because you can't find anime like anywhere.
3047000	3051000	You lease a lot of like you know your Wal-Marts and stuff like that.
3052000	3056000	So I had a specific reason I went there and you know.
3057000	3059000	All of the first anime I ever bought was from Suncoast.
3060000	3063000	Yeah now you can just go online and order off Amazon or order it off wherever.
3064000	3065000	It was a place you could find subtitled anime in Alabama.
3066000	3070000	Now I think there will still always be a demand for secondhand stuff.
3071000	3075000	And I think you know especially independent secondhand stores will thrive especially in big areas.
3075000	3079000	You know you'll have that one store in town and you know that will always kind of be a thing.
3080000	3081000	But especially you know for retro gamers and stuff.
3082000	3086000	But I kind of don't think that on a mass scale something like GameStop is going to work in ten years.
3087000	3095000	It's all about trust I think because honestly you know a lot of these consoles aren't going to go digital only because the consumers don't trust the companies that run the consoles.
3096000	3101000	There's a lot more trust for Valve and the Steam platform than there is for Microsoft or Sony or even.
3101000	3107000	Well I don't know about Nintendo. Nintendo is just not doing anything really. I mean there's I guess virtual console and stuff.
3108000	3111000	But there's not a whole ton of trust where I'm going to buy all my games digitally.
3112000	3113000	Nintendo can't really be evaluated right now.
3114000	3118000	Yeah it's hard to evaluate Nintendo but yeah like I'm not going to really trust you know to.
3119000	3124000	Well first off I don't really see the need to buy a lot of games because you know with PlayStation Plus I just add everything to my queue and.
3125000	3127000	Shit I have a ton of games I haven't played yet.
3128000	3136000	But I just don't want I'm not going to go buy you know a brand new game especially nowadays you know a brand new game that I don't know what the quality is of it.
3137000	3139000	And if it's just garbage I can't do anything with it.
3140000	3142000	It's like oh well fuck me I guess I'm out 60 bucks.
3143000	3147000	You know so I just don't see the point and they're just not going to drop the price.
3148000	3151000	I mean come on they're not going to drop the price on a closed marketplace like that.
3151000	3158000	Of you're not going to find a new game at like you know for a twenty dollars or something like that.
3159000	3163000	Like a brand new like a brand new Halo Halo 10 or whatever you're not going to see at twenty dollars.
3164000	3167000	Yeah I was going to say the Sony sale last weekend we were talking about now that was pretty impressive.
3168000	3170000	But you're right those were all years old games that probably weren't selling anything anyway.
3171000	3173000	Yeah it's you know a sale is money made.
3174000	3179000	Sorry you do bring up a very good point that if one person controls the marketplace like that that's going to be very bad.
3179000	3191000	Yeah it's just like Steam. Yeah there's one you know there's a Steam marketplace but there's so many people out there that sell the Steam games and there's sales all across the board depending on where you want.
3192000	3196000	So there's a lot of competition out there with that stuff and there's even competing in marketplaces if you want to do that.
3197000	3200000	I'm going to be really tinfoil hat here for a minute.
3201000	3203000	Like people are going to point and laugh at me and that's okay but I'm going to ask this question.
3203000	3214000	Because every few years it seems like somebody brings up the whole and especially in light of what we talked about at the top of the show tonight somebody brings up the whole are we headed for another video game crash.
3215000	3230000	If one person if GameStop goes under and hypothetically let's say everything goes digital one person controls that marketplace that Sony or Microsoft controls the marketplace and charges these sixty dollar games that aren't very good will we end up in another video game crash that's all digital.
3230000	3233000	There's no landfills to bury them in anymore it's just book delete.
3234000	3243000	I don't think so just because there's it's it's I know that there's the illusion that there's not a lot of choice but there is a choice you just don't buy that console.
3244000	3255000	You know there's there's the choice of just going on PC there's a lot of there's so many indie developers out there now that there's always going to be choices and your choice may be just not playing on that platform.
3255000	3267000	You know and there that's the thing is these console manufacturers are aware that this indie wave is kind of where it's at because there's a lot of fresh game ideas and you know innovative things happening there.
3268000	3282000	That's why they're trying to get everybody on board with bringing their games to the console because they see that they're doing well on PC and it's like oh well that's another reason I should buy PlayStation 4 because you know this game that I've played on steam is also on PlayStation 4.
3282000	3291000	You know but I think that's why they're I mean look at Minecraft shit you know Minecraft sells like crazy on Xbox 360 even though it's been out on PC for fucking ever.
3292000	3297000	And so but still that's a draw people look at that like shit I want to get Minecraft.
3298000	3305000	All right some some folks think the end could be already coming Akuma JP says we're already in a crash and guys you know says games are already doing bad.
3305000	3313000	So anyway I do want to try to move on but I do have a couple more thoughts to get out here as 100 Matt and chat says the problem is that malls are dying.
3314000	3318000	People don't go to malls anymore because they are able to buy things cheaper and deliver to you via online.
3319000	3326000	I mean but here's the thing you can't buy Cinnabon online. Well maybe you can know. Can you get a food court online.
3326000	3332000	Well here's the thing I don't but there's places like I don't know if we have anything like that here but in Alabama we had a takeout taxi.
3333000	3340000	Not. Oh well you know where they bring it to you. But even that I don't personally I don't really like pizza. I don't like buying clothes on.
3341000	3347000	Yeah yeah unless it's like a T-shirt T-shirt. Those those like the thread lists and the shirt woots and all that. That's one thing.
3348000	3352000	But the whole like you know especially like pants you got to try those on you. I don't I don't buy that stuff on my shoes.
3353000	3361000	Change from anything like nothing against Zappos which has an amazing customer service. And the one time Alan did buy me shoes online.
3362000	3367000	They didn't fit. So we had to send it back. You know that whole thing. And they were really great about it. Great customer service.
3368000	3371000	But I'm kind of like I kind of prefer to do that stuff in a store you know where I can like you know try the shoes on.
3372000	3381000	They have stores too. Do they really. Yeah a few. But I still think there's some things that are in a mall it's just maybe what's in that mall might be shifting a little bit.
3382000	3393000	I don't really see that. There's no more Walden books. Exactly. It's hard. It's hard to shop for sex toys online when you can walk into Spencer's gifts and they're all right there in front of you.
3394000	3405000	You can handle them. You can you know. Exactly. All right. Anyhow let's move on. Really good discussion. If you guys have something you want to contribute you can visit our email bag.
3405000	3410000	It's Participate at OrangeLaundry.com if you want to participate in the show with a future week.
3411000	3417000	In the meantime I got to move on for time so let's talk about the PlayStation 4 firmware update that's coming on April 30th.
3418000	3423000	April 30th we'll see firmware 1.70 hit the PlayStation 4 and there's a few changes coming to this.
3423000	3432000	The share factory video editing suite is the big one. Now your recorded videos you'll be able to do a little more complex.
3433000	3443000	Excuse me. I have the hiccups. Radio guy's biggest enemy. Share factory will allow you to edit the videos that you are automatically taking when you play the PlayStation 4.
3444000	3450000	It's a little more robust editing system so that's going to be a great thing. The other thing that's pretty awesome HDCP off.
3450000	3456000	So meaning that if you do use an external capture card. You don't use the built in streaming device.
3457000	3465000	You use a capture card to either save the video for your YouTubes or whatever. You will be able to turn the HDCP or the copy protection off at least with the games.
3466000	3469000	I'm assuming for Blu-rays it will still be on because that would be a little silly if they didn't turn that off.
3470000	3472000	But with games that will be off. That will be good.
3472000	3482000	And then also auto downloading where you can preload games that you've preordered so they unlock right on the release day. That is coming as well.
3483000	3484000	I thought that feature was already there but I guess it wasn't.
3485000	3488000	It was something that I think they started with Infamous maybe?
3489000	3494000	I think you could just download it on the day. But now they're talking about depending on the manufacturing of the game.
3495000	3500000	Up to a week before or three days before. Well in my head I'm like didn't they do that with Borderlands 2 on the PlayStation 3 release?
3500000	3508000	They tried that with Grand Theft Auto 5. The digital version of that and it got leaked out and then people started digging through the files and stuff.
3509000	3516000	So they're going to try this again and ultimately it's up to the person who makes the game how much of a window they want to give.
3517000	3524000	But to charge you the $60 to have it ready to go on midnight the day it's out. I'm sure many companies will gladly do it.
3524000	3534000	So there you go. Tigerclaw in chat says will the PlayStation 4 update add 3D support? Not that I've heard. I've heard 3D Blu-ray not a priority to get enabled right now.
3535000	3537000	Because 3D is kind of going out as fast as it came in.
3538000	3542000	It's still kind of lame that you'd want that support because you had it on your other console.
3543000	3547000	Yeah that's kind of bothersome. But you know what else I'd like to see support for would be playing the PlayStation 3 games.
3548000	3552000	But that's just not going to be possible on the PlayStation 4 until the streaming thing happens.
3553000	3555000	Alright, Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?
3556000	3564000	I have some interesting stuff. This actually has to do with a big argument that's been going on between different people.
3565000	3569000	What's better, playing on PC or playing on a console? You know the old debate.
3570000	3574000	Well right now I think people are saying that they prefer PC more than their consoles.
3574000	3582000	Because right now there is quite a heavy overlap with players that are playing on both types of systems.
3583000	3591000	And that the PC market is now overselling versus, well selling better than the console market.
3592000	3599000	That more people are getting games on consoles. Especially with different MMOs and MOBA games and different things like that.
3599000	3610000	And especially since we're seeing a lot more top named titles coming out for PC and with consoles than we did in the past.
3611000	3614000	There's not just the one or the other, now it's you have your pick.
3615000	3617000	Is there a me? I play everything on PC.
3618000	3624000	There are some things I prefer to play on console but this news doesn't particularly surprise me.
3624000	3632000	Because there are a lot of casual gamers who don't necessarily, I mean almost everybody, every house has a PC.
3633000	3640000	Even if you don't have kids or you're older or you're not in the Gen X or lower generations or whatever.
3641000	3647000	You still have a PC and you might be playing Bejeweled or you're playing Facebook games or SimCity or casual things like that.
3648000	3651000	This news doesn't surprise me if you really look at the big picture.
3651000	3660000	And the other thing to consider is that, okay you look at places like China, Korea, I don't even think they have any of the consoles we have here.
3661000	3663000	China especially, I don't think it has any of the stuff we have here.
3664000	3666000	They do. They do international Asian releases.
3667000	3671000	Do they? I thought I heard they do not allow the PlayStation 4s and stuff in that country.
3672000	3675000	Not yet. Well they just overrode that.
3675000	3680000	It's coming. But regardless, even if it is out there, it's a blip in the grand scheme of things.
3681000	3684000	Let's not forget how freaking huge China is, right? It's a very large country, people.
3685000	3689000	And they're PC for sure. So if you consider all of that, it's not that surprising.
3690000	3692000	But the majority of its population not even being able to afford them anyway.
3693000	3702000	But also consider this too, it's not just PC. We're getting a lot more gaming support for Mac.
3702000	3709000	In fact, I was just browsing the App Store not too long ago and I bought Commie.
3710000	3714000	Borderlands 2 is available. Bioshock Infinite is available.
3715000	3718000	To be fair, it helped when they started making the computers out of the similar parts.
3719000	3722000	I mean, that's the whole reason why PlayStation 4 doesn't play PlayStation 3 games.
3723000	3729000	Different parts. But ever since they started making apples out of Intel, it's a little easier to do that stuff.
3729000	3737000	Well, also, there's starting to be quite a bit more support for Linux, especially since Linux handles, for the most part, it's set to...
3738000	3746000	As long as you can find the support for your card, it will handle 3D actually a lot more smoothly than a PC will.
3747000	3754000	I mean, most, you know, the majority of rendering applications will actually run better on Linux than it will on anything else.
3755000	3763000	Akuma JP says, trust me, lots of Chinese users. A lot play copies, apparently. Yeah, piracy is huge in those countries.
3764000	3768000	And Dungeon Buster says, China will allow official console sales in the Shanghai Special Trade Zone.
3769000	3774000	They just released a massive list of what the Shanghai censorship ministry expects every game to be evaluated against a week or so ago.
3775000	3778000	I actually think we have that coming up later in the show, so I'll sit on that until later in the show.
3778000	3785000	But I just, I don't hear a lot of the console chatter coming out of those other countries where there's a lot of people.
3786000	3793000	So, I mean, if it's there, a lot of it's being pirated, a lot of it's limited, you know, but I guess a lot of the PC stuff's being pirated too.
3794000	3799000	But again, I think there's just, there's a much bigger scope to consider than your house.
3800000	3805000	I don't think what Jamie's saying, though, in this story and this whole thing, I don't think this means necessarily bad news for consoles.
3805000	3810000	I don't think so. I think there'll always be a market for the dedicated game console.
3811000	3815000	But, you know, just might be, if you see a lot of big projects going to PC, it's because there's a lot of people there.
3816000	3821000	And just having dealt with, you know, trying to play multiplayer games sometimes on PC, sometimes it is better just to have a console.
3822000	3827000	It's a lot easier just to, hey, let's play multiplayer instead of, okay, I gotta open this port.
3828000	3830000	I've never had to do that on a PC. Never.
3831000	3832000	Well, lucky you, but I have.
3833000	3834000	With my firewalls intact.
3835000	3838000	I'm not playing the same games we are then, because I've had to do all that shit too.
3839000	3842000	In fact, the only times I've ever had to open ports were on my Dreamcast for playing Quake.
3845000	3847000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on with some more news. Loki.
3848000	3857000	All right, so Unreal 4 is going to be adding support for the brand new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with their update to 4.1.
3857000	3871000	And, of course, along with that, if you wish to develop games for it, remember they announced that they're going to be dropping the price to $19 a month plus 5% gross revenue for anything.
3872000	3875000	So if you want to get into developing for Unreal, you can actually do that pretty cheap.
3876000	3891000	And, of course, with that, now they support PC, Mac, SteamOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Oculus Rift, and Project Morpheus on top of the current gen consoles.
3894000	3896000	Are you excited to program for this someday?
3896000	3902000	You know, I've tried messing with Unreal Engine stuff, and I don't understand it.
3903000	3912000	They have an editor for Goat Simulator that comes with the game that you can make your own levels and stuff, and I just kind of was confused with it.
3913000	3920000	I'm sure if I sat down and messed around with it, it looks like it might be easy, but I just didn't know my way around the interfaces and stuff.
3920000	3930000	So, by here, there is something that you can use that's pretty self-explanatory as far as an editor, kind of like Unity and stuff, but I just haven't messed with it.
3932000	3937000	Well, moving on to a game that I don't believe was made in Unity, but nevertheless it is coming out soon.
3938000	3946000	Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare. Hey, guess what? There's going to be, we love this word, microtransactions within the game.
3946000	3954000	Because there is in-game currency that you can get through regular play, and you can spend it on upgrade packs, and you get the extra content for the war zones.
3955000	3961000	But, hey, you want to bypass all that? No problem. Just go into the little store and buy that in-game currency.
3962000	3969000	That is all they're saying that you're going to be able to buy right now. So, hooray, the Facebook model invading yet another franchise.
3970000	3974000	The way they describe it, does it sound like Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, how you could do that?
3974000	3980000	Ah, gotcha. I never bought Mass Effect 3. Doesn't mean it's still okay, but you know.
3981000	3989000	I did, but that was just like with leftover points after buying DLC. Like, oh, I've got 20 points, I may as well just buy.
3990000	3999000	Which is what they want you to do. Well, it's just fine, I had leftovers anyway. I wasn't really out anything. I added it all up, it still would have been the cost of a DLC.
3999000	4008000	I still never really, really like, I mean, as much as I am hardcore in the Mass Effect series and love all that stuff, that stuff always kind of rubbed me a little.
4009000	4017000	That's shaky ground. But here's the thing about the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3, and which I hope will hold true in this game as well, is you really, really, really, really didn't need to do any of that at all.
4018000	4022000	Honestly, you didn't need to unlock anything. You could do just fine in the multiplayer with the basic stuff.
4022000	4036000	I think, yeah, and if I remember correctly, I think this game, most of the stuff you would unlock weren't necessarily, maybe some of it might be just like leveling perks or something like that, so you can level twice the XP or something.
4037000	4039000	But I think that it was just costumes.
4040000	4047000	Yeah. Well, at least you'll know that once you spend your money on the game, you can still give them more money, you know, if you want.
4048000	4050000	There you go. Dark Soccer, before we get to release dates.
4050000	4054000	Oh, yeah, I do have another thing. This is actually about Hearthstone.
4055000	4065000	Well, there is the new expansion coming out, the Curse of Naxxramas, which was actually one of my favorite places to go run around in Wildville.
4066000	4076000	But basically, you get certain mechanics that when you die, you actually get certain effects that happen.
4076000	4082000	One of them is a deathrattle that activates when certain creatures are killed, like if you kill a leper gnome.
4083000	4096000	It has a deathrattle that deals two damage to the enemy hero, and basically it's more like a last strike, you know, the critter dies, it gets to do something.
4097000	4103000	So that's the Naxxramas mechanic when you're playing there.
4103000	4108000	You know, I know a lot of people are really into Hearthstone. I can't get into it.
4109000	4110000	There's a lot of people at my work that play it.
4111000	4117000	Yeah? I see a lot of people on Twitter, and obviously doing Horde House, which is rooted in a very popular Blizzard franchise.
4118000	4122000	I know a lot of people that really support the Blizzard stuff, and a lot of them are playing Hearthstone. I can't really get into it.
4123000	4127000	Maybe I'll try it again when all the Curse of Naxxramas comes out.
4128000	4130000	Especially my coworker, Intern Drew.
4131000	4132000	Yeah.
4133000	4136000	Of course, I've also got other people on my team playing Diablo.
4137000	4138000	Hey, more power to it. Yeah, I love Diablo.
4139000	4140000	I'm just thinking about getting back into Diablo.
4141000	4147000	I will cut a bitch to get a Heroes of the Storm alpha invite. Like, who do I have to, you know, convince?
4148000	4149000	I wish I could talk about my beta invite.
4150000	4151000	Yeah, right?
4152000	4155000	It was awful. For everyone who thinks this game is going to be cool, no.
4155000	4162000	Well, we can't talk about it, I guess, but I kind of think you have a built-in bias, unfortunately.
4163000	4164000	Yeah, motion sickness.
4165000	4170000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Maybe they'll be something Jamie will like this week.
4171000	4172000	I don't like anything. I'm a gamer. I hate it all.
4173000	4177000	Well, there is a few things coming out this week.
4178000	4184000	Starting off with the amazing Spider-Man 2, which is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U.
4185000	4188000	PlayStation 4, 3DS as well.
4189000	4195000	Also, 3DS getting Gardening Mama 2, Forest Friends.
4196000	4198000	Do those games still sell, really?
4199000	4200000	I guess they do.
4201000	4202000	There is a new Cookie Mama game coming out in 3DS later this year.
4203000	4204000	Alright, I guess that means yes.
4205000	4208000	Legends of Oz, Dorothy's Return, also on 3DS.
4208000	4219000	Kirby Triple Deluxe on 3DS and Mario Golf World Tour on 3DS, which is also the first game that's going to have the Season Pass DLC for Nintendo.
4220000	4221000	So, that's it.
4222000	4229000	Alright, heading on over to Japan and checking out their releases. On May 1st on the PlayStation 4, Child of Light gets released.
4230000	4235000	And there's actually a limited edition package that's coming out in Japan from Ubisoft. That is on May 1st.
4235000	4242000	Heading on over to some other consoles. How about the PlayStation 3? The PlayStation 3 gets that same Child of Light on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4243000	4254000	Otherwise, I think we're coming up on Gold Week, so I think some stuff is going to slow down there in Japan because I don't see a lot of stuff in Japan until, like, middle of May.
4254000	4262000	On the Xbox 360, Jinja Force, not Jinjer Force, but Jinja.
4263000	4264000	Is it with a J or a G?
4265000	4266000	G.
4267000	4268000	I like Jinja Force.
4269000	4270000	It is a redhead on the box art.
4271000	4275000	If it's a J, it's a G. It's a G.
4276000	4277000	Fine. Why am I the one that reads Japanese?
4278000	4279000	Why don't you let me do it then?
4280000	4281000	Because you wanted to do the Europe ones way back when.
4282000	4283000	Fine. Whatevs.
4284000	4292000	Nothing on the Vita this week. On the Wii U this week, nothing. Well, I mean, that's a given, right?
4293000	4294000	And on the 3-
4295000	4296000	What? What are you laughing at?
4297000	4298000	I love you, actdeft.
4299000	4300000	What did actdeft say in chat?
4301000	4302000	Actdeft kicks Raginator in the Yaris.
4302000	4313000	Also, on the Nintendo 3DS, we do have a few releases there on the 3DS this week. Mario Golf World Tour and Osawari Tantei Ozawa Arena Rising 3 comes out from success.
4314000	4319000	So, hopefully it will be a success. I'm trying to see what kind of game this is. It's a 3DS game where it looks like you have little pets.
4320000	4321000	Oh, it's cute.
4322000	4326000	It looks like a 90s PC game interface where you have the items and you talk to people.
4327000	4328000	It's totes adorbs.
4329000	4330000	Looks like a little detective game or something.
4330000	4331000	Oh, it's adorbs.
4332000	4333000	Excuse me.
4334000	4335000	No, I don't know what that is.
4336000	4340000	Well, there you go. That is it for Japanese releases. Loki? Or, sorry, Dark Sakura.
4341000	4344000	Jeez, Rob. I'm trying to take advantage of my broken ass internet.
4345000	4346000	Piss me off. Watch what happens.
4347000	4350000	Bitch, please, I will cut. No. You gave me coffee, so I can't kill you yet.
4351000	4359000	On the 29th of April, we have Daylight on PS4 and PC. On the 30th, a shitload of stuff, mostly Child of Light.
4360000	4370000	And, yeah. On May 1st, we have Botanicula on iPad, which I just keep thinking of Bonicula. You know, the Vampire Bunny books? Those are fun.
4371000	4378000	And then Stick It to the Man for Wii U, which is the best name ever, because fucking hell. That's it.
4378000	4382000	Alright. Just a few more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week. Loki?
4383000	4395000	Well, you know, some people are wondering, are there going to be some NES remix-style games for other virtual console systems, including Super Nintendo, Game Boy, or Game Boy Advance?
4396000	4406000	And, apparently, the answer to that is, well, if there is a big enough outpouring for support of those titles, it's something that they would consider to take a look at.
4406000	4411000	So, shocking! People will build something for demand.
4412000	4415000	Yes. If you're willing to give them money, they might make it.
4416000	4419000	I would love to see a Super Nintendo remix game.
4420000	4425000	I think a Super Nintendo one would be awesome, but they really have to figure out a way to bring in third parties to make that work. You know what I mean?
4426000	4427000	Yeah.
4428000	4441000	You know what would really surprise people? If they teamed up with Sega. Because you know Sega loves to milk the shit out of their classic games. Wouldn't it be awesome if they teamed up with Sega to do a Genesis remix? I bet that comes first.
4442000	4454000	It's possible. Come on, people. Sega and Nintendo totally in bed together these days. Which, I know, it's weird. The 80s child in us, or if you were alive then, doesn't really get that, but it could happen.
4455000	4462000	I would see that. But I would love a Super Nintendo one if they could get third parties involved. Game Boy one, not so much. I don't think the Game Boy games hold up very well.
4463000	4478000	I laughed at, I think there was an article I saw that someone was asking why is an NES remix on the 3DS and they're just like, well, not comfortable with programming on 3DS and I want a more powerful system for that.
4479000	4484000	I'm like, you're emulating NES games. You don't need that very powerful system for that.
4485000	4487000	They do some other little things to them.
4488000	4490000	But come on, it's not much.
4491000	4495000	I kind of thought the answer was a bit of a cop out too. Because we need to sell Wii U's. That's the answer.
4496000	4500000	Yeah, exactly. That's it right there. Well, you have enough reasons to buy a 3DS.
4501000	4509000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says they did mention wanting to do a third party remix with Mega Man, Castlevania and so on. Well, make it so.
4510000	4513000	Get in bed with Capcom, Konami, whoever you have to to make that happen.
4513000	4517000	You could just start redoing why Konami World or Super Konami World or whatever it was.
4518000	4519000	Why not? It was awesome.
4520000	4523000	Can you imagine one of the stages being play Contra without 30 lives?
4524000	4532000	Oh shit. Remember that fighting game, the world fighting game or something like that where it was all the Hasbro and Konami and all those weird characters in there?
4532000	4543000	So you had Optimus Prime versus Bomberman versus Simon Belmont and I think Solid Snake or something in there. It was really weird.
4544000	4546000	I played that at an anime convention once. I was like, what the fuck is this?
4547000	4548000	Awesome.
4549000	4554000	Alright, one more story I've got for you guys and that has to do with a new Dragon Quest game. That's right.
4554000	4562000	Go figure. A new Dragon Quest game is in the works. Well, that's good because I guess we're never going to get Dragon Quest X. You just have to let that go.
4563000	4568000	Well, Toriyama still needs stuff to draw other than doing a Dragon Ball chibi or whatever it's called now.
4569000	4582000	Well, apparently some information just slipped out from series creator Yuji Horii at the event that was going on in Chiba, Japan this week because I know Square was doing a bunch of stuff there because there was some Final Fantasy XIV info that came out of that as well.
4582000	4595000	And apparently what happened is that the producer and the chief planner behind Dragon Quest expressed surprise at the accidental disclosure about the fact that Square Enix was developing the next Dragon Quest game. But that's all they said.
4596000	4598000	He was quoted as going, what?
4599000	4604000	And to me that's not really a big shot. They're going to make another Dragon Quest game? Get out.
4605000	4607000	Sequel the popular franchise? What?
4608000	4611000	What I'd really like to hear about is, are we ever going to get X? I guess not.
4612000	4616000	Final Fantasy XI will go free-to-play before we ever get X.
4617000	4625000	It would be nice if we get the Wii. It would be something on the Wii U. Because they did have a Wii U version in Japan. They just skipped the Wii version. Just give us the Wii U one.
4626000	4627000	Seriously, XI needs to go free-to-play.
4628000	4630000	I know. You're so desperate for that. You are so, so desperate for a free-to-play.
4631000	4634000	They don't want it. They'll just bury it in the ground before they...
4635000	4641000	They're still working on updates and stuff to it to try to get people to keep playing it. It has this loyal fanbase that doesn't want to change to XIV.
4642000	4649000	Alright. Let us get into the Classic Game of the Week.
4650000	4662000	You know, every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you ought to be playing this game.
4663000	4664000	Yeah, really.
4665000	4666000	Get off my lawn until you check out this game.
4667000	4668000	I'm going to shake my cane at you kids.
4668000	4671000	That's right. DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
4672000	4675000	Before I announce the name, I think that we should let the game speak for itself.
4677000	4679000	If it's audible enough.
4680000	4681000	It's very quiet, but it's there.
4682000	4686000	Alright. The game is...
4687000	4691000	Metal Slug. Which I'm surprised I haven't done Metal Slug yet.
4694000	4695000	Metal Slug.
4695000	4696000	Metal Slug.
4697000	4702000	Dan was going around going, Metal Slug X all afternoon. I was like, okay Dan, rock on.
4703000	4710000	So yeah, I know that we talk about Metal Slug a lot, but I can't believe I've never done it. I thought I'd done Metal Slug.
4711000	4714000	It's just another one of those games that's like, really? I haven't?
4715000	4721000	Anyway, Metal Slug is a run and gun game. It was done by Nazca and published by SNK.
4721000	4727000	Nazca also did games for Irem as well, and quite a few other release games.
4728000	4736000	It came out for the Neo Geo MVS Arcade, and it was very, very well animated for its time.
4737000	4747000	I mean, all the games are still very fluid, but it's all hand drawn animation, two player, and it's been ported to the Neo Geo CD, of which I have that copy.
4747000	4756000	Sega Saturn, of which I have that copy. PlayStation, yeah. Virtual Console, PSN, iOS, Android, Neo Geo X.
4757000	4764000	There's Wii, PlayStation, I'm sorry, PSP, and PlayStation 2 that was part of Metal Slug Anthology.
4764000	4777000	So basically, you're running around. You can get heavy machine gun or rocket launcher by rescuing POWs, and you have a boss at each end of the level.
4778000	4786000	Different, larger, different, tougher enemies, and then you can get little Metal Slug tanks, where the tank is actually called the SV-001.
4787000	4791000	The SV stands for Super Vehicle because it makes you more offensive, and a little more defensive.
4791000	4796000	So you can go around, you also get melee attacks with a knife as well as using the guns.
4797000	4801000	Like I said, you rescue POWs as you're going through the jungle or wherever you are.
4802000	4814000	Different enemies, you have tanks, mobile artillery, aircraft, armored personnel carriers, tacticals, the random soldiers, you have people in helicopters, all kinds of stuff.
4814000	4820000	But basically, it's just like a kind of a jungle warfare game, you know.
4821000	4828000	Although, later Metal Slug games did get, you know, a little bit more and more ridiculous, you know.
4829000	4834000	I love how people in chat are going rocket launcher, because that's always what I thought I said at first.
4835000	4843000	But as far as the different ports, yeah, we had MVS and AES versions, which I would still love to get my hands on an AES one. I haven't found one yet.
4844000	4851000	There's the Neo Geo CD version that had combat school that lets you revisit different levels, but with different mission objectives.
4852000	4858000	Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions came out in Japan. The Saturn version had two versions of it.
4859000	4869000	Sega Saturn had the 1.002 and 1.005 that had bug fixes. And PlayStation was distributed by SNK Playmore as a re-release version.
4869000	4879000	They both had the combat school, and PlayStation had one called Another Story that had different little mini games in it that had to go with the plot.
4880000	4886000	Metal Slug Anthology came out in 2006, which in Japan was called Metal Slug Complete for Wii, PS2, and PSP.
4887000	4893000	That included Metal Slug, and then Metal Slug 2 and Metal Slug X, and Metal Slug, all the way up to Metal Slug 6.
4894000	4897000	They were all emulated versions of the originals, had nothing else added to it.
4897000	4906000	Metal Slug was also on GameTap, released on the Virtual Console, and part of the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 for Wii, PS2, and PSP.
4907000	4913000	There is an emulated version for PSP and PS3, and a wireless version for iOS and Android.
4914000	4918000	If you ever got one of those Neo Geo X's, it was one of the pre-loaded games.
4918000	4923000	So Metal Slug is really just like one of those super fun games, you know?
4924000	4930000	You can either be super amazing at it, or you can be super crappy at it, and it doesn't matter, because it's fucking fun.
4931000	4936000	I love how fluid the animations are in this game, too, for a sprite game, you know, of this age.
4937000	4939000	Like, this was really a step up for side-scrollers, you know?
4940000	4946000	Well, and when this came out, actually, it wasn't just, you know, the standard, uh, they were all hand-drawn pixels.
4946000	4954000	I mean, they were all hand-drawn, um, frames converted to pixel, if I do recall, uh, my history on this game properly.
4955000	4960000	But, I mean, I'd have to say, as much as I love the later ones, I really love the first one.
4961000	4971000	I mean, the first one was just, you know, and I was actually watching today, um, and just, you know, freeze frame sometimes if you guys are watching it on YouTube or something.
4971000	4977000	And look at the backgrounds, especially when you're going through the places that, um, have the huts on them.
4978000	4983000	You know, all those, all those backgrounds were completely hand-drawn. They're so detailed.
4984000	4994000	And on top of that, it's just the level of depth that you're getting with straight 2D, you know, just using different layers and everything.
4995000	5000000	It really is very well done. I mean, the game has definite artistic merit to it, I think.
5001000	5015000	And, I mean, the later games gave us different characters. Like, we had, um, uh, what was it, uh, the other two, the female characters in, I think, Metal Slug 4 and up.
5016000	5020000	And then, um, like, Theo and, um, the other person I can't remember right now.
5020000	5036000	And then, um, you had, uh, the zombie mode. You remember the zombie mode in 3? Where if you fought the zombies and you got, like, what was it, if you got, like, uh, breathed on or something, you would start throwing up on people for your weapon.
5037000	5048000	But moving really slowly, you had, like, mommy mode. And then there were the different versions of, uh, of the, uh, the tanks. Like, you got the camel slug that you rode on a camel with armor on it.
5048000	5057000	And, you know, they just got better and better. But the first one still, if, you know, if people haven't played the first Metal Slug, they need to really go back and do that.
5058000	5065000	And all of the games have just stayed. This is one of those, um, series where all of the games have been top quality and super fun.
5066000	5068000	So, that's why I pick, um, Metal Slug.
5069000	5076000	Alright. There it is. Your classic game of the week. The start of a very long series. Metal Slug.
5077000	5080000	And if you make fun of Metal Slug, I will cut a bitch.
5081000	5088000	Lots of, lots of great stuff, uh, about Metal Slug in our chat room. Um, nemesis47 says, Metal Slug for the win. Actf says, it's on Android 2.
5089000	5094000	Dungeonbuster says, the expressions on all the characters were fantastic. Even the Metal Slug tank looked like it was having fun.
5095000	5103000	Um, let's see. Uh, Burr says, Mercenary Kings almost hits the right notes, but not quite, which is a newer game that is very inspired by this.
5104000	5109000	That's just because, uh, you know, the pixel artists that did that game, it's fucking awesome.
5110000	5115000	Uh, and then nemesis47 says, the Metal Slug guy is on the Neo Geo Battle Colosseum on the Playstation 2 as well.
5116000	5119000	And SHO and Hunter Matt says, the game had a lot of vehicles you wish you had in real life.
5120000	5121000	I want a camel slug.
5121000	5124000	I was thinking about armoring Midna, and then I could have cat slug.
5125000	5130000	I've seen someone recreate that, um, the, uh, the vehicle in Lego, and that was awesome.
5131000	5132000	Oh, that sounds awesome.
5133000	5137000	That would be one of those kits I'd want to buy, those Cusseaux, uh, kits, yeah.
5138000	5139000	Awesome. Alright guys, we are gonna take-
5140000	5144000	I love that it's called Cusseaux, cause you know what that means? Shit.
5145000	5149000	We are gonna take a break, and when we come back there is more Orange Lawns ready to come.
5149000	5156000	We're gonna touch on Urban Legends again, but not just landfills, we're gonna talk about your Urban Legends, uh, in the Fugu Question of the Week tonight.
5157000	5160000	And we do have some more news coming up as well, a lot of Minecraft news tonight, kind of randomly.
5161000	5166000	And, uh, a new Theatrhythm game announced this week for the US, uh, it's coming over here as well.
5167000	5171000	Very exciting, we'll talk about all of that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lawns Radio, right after this.
5171000	5185000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this April the 27th of 2014 with episode number 550 of our show.
5186000	5196000	I guess we should be celebrating of sorts tonight because, you know, multiples of 50 are usually kind of a landmark in the podcast world, and here we are on a multiple of 50, it's 550.
5196000	5203000	In five more weeks, we'll have three in a row, 555. And then, you know, that brings us one step closer to 666.
5204000	5205000	Oh Rob.
5206000	5209000	Which I know is the landmark Dark Soccer really wants to get to for the show.
5210000	5211000	Not really, I don't care.
5212000	5225000	But also, uh, for, for, for, for the few of our listeners that were here in the very beginning that are, that are still, you know, here with us and, you know, we appreciate your support, um, you will be handsomely rewarded hopefully come this October with episode 573.
5226000	5234000	Not everybody's going to get that joke, but some of you will and, and I definitely want to do something special. I already have some ideas in mind for how, how we can celebrate episode 573.
5235000	5240000	So, uh, we'll be looking at that in October. So some things to look forward to, but happy 550.
5241000	5248000	And, uh, you know, even though I kind of sit back here and I go, oh my God, 550 weeks.
5249000	5250000	That's a very long time.
5251000	5252000	Times like three hours.
5252000	5261000	Well, I mean, technically the first 20 weeks, it was a two hour show and we used to have a lot of music breaks, but still, but still, I mean, but you make up for that with, with a year, we were double dipping.
5262000	5264000	We did a three hour show and we did a 40 minute podcast.
5265000	5269000	So, you know, it kind of balances itself out, but yeah, it's, Oh my God, it's so crazy.
5270000	5277000	But, uh, you know, I say, you know, cause, uh, I posted something about that on Twitter and I got some responses that were like, you know, well, we're just hitting episode 50.
5277000	5285000	Congrats to you. And I'm always like, don't, don't shortchange yourself. Like so many shows don't even get to 10. There's so many podcasts that don't even get to 10.
5286000	5291000	So to get to 50 with that, that means you did it for at least a year, maybe longer if you're only twice a month or whatever.
5292000	5297000	So, uh, the fact that you get to episode 50 is a heck of an accomplishment. So yeah, you know, very few shows get to 50.
5298000	5303000	Um, I know, uh, I think still from girls gone. Wow. Which is another show here at the voice geeks network.
5303000	5309000	They were just talking about that. They hit four years. I didn't realize that they were hitting their four year mark, but they did. So congrats to them. That's, that's great.
5310000	5316000	And, uh, I, I caught still saying something about, can you imagine if we were doing this as long as OLR? Like, you never know.
5317000	5318000	That's what I said to her too.
5319000	5330000	You never know. All right. Um, let's see, go into the chat room. SSJ 100. Matt says, wasn't there technically an OLR 666 with Travis, John and Ronma?
5330000	5337000	I think there was, it was like a week. We weren't here where understation live was on orange on radio when it was a network on life.
5338000	5348000	There's five. And I think they did an OLR 666. Unfortunately, that episode will have to be retconned with a different number. If we actually do make it to six, we'll have to retcon that was six, six, six, six or something.
5349000	5357000	Because, uh, I don't know. If we make it to 2017, we might actually have that.
5357000	5367000	Oh my gosh. We'll be the show for, we'll be the show by 40 year old gamers. We were 20 year old gamers, now we're 30 year old gamers and we'll be 40 year old gamers.
5368000	5373000	Hey, there's some great 40 year old gamers out there that do shows right now. So we'll just follow in their footsteps.
5374000	5384000	All right. Anyhow, uh, of course, thanks to everybody, uh, in the chat and out there in the podcast world and everybody who supports us, you know, any, any landmark episode we have.
5384000	5390000	And you know, there, there's some great podcasts out there by, uh, 29 year olds like Bobby Black Wolf.
5393000	5395000	Why am I not a grammar teacher, Rob?
5396000	5400000	I don't know why. Uh, I'm looking, uh, dark to see it says Travis is going to be pissed.
5401000	5402000	So?
5402000	5405000	Ah, let him, let him come at me bro. And I'm kidding. He'll, he'll just,
5406000	5407000	What is Travis not pissed off about?
5408000	5412000	He'll, he'll just, he'll say something sassy at dragon con. Oh Rob.
5412000	5416000	You know what? Damn it, Rob. That was my gimmick voice. I guess gamut and Travis sound the same to me.
5417000	5420000	I, I adore Travis, but he does get angry about a lot of things.
5421000	5429000	Love you, Travis. Kiss, kiss. Um, anyway, where was I? Oh yes. I was thanking the listeners before you guys got me, uh, poking fun at Travis.
5430000	5439000	You guys, um, uh, any landmark we have, we made it because you guys support us. I mean, plain and simple, you know, you're our motivation to do this every week.
5439000	5441000	So just thank you.
5442000	5449000	They want me to keep doing this by me tacos. Thank you. How can they buy you tacos? I've had somebody asked, how do I buy Jamie a taco?
5450000	5451000	Just give me money. I'll buy my own taco.
5452000	5459000	What if they want to send you like a card, a gift card, semi gift cards, Taco bell gift cards, or pinkberry or Starbucks.
5460000	5461000	You don't have tacos at pinkberry.
5462000	5466000	But I can eat chocolate hazelnut and imagine tacos.
5466000	5478000	If you, we actually have, since VOG is a business now, we have a PO, it's in Georgia, but somehow like at Dragon Con, Bobby can just bring a sack full of gift cards and be like, this is for dark Sakura.
5479000	5485000	So if you really are interested, if you really are interested, I can give you the public VOG post office box. Just let me know.
5486000	5491000	Or right now you can put money into my con fund so that I can be even more fabulous with my cosplay.
5491000	5497000	No, if you really want to make us happy, you will help a kitten. That's, that's what we talked about.
5498000	5499000	Adopt a cat.
5500000	5505000	Either adopt or if you're alert, send food or help somebody else's cat, you know, donate to a shelter, help a cat.
5506000	5511000	And I want to see pictures of the cat food that you buy and delivery to the happy, hungry kitties.
5512000	5518000	You know, I, I, I hear you saying help a kitten, but I can't help but think buy skywriting is a little bit better.
5518000	5527000	You can also help a puppy. That would be fine. Um, but we guess dark soccer prefers kittens, but you can help a puppy.
5528000	5533000	You bring me a ferret. You can buy one of those expensive, you know, dogs and then shave our URL into them.
5534000	5540000	Yeah. That's animal abuse. Loki. That's not abuse. They don't care. They're animals. They're like, ah, I'm cooler in one spot.
5540000	5543000	Can I still reach my butt? Lick, lick. Yes.
5544000	5554000	That's where the.com is. All right. Anyway, uh, in all seriousness, thank you all the listeners who, um, helped us hit another landmark and, um, years to the future of OLR.
5555000	5559000	Let's talk about the present of OLR and what's going on in rapid fire news.
5560000	5561000	You like presents?
5562000	5569000	Well, I don't have any for you this week. You got a present last week. All right, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.
5570000	5582000	Microsoft has trademarked a title for scream ride and that just screams to me that it's a connect title because I don't know.
5583000	5589000	It just sounds connecty and it also sounds like it might be on rails. So, you know, new fable game.
5590000	5597000	Um, of course, you know, they have no comment to make on that, but it is being trademarked for an online computer game.
5597000	5604000	So, uh, I'd imagine that we will hear about this pretty soon, probably at E3.
5605000	5608000	Screaming at the connect, trying to get it to understand you.
5609000	5611000	I remember brain training.
5612000	5615000	Blue, blue, blue.
5616000	5617000	Okay.
5618000	5628000	Um, but there is, uh, some people are thinking that, Oh, it's their 3d thing, whatever they're like Oculus rift project Morpheus thing is, this is going to go along with that.
5629000	5630000	Cause you know, those tech demos and stuff.
5631000	5634000	Because scream ride is what I want to name a contraption that goes over my head.
5635000	5639000	No, no, no, not for the actual contraction, but for a title for said contraption.
5640000	5641000	You know, like, you know, a roller coaster.
5641000	5647000	Cool. Maybe it's like roller coaster, but like with guns. So it's like, now it's on rails, Peter Molyneux.
5648000	5663000	Um, well, we don't know what it is and I'm sure it'll be underwhelming, whatever it is. Cause you know, I just like was it when Sony announced that and yes, that horror game that was going to be kind of like the teen horror genre type thing.
5664000	5666000	I was like, no, we'll see.
5666000	5671000	Maybe scream ride means that, you know, there'll be.
5672000	5674000	If it's for connect, I'll probably have zero interest in it.
5675000	5677000	A theme park, a Microsoft theme park.
5678000	5682000	That's a PC title. That's what it's being used for or PC or some sort of digital title.
5683000	5690000	Okay. So there's another Skylanders game this year. Yeah. I'm not surprised, but here's, here's the funny part.
5691000	5693000	So the brand new games called Skylanders trap team.
5694000	5703000	And the gimmick this year is that you get these little crystals that you can trap enemies in the game and then kind of turn them to the light side and be able to do that.
5704000	5711000	And I guess there's 40 trappable villains in the game, 60 characters you can buy, um, including the trap masters, which is a new class.
5712000	5716000	And no, it's even better because last year they made you buy a brand new portal.
5717000	5721000	That portal won't work with shit. So you got to buy yet another brand new portal for this game.
5722000	5728000	That's why I love this series so much. Um, so that'll be probably coming out around October cause that's when those all come out.
5728000	5735000	So yeah. And, uh, let's see, last but not least, uh, Mario Kart eight is getting a pretty awesome.
5736000	5743000	We bundle in Europe. This would make Ron my happy. It's all Luigi themed. So they've got a Luigi year of Luigi continues.
5744000	5755000	Yes. You've got a Luigi steering wheel, a Luigi skin, Mario Kart eight, um, game pad, a Luigi, uh, we remote plus and even a Luigi hat.
5756000	5765000	And of course, you know, the, uh, strategy guide and the game. So that's not bad. And, uh, it's going to go for, I guess, uh, 250 euros.
5766000	5777000	So, um, pretty cool. And then, um, let's see, or maybe that's 250 pounds. I don't know. I don't know my, my, uh, you guys, I think maybe it's zero anyways.
5777000	5784000	Anyways, and last but not least, uh, some more, uh, we wrote plus they're themed after, uh, different characters.
5785000	5801000	They've got, I guess the princess peach, we remote plus that's I'm coming out. Um, and then also the, uh, Yoshi themed, we remote plus, and these are coming out in Europe at the same time as, um, the, uh, Mario Kart eight game.
5801000	5811000	So I don't know if that's coming out over here yet. I haven't heard of when that's scheduled to be out here, but I, well, it's kind of neat, I guess that they're going to have all these same things.
5812000	5820000	I kind of like that bundle though. Although the Luigi thing now Mario Kart themed. Okay. But Luigi had, it does make any sense.
5821000	5831000	All right. I got some news for you guys as well. Uh, starting off with PlayStation plus the updates on what will be happening on PlayStation plus in may, because you know, they're going to give away games every month.
5832000	5846000	And this month they will be offering on PlayStation four, uh, stick it to the man is going to be the game on the PlayStation four and on PlayStation three, you can get puppeteer pro Evo soccer, 2014 and skull girls encore.
5846000	5855000	How do you like that? I know you like skull girls so you can get it for free on the Vita surge deluxe and limbo. So check out all of that.
5856000	5864000	That's a, that's going to be a lot so I can play stick it to the man on PlayStation four and I will, uh, also we have, uh, some sales figures out of Microsoft.
5865000	5870000	I want to say, I thought we reported on something similar to this last week, but there's, there's a news report from a couple of days ago.
5870000	5881000	So, all right. Uh, Microsoft quarterly reports show that 1.2 million Xbox one systems were shipped in quarter three, uh, meaning they've shipped 5 million since launch.
5882000	5896000	They're up to 20.4 billion in revenue and 5.6, 6 billion in net income. Now, of course, Sony says that they have sold 7 million. Um, so, you know, Sony's a little bit ahead of the game, but Microsoft isn't exactly in, you know, Wii U territory right now.
5896000	5919000	The Xbox one is doing okay. I read, and I'm not sure how accurate it is cause it's, you know, secondhand, secondhand guy said something, you know, I heard that they were saying that they were going to slow down or stop production of the Xbox one because they have such a surplus of supply right now on that console that they just don't need to produce them as fast.
5920000	5928000	I don't know. And speaking of Xbox killer instinct, season two is on the horizon. Uh, keep in mind, it's got a new developer now cause the previous one was bought.
5928000	5945000	Uh, but iron galaxy studios will be adding eight characters to the game with the season two content. This is all revealed during a play Xbox live arcade live stream. So yep, eight more characters, no hints on what those characters are, but there may also be what's called a no mercy finisher.
5945000	5957000	Think of it as a fatality and mortal combat. Although since there's not really fatalities and kill it, why I guess they did throw characters off a roof and the original one. So they had the, they had the combo finishers.
5957000	5966000	It'll probably be a little more like that or a brutality or something, but they're calling it no mercy is what they've got. You know, the boobs of death in killer instinct for orchid.
5966000	5976000	Now before we get to Jamie's rapid fire news stories, I have some breaking news and this is breaking news of the utmost importance. Listen up.
5976000	6001000	This is like, this is like code red breaking news. This is, this is huge. Um, I just saw this on Twitter. Dark soccer. Listen up. I just thought this is, this is, this is at you girl. Okay. I just saw this on Twitter. I didn't do it. This is from my pal Godfrey who runs a long running podcast.
6002000	6019000	I just want to give a quick shout out to gamer tag radio shadow runs a very long running podcast over there. Just tweeted this news report from computer and video games.com what a mass effect trilogy for PlayStation four and Xbox one spotted on a Chilean retail site.
6019000	6038000	What now granted it's, it's just a retail site in Chile, but apparently a retail listing with box art even for the mass effect trilogy for PlayStation four and Xbox one has been spotted. Is it going to still have the same low res textures from the year?
6039000	6057000	Go ask Chile, but I don't speak Chilean. There does appear to be indication that this, I mean, again, you know, the retail site could just be trying to get pre-order money or whatever, which, you know, could be a thing, but, uh, it's looking at, this would be very interesting for the next game.
6058000	6067000	Maybe this is going to be now how you can have a save file that possibly goes into the next game. I doubt that's going to be the only way, especially since they're going to do a PC version.
6068000	6079000	So, uh, yeah. Uh, which also means this is also a important, this would be the fourth time that I will buy the mass effect trilogy. If this news is true, I own it on PlayStation three.
6080000	6088000	I own the three games separately on Xbox three 60 and I own all three games separately on PC because I am a whore and how I should go.
6089000	6103000	You should know, but here's the, here's the whole, the whole thing about it though, is that unless you're going to add something to make it special, there's really no point. I don't have, I mean, we were talking about getting a PS4, but I don't have one yet.
6104000	6108000	The point is mass effect on another console. That's the point.
6109000	6115000	And you know what, Rob, I have just the PC versions cause you know what? I have modded mine to shit and back and make them look pretty.
6115000	6117000	Garris in ultra HD.
6118000	6122000	My Garris is already in ultra HD. I have high res mods. Thank you.
6123000	6132000	Uh, Bobby black Wolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, yay, two more platform. Yay. Two more platforms. I can not play mass effect on Bobby.
6133000	6135000	You're going to reprogram the whole thing for frostbite.
6135000	6145000	Bobby, you go to hell, you go to hell and you die. Just kidding hearts. Anyhow, that was our very important, mega important super.
6146000	6153000	I had actually saw that earlier, but since this is a retailer listing that, and personally I haven't heard anything, I didn't think it was worth mentioning.
6154000	6155000	Yeah, see, Loki hasn't heard anything.
6156000	6161000	In the spirit of, of what we were talking about with Roswell, New Mexico earlier tonight, I want to believe.
6162000	6163000	Good Lord, Rob.
6163000	6165000	I want to believe.
6168000	6169000	You know what?
6170000	6171000	What?
6172000	6177000	I will just keep modding my game with pretty hair and buff arms.
6178000	6180000	Why don't you mod this show with some rapid fire news?
6181000	6186000	How about I mod you? How about I just take, I'm keeping your iPad now. Thank you. It's prettier than mine anyway.
6187000	6192000	Hey, that, that is the super special new iPad. It was so new. It was only on the market for like six months before they replaced it.
6193000	6200000	Yeah. Anyway, um, there is a full length documentary that's available online for download called Gaming in Color.
6201000	6209000	That is, you know, instead of mentioning all of the, the standard, what's the, the LGBTQA?
6210000	6212000	Quilt bag encompasses everything. Quilt bag.
6213000	6218000	Well, I am going to say non-cishet. How's that? It's a little faster.
6219000	6220000	Okay. I like quilt bag.
6221000	6222000	Okay. Quilt bag.
6223000	6231000	At any rate, um, it's available for a pay what you want. The Kickstarter is already finished and it is available for download.
6232000	6239000	And let me get the link, um, at gamingincolor.v, like VictorHHotelXXray.tv.
6240000	6241000	Or just Google it. You'll find it.
6242000	6246000	Or Google it. Thanks, Rob. I was trying to make use of my NATO alphabet. Thank you.
6247000	6249000	I have not seen the documentary yet, but I definitely want to check it out.
6249000	6257000	I love that they're doing a pay whatever you want type of things for people that, you know, can afford to drop a little more than, than others.
6258000	6260000	I think that's, that's really cool. That shows that they just want to get the message out.
6261000	6263000	I would say pay like, pay what you can. Don't pay what you want. Pay what you can.
6264000	6265000	Yeah.
6266000	6267000	If that makes sense.
6268000	6272000	That's a really good distinction. That is a really good distinction. Pay what you want versus pay what you can. I like that.
6272000	6279000	Because I want to pay 500 bucks, but I can't. So I would pay 10 because that's what I have.
6280000	6281000	There you go.
6282000	6291000	But anyway, the message is aimed at people who don't understand the need for having characters that fight bigotry that are against the cishet norm, you know.
6292000	6299000	And so it's meant to just really open people's minds and give a different perspective. And I'm looking forward to watching it.
6299000	6303000	The only, hmm, I better keep my mouth shut because I'm going to get myself in trouble.
6304000	6305000	Just say it. Say it.
6306000	6309000	The only thing I don't like about the cishet term, like I get it. I understand why it's there.
6310000	6315000	But 90% of the time I see it used is by a social justice warrior who doesn't have a goddamn clue what they're talking about.
6316000	6317000	I know.
6318000	6319000	That's the only thing that bugs me about that word that makes it kind of nails on a chalkboard.
6319000	6330000	I'm not saying I hate the word or I just, I get why it's there and everything, but it's just like, so, it's like rating a movie NC-17.
6331000	6337000	They've used that rating with so many terrible movies that you can't take a movie seriously anymore that has that rating.
6338000	6339000	I don't know what else to compare it to.
6340000	6342000	By the way, Rob, by the way, Queen Simia asks what the U stands for.
6343000	6352000	Unsure. I think it is. Quilt bag. Questioning. No, no. I'll look it up. I'll look it up.
6353000	6354000	Okay.
6355000	6356000	Anyhow.
6357000	6361000	I just like to say extra sexy. How's that? Or in case you're me, then it's non-sexy.
6362000	6365000	Okay. So, in other news.
6365000	6366000	In other news.
6367000	6374000	Questioning undecided. It's questioning undecided, intersex, lesbian, transsexual, bisexual, asexual, gay.
6375000	6377000	Quilt bag. Pretty cool, huh?
6378000	6379000	Okay.
6380000	6381000	Okay.
6382000	6383000	The more you know.
6384000	6391000	And, and to kind of further go into what we were talking about, about Mass Effect trilogy, I did some extra checking.
6392000	6396000	And yes, I can say that I don't think that that's legit.
6397000	6401000	Yet. I mean, I can see him doing something like that, but no.
6402000	6406000	Why don't you just come over here and take a shit on my desk? Because that's pretty much what you're doing right now, Loki.
6407000	6411000	You know what? I'm pretty much, um, I kind of don't care, you know?
6411000	6418000	It's fine. In all seriousness, as much as I would buy the, I would do it again.
6419000	6422000	But I really want to hear about what's next for Mass Effect.
6423000	6426000	Mass Effect 4, quote, Rob would do it again. End quote.
6427000	6430000	Well, what engine did they use to make that? Was that the same engine that they did Dragon Age out of?
6431000	6437000	I mean, maybe they're, I know Inquisition's coming out later on this year, but I don't think it's the same engine as the last Dragon Age game.
6438000	6439000	Are they doing Inquisition on Frostbite?
6439000	6441000	Yeah, I think it's all Frostbite now, so.
6442000	6444000	Inquisition's the first game on the new engine, I think, so. Anyhow.
6445000	6459000	Anyway, how about Taito? I love Taito. Taito is doing a game called Rhythm Vaders that is a kind of a groove, it's called a groove coaster game, I guess? Or is it in the name?
6460000	6465000	But anyway, it is going to be possibly getting an international release.
6465000	6477000	It is, it might be using a different name over here than versus what it is in Japan, but it looks kind of neat. Rhythm Vaders? That's a fun name.
6478000	6480000	Although now I'm thinking of Darth Vader with a boombox.
6481000	6484000	Groove Coaster's a fun little iOS game. It really is. It's worth your time.
6484000	6492000	Okay. And then Capcom is, they actually are possibly going to be revealing Resident Evil 7 at E3.
6493000	6501000	It comes out from the Sankei financial newspaper that they're looking to make that release, so take it for what you will.
6502000	6510000	But more Resident Evil, which just got super convoluted. I haven't played one since Code Veronica.
6511000	6513000	Can they just, can it just be Resident Evil 5?
6514000	6518000	Like, you know, Resident Evil 4, great Resident Evil game, and then can they just make this new one?
6519000	6522000	Can they just go back and say, you know what, we're just going to do Resident Evil 5 again.
6523000	6526000	Like, not a remake, just the real Resident Evil 5. Like, the other two would, haha, just kidding.
6527000	6528000	It was all a dream.
6529000	6532000	Yeah, exactly, exactly. Like, the whole Dallas thing. Like, it was all a dream.
6533000	6534000	It was just in the shower.
6535000	6537000	I actually, I like what Queen Sami said. ME4, it's not Shepard.
6538000	6539000	Alright.
6540000	6542000	It's basically, it's the story of Garrus being a badass. I play it.
6542000	6546000	You never know who the next character might be, you never know. Let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
6547000	6548000	Do it.
6554000	6559000	Every week we ask our Facebook and Google Plus communities a question. You throw it together, you get FUGL.
6560000	6565000	Obviously, the whole damn world's talking about the ET cartridges that were found in the landfill over the weekend,
6566000	6568000	bringing conclusive proof to an urban legend from many of our childhoods.
6569000	6571000	Although, I would argue if it was really an urban legend, but I digress.
6572000	6576000	Everyone's talking about it. It's in the mainstream press, and I linked to an article from USA Today.
6577000	6580000	That's how big this news is, okay? It goes beyond just gamer news.
6581000	6587000	Now, with that out of the way, what's your favorite gaming urban legend, and bonus points if you think it's true, okay?
6588000	6591000	So, let's go to your favorite gaming urban legend.
6593000	6595000	We're gonna start with Gaming Nerd over on Facebook, who says,
6595000	6602000	The Haunting Story of Polybus, the arcade machine that causes various degrees of stress, nightmares, insanity, and even suicide.
6603000	6605000	Bobby was talking about this on his show tonight a little bit.
6606000	6607000	I mentioned it.
6608000	6609000	Yeah, you mentioned it as well. Do you want to quickly summarize the Polybus thing?
6610000	6614000	It's a game that was supposedly created by the government to test reflexes.
6615000	6620000	It used really like a crazy flashing light show. Some people said that they saw the game,
6620000	6624000	and there are recreations made based off of descriptions.
6625000	6630000	But there is one supposedly black and white picture of the game with the logo,
6631000	6634000	and then it's otherwise just been thrown in the background as sort of an urban legend sort of thing.
6635000	6639000	Like, it made an appearance in The Simpsons and Robert's...
6640000	6643000	Yeah, Bobby's corrected me in chat. Polybius. Well, here's the thing.
6644000	6649000	If the game's fake, then why is there really a way to pronounce it after all?
6650000	6652000	That's my argument, so there.
6653000	6657000	Alright, moving on. Renee, our friend from Killer Queens from Outer Space Podcast says,
6658000	6662000	The code to make Smurfette naked in the Smurf adventure on Colecovision, and it's true!
6663000	6667000	I actually, because I had played a ton of that game when I was...
6668000	6669000	Go figure! You?
6670000	6672000	No, I had a Coleco, but I never knew about that.
6673000	6677000	But yeah, it's true. It's a programming glitch because of the limitations of the system.
6677000	6684000	They can only draw so many sprites on different layers, and so if you happen to duck down by Smurfette,
6685000	6689000	it draws your hat, and then it never draws her skirt again.
6690000	6694000	And her skirt actually ends up going flying, like floats away or something. It's kind of weird.
6695000	6698000	But it's not intentional. It's just a bug.
6699000	6702000	Syal responds on Facebook and says, Duke Nukem forever. Oh wait, that happened.
6703000	6706000	Do creepypastas count as urban legends? Sure, why not.
6707000	6710000	So he links to a creepypasta article that talks about Lavender Town Syndrome.
6711000	6716000	In the Too Long Didn't Read version, music from Lavender Town in the early versions of Red and Green made kids commit suicide.
6717000	6723000	When the sounds were analyzed in 2010, it drew images of the Pokemon Unknown spelling out, leave now.
6724000	6726000	Okay, that's a little ridiculous.
6729000	6734000	Alright. Let's see, some other comments. Monty Boggs says, Tron. Oh wait, it's real.
6735000	6742000	Oh, you mean the actual Tron, like the universe of Tron exists? No, I think that it was maybe Space Paranoids.
6743000	6747000	But you know, they actually made Space Paranoids, as we played it at Electronica.
6748000	6756000	Ronnie B says, this is like an in-real-life version of Jumanji. I only remember the Bigfoot legend of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6757000	6762000	Awesome Unicorn says, beyond the simple you-can-revive-so-and-so legends of most Final Fantasies,
6762000	6768000	I really enjoy the legend of the hidden narrative of Final Fantasy VIII, in which Squall dies at the end of disc one,
6769000	6771000	and the rest of the game is a fever dream during his last moments before death.
6772000	6777000	I can't say if it was intentionally written that way, but it really makes the inconsistencies in characterization more interesting.
6778000	6782000	That's kind of, I like that kind of urban legend, just another way of interpreting the story. That's pretty cool.
6783000	6791000	Red the Haze replies and says, don't know if this qualifies as an urban legend, but the Haunted Majora's Mask Cart, also known as the Bensave,
6792000	6797000	it genuinely creeped me out, and people believed it when it came out because of the videos of a hacked ROM of Majora's Mask.
6798000	6799000	I don't know much about that one. Do you know that?
6800000	6804000	Yeah, I remember it. It's kind of creepy, but it's silly. The whole game looks creepy.
6805000	6814000	Let's see, Nemesis 47 names a few of them here. Only one among the urban myths that I mentioned that's half real is, again, as I say, Polybus, but Polybius,
6815000	6820000	because my boss at the City of the Dead Haunted House actually knows a guy who has the actual cabinet to the game.
6820000	6829000	Don't know if it, see, but here's the thing. You know a guy who knows a guy? Come on. Come on. I want to see the receipts. I want to see the receipts.
6830000	6836000	Show me the game. Show me the game. No offense to Nemesis 47, but I'm just saying that that's how these legends start. I know a guy who knows a guy.
6837000	6847000	Well, do you, is it possible that you just know a liar? I mean, anyway, don't know if it causes said dizzy effects, but it's half real from what he said in the YouTube video they posted.
6847000	6852000	Critical Myth replies and says, his favorite gaming urban legend? Half-Life 3.
6853000	6862000	Andy R. replies and says, the Mew under the truck by the S.S. Anne myth. Tried it myself eventually and found it was false.
6863000	6868000	Rage Nader talks about the haunted Zelda cartridge, and that's the only one that comes to mind.
6868000	6879000	Our friend, our friend Spike, from the fantastic podcast GameBully.org, replies and says, Ermac in the first Mortal Kombat.
6880000	6888000	That was more of an April Fools joke gone crazy that they actually turned into a real thing because the developers thought it was so funny. So, that's pretty, pretty awesome.
6889000	6892000	Nemesis 47 is trying to dig up the video right now.
6893000	6896000	I'm trying to find one that's sort of a current...
6897000	6901000	Hey, I like that I asked for the receipts and they're trying to get them. I appreciate that.
6902000	6909000	I'm trying to find one that I know is a very recent one that's going with Animal Crossing New Leaf.
6910000	6918000	That's for, and I've mentioned it before on the show, Aika Village, where it's basically set up as, it walks you through the village a certain way.
6918000	6927000	It's always nighttime, of course, because it's, you know, Dream Village, but it walks you through the story of this kid being murdered.
6928000	6934000	And then like all these graves and candy everywhere and really a lot of weirdness going on.
6935000	6942000	But people were like, some people were like, oh, it was actually haunted or something. And it was actually a story about this, that this girl wrote about her life and everything.
6942000	6951000	And I don't know if that's true. I've seen people post on forums where one person says, yeah, I know the person that made it and this is what happened.
6952000	6960000	This is her story. She doesn't want to come forward, you know, but it definitely falls under the category of creepypasta. So, I'll find the code for people.
6961000	6967000	Going to Google Plus, which that is not an urban legend. Google still does have Google Plus, despite all the news you heard this week.
6967000	6974000	Well, yeah, because they made you all, you know, sign up for accounts. Oh, here's the great part. I love this, you know, with YouTube and stuff.
6975000	6980000	They keep saying, hey, you sure you don't want to use your real name? I'm like, no, you know, I want to use this name.
6981000	6986000	And so they actually gave me an option to like create an account. I thought, oh, I got to, you know, specify a name.
6987000	6996000	And so now I have two accounts that are both low-key O-L-R. I'm like, and I can't delete the other one. It's just this blank account that's sitting there.
6997000	7002000	I had the hardest time connecting the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube with the Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus page.
7003000	7008000	I had the hardest time doing that. I still don't know how we did it. I think Jason did it and just, you know, I was like, oh, it's fixed.
7009000	7013000	I think that's finally what happened. I had the hardest time doing that. But anyway, I digress.
7014000	7015000	A new priest, an old priest.
7016000	7020000	By the way, if I may say, the ICA village dream code is two, six, oh shit.
7021000	7022000	Two, six, oh shit.
7023000	7024000	I tried to actually pull it up and the page closed itself.
7024000	7028000	Two, six, oh shit. They don't want her giving out the code.
7029000	7037000	All right. It's two, six, zero, zero, zero, two, one, eight, seven, two, nine, eight. So that's ICA village.
7038000	7040000	All right. Google Plus answers.
7041000	7046000	Flaco Jones, our friend that was here last, I don't know if you heard last week's episode, but Flaco filled in for you at the last minute and did a great job.
7047000	7048000	Yeah, I saw him yesterday.
7048000	7053000	Great guy. Anyway, Flaco replies and says, the story about Earthbound not coming to Virtual Console because of legal issues.
7054000	7057000	It was all based on one well-written article that didn't name its sources.
7058000	7063000	Time helped the game steam and it seemed to make sense until the game was finally released on Wii U and no litigation filed.
7064000	7065000	That's a good choice.
7066000	7071000	AJA Twist replies and says, I like the Pokemon legends. There's a lot and some are pretty dark.
7072000	7076000	For example, in the original Blue and Red, one legend is that you killed your rivals at Raticate.
7076000	7080000	The last time you see your rivals Raticate is during a battle on a ship.
7081000	7085000	The next time you see your rival is in Lavender Tower. Your rival says to you, why are you here?
7086000	7090000	You don't have any dead Pokemon, which could mean he is there because he has a dead Pokemon.
7091000	7096000	There wasn't a Pokemon Center on the ship where you had your last battle, which led people to believe he couldn't save his Raticate's life.
7097000	7101000	Oh, there is a lot of these around Pokemon. I didn't realize.
7101000	7108000	ActDeft replies and says, not technically legends, but a lot of EGM's old April Fools jokes were like it back in the day for me.
7109000	7113000	Especially since many of my friends and I didn't know about April Fools and truly believed what the magazine said back then.
7114000	7118000	Heck, I knew people that still thought of those as totally true despite me telling them how they were fake.
7119000	7127000	And last but not least, our pal VxChasenXV replies on Google and says, I'm a pretty big fan of the Video Gaming Causes Real Life Violence legend.
7128000	7132000	For the lulz. Good answer. I like those sassy answers there.
7133000	7139000	That's the answers from Facebook and Google Plus. A lot of them were named. Does anybody here in the room have a favorite that was not named?
7140000	7145000	The one that comes to mind for me from growing up was kind of referenced in one of these but wasn't explicitly named.
7146000	7153000	And that would be how you can revive Palom and Porom in Final Fantasy II, which remember was II in America but IV in Japan.
7154000	7157000	But when we were younger, we didn't know about IV in Japan. We only knew about II.
7158000	7163000	And when you would try to unstone Palom and Porom, you get an item box, you can't do anything.
7164000	7169000	And there was always that urban legend that you can do it, you can do it if you get the special item, you can do it.
7170000	7175000	Well, you could do it in the Japanese version of the game where the item existed, but never could do it in Final Fantasy II.
7175000	7183000	There were also, I mean even though I hate the bitch, there were also all the Eryth as having supposed to have been, there was like a revival quest in II.
7184000	7191000	And that half of it's written for, not in II, I'm saying in Disc II, that it was written for but never implemented.
7192000	7199000	So you can actually find code from where you were supposed to be able to revive her and there are ways to bring her back in your party but it glitches the game out really badly.
7200000	7201000	Phoenix down.
7201000	7208000	I also think the biggest one of all was probably Final Fantasy VI and reviving General Leo because you couldn't even do that in the Japanese version.
7209000	7213000	Seriously, why couldn't they just use a Phoenix down? I mean, that doesn't make any sense, like, oh, she's dead.
7214000	7216000	It's like, well, hey, we got this Phoenix down that could totally revive people.
7217000	7220000	Because your character just faints when they get to zero health.
7221000	7228000	Right, because of being set on fire, eaten by animals. I fainted, not died.
7229000	7232000	Any gaming urban legends for you, Loki, or were they all...
7233000	7242000	The only one I could think of was people looking for a game shark code or an in-game code to make Lara Croft naked in Tomb Raider.
7243000	7250000	I mean, there's all those April Fools jokes and stuff. Maybe that, I don't know.
7251000	7256000	Now there was one that when I was a kid we thought was just a legend until we actually found it to be true because I did it.
7256000	7258000	It was Mortal Kombat 2 playing Pong.
7259000	7260000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7261000	7266000	I actually played 250 versus games and we got Pong.
7267000	7268000	What a way to spend a Saturday.
7269000	7270000	Seriously.
7271000	7272000	But you got Pong.
7273000	7279000	Well, yeah, it was kind of fun. Then my brothers and I tried to do it on the Super Nintendo cartridge and it only stops at 200 games.
7280000	7286000	All right, let's move on back into some more news. Thank you everybody who answered the FUGL question of the week. Loki.
7287000	7293000	All right. So, you know, this is kind of interesting, but we've got...
7294000	7295000	Let's see here.
7296000	7305000	We've got Zynga back in the news because I hadn't heard about them forever and I thought they kind of went to the wayside and, you know, King was the new,
7305000	7314000	I hate this company, company in the mobile space, but apparently Zynga, the founder, has stepped down and they have a new person now taking his place.
7315000	7331000	So now I guess Mark Pincus is leaving and in his place they're getting the, what is it, the Xbox Live Journal manager or the, I guess, now former Xbox Live general manager who's taking his place.
7332000	7343000	So that's, I don't know, interesting I guess because Xbox Live seems to be a better run than probably Zynga in my opinion.
7344000	7352000	So maybe, I don't know, I got nothing. I don't see them coming back and being like this big powerhouse thing.
7353000	7356000	All I see them doing is like, hey, Farmville 3?
7357000	7358000	Zynga needs to launch a console. That's what they're doing.
7358000	7369000	Oh God, that would be terrible. But no, I don't know. I just don't care about them anymore. That's pretty much it.
7370000	7377000	I need a game I can take seriously out of them if they want me to take them seriously. Otherwise I just kind of go, oh, that's that company that makes all that crap.
7377000	7390000	Like something innovative. Because nowadays everything that they've done has kind of been done by everybody else and better, but at the same time there's so much saturation in that market that it's so hard to stand out.
7391000	7399000	I would love to see them come out at E3 with a trailer on YouTube that blows everybody away. I'm talking like Dead Island type of trailer, which that game wasn't even that great.
7399000	7407000	But the trailer, remember the trailer and everybody was talking about that trailer, right? I need Zynga to come out with something like that and then the Zynga logos at the end and everybody's like, no fucking way.
7408000	7416000	That's how they can fix that. Exactly. You come out with that game, it's like a mind blowing trailer. It's like, I never thought they'd do a game like this.
7417000	7424000	You also just kind of have to accept the fact that Zynga doesn't make games for you and me anymore. They make games for...
7425000	7438000	I understand that, but it's just like... I guess this is my same gripe that I have in the whole mobile space. These companies make the same type of game just kind of like reskinned over and over and over again.
7438000	7446000	And then on top of that, you have everybody that clones those games or they're cloning other people's games and reskinning them. Everybody's just reskinning and cloning.
7447000	7457000	In fact, it was funny because there's still all the flappy bird stuff on there and I saw, was it this week, that there's even goat simulator clones now coming on there, which is fine.
7457000	7463000	Whatever. It's a physics simulator with a goat. I mean, whatever. You can't really do much on mobile anyways.
7464000	7473000	It's just interesting that people will seriously try to copy whatever is popular at that moment. They just try to grab some cash and then kind of move on to the next popular thing.
7474000	7478000	Maybe it works. I don't know. I haven't tried, but it's just weird.
7479000	7483000	All right. Well, moving on. I'm going to talk quickly about this because it was really brought up earlier in the show.
7484000	7492000	But some news about the game sales in China. China did lift its ban on foreign game consoles back in January.
7493000	7499000	So there's some news about now how this is going to work and the kind of content that will actually be allowed to be sold in the country.
7500000	7507000	So for example, gambling related game features would not be able to be sold in the country. So no Vegas stakes on virtual console in China.
7508000	7514000	I would think a gambling element could be really vaguely doesn't necessarily have to be a gambling simulator.
7515000	7521000	It could be anything where you can like in some of the final fantasy games, isn't there like you can gamble Gill or something like think about it.
7522000	7528000	There could be an element in the game that would make it a bad also final fantasy six would not be able to be sold there.
7529000	7543000	Yeah. Right. So any, um, any game that is threatening to quote China's national unity sovereignty or territorial integrity or any content that instigates racial or ethnic hatred will not be distributable in the country.
7544000	7549000	Does that mean no civilization? Cause like no game makes me a bigger racist civilization.
7549000	7559000	And it's all, it's only during the game, you know, where you'll get, you'll get really pissed off. Like, you know, like the fucking Dutch, God damn the Dutch, the Dutch just took my goddamn city again.
7560000	7566000	But at the end of the day, like I love sill and I love that I'm half Dutch, but during civilization.
7567000	7578000	And I married, uh, there you go. You married. Yeah. You married as Dan's grandfather says, if you ain't Dutch ain't much, but when I'm playing civilization and they're my rival, I hate them.
7579000	7583000	So I wonder if that would be something cause I've, I've played my games of Civ where I hate the Chinese as well.
7584000	7596000	So I would wonder if that might be a game that would end up being banned. Who knows? Uh, games can also not promote obscenity, drug use, violence or gambling and no cults or superstitions. Well, no.
7597000	7602000	Well, it looks like there's no games coming to China. Unfortunately, uh, that's too bad.
7603000	7614000	Would Farmville be okay? Maybe. Well, actually, apparently final fantasy 14, they're going to release in China and it's a bit, you know, MMOs are huge in China and there's not a lot of cross.
7615000	7622000	I don't, I mean, world of Warcraft is out in China, but it's a different company and I think they're an expansion behind and it's not quite the phenomenon.
7622000	7630000	It is here. So, you know, a lot of the MMOs that do well here don't necessarily do well there and vice versa. Their MMOs are not necessarily popular here.
7631000	7640000	Um, but they are going to release 14. So that should be interesting to see. So anyhow, it's a damn shame that RO2 was kind of lame.
7641000	7642000	But it had good music.
7643000	7649000	Act deft in our chat room. I have had it with these motherfucking Dutch in this motherfucking game.
7652000	7657000	I have had it with these monkey loving Dutch in this Monday to Friday plane.
7658000	7659000	Oh, Lord.
7662000	7664000	Moving on, uh, to our Sakura.
7665000	7675000	Well, um, how about something Minecraft related as we've already, the game that just doesn't stop, I guess Minecraft would be okay in China.
7676000	7679000	I don't think any of those things are necessarily, huh? I don't know.
7680000	7684000	I think the slender man has his own claim. You're killing animals. Is that violence though?
7685000	7690000	Oh, could be. Anyway, how about Minecraft realms, which we have discussed in the past.
7691000	7699000	Um, but the Minecraft realms is a hosting and set up for multiplayer Minecraft worlds that's $13 a month.
7700000	7710000	So basically it's just a giveaway for parents to restrict, you know, who their kids can play with by having it be invite only or have different range of permissions available.
7711000	7717000	It's only out for PC and you can find out more at minecraft.net forward slash realms.
7717000	7726000	I don't know. There's also something on there about discounts. If you go to three or six month subscriptions, which I don't know, that's actually not bad.
7727000	7731000	And you can get up to, uh, uh, 10 players at a time on each realm.
7732000	7737000	Uh, I mean, that's cool that they're doing some official thing, but let me put it this way. You can do it cheaper and better.
7737000	7747000	Um, I pay like five bucks a month and I can do up to 20. Granted, there's more set up to it. Um, but you can do mod support and all that stuff.
7748000	7756000	But if you just want a way that, you know, whatever, that you don't want to mess with any of that set up and everything, then I guess that'd be a good way to go.
7757000	7761000	And you can do other things too. You can not only just host your own worlds, but you can actually set up like mini games and stuff.
7761000	7773000	They have like pre-made mods that you can kind of, I want to set up a tower defense world or I want to set up, you know, this, uh, you know, PvP world or I want to do something else.
7774000	7785000	And you can do that pretty easily. They have mods and stuff available for that. Um, and then on top of that, um, I think that realm supports also supposed to be coming to mobile.
7786000	7789000	So you'll be able to have your own servers and stuff if you want to play mobile.
7789000	7790000	That's cool for the mobile.
7791000	7793000	For the pocket edition. Yeah. So that'd be kind of neat.
7794000	7801000	Um, I would love servers for the Xbox 360 version because right now you have to have like, you know, one person logged in stuff.
7802000	7806000	That'd be pretty awesome if you could do like a remote server that you can log into or something.
7807000	7808000	Um, indeed it would be.
7808000	7814000	Um, some more Minecraft information. Of course there's going to be some new updates coming out soon.
7815000	7819000	Um, one of which though is going to be including world customization, um, updates.
7820000	7827000	And what that means is there's going to be a lot more control over how your world is generated in the, um, the initial build of it.
7828000	7835000	I guess you can, um, set, you know, limits, including, you know, how deep the world goes, how the upper limits, they have different presets.
7835000	7842000	You can, you know, generate caves or not, villages, temples, strongholds, um, really, uh, lots of control.
7843000	7847000	They had a video that came out that kind of showed all this stuff and it looks pretty cool.
7848000	7850000	You can make some pretty crazy looking worlds out of that.
7851000	7861000	Um, also, if you happen to own consoles that are not PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, you might be wondering, hey, when am I going to be able to play Minecraft?
7861000	7869000	Well, the PlayStation 4 and Vita versions of the game are going to be available, um, in either quarter 2 or quarter 3, so sometime this summer.
7870000	7875000	And, um, you can transfer your PlayStation 3 worlds to them, which is kind of cool.
7876000	7888000	And those will be coming out at some point, um, saying that they will have some news, I guess, later on if there's going to be cross-buy or a PS3 to PlayStation 4 upgrade option.
7888000	7891000	Um, but, it's still pretty cool.
7892000	7905000	And then also, they're saying that, um, not only does the PlayStation 4 and Vita versions support transferring saves, but the Xbox One will support the 360 saves being transferred to it as well.
7906000	7911000	So, that's pretty cool, so you don't have to lose your world and you can, you know, upgrade whenever it comes out.
7912000	7919000	Uh, no word, though, on when that version of the game will be coming out, but at some point, you know, maybe this year.
7920000	7925000	They pushed that, they stealthily pushed that back. That, Minecraft on PS4 was supposed to be out already.
7926000	7930000	Yeah, the PS3 version, well, disc versions coming out in a couple, I think like a week or so.
7930000	7941000	So, um, and that's already selling like hotcakes. So, you'd be surprised, like the disc version of the Xbox 360 version has been top ten selling titles since it's been released.
7942000	7951000	Oh yeah, it's crazy how huge Minecraft is. I have co-workers that never talk about video games, but they'll talk about, oh yeah, I played Minecraft this weekend with my nephew.
7952000	7953000	It's like, oh.
7954000	7955000	It's fun.
7956000	7957000	My game's huge.
7958000	7959000	I haven't touched our server in two months.
7960000	7961000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7962000	7971000	Well, when I got my new computer and stuff, I had like, some of my bookmarks were gone, so I just haven't gone around to updating stuff.
7972000	7976000	Alright, well, a real quick update here for you guys on Theatrhythm.
7977000	7982000	You remember that game on the 3DS? It was a music game from Square, which featured a lot of music from Final Fantasy.
7983000	7986000	I reviewed the game on VOG Network when it first came out. I think I gave it a B+.
7987000	7989000	But, I mean, that's still good and I like the game.
7990000	7995000	And I'm excited about this. Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call is coming. It was confirmed for North America.
7996000	8003000	I believe the game just came out in Japan, but thanks to region locking, we're going to have to wait for the US version unless somebody can find me a Japanese 3DS.
8004000	8009000	Two hundred and twenty-one songs in this version of the game. Sixty characters from the Final Fantasy franchise in it.
8010000	8028000	What's really cool is that this time the game is going to have music from Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, and some of the Final Fantasy side games that were there, as well as in the main series, including music from Final Fantasy XIV, which is very good, because XIV's got a great soundtrack, and music from X-2 and other stuff as well.
8028000	8039000	The only thing that kind of pisses me off, being that I own the original Theatrhythm game and I paid for it and all that stuff, is that every single song from the original Theatrhythm, and I think all the DLC, is already in this game.
8040000	8051000	So it's like, oh, okay, so there's literally no reason to own the old game. And I can't even really sell the old game, because it ain't going to be worth the hoot with this other game out there.
8051000	8064000	So that part's kind of like, hmm, but whatever. There is an announcement trailer out there, and I'll probably buy the game anyway, because I really like Final Fantasy, you guys. A lot. A lot, a lot.
8065000	8078000	Alright, we're going to get to the mailbag. Let's get to the mailbag, because you guys email us every week at participate at orangelaungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorite emails here on air.
8079000	8084000	Where's my music? I don't have my music tonight. Can you sing Dark Soccer, maybe?
8085000	8087000	Uh, words?
8088000	8089000	I did not have my theme music for the mailbag.
8090000	8091000	Well, how could you do that?
8092000	8100000	I was missing another one of my files earlier. Alright, participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
8100000	8108000	So, thanks to a technical issue, Dark Soccer is not going to be reading emails tonight. I'm going to read them in her place.
8109000	8113000	So, Dark Soccer, if I could borrow your hazmat suit while I dive into the mailbag.
8114000	8115000	I don't know, it's got stuff all over it.
8116000	8122000	Gross. Alright, let me see if I can get in there, and pull out some emails. We have three emails tonight.
8123000	8131000	First email comes to us from EA Skizie, who says, what's up orange people? I don't think I'm actually orange.
8132000	8133000	You don't look like Bob Barker.
8134000	8139000	I don't look like Bob Barker. That man was orange. Orange. I did go to a Taming of the Price is Right, but I'll say that story for another week.
8140000	8145000	I have never had an email read on any podcast or radio show, so thanks for that last week.
8145000	8158000	You're welcome. Other podcasts you listen to don't read your emails. I guess maybe you listen to too many podcasts that get famous people that have thousands and thousands of listeners.
8159000	8163000	But trust me, the independent producers appreciate each and every email that they get.
8164000	8165000	We'll read your email again this week.
8166000	8173000	My buddy demands that I don't lower the difficulty on Torchlight 2 for our co-op playthrough, so I'm stuck dying a lot. Whatever.
8173000	8180000	Oh yeah, this was the email last week about how do I get better at Torchlight 2 because I keep dying, and we're like, play it on an easier mode.
8181000	8183000	Here's the next question from EA Skizie.
8184000	8191000	If Sonic the Hedgehog and Princess Peach, or Toadstool, had a baby, what would it look like? What would his or her name be?
8192000	8197000	And what kind of game would he or she star in? Oh, and don't forget, who is their enemy or final boss?
8197000	8207000	If Sonic the Hedgehog and Princess Peach had a baby, what would it look like? Well, considering one is a hedgehog and one is a person.
8208000	8211000	It would look like a mutation.
8212000	8214000	It would look like something I would see on the cover of Weekly World News.
8215000	8217000	It would look like a hybrid, because that's what it would be.
8218000	8224000	Well, technically, is she a Toadstool? I mean, she might be part mushroom or something, so I don't know how that works.
8225000	8226000	She has fronds under her skirt.
8227000	8240000	Well, if you mix Sonic with a Toad, you know, Sonics and Hedgehogs are fast and Toads are a little slow, I think you'd end up with somebody normal. That's what you would get.
8241000	8245000	And what game would they star in? Normal the Unremarkable Hero.
8246000	8249000	Copyright OLR 2014.
8250000	8263000	Honestly, what you would have is you would have Knuckles, because it's a character that runs pretty fast and can kind of hover, because Princess Peach does her little hover thing, so you have Knuckles.
8264000	8266000	You would get another shitty Sonic friend, that's what you get.
8267000	8275000	Yes, another shitty Sonic friend, and the enemy would be, I don't know, who's against bestiality? Everybody?
8275000	8287000	I've got it. So, if the spawn of Sonic and Princess Toadstool is normal the unremarkable, then who would the final boss of the game be? Captain Fabulous!
8290000	8291000	He's the anti-hero.
8292000	8293000	You need to make that game.
8294000	8296000	You kind of cheer for him a little bit. Normal the unremarkable, fighting Captain Fabulous.
8297000	8299000	Well, there's Captain Rainbow. I mean, that's close.
8300000	8305000	Who should totally be a character in Smash Bros., because nobody is expecting that.
8306000	8309000	You know who needs to be a character in Smash Bros. is Tingle. That's the one I'm waiting for.
8310000	8312000	I don't think anyone would care, but he's an assist, though.
8313000	8320000	Alright, anyhow, EA Skizie says, I thought this would be a fun question for you guys to tackle. Keep gaming, guys. The show is dope. Happy face.
8320000	8326000	P.S. Please do the show till you die. I'll listen to your cranky old asses forever. LOL.
8327000	8329000	Well, thanks for the sentiment, I think.
8330000	8334000	You're listening to Orange Lounge, right here.
8335000	8338000	You're listening to Orange Lounge, oops, I crapped my pants.
8339000	8341000	I'd be like, you're listening to Orange.
8342000	8345000	And now it's time for the classic nap of the week.
8346000	8349000	The classic game of the week is Titanfall.
8351000	8354000	Titanfall. Titanfall 4 by then.
8355000	8360000	Alright, there you go. That's email number 1. Thank you, EA Skizie, for the lulz.
8361000	8365000	Let us go to email number 2 from Awesome Unicorn.
8366000	8377000	Awesome Unicorn, dear OLR, my apologies for sounding like a miserable grammar Nazi, but I couldn't let slide this chance to razz on Jamie and come to Rob's defense.
8377000	8383000	I picked the best week ever to do the mailbag. Oh, I'm perked up now. Razzing on Jamie, coming to my defense. Yay!
8384000	8388000	Thank you, Alan. Alan says what I was thinking.
8389000	8392000	Alan, my partner in the kitchen, watch it be wrong.
8393000	8394000	Oh, I'm ready.
8395000	8397000	Well, let's finish Awesome Unicorn's email. I am so ready for this. Here we go.
8398000	8402000	At the end of the last episode, Rob says, it will just be Jamie and I.
8403000	8406000	At which point, Jamie states that it should be and me, not and I.
8407000	8418000	Thanks to the linking verb, here a form of to be, in the sentence, the pronoun used as the object must complement the subject in a case called the predicate nominative.
8419000	8420000	I can't even pronounce his justification.
8421000	8425000	Basically, it's the grammatical equivalent of the reflexive property, a equals a.
8426000	8436000	For pronouns, this case is identical to the subjective case, so this is the reason you would say, this is she, when answering the phone, or it will be Jamie and I when discussing podcasting plans.
8437000	8441000	But, I don't like the but in this case. Usually, I'm a fan of buts, but in this case, I don't know.
8442000	8448000	But, with all that out of the way, the predicate nominative is dying a swift death in our current vernacular.
8449000	8454000	So, even though Rob is actually right, Jamie isn't wrong. Thanks for nothing, Four Years of Latin.
8455000	8457000	I promise I'm not rude. I just wanted a chance to tease Jamie.
8458000	8460000	Thanks for another week of entertainment and stay awesome.
8460000	8473000	But, it would be determined on if you were actually trying to use it as a continuation where there was a, where the next part of the sentence would be an understood item, or if you were actually using it in a subjective sense.
8474000	8478000	You know what? I like emails that tell me I'm the most smartest on this show, so you know what?
8479000	8480000	But.
8481000	8482000	It's smarterest.
8483000	8485000	That's right. I am the mosted smarterest.
8486000	8488000	I am smarter than you, so.
8488000	8492000	I am surrounded by people who don't know how to speak their own language.
8493000	8496000	Oh, I forgot. This is America. Of course no one knows how to speak their own language.
8497000	8499000	We don't speak English here. We speak Murican.
8500000	8511000	That's, that's always my favorite comeback to the whole like, you know, well, this is America, and in America, we speak English. And I'm like, you don't.
8512000	8513000	And besides that, you know what?
8514000	8517000	We have no national language. It's official.
8518000	8519000	No national language.
8520000	8523000	Anyway, can we talk about butts?
8524000	8525000	We all have one.
8526000	8527000	Girls' butts?
8528000	8529000	No.
8530000	8537000	Whatever you're into. Whatever you're into. All right. Anyhow, thank you Awesome Unicorn for trying to stick up for me a little bit, even if you concede it at the end there a little bit, but I'm just saying.
8537000	8550000	All right. We have another email here from Dr. Noir, who says, hail to the OL army chiefs. Greetings from Lima, Peru, from your other Mexican recruit. So not act deaf, but the other.
8551000	8552000	But wouldn't he be Peruvian?
8553000	8556000	Well, I think he's just visiting Peru is my, my thought here. So maybe.
8557000	8559000	Let us know if you're visiting Peru or you're actually Peruvian.
8560000	8561000	Because saying Peruvian is awesome.
8562000	8565000	That is, that is true. Do we have any Peruvian listeners? I'd actually kind of like to know that.
8565000	8568000	But anyhow, I love hearing from listeners around the world. Nothing.
8569000	8570000	What? You laughing over there?
8571000	8572000	I'll friend anyone's butt.
8573000	8582000	Here's the thing. I'm going to tell you, please don't be shy. Please don't be afraid that your English isn't good enough, especially when dark Sakura can sometimes be a bit of a grammar Nazi and now she has a helper.
8583000	8586000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do not like that terminology because they were awful and killed people.
8587000	8588000	Okay, fine. A grammar.
8589000	8590000	Extremist.
8591000	8592000	A grammar bitch. All right.
8593000	8594000	Okay. I will go for grammar bitch.
8595000	8604000	Anyhow, here's the thing. I, I, nothing tickles me more as a, as a podcaster here in the United States than hearing from people around the world.
8605000	8613000	I know we have listeners in Mexico. We have listeners in Sweden. We have listeners in Japan. Hell, we even have listeners in Canada. Fuck yeah.
8614000	8622000	But I'd like to hear from our, our listeners from around the world. Nothing is more rewarding than a podcaster. So please, please email us, you guys. I want to hear from all you around the world.
8622000	8629000	Anyhow. Oh, we have a Belgian listener too. I remember that we get those emails too. So anyhow, back to Dr. Noir.
8630000	8636000	I've been trying to remember the name of a game for the past month with zero success and it's killing me.
8637000	8645000	So I would like to pick the collective OL army brain to get that monkey off my back. Now I read this email before the show. I didn't know.
8646000	8649000	So here we go. Let's see if you guys can end chat room. Play along. Here we go.
8649000	8665000	This is an eight or 16 bit game where you place mythical creatures. I remember unicorns and dragons on a hex board to do battle against monsters on a turn-based strategy system.
8666000	8676000	The creatures level up as they acquire kills. The name and platform for the game is what I'm after and a source would be appreciated since I want to play it with my kids.
8676000	8679000	Hopefully it will hold up nicely to the test of time.
8680000	8691000	Oh my God. I know what this is. It's, um, and it was sort of, no, it was, it was a hex board. It wasn't isometric, but my brain went to Arcon. Arcon was not a hex board.
8692000	8705000	No, but, um, and I don't know, but didn't the makers. Okay. There was a game by the makers of Nobunaga's ambition, which involves mythical creatures.
8706000	8720000	I think, but I might be on the wrong track. Rama thinks super Godzilla, but that didn't really, that was on a hex board, but I don't think, uh, like he's thinking, he says unicorns and dragons.
8721000	8733000	Um, there's, uh, I don't remember the name. I thought it was the one that there, uh, there was a recent Kickstarter that they were rebuilding the game for, uh, or, uh, doing a sequel to it.
8734000	8743000	And I don't remember. I'm not actually on Kickstarter trying to remember what the hell the name was from the original creator. Um, and apparently it was a popular game.
8744000	8755000	I don't know if that's the one, if it was, um, I hate, hate the way they have this set up here. It's so hard to find anything. God damn it.
8756000	8769000	I'm trying to think of what that game was that, um, I'm sorry guys, I'm drawing a blank here. I hate not knowing these things.
8769000	8781000	So some folks in chat, uh, hex heroes, uh, act F says hex heroes. Uh, Rob of us says heroes of might and magic.
8782000	8789000	I was thinking here is a main magic. I think that might've been it. Let me see. I'm going to look it up right now. I still have no connection. So
8789000	8799000	sorry for the dead air guys, but this is super important. We're trying to figure out what this game is. Heroes of might magic.
8800000	8810000	Oh yeah. Cause it had all the sequels and everything. And heroes of might magic was 95 though with that. I guess that'd be around about end of SNES era.
8811000	8819000	But the problem was I don't think it was on the SNES. I think it was only a PC game, but I guess he didn't say it was PC. That could be it.
8820000	8826000	Well, uh, Dr. Noir, check that out. See if heroes of might and magic is it. Maybe that's the one you're thinking of, which by the way, it's a huge series.
8827000	8833000	I've got a ton of that. Uh, some other tips here from the chat. Uh, dungeon Buster says wrath unleashed by Lucas arts, possibly dungeon.
8833000	8840000	Muster's thinking it could be a Lucas arts game. So, uh, there you go. Some thoughts, but yeah, I am drawing a blank.
8841000	8849000	I can't remember it. There was a, there was a Kickstarter for an old, it was an old strategy game and uh, they were remaking it.
8850000	8856000	I don't remember the fuck it was. It was not even that long ago. It was like maybe a month or two ago that they had it come out.
8856000	8868000	And, uh, God, I'm trying to look it up. It was a, this was a PC title. They had a demo for it and everything. Um, Kickstarter.
8873000	8879000	All right. That's going to frustrate me. Sorry guys. I know that was a lot of dead air in that, but I'm like, ah, we need to think of the game.
8880000	8882000	So unfortunately, Dr. Noir stumped the host tonight.
8882000	8889000	How about we do some research this week and make it a, an answer next week. Yeah, I bet we'll get some emails on it this week or some tweets.
8890000	8897000	Send me some tweets and I'll retweet, retweet if I think you got the right answer. You know, who's got a great brain for those classic video games that I bet knows this.
8898000	8904000	If he's listening is a captain spike from game boy. I bet would know this spike. Come hang out and chat. Hold on. Is he on Skype?
8904000	8912000	Oh Lord. I am not above calling that man right now. If he is on Skype, I don't think he is. He's smarter than that.
8914000	8926000	Let me see. Yeah, he's not on Skype. Maybe I'll text him. Let's see if he, uh, this was it. It was chaos reborn, but it was a remake of, was it chaos?
8926000	8929000	Maybe that's not the game I'm thinking of or not the game they're thinking of.
8929000	8937000	Yeah. SSU 100 Matt in chat says, thanks emailer. Now it's going to drive all of us nuts trying to figure out what this game is.
8937000	8951000	Well, let's see. So chaos, which was, uh, what system was that? I'm thinking PC. Uh, it was done by, is it fire access to the originally? I don't remember. Maybe this is being remade by fire.
8952000	8964000	Let's see. Kickstarter campaign. I think it was, do we have any more email? No, that was it. Well, fuck. How about FUs now?
8964000	8979000	Yes, I think we will get to the FUs of the week. While I send a frantic text message here, uh, while we get to the FUs of the week, I'm going to say FU to that email. Sorry, Dr. Noir, but you know you're going to drive us nuts with that all week now. I don't like not knowing.
8979000	8986000	We pride ourselves on our knowledge and you have hit the dark corner that the three of us have not overlapped on.
8986000	8991000	Yeah. All right, so let's get to the FUs of the week.
8991000	9019000	Um, FU to my iPad and or your internet or the, uh, well Rob's internet or the fact that the two will not nary the two shall meet.
9019000	9041000	You know, because I haven't been able to get anything working except chat on my iPad and this is getting rid on and also, um, I don't want to say FU to our new, um, cell phone coverage company because they are also Dan's employer, but we need to get that LTE tower out here ASAP.
9042000	9045000	ASAFP. You know who you are.
9048000	9050000	All right, Loki, your FUs of the week.
9050000	9055000	Uh, my FU of the week goes to trying to figure out what this game is.
9055000	9059000	Uh, what, no, what year, what, what were they talking about before that they came?
9059000	9061000	They said it needed to be 16 or 8 bit.
9062000	9073000	16 or 8 bit, but okay. Well, chaos, the original chaos game, um, came out on the ZX spectrum. I don't know if that was it. That was 1985.
9073000	9075000	That would have been UK.
9078000	9081000	I have no idea. I give up.
9081000	9086000	Um, my FU of the week goes to, uh, being stumped right now.
9086000	9094000	And, uh, my other FU of the week goes to the fact that I have this really bad tendency to have all these phone numbers in my phone and I don't put names on them.
9094000	9100000	So then when I try to find a phone number later, I can't figure it out. So FU to my lack of organization.
9100000	9104000	There you go. All right, just a few more news stories for you guys.
9104000	9110000	And then we're going to get to your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki?
9110000	9116000	All right. So there's some old edutainment titles that are going to be coming to Steam as well.
9116000	9129000	Now, I know of these titles. I've never played them, but apparently these are all by Humongous Entertainment, which you may remember is co-founded by Ron Gilbert, who created Secret of Monkey Island.
9129000	9147000	And, uh, these games, you know, they had such things as, you know, uh, Freddy Fish in the case of the Missing Kelp Seeds, Pajama Sam, No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, Putt-Putt and Pep's Ballonorama, and, uh, Freddy Fish and Luther's, uh, was it, Luther's Maze Madness.
9147000	9152000	Well, now they're going to be launching, um, some more versions of the game, I guess.
9152000	9162000	Uh, Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon, Pajama Sam 3, You Are What You Eat, From Your Head to Your Feet, Spy Fox 3 Operation Ozone, and Putt-Putt Travels Through Time.
9162000	9174000	And those are, um, I guess available now, I want to say, and they're even on sale. You can actually grab all 27 games for 100 bucks, if you really want to, if you're really into edutainment.
9176000	9179000	I don't know. It's neat, I guess.
9179000	9180000	Or have kids?
9180000	9181000	Or, yeah.
9181000	9185000	Like, someone in this room? I don't think my cat would play any of those.
9185000	9188000	She could use some education.
9188000	9190000	So, that's pretty cool.
9190000	9192000	I don't know.
9192000	9196000	Sorry, I'm sending text messages as you're talking.
9196000	9199000	Tell Captain Spike I said hi.
9199000	9202000	I will.
9202000	9203000	Alright.
9203000	9218000	Yeah, it looks like these titles are actually going to be released a few each week, so they started releasing them already, but it's going to be released, I guess, through the rest of May, and up through the first week of June, so.
9218000	9221000	Lots of, lots of titles.
9224000	9225000	What are you doing?
9225000	9230000	I am sending a picture of the email, so that I'm not leaving out any details.
9231000	9232000	Alright.
9232000	9243000	Moving on to a story about Nintendo, which is a little bit of the whole, like, this is part of why Nintendo's getting a bad rap, y'all.
9243000	9258000	Dan Adelman, who is over at Nintendo as the head of their indie initiative, which, you know, Nintendo really made a push to try to get indies on the Wii U shop, and we actually heard from a few developers that actually really liked working with Nintendo and how easy it was to get on the shop and so forth.
9258000	9267000	They're apparently no longer allowed, Dan is no longer allowed to get on Twitter, and the issue here is that he was one of the main points of contact for indie developers.
9267000	9276000	You know, Twitter's a great way to reach out and get people's attention, like, you know, listeners can tweet me, and I, I, nine times out of ten will respond.
9276000	9283000	I'm only not going to respond if it's, like, trolling or whatever, but if you, like, ask me a question, I'm going to answer you, which, by the way, twitter.com slash s-k-i-e.
9283000	9287000	But anyhow, so, but Dan's been shut down by Nintendo.
9287000	9296000	This was in an observation from one of the writers at Gamasutra, who said that contacting Nintendo was very difficult.
9296000	9299000	The head of Nintendo's indie initiative was not allowed to speak with us.
9299000	9309000	This is the sort of corporate policy that perpetuates the stereotype that Nintendo doesn't work well with third parties, and is an emblem of Nintendo's reluctance to change and become more open as markets shift.
9309000	9311000	As an indie developer, this is very troubling to me.
9311000	9316000	I've received word from a reliable source that Adelman is no longer allowed to access Twitter.
9316000	9318000	His last post was in October of last year.
9318000	9326000	Apparently, he wrote something along the lines of, I travel a lot, so I feel your pain, when somebody didn't like the region locking of the 3DS.
9326000	9329000	And that was viewed unacceptable by Nintendo, so that was it.
9329000	9331000	Their twitter was shut down.
9331000	9335000	It's a little ridiculous and out of touch, if this is true.
9335000	9345000	Now, granted, I read the Gamasutra piece, and I, I, I thought it was good, but it did seem a little bit like, we're going to really rag on Nintendo because they wouldn't interview with me.
9345000	9347000	Which was a little bit cheesy.
9347000	9358000	However, any way you slice it, Nintendo's kind of starting to develop an image problem, and their problem is that they don't get it.
9358000	9362000	So, I hope that they can do what they need to do to correct that image.
9362000	9367000	Because there's a lot of people that are kind of rooting for Nintendo, but it's getting harder and harder as the months go on, let me tell you.
9367000	9369000	And stories like this don't help.
9370000	9373000	So, there you go.
9373000	9376000	That's it. That's the last story.
9376000	9384000	So, I think it's time to open up the Skype line over at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9384000	9388000	If you want to give us a call, and you can talk about whatever you want.
9388000	9390000	Maybe you know the damn game.
9392000	9394000	And you can give us a call.
9394000	9401000	So, while we wait for some calls to come in, I'll turn to Loki, as I usually do at this point of the show, and go, is there any last minute stories?
9401000	9405000	Ah, no. Not the moment.
9405000	9406000	Not the moment.
9406000	9407000	I'll look harder.
9407000	9410000	Alright. Well, yeah, look harder while we go to take some calls.
9410000	9412000	He said hard. He said harder.
9412000	9414000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9414000	9415000	Hey, this is HecDeaf.
9415000	9417000	Hey, HecDeaf. How you doing, buddy?
9417000	9419000	Ah, pretty good. Pretty good.
9419000	9420000	What's on your mind?
9420000	9430000	Well, I won't give you head migraines because of something like Dr. Noir.
9430000	9434000	Well, he's going to feel bad when he listens to this, and I don't want him to.
9434000	9437000	He should get a point or something for stumping us.
9437000	9438000	That's what he should get.
9438000	9442000	Yeah, he got the Stump D, the health achievement.
9442000	9446000	Yeah. Maybe I'll see if I can get him some loot over on VOG Network.
9446000	9449000	You gave Rob a migraine. Congrats. No, I'm kidding.
9450000	9456000	Something that did give me a really great headache was NES Remix 2.
9456000	9458000	Oh, are you playing NES Remix 2?
9458000	9462000	Yeah, I got it yesterday, actually, and I'm pretty much liking it.
9462000	9466000	It's a pretty good game, though. Like I said earlier in chat,
9466000	9473000	it's basically NES Remix 1, but with other games, it's a bit better,
9473000	9482000	especially because it has Super Luigi Brothers and the Nintendo Championship world thing.
9482000	9488000	But something that really struck me, like, oh my god, Nintendo, what are you doing?
9488000	9496000	Well, I'll ask you first. Did you play the Kirby Adventure challenges?
9496000	9503000	Yes, and I had the same reaction you did to the whole, like, let's watch the demo as one of the mini challenges.
9503000	9510000	But you know, I will say this, you'll notice that almost all of the first stages in the games are teaching you how to play the game.
9510000	9518000	Oh, yeah. That's definitely something I like, even from the first game, that it's teaching you how to play the game.
9518000	9519000	Well, you know why.
9519000	9527000	One thing is teaching you how to play. One thing is making you see it through the demo as something that you already played years before.
9527000	9536000	And this is speaking for me, because you know me, and most people here listening to the show know how I love Kirby.
9536000	9537000	I know.
9537000	9542000	So, I felt like, Nintendo, what the fuck are you doing?
9543000	9550000	ActDeft, let's be real, NES Remix 2 in some ways is virtual console demos that you paid money for.
9550000	9558000	So, it's got to teach you how to play a little bit. And there's, believe it or not, ActDeft, some of these kids today have never played Kirby.
9558000	9570000	Yeah, that's something I got told on Twitter. It's probably for the hardcores that don't listen or don't watch the demos or something like that.
9570000	9577000	But, yeah, it really strikes me like super odd or something like, Nintendo, you're holding my hand way too much.
9577000	9583000	Because, and I'll say it again, the game already teaches you how to play.
9583000	9592000	Basically, on the first two challenges, it basically teaches you how to play. So, it's like overdoing it.
9592000	9599000	And not only Kirby, also, at least from what I played, Wario's Wits also does it.
9599000	9604000	Which, well, now for Wario's Woods, I kind of need it. Because I got one of those remix stages involving Wario's Woods.
9604000	9608000	And I was like, literally, I don't know what I'm doing. I've never played this game in my life.
9608000	9615000	I played a lot of the Nintendo puzzlers. I played the shit out of Dr. Mario, which is the only way I can do good on the Nintendo championships.
9615000	9619000	It's because I'm pretty good at Dr. Mario, so I can rack up a score there.
9619000	9627000	But then, outside of that, because it's all about setting up combos, if you want to get the high score in the championship, you've got to know how to do combos in Dr. Mario.
9627000	9638000	But anyway, besides that, Wario's Woods came out. I've never played Wario's Woods in my life, so I have no idea how that game works.
9638000	9647000	Actually, I played a lot of Wario's Woods back in the day, when I had the Super Nintendo. I played that version, so I know how to play it too.
9648000	9657000	There's something that probably also compares between those four challenges, to watch the demo. Wario's Woods is a lot quicker.
9657000	9664000	Meanwhile, Kirby's takes like two minutes to get it done.
9664000	9666000	There's a lot to it.
9667000	9674000	It teaches you all the abilities and all that stuff, so it takes way too long.
9674000	9679000	Like I said, maybe for someone who doesn't know the game, well, that's okay.
9679000	9690000	But for me, I'm a veteran Kirby fan. Even Kirby's Adventure was my first Kirby game, so I feel like, well, you know.
9691000	9697000	Alright, well, ActDeft, I hate to cut you off here, but I have a very important update. I just got a text message. I don't know if you heard the sound in the background.
9697000	9704000	So here's my buddy, CaptainSpike from gamebuoy.org, who knows a lot, a lot about video games. This man's encyclopedia. He's very smart.
9704000	9715000	He says, outside of the game Hex, which is just unicorns, or something from the Archon series, which lacks leveling, I'm drawing a blank, which is bizarre.
9716000	9724000	So he also is stumped. So Dr. Noir, I hate to insinuate this, but are you sure you're getting all the details right? Because you've stumped everybody.
9724000	9726000	Are you sure it's not Battle Chess?
9726000	9731000	I like the idea that it's Hex. So go check that one out too.
9731000	9734000	Maybe they didn't do Hex 2, Electric Boogaloo?
9734000	9744000	I don't know if you have seen Dungeon Busters message on chat. He said it could be Master of Monsters, and there's the YouTube link.
9744000	9750000	And it looks kind of like what Dr. Noir talked about, so maybe it could be that.
9750000	9757000	Master of Monsters. Let me take a peek. You mentioned this game. I've never heard of this in my life, so let me take a look at this.
9757000	9764000	Master of Monsters. It was on the Genesis, apparently. So I'm trying to look at a clip here of what was sent.
9766000	9773000	Oh yeah, this looks like it might be a modern Archon or something, because the pieces are fighting. It is a Hex grid.
9775000	9778000	Ooh, this is a really good guess.
9778000	9781000	Oh my god, I just looked at pictures of it. This is what I was thinking of.
9781000	9782000	This is a really good guess.
9782000	9784000	No, this is exactly what I was thinking of.
9784000	9788000	Okay, I think this is right. I think Dungeon Busters is right. It's Master of Monsters.
9788000	9790000	Make sure there wasn't a Master System version.
9792000	9793000	There might have been.
9798000	9801000	Yeah, I think this was it. But yeah, there was...
9802000	9808000	Oh, I guess Spike says he's... I think he's listening, because he just texted, Master of Monsters is probably it, der.
9808000	9818000	Alright, well there you go. Alright, ActDeaf, well at least you can say you were on the line at the moment we finally figured out what that damn game is.
9818000	9823000	Good job, Dungeon Buster. You get a cookie. You know what? We will route one of Jamie's tacos your way.
9825000	9828000	We'll make her part with a taco, Dungeon Buster, and send it your way.
9828000	9831000	Alright, ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go get some more calls. Thank you so much, buddy.
9832000	9833000	Hey, thanks for having me.
9833000	9845000	Alright. Thanks as always, Kirby. ActDeaf is great, and obviously very knowledgeable when it comes to the Kirby series and all that. Always good to have him on.
9845000	9849000	But we do have another call coming in. Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9849000	9850000	This is Ra-ba-ba.
9850000	9854000	Oh my god, it's Ra-ba-ba, and I can see Ra-ba-ba-ba.
9854000	9858000	Yeah, I had to cut your feed so I didn't talk over you again.
9858000	9859000	That's alright.
9859000	9862000	Oh my god, you look like the guy that I learned Corel Painter from.
9864000	9866000	Bob Ross? No?
9866000	9867000	No.
9867000	9868000	No, not Bob Ross.
9868000	9871000	No, his name was Jeff. We just called him Jeff.
9871000	9873000	He's wearing a Game of Thrones shirt, I noticed.
9873000	9874000	Chair of Swords!
9875000	9877000	It will always be Chair of Swords to me.
9878000	9880000	I actually have two characters I like now.
9881000	9882000	Yeah?
9882000	9886000	I like Tyrion and I like Arya, but I can't wait to see more. To read more. Read more.
9886000	9892000	Look, this is not a Game of Swords of Chairs of whatever show. This is a video game show.
9892000	9893000	Hi Ra-ba-ba-ba-ba.
9893000	9896000	Ra-ba-ba-ba. I have a feeling I know what game you might be calling on tonight, but let me see.
9896000	9898000	What do I owe this phone call tonight?
9899000	9900000	Marvel Puzzle Quest?
9900000	9902000	Yep, yep. What's up?
9902000	9908000	Well, you just joined and I noticed you're playing it free and I think that's a great way to go.
9908000	9918000	I have the OLR army alpha as the first OLR army.
9918000	9919000	Uh-oh.
9919000	9920000	There we go.
9920000	9925000	Ra-ba-ba, we're getting a little bit of a lag spike, Ra-ba-ba, so you said you got the OLR army.
9925000	9937000	Yes. And it turns out that it's ten right now and it's full, but I can bump it up to twenty with some real cash.
9937000	9939000	I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
9939000	9943000	That is a big plunge, Ra-ba-ba. That is some serious commitment.
9943000	9949000	You're going to need to get in writing from several people that they'll actually try to play in order to bump it up with that.
9949000	9952000	Actually, most of the Alliance does play. You're in a good one.
9952000	9957000	Yeah, I noticed that. I saw some people were out there calling people out like,
9957000	9961000	such and such, you haven't played in like three days, you're not going to be good enough for this.
9961000	9962000	Yeah.
9962000	9963000	I'm paraphrasing.
9963000	9968000	I was hoping that wouldn't happen because I want beginner players as well as experienced players,
9968000	9975000	whoever wants to be on it, because I don't consider myself that great. I just paid some money and got some power-ups.
9975000	9981000	There you go. At least you admit. But if you like a free-to-play game enough, throw a little money at it.
9981000	9986000	I did with Path of Exile and I don't regret it at all. But Ra-ba-ba, I need tips.
9986000	9991000	So for those that are just getting into Marvel Puzzle Quest, what would you say are some tips?
9991000	9996000	Well, tips, keep your one-star characters. I know I put that in the chat, but nobody else can read it.
9996000	10005000	You need at least three one-star characters. When you start, you should use your gold to buy the two...
10005000	10010000	What are they? Black Widow and...
10010000	10011000	Hawkeye.
10011000	10012000	Hawkeye. Buy those.
10012000	10013000	The pair.
10013000	10019000	And you come with Iron Man, and those are your three basic first characters to start with.
10019000	10026000	They're really great, and you can level them up to 50 quicker than anybody else, so you gotta keep a hold of them.
10026000	10028000	Don't sell them and then have nothing.
10028000	10032000	I have to ask you, is Jessica Jones a character?
10032000	10033000	I don't know.
10033000	10035000	She's the only one I care about.
10035000	10037000	I haven't seen her in anybody's roster.
10037000	10040000	Yes, she is. I saw her. I saw Jessica Jones.
10040000	10041000	I love her.
10041000	10042000	Yes, she's in it. I'm almost positive I saw her.
10042000	10044000	Does she have the power of Stark?
10044000	10053000	I don't know, but I will say this, Robin, but I was playing through the story mode, and I got some basic hero unlock rewards, but here's the thing.
10053000	10056000	It threw me a three-star Thor level 15 as a reward.
10056000	10058000	You got the gold Thor, didn't you?
10058000	10060000	Yeah, I did.
10060000	10069000	Like, just on a whim. I beat a mission, and it's all, here's your regular unlock, and I used it, and it's like, here's a level 15 gold Thor, and I'm like, fuck yeah.
10070000	10076000	That's a really good one, because a lot of missions need Thor. The modern Thor, not the older Thor.
10076000	10082000	Yeah, it's modern Thor. Okay, not only do I have modern Thor, I somehow have classic Storm and modern Storm.
10084000	10089000	Oh, yeah, I do too. Those are easy to come by, because they show up in the later missions.
10089000	10090000	Oh, okay.
10090000	10096000	So, classic Storm is harder to get, because she's like two stars or something.
10096000	10097000	Yeah, yeah.
10097000	10103000	The only other advice I'd give right now, other than if you're playing free, save your money for slots.
10103000	10109000	You know, save your hero gold for slots, and it completely went out of my head already.
10109000	10111000	Oh, I hate being old.
10111000	10114000	That's okay. That's okay, me too.
10114000	10118000	Live makes it even worse, too.
10118000	10126000	But, Rababa, what is it that you say that keeps you playing this game, that you like so much about it that you want to throw money at it?
10126000	10132000	Well, I like, um, I love seeing all the covers, and I know that makes me kind of an art whore, but I like it.
10132000	10135000	Nothing wrong with that. There's one here in studio, too.
10135000	10142000	Yeah, and the, like, for example, Hawkeye, he has an ability that really matches his character.
10142000	10148000	He can pick a gem and turn it into a, what do they call that, a wild card?
10148000	10160000	A critical hit, I think is what they call it, and that's like him taking, basically, a perfect shot, and he can also kill out an entire row, which is fantastic.
10160000	10162000	Yes, I've used that.
10162000	10174000	Later on, you'll fight robots that kind of do sort of a fan, they break out a whole ton of your gems, and they kill you fast.
10175000	10183000	Oh, yeah, I remembered the other tip. You got five health per day, well, you have five health maximum unless you find more.
10183000	10191000	Use, if you're not trying to hold onto the extras over five, just use your five every day, because you'll get them back by the next day.
10191000	10192000	Well, that's good to know.
10192000	10197000	Yeah, they recharge every 35 minutes, I think.
10197000	10199000	Wow.
10199000	10204000	You can play a lot for free. That's my biggest push.
10204000	10209000	Marvel Puzzle Quest is on Steam, and it's also on iPad, and all that good stuff.
10209000	10211000	Is it on iPad?
10211000	10212000	Don't.
10212000	10214000	Oh, yeah, I'm playing on the phone. What am I talking about?
10214000	10218000	Yeah, if you can play it on the phone, you can play it on the iPad, too. There you go.
10218000	10222000	I knocked one of my characters off the Alliance just for you, because I was double dipping.
10222000	10229000	Well, I appreciate it making way for me. I hope I will contribute and not get yelled at by the others, but I'm trying to check in at least once a day.
10229000	10236000	I even played some of the mission stuff today. It's not that bad, because they give you level 40 characters to help you get through some of those missions, so it's nice.
10236000	10241000	Yeah, that was daunting at first until I tried it, and then I was like, oh, well, I can do this.
10241000	10246000	Yeah, because it's a hard difficulty. I'm like, oh, that sounds scary, but then I played it, and I'm like, oh, this isn't that bad.
10247000	10254000	If you win one mission, you'll get a bonus, even if you're in the top 10,000. It's great.
10254000	10258000	Dark Soccer has suckered in. Good job. You recruited another one.
10258000	10260000	Yay, off to buy a new slot.
10260000	10265000	Alright, well, Rababa, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but take care. Always good to hear from you.
10265000	10267000	Alright, I'll talk to you later.
10267000	10268000	Alright, bye.
10268000	10269000	Bye.
10269000	10274000	Alright, let's see if we can squeeze in one more call before the night's over.
10274000	10284000	1-877-GAMO-LR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. I do have some tweets I want to get to, but Loki, I'll check on you one more time and see if you had anything.
10284000	10293000	A couple things. One, I just updated our Minecraft server so that it has a newer version on it, so it's now running 1-7-9.
10293000	10303000	I think it was like 1-7-2 before, so there should be some new features there, and it also changed all the different file formats, so I probably have to fix all of the plugins.
10303000	10305000	Why I make myself work, I don't know.
10305000	10309000	Alright, let me go to the phones because we've got another call. It is lighting up tonight, guys.
10309000	10313000	1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but we do have a call. Here it is.
10313000	10315000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10315000	10318000	It's the Residential Cosplay Convention Horonima.
10318000	10320000	Oh, God, where'd you go this time?
10320000	10324000	Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
10324000	10328000	I do not want to hear about what most folks did.
10328000	10332000	So, tell us about the con.
10332000	10338000	I didn't call to talk about the con, but I just wanted to cover a couple things real quick, and I'll be on my merry little way.
10338000	10344000	I just wanted to address something that you said on Facebook or Twitter. I don't remember where it was.
10345000	10352000	I didn't know about the whole E.T. thing, because remember, when you're at a con, it's like a three-day expedition.
10352000	10362000	You pretty much cut out from the outside world unless you have social media, and even in the hotels, cellular services and all that good, which is why I tagged you, because I didn't know.
10362000	10367000	So, I remember you said something along the lines of, that's great, where's my movie?
10367000	10373000	I want you to know that Anime Jam Session is joining forces with some other podcasts on the VOG Network.
10373000	10379000	We're going to get together a Kickstarter. We're going to raise funds for the Rob Roberts story.
10382000	10390000	Me and my cook, John, we've already decided the main cast. We're going to cast for you Leonardo DiCaprio.
10390000	10394000	Oh, okay, so he cannot win an Oscar again, sure.
10394000	10396000	But your movie will get Best Picture now.
10396000	10400000	Oh, okay, yeah, of course. It'll win all the other awards, but Leo won't get anything.
10400000	10403000	For Jamie Summers, we cast Sarah Silverman.
10406000	10408000	I like that one. That's good.
10408000	10412000	For Matt, we went with Robert Downey Jr.
10412000	10416000	I was going to say you could even do Zach Galifianakis. I mean, that's...
10416000	10420000	That's a good one. Who'd you get to play Allen? Who am I shacking up with?
10420000	10421000	Neil Patrick Harris.
10421000	10424000	Okay, that works. I like that. You liked Allen.
10424000	10427000	Hey, I want Neil Patrick Harris to play me. Screw that.
10428000	10431000	Oh, Allen says, could you get Zachary Quineau?
10432000	10434000	We probably could. I don't see why not.
10434000	10439000	All right, all right. Oh, Neil Patrick Harris just got fired from the Rob Roberts story.
10439000	10442000	Who does that? Who fires Neil Patrick Harris?
10443000	10444000	I would just love...
10444000	10445000	Apparently, Allen does.
10445000	10448000	I'd just love to play laser tag with that guy. I mean, that would be fun.
10448000	10450000	It would be fun. Oh, my gosh.
10450000	10453000	Assuming that he's... He probably doesn't like his character, but...
10453000	10456000	What happens in the Rob Roberts story?
10456000	10463000	It's a story of triumph and coming over as a young little boy who sees who he is
10463000	10469000	and he goes on to start a podcast which soon becomes like the biggest thing in the whole wide world.
10469000	10472000	You end up dying a multi-millionaire, something like that.
10474000	10480000	Yeah, you're kind of sort of like the... I would say like the gay equivalent to Warren Buffet, you know?
10481000	10483000	Rama, who would play you?
10484000	10486000	Who else? Samuel L. Jackson.
10489000	10492000	And if you listen to my podcast enough, my rant is quite understandable.
10492000	10498000	I just want to see Samuel L. Jackson as black Luigi. Like, the movie would make millions on that alone.
10507000	10508000	I'm a Luigi, motherfucker!
10509000	10510000	Exactly!
10514000	10519000	Say Mamma Mia! Say Mamma Mia! One more goddamn time!
10524000	10529000	I love it. This is my seal of approval. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I have a really important question.
10530000	10532000	Who plays Travis Donovan?
10533000	10535000	I was thinking Michael J. Fox.
10535000	10536000	Michael J. Fox.
10538000	10543000	I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. But can we get Wilford Brimley, the diabetes guy?
10545000	10547000	Sure. Who would he play, though?
10548000	10549000	Travis.
10550000	10553000	Oh, God. Well, they're both crotchety little... Oh, wait, I shouldn't be playing that.
10554000	10555000	Whoops. Sorry.
10558000	10560000	I'm Queen Amidala.
10560000	10567000	And right now, somewhere in clean Texas, Travis's hair flips to the other side. He goes, I sense a disturbance in the force.
10570000	10573000	Oh, this has been such a good conversation, Rama. Thank you so much.
10574000	10575000	I just realized my mic was off.
10576000	10577000	Oh, that's alright. Alright.
10578000	10579000	Not alright!
10583000	10585000	Oh, Rama, I love you. Thank you for the laughs, my friend.
10586000	10587000	You're welcome.
10588000	10589000	Was there anything else you want to talk about tonight real quick?
10590000	10593000	I have something for the VOG Network.
10594000	10595000	Was it Zeke Icon?
10596000	10601000	They had a well-known legendary voice actor at the convention.
10602000	10606000	Now, let me ask you this. Do you remember watching the Disney Afternoon as a child?
10610000	10611000	Yeah. Sometimes.
10612000	10616000	Alright, then I'm going to play this voice clip. Let's see if you know it. Here we go.
10617000	10624000	Hi, this is Jim Cummings, and you are participating with the voice of Geeks Network, VOG.com.
10625000	10627000	Or is it VOGnetwork.com?
10628000	10629000	Carry on.
10630000	10631000	I don't know what I'm doing.
10632000	10633000	Cool. I don't know what I'm doing.
10634000	10637000	Oh, my God, that's great. No, I don't recognize the voice. Who was that?
10638000	10640000	Jim Cummings, known as Winnie the Pooh.
10641000	10642000	Oh!
10643000	10645000	Oh, my God. No, I don't recognize the name.
10646000	10647000	Darkwing Duck. Hello, Rob.
10648000	10652000	He was also Pete from Goof Troop, and he also did various voices in Kingdom Hearts.
10653000	10654000	Oh, wow.
10655000	10656000	Bonkers the Bobcat.
10657000	10658000	That's great.
10659000	10660000	And I think he was also one of the Gummy Bears as well.
10661000	10662000	I can't believe you got that. That's amazing.
10663000	10664000	I'm sure he was.
10665000	10666000	Awesome. Awesome.
10667000	10671000	Alright, Rama. Well, we've got to wrap things up, but before I let you go, who's playing Bobby Black Wolf?
10673000	10674000	Jack Black.
10674000	10675000	Jack Black. Alright. I like that.
10676000	10679000	You know what would also be a good candidate would be Bill O'Reilly, because he's always wrong.
10680000	10681000	No. No.
10681000	10682000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
10683000	10685000	No. No. I personally have an issue with Bill O'Reilly.
10686000	10688000	Alright. No. No, I'm kidding. We love Bobby, but I got to give him shit once in a while.
10689000	10690000	Alright, take care, buddy.
10691000	10692000	Alright, take care, bro.
10692000	10693000	Alright, bye.
10693000	10694000	Bye.
10695000	10696000	I love it.
10696000	10701000	Alright, if you didn't get through tonight, I'm very sorry, but we are going to wrap things up, because we're well after 9 o'clock here on the West Coast.
10701000	10708000	So, send us an email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send an email for us to read in a future week.
10709000	10716000	I want to see if I can get to the tweets real fast here, because, of course, you can tweet us at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10717000	10721000	And I did see some things come in, so I'm trying to get those up real quick.
10722000	10729000	And, let's see. Captain Spike must be listening, because he says, because of O-L-R, I am downloading Marvel Puzzle Quest for PC right now.
10729000	10736000	Thanks, Rob. I was going to actually say, you want to thank Rababa, because he got me into it, now he's got Jamie, and now Captain Spike.
10737000	10744000	Tigerclaw sends us a few tweets. Mario Kart 8 best buy pre-order comes with a $10 coupon for real gas.
10745000	10751000	Well, we can all use that. That's for damn sure. So, thank you. That's a great tie-in. I love that.
10752000	10759000	And, also, apparently, Microsoft's Siri response, Cortana, doesn't talk to kids.
10761000	10762000	So, just, Cortana's...
10763000	10764000	Cortana's stupid.
10765000	10768000	Well, it might be. If it's an option that can be turned on or off...
10769000	10776000	Yeah, I hope it's like a parental feature and not just, oh, well, your voice sounds like a kid, because that's going to be all sorts of fucked up, you know.
10777000	10785000	They're tying it into the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, which ensures that children under the age of 13 can't share information online.
10786000	10792000	So, why would a search thing share information online? Microsoft?
10793000	10800000	I don't know. Alright. That is about going to wrap us up for another O-L-R, because you said you didn't have any...
10801000	10805000	Resident Evil 6 is getting, well, they're making a sixth Resident Evil movie.
10806000	10808000	Oh, hooray! Is it going to star Mila Jovovich again?
10809000	10810000	Is it going to be directed by her husband?
10811000	10812000	Yeah.
10813000	10814000	Well, hey, those movies still make money.
10815000	10822000	I've been catching up, see, that's the thing, with Danny, I've done some out of Archer episodes now, I've been catching up on movies I've missed at the theaters.
10823000	10837000	Not really good movies, but in some older movies. I watched The Fifth Element the other day, and then I also watched G.I. Joe, the second G.I. Joe movie, because I wanted to see the first one.
10838000	10841000	I'm glad I didn't go to the theater to see the second one, because it wasn't very good.
10842000	10846000	Oh, the remake of Red Dawn, which I actually liked. That was pretty cool.
10847000	10861000	But, yeah, so I'm trying to catch up stuff. Someone just mentioned Code Monkeys earlier in the show, and I think that's on Netflix, so I kind of want to binge on that, because I watched a little bit when it was on G4, but I never really saw the whole series, and it was pretty funny.
10862000	10863000	Alright.
10864000	10869000	Alright, well, we are running a little long tonight, so we do want to go ahead and wrap things up and get on out of here for the night.
10869000	10876000	Thank you guys, as always, for listening to the show and for supporting independent radio. If you like what you heard here, please tell a friend or five about the show. Help us spread the word.
10877000	10886000	A nice review on iTunes or on Stitcher goes a very long way. Thank you guys all for your support. I don't know if you guys know, but we're actually right now a top 20 games and hobbies show.
10887000	10894000	That means not just video games, but all games and hobbies. We're a top 20 show on Stitcher. Can you believe that? That's awesome, and that's all because of you guys and helping to spread the word about the show.
10894000	10899000	So appreciate you guys. So that's all we ask. We don't ask for your money or anything, although Jamie wouldn't mind a gift card or two.
10900000	10905000	Anyhow, that is going to wrap it up for tonight, but before we get on out of here, let's get everybody's final thought tonight.
10906000	10912000	My final thought for tonight will be, Alan's home early and he's making dinner. Yay, I'm so lucky. That's my final thought.
10913000	10914000	What a good house husband.
10915000	10919000	He's doing great. He's working too, so he's just a great guy.
10920000	10921000	Yeah.
10921000	10924000	Alright, Dark Soccer, since you have your mic up, what's your final thought tonight?
10925000	10931000	I finally lost internet completely, even in chat, so to everybody that I have been chatting with, oops.
10932000	10933000	Oops.
10934000	10935000	And I did a special fortune cookie.
10936000	10941000	We'll see what we can do about the router thing because I do have that extra thing that Jason sent and so we might put a relay in the house somewhere that will help.
10942000	10943000	So we'll see if it'll help.
10944000	10947000	Lastly, but not leastly, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10948000	10960000	Hopefully I get some more coding this week done and hopefully something that actually I can show being done, although I don't think, it might work on the GUI at some point soon.
10961000	10962000	I don't know. We'll see.
10963000	10964000	Alright.
10965000	10969000	Coding, coding, coding. Maybe we'll play a game. I do need to finish South Park and I know it's a short game, so maybe I'll do that.
10969000	10976000	Alright. Well, here's to 550 episodes, everybody, and we'll see you for 550 more.
10977000	10979000	See you next week, everybody. Have a great night.
10999000	11001000	See you next week.
11029000	11031000	See you next time.
