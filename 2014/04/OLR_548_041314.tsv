7000	14000	Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	PAX East has wrapped up and the gaming news we've been yearning for has arrived.
17000	19000	Kicking off this week was a special Nintendo Direct.
19000	23000	PAX brought us information on updates to Titanfall, the new Borderlands, and a new title from Harmonix.
23000	27000	Too much to cover in a mere 8 seconds, so stay tuned for the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio here on April the 13th, 2014 with episode 548 of our show.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
51000	54000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	56000	How are you, DarkSakura?
56000	60000	My stomach's a little upset because I ate really rich broth.
60000	62000	Really rich broth.
62000	66000	Maybe it was like really upset at something that happened over the weekend or who knows.
66000	72000	Actually, I gotta say this and I hope you do feel better because DarkSakura, y'all, was a real rock star for me yesterday.
72000	79000	We went to IKEA because I needed some furniture and you know that every time you go to IKEA, it's IRL Tetris.
79000	83000	Like it's IRL Tetris trying to load those boxes in your compact car.
84000	89000	Right? I'm gonna blast that on speakers driving through the parking lot of IKEA.
89000	94000	But we did it. We got that crap in my car. It was the first time I ever had to fold down the backseat ever.
94000	98000	Which, you know, it wasn't that hard, but it's just like one of those, wow, I did something new today.
98000	100000	That's the first time I squatted a shelf.
100000	106000	Right? And you lifted like a 54-pound shelf. I'm like, let me help, let me help. You're like, no, I am woman, hear me roar.
106000	107000	And you picked up that.
107000	109000	What was it, like 57 pounds or something like that?
109000	112000	Yeah, it was 57 pounds. That's the new little shelf cart thing we have in the living room.
112000	119000	It really wasn't that bad though, because I've gotten, where I squat, what's my squats now, at 80?
119000	128000	So, it wasn't that bad, but I realized that when I could lift 60, 70 over my head, that I was not squatting enough.
128000	131000	Well, I would not have been able to do that by myself, so I appreciate the company yesterday.
131000	135000	And of course, go into our chat room over at live.vogganetwork.com
135000	138000	because we do tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
138000	143000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vogganetwork.com.
143000	144000	Yes, we do.
144000	149000	And in our chat room, we have Brad from Pod Culture saying, IKEA meatballs tasty.
149000	150000	That is their slogan.
150000	153000	Hello, Tech Master Loki, how are you?
153000	154000	Fine.
154000	159000	We can't get through a conversation about IKEA, especially when it comes to food, without hearing from Tech Master Loki. How have you been?
159000	160000	I've been okay.
160000	162000	When was the last time you had some IKEA food?
162000	163000	I've never had any IKEA food.
163000	164000	What?
164000	165000	I've never been to IKEA.
165000	170000	What? I called the wrong person yesterday. No offense, Dark Soccer, but if he's never been.
170000	173000	I needed those shelves.
173000	174000	That's true.
174000	179000	I needed those drawers and my soap dispenser that I got.
179000	185000	Well, Loki, as I'm filling up this house with things that my apartment was not big enough for, I'm sure there will be something else.
185000	191000	So next time I need to go to IKEA, I'm going to call you so you can have some meatballs and check out the store.
191000	196000	Which, why aren't they paying us? I'm just totally pimping the shit out of that store right now.
196000	201000	For the record, I was singing the song as we went through the roundabout, as most of the chat room is right now.
201000	205000	I noticed, yeah, having 978 is singing the Jonathan Coulton IKEA song in chat right now.
205000	207000	Well, the Meatballs Tasty line is also from that song.
207000	209000	Ah, there you go. There you go.
209000	212000	Alright, Loki, what's new with you quickly?
212000	215000	I got a second week of watching the baby.
215000	216000	Yeah?
216000	217000	Good times?
217000	218000	Tiring.
218000	219000	Tiring?
219000	220000	Yeah.
221000	225000	Are you able to get the baby to drink now, okay, and feeding?
225000	227000	I had to syringe feed him.
227000	228000	Oh.
228000	229000	That's annoying.
229000	230000	Yikes.
230000	231000	He's lazy.
231000	232000	Aw, poor guy.
232000	234000	Hopefully in a couple months.
234000	236000	You should get one of those boob attachment things.
236000	239000	That's what I told him last week, to wear the fake boobs.
239000	242000	It doesn't matter what you do. You could do all sorts of tricks with this baby.
242000	243000	It's just not going to matter.
243000	244000	It's because he's smarter than the average baby.
244000	246000	He's smarter. Yeah, he's a smart baby.
246000	249000	Alright, well, we are going to shift gears a little bit here.
249000	253000	We are going to go right into some gaming news here, and right at the top of the show,
253000	260000	I know PAX East is on a lot of people's minds because, you know, it happened this weekend.
260000	263000	I bet a lot of you guys might be tuning into the show tonight live.
263000	266000	We're probably there, or if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,
266000	270000	you probably missed the live show because, you know, you were there at PAX East.
270000	274000	But us being all the way here on the West Coast, who didn't get to make it out to PAX East,
274000	277000	we wanted to hear about how the show went this year.
277000	280000	So for our kickoff topic tonight, I want to bring on to the show tonight.
280000	286000	Live, joining us via the Skype line from Anime Jam Session, the one and only DJ Rama S is here.
286000	288000	Hey, what's going on, Rob?
288000	290000	Hey, not much. How you doing, Rama?
290000	293000	Good, good. But what is this about PAX East?
293000	295000	We're coming back from IkeaCon.
295000	299000	There's a crap load of furniture in the back, and I'm holding a table with one hand.
299000	302000	If I'm not careful, it's going to take my head off.
302000	304000	Don't forget the 50 packs of Allen wrenches.
304000	308000	Did you really go by Ikea on your way back? That's a lie.
308000	311000	Twice.
311000	315000	Are you by yourself, or you sound like you're in a car full of people?
315000	317000	I am in a car full of people.
317000	322000	Mako John here is driving the mobile studio, and behind me is Zaku.
322000	327000	Hey, guys. Well, hi to the whole crew in the car. How you guys doing?
327000	328000	Hi, hi.
328000	329000	Hello, hello.
329000	336000	So PAX East, you guys are on your way back. In one word, Rama, how is PAX East?
336000	338000	Fucking phenomenal.
338000	340000	That's two words. You cheated.
340000	343000	It's hyphenated. I say it passes.
343000	347000	Walk us through your weekend at the con a little bit. How did things go?
347000	354000	You got there, and how did Friday go, and so forth. Walk us through your weekend.
354000	358000	Rama, you still there?
358000	360000	Yeah, we're here.
360000	363000	It might have been a dead zone as we're on 95 going back.
363000	370000	That's okay. Live radio, folks, and we are doing this from a car all the way to our little studio in Sacramento.
370000	377000	So I don't know if you heard the question, Rama, but Rama, I just wanted you to kind of walk us through your weekend a little bit.
377000	386000	Okay. It was really fun. The expo hall was a lot more packed.
386000	397000	It was a little bit harder to get swag this year. Not as much cosplay, but very popular with Mario Brothers and Bioshock for obvious reasons.
397000	399000	Right.
399000	406000	The parties were just freaking phenomenal. Seeing the Crystal Method perform live was just worth it for me.
406000	411000	Oh, I had no idea they were headlining the con. They were the big music guests there?
411000	413000	No, for the after party.
413000	418000	Oh, okay. So there was something else going on in Boston at the same time.
418000	428000	Yeah, nowadays, now what they're doing is, Friday nights and Saturday nights, they're having the Nvidia after party or the IGN after party,
428000	436000	or Enter Game Company here, World Bar Crawl 2014, get in when you fit in, you know.
436000	442000	Got it. So they don't do the official concerts anymore. It's more like go to all these cool after parties and get out of parties.
442000	447000	They still do it, but yeah.
447000	451000	I'm having a hard time hearing Zaku. I don't know what he's saying.
451000	460000	I said, it was, got it? I think the court's in short.
460000	462000	Live from the mobile studio, folks.
462000	463000	Alright, can you hear me now?
463000	464000	Yeah, barely.
465000	472000	Alright. I actually went to that Nvidia party, but I guess the whole crux of it is that compared to last year,
472000	478000	there's been a slight uptick in the number of after parties surrounding the con.
478000	485000	Some of which you have to travel outside of the convention center area, you know, to actually reach.
485000	490000	Some of which you have to like have it out. But yeah, I actually went to the Nvidia after party on Friday.
490000	495000	Aside from playing a bit of Titanfall, we were getting like, we only got up to like two free drinks,
495000	500000	and then they threw in an extra one when they moved the party up to the venue above the party.
500000	505000	Well, I think the best part about any convention or the after party is, I mean, that even extends to E3,
505000	511000	which technically isn't a convention. It's a trade show. But y'all have heard about the legendary parties at E3.
511000	515000	And heck, I think I was just talking on the Bobby Blackwell show before we were live.
515000	520000	I was talking about Gamer X and how some of the parties at that were the highlight of the show.
520000	528000	So, I mean, I'm not surprised at all to hear that the after parties in some ways stole the convention in a way.
528000	535000	Yeah. I mean, that's still typical, but you also have like, you know, a lot of people, from what I've been hearing,
535000	542000	a lot of people were saying that Bethesda's Wolfenstein party was pretty much the hit just on the terms of swag
542000	551000	and the fact that it was a 1960s theme that plays into the new version of Wolfenstein that they're releasing, the new order.
551000	559000	So people were encouraged to actually dress up in 1960s attire, even though that wasn't a requirement.
559000	571000	But from what I was gauging on social media and all other sources, people were pretty much saying that that was the best party of the weekend.
571000	577000	Not to throw cold water on the ACES PC Gamer party, but in terms of what you got for just showing up,
577000	583000	those folks were able to get a lot more swag than the PC Gamer ones, unfortunately.
583000	590000	Swag has been pretty much relegated to these after parties. If you actually got in and managed to get the swag, then...
590000	592000	That's really no different from E3.
592000	594000	Otherwise, the call center...
594000	599000	The whole swag thing is really no different from E3 or some of the other conventions that are out there,
599000	603000	because I know you got to go to the after parties if that's stuff you're looking for.
603000	610000	They give away these big bags, but there's nothing to fill them with, which I don't know if you want to blame the economy or cost saving or what have you.
610000	615000	And I noticed in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, SSGO and under Matt, who I know is also at PAX East,
615000	619000	agrees that swag was tough to acquire, at least for me. So, you know, it is what it is.
619000	624000	But tell us about some of the things on the convention floor over at PAX East that you guys were able to get...
624000	630000	Well, I mean, for my Nvidia swag bag, I managed to get at least three USB drives.
630000	633000	Oh, well, that's... Alright, hey, that's pretty awesome.
633000	636000	Where's mine? No, I'm just kidding. Alright, hey.
636000	639000	Rob. What? Hello?
639000	644000	Rob, I'll say this. This is what you should call... We're right here, bro.
644000	651000	PAX East should have been called this. PAX East 2014. The return of the indie motherfucker.
652000	657000	The most hilarious thing about that is that Rama got cut off as he was saying that,
657000	664000	but I imagine there's a huge delay thanks to the fact that we're beaming onto highway 95 somewhere from space.
664000	669000	So this is the year of the indie? The return of the indie?
669000	676000	The return of the indie motherfuckers. It was 85-90% indie development all over the place.
676000	682000	Yes, you did have Microsoft with the Xbox One sitting out there.
682000	687000	Ubisoft was there. 2K was there. Bethesda was there.
687000	690000	But there was a lot more independent publishers and developers,
690000	696000	and pretty much the biggest indie developer there I would say would have to be Riot Games with League of Legends.
696000	700000	And believe you me, you kind of want to keep your distance from that booth.
701000	703000	League of Legends fans are crazy.
703000	707000	Because it was getting to where they were fighting for swag, and I ain't fighting for swag.
707000	711000	Yeah, I bet. I bet. And Blizzard, well Blizzard's not really indie,
711000	715000	but I know Blizzard had a big weight for a lot of things they were giving away.
715000	720000	They were giving away beta tests for Warlords of Draenor, which a ton of people that are huge into Warcraft,
720000	723000	and when you're super into one game like that, as a lot of League players are,
723000	727000	and as a lot of Warcraft players are, I mean you will cut a bitch for swag.
727000	732000	I remember when we were super into DDR, I got yelled at by some girl,
732000	736000	because I caught a t-shirt that she wanted, and she got nasty with me,
736000	739000	and no, I didn't give her the shirt, I kept it for myself.
739000	743000	If you're going to act like that, hmm. Yeah, I got your shirt. Anyway.
743000	746000	No, no, no. You got your shirt.
746000	750000	That's right. My shirt. Anyway. I still wear that shirt, by the way.
750000	753000	Beatmania, yo, with my Beatmania shirt. Anyway, okay.
754000	758000	Rama, what were some of the games you actually got your hands on, like some things you actually got to play?
758000	762000	Well, before I get into that, the funny thing that you mentioned is DDR.
762000	768000	I don't remember the full title of the game, it was called The Order of Something.
768000	771000	The Order of the Necromancer.
771000	775000	I think you're talking about the Crypt of the Necromancer.
775000	777000	The Crypt of the Necromancer.
777000	783000	Keyboard, hmm? You played with controller, keyboard, and dance pads.
784000	791000	That sounds like fun. What is the game? Is it just a music game, or is it an adventure, or what?
791000	795000	It's an adventure, top-down, gauntlet-style crawler.
796000	799000	That sounds kind of awesome, actually. Did you enjoy it?
799000	803000	Yeah. I think the line was a little bit too long for me to enjoy it.
803000	812000	But, they had this one game there that's coming out, Steam, at PlayStation 4, which I may have to purchase.
812000	820000	It is a, I think it's called Gravenger Z. I have the pin somewhere in my bag.
820000	827000	But, I know Jamie will enjoy this, because it is an old-school anime-style shooter.
827000	835000	With the 70s-style animation, the original old-school, late 80s arcade bootloader.
835000	837000	It's a Galaxie.
837000	841000	The eye-catches says we'll be right back between every game level and so forth.
842000	845000	That sounds kind of awesome, actually. That sounds amazing.
845000	852000	Yes, it was. There were a lot of mobile games. We were busy playing.
852000	859000	Me and Mark were busy playing this game called Fairway Solitaire Golf, because we were trying to win $1,000 on Xbox One.
859000	866000	Yeah, they were having a tournament. The top three players every day of the convention.
866000	875000	First player got $1,000, second player got an Xbox One, and third player got an iPad.
875000	876000	Yes.
876000	880000	So, everybody was playing that just to try and get the prizes.
880000	884000	That probably would be $2,000.
884000	885000	Showing up.
885000	886000	Pay for my trip.
886000	887000	$1,000.
887000	889000	$1,000 cash.
889000	890000	Yes.
890000	891000	Wow.
891000	898000	Well, I'm assuming you didn't win, or you'd be talking to us from an airplane right now.
898000	907000	No, you were here, and I'm on a boat by the Lonely Island. Yeah, we decided to take a yacht back to the studio.
907000	914000	All right. Rama, before we let you go, what was the highlight of the whole damn thing for you guys?
915000	916000	Oh.
916000	919000	I'm going to let the others talk, because I've got to think about that one.
919000	928000	All right. I mean, I guess if you ... Well, I guess mostly the highlights were just like whatever they announced.
928000	937000	Let's see. NVIDIA basically announced Portal for the Shield, meaning that Valve for the first time is targeting Android.
937000	938000	Right.
938000	942000	That came out of left field essentially during the panel.
942000	948000	The head of one of the folks, execs from NVIDIA, was hosting it.
948000	955000	He had developers play Portal on the Shield, and the thing is the PC wasn't even streaming it.
955000	957000	Wasn't that on the show last week?
957000	958000	Yeah, they announced it last week.
958000	963000	They did announce it, but maybe this is the first time that you really see them embracing it in public.
963000	965000	Yeah, they were actually showcasing it, though.
965000	967000	Okay, yeah. That's cool.
967000	970000	So far it looks pretty good for an Android Portal.
970000	971000	All right.
971000	974000	It's almost like the original one. The second one is like harmonics.
974000	979000	It actually woke up pretty early just to get to the first panel of the day, which was theirs.
979000	988000	They announced Record Run, which is the first tablet game being released by them right now.
988000	998000	It's kind of like audio surf, but not really in the same artistic style, but in the actual mechanics,
998000	1007000	where your actual iPads or iOS's library essentially drives the actual notes.
1007000	1016000	It's essentially a free-to-play game, where you basically have a certain number of songs you can add into your collection in the slots.
1016000	1029000	And the more you play it, the more you get what's called backstage passes, which is essentially the currency that you use within the game to spend it on more music slots to add more tracks from your library.
1029000	1037000	And from what they were telling me, they were this close during the keynote to announcing another title,
1037000	1042000	but at the last minute they couldn't get clearance from one of the legal hurdles that was in the way.
1043000	1051000	So they had a hold off on that, and they might announce something later on, hopefully by E3.
1051000	1059000	Well, I know we'll have more information on the harmonics game coming up a little later in the show and some of these other big announcements that I know came out of PAX East.
1059000	1064000	But yeah, getting to be there for some brand new information I'm sure is a highlight.
1064000	1071000	It's always kind of cool to be there in the room when a big bombshell is dropped, like going to a big press conference or something like that. That's awesome.
1072000	1075000	Rama, Mako-chan, what about you guys? What was the highlight?
1075000	1078000	Alright, here you go Mako.
1078000	1083000	I was actually playing two different games on the floor and absolutely loved them.
1083000	1089000	One of them, they were there last year, it's called Cupcakes and Critters.
1089000	1090000	I saw that.
1090000	1098000	And this year they had, the game itself was more developed and they were really trying to pimp it out.
1098000	1111000	And basically you're trying to save a cupcake from a bunch of roaches, but it's mind-numbing and you just sit there and kill all of these bugs.
1111000	1118000	But when you hit the cupcake, it actually smiles and laughs, so I thought that was hilarious.
1118000	1126000	The other game is going to be out shortly for 3DS, PS4, and what was the other one?
1126000	1127000	Vita.
1127000	1128000	Vita.
1128000	1129000	Vita.
1129000	1131000	It's called Blast'em Bunnies.
1131000	1138000	It's actually a shooter where you're killing really cute bunnies with carrots and pumpkins.
1138000	1139000	Onions.
1139000	1140000	Onions.
1140000	1141000	Turnips.
1141000	1150000	Everything is like motion control, so with the controller you have to actually turn the controller left and right to aim or up and down.
1150000	1153000	So it was actually really, really fun.
1153000	1155000	Huh, that sounds neat.
1158000	1160000	Alright, Rob, I guess we're to you.
1160000	1163000	Last but not least, what's your big highlight?
1163000	1165000	I got three.
1165000	1167000	Number one, number three.
1167000	1178000	As you know, I'm a hardware guy, so I went over to the Cooler Master booth and they had a contest for the typing of the dead on their mechanical keyboards.
1178000	1179000	It was fun.
1179000	1183000	I've come to the determination that I need a mechanical keyboard.
1183000	1186000	Me too, I came to that determination some time ago.
1186000	1187000	Absolutely.
1192000	1193000	Number two.
1193000	1196000	Oh crap, I can't believe I forgot that.
1196000	1198000	Anyway, if I remember I'll come back to it.
1198000	1200000	But this was my highlight.
1200000	1201000	No, no, now I remember number two.
1201000	1211000	Number two was playing Skullgirls through Steam on a Windows Surface tablet.
1211000	1213000	Huh.
1213000	1219000	That blew my mind because I didn't think a tablet like that was that powerful.
1219000	1225000	Sitting there, playing it, they had the hub connected to it, two controllers, and I'm playing through the game.
1225000	1227000	No lag, no slow down, no nothing.
1227000	1229000	I was greatly impressed.
1229000	1237000	I mean, I won't go out and get a Surface tablet, but I am impressed at the power behind this little device.
1237000	1240000	Okay.
1240000	1242000	And my number one.
1242000	1243000	Uh huh.
1243000	1246000	This is the one thing I actually got online for.
1246000	1249000	Took me about 30, 35 minutes to get into it.
1249000	1253000	I got in, I got strapped down into an Oculus Rift.
1253000	1255000	Oh, Bobby's smiling somewhere.
1255000	1258000	Tell us about your Oculus Rift experience.
1258000	1260000	I want one.
1260000	1264000	Even though Zuckerberg owns it now?
1264000	1266000	I mean, it's okay.
1266000	1273000	Granted that the front of the device is blue and has a giant Facebook logo on it, you'll get used to it.
1273000	1276000	You'll learn to like them anyway, I'm sure.
1276000	1279000	What was the Oculus experience like for you?
1279000	1281000	What did you get to play?
1281000	1290000	It was a game called Couch Night, where it was two stick video type nights and you were just fighting each other on a table.
1290000	1298000	But let me tell you, they sat me down in the chair and they put the headset on and they told me to look around to calibrate it.
1298000	1301000	I look around, I'm having a mini heart attack.
1301000	1306000	For a split second this was actual reality.
1306000	1309000	I'm like, this is what I'm looking at.
1309000	1311000	I'm sitting in a chair, not on a couch.
1311000	1313000	You plugged into the Matrix.
1313000	1319000	Yes. And the fact of the matter is that the goggles fits on top of my glasses.
1319000	1321000	And it works even better for me.
1321000	1326000	Nice. So now you're sold on the Oculus Rift after that, huh?
1326000	1328000	Yes.
1328000	1330000	Good times. Good times.
1330000	1335000	Well, Rama, Meika Chan, and Zaku, thank you guys for talking to us from the car on the way home.
1335000	1336000	Really appreciate it.
1336000	1339000	I gotta let you guys go so we can get on with the show.
1339000	1344000	But everybody listen to Anime Jam Session on Tuesday because I know at least Rama and Meika Chan will be there.
1344000	1347000	Probably, you gotta talk about PAX East, even though it's not anime.
1347000	1349000	We will. It's a PAX East show.
1349000	1353000	You gotta. You gotta talk a little more about some of that cosplay and some of the other sights and sounds.
1353000	1357000	Any quick last words before, any parting shots before we go?
1358000	1367000	Um. Sucks to be EA. Sucks to be Sony. They should have been there. They missed out.
1367000	1373000	But you know what? Let it be. I want more PAX. I want more indie gamers. I want more fun with that.
1373000	1379000	There you go. You can still have fun with nothing but indies. You're 85% indies. That's absolutely true.
1379000	1382000	Alright, buddy. Have a safe drive back. Don't do anything crazy.
1382000	1383000	Alright.
1383000	1384000	We won't.
1384000	1385000	Alright, bye.
1385000	1386000	Bye.
1386000	1389000	Alright, live interview from a moving vehicle.
1389000	1392000	How is that for the future, you guys? Internet radio.
1392000	1395000	Thank you guys for putting up with some of those little tech hiccups there.
1395000	1398000	But, you know, such is the beauty of live radio.
1398000	1411000	Anyhow, so yes, again, Rama and Meika Chan will be on Anime Jam Session, which you can hear at the voicegeeksnetwork of voggenetwork.com, Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
1412000	1421000	Alright, we're going to get on with our own show here. We have some news, including some of the other things that were announced at PAX East, amongst other gaming news that happened in the industry this week.
1421000	1425000	But before we get there, we always like to start off with, how was your gaming week?
1425000	1433000	To establish a little bit of a frame of reference for where our heads are at with the gaming industry this week, especially since we weren't at PAX East.
1433000	1439000	We usually start with DarkSakura, but she stepped away for just a moment, so we're going to go ahead and start with Loki tonight. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1439000	1446000	I didn't play very much. I only played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and just, you know, our multiplayer games.
1446000	1449000	And I'm awesome.
1449000	1454000	So, still really enjoying that.
1454000	1461000	I don't know. I played a little bit of a Unity game that someone had made called Garbage Day.
1461000	1470000	It's just kind of a silly, you know, not really a grand theft auto, it's like a sandbox game where you just, there's really no point to it yet, you just murder people.
1470000	1473000	But it sounds like a point to me!
1473000	1480000	No, here's the thing though. It's like, the game is so basic right now, there's hardly anything to it, but...
1480000	1481000	But there is murder!
1481000	1485000	But the music that they have in the background is hilarious. It's just very, like, happy...
1485000	1486000	What game is this again?
1486000	1487000	It's called Garbage Day.
1487000	1488000	Garbage Day.
1488000	1496000	It's like something some guy is making on, like, the Unity Reddit forum thing, so I got to check that out. That was kind of funny.
1496000	1498000	No Goat Simulator stories for this week?
1498000	1500000	I don't think I played that this week, actually.
1500000	1501000	What?
1501000	1508000	I haven't had a lot of time to play games, because a certain baby isn't taking naps when he's supposed to be.
1508000	1510000	Oh, right, you gotta be a dad and all that, geez.
1510000	1515000	I know, he's totally cutting into my game time. I mean, seriously.
1515000	1518000	You need baby mamas, that way mama will fix it.
1520000	1527000	But, yeah, I'm hoping to play some more stuff. I do want to get back into South Park and finish that.
1527000	1531000	I know it's not a very long game, so I want to do that.
1531000	1544000	I also have Bridge Constructor, which I got from the last Humble Bundle, and the physics in that game are absolutely fucking terrible, so that I want to play.
1544000	1546000	You like terrible physics, though.
1546000	1549000	I love it, it's hilarious. It's hilarious to see that kind of stuff happen.
1549000	1551000	Who needs the theory of gravity?
1551000	1557000	Well, it's just, like, it just doesn't work quite right. There's something off, is what's the best part about it.
1557000	1561000	I played a few video games like that. Something's just not right with the physics.
1561000	1567000	That's about it. I was hoping to pick up Titanfall in 360 this week, but I'm kind of glad I didn't, because I wouldn't have had any chance to play it.
1567000	1576000	Maybe later on, but looking forward to Wolfenstein and Watch Dogs, because they'll be the next two I want to try.
1576000	1582000	Alright, sounds good. Dark Soccer is back. She's got coffee. She's ready to go. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1582000	1584000	It was minimal.
1584000	1585000	Minimal?
1585000	1596000	Yeah. I played Animal Crossing and that's about it. Although, I did pick up a game today that I will be discussing later in the show on iOS.
1596000	1606000	And I really think all I played was Animal Crossing this week. It's just been really kind of a busy week for me at work and weirdness.
1606000	1610000	That's pretty neat, though, that a game like Animal Crossing can hold your attention after all this time.
1610000	1614000	I'm surprised you didn't pick up the Disney game that everybody's talking about this week.
1614000	1618000	The, ah, I can't remember the name of it. It's like Disney's version of Animal Crossing.
1618000	1620000	What the hell is it, Loki? You know what I'm talking about.
1620000	1624000	It's like, uh, like Magical Kingdom or something like that.
1624000	1626000	Something like that. Yeah, yeah.
1626000	1629000	No point. I've got other games I'd rather be playing.
1629000	1630000	Alright.
1630000	1639000	But, I don't know. It was kind of nice taking a little bit of a break and just going home and I was a little sick earlier this week.
1640000	1645000	But, um, so mostly it was just going home and going to bed.
1645000	1654000	And then being, ah, going out to Pinkberry with somebody who shall remain named Rob.
1654000	1655000	Delicious.
1655000	1656000	It was.
1656000	1657000	Alright.
1657000	1659000	It was a busy week.
1659000	1660000	Alright, fair enough.
1660000	1667000	Um, my gaming week, sadly, I did play a lot this week, but it was a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about on this show for weeks.
1667000	1673000	So, sadly, I don't have really anything new to review for you guys, but I will say Final Fantasy XIV is out on the Playstation 4 officially now.
1673000	1674000	Thumbs up.
1674000	1682000	The Fat Chocobo mount for the collector's edition of the game, which you also get if you had a collector's edition for PC or Playstation 3, is amazing.
1682000	1687000	It's the Fat Chocobo, which I think started in Final Fantasy IV, but you, hmm.
1687000	1689000	I didn't know about this and I have to redeem mine then.
1689000	1692000	It's waiting for you in the in-game mail when you sign in.
1692000	1693000	Yeah, they all went out this morning.
1693000	1694000	Logging in.
1694000	1697000	So when you log in, yeah, and the mount, it's so adorable.
1697000	1705000	It's like this Fat Chocobo that you ride on the back and you have on a fishing pole a little, it's a Gishaw greens, but it looks like a cabbage.
1705000	1709000	So it's like a cabbage that hangs out in front of the Fat Chocobo's mouth, so that's what makes him run.
1709000	1713000	And then when you stop, your character, like, pulls the thing up so the Chocobo can't see it.
1713000	1715000	Like, the attention to detail is great.
1715000	1718000	And then when you jump, it's fat little legs go like this.
1718000	1720000	Fat little legs fly.
1720000	1721000	It's so cute.
1721000	1726000	I'll probably be writing that instead of my quarrel. Although I like my quarrel.
1726000	1730000	So I've been playing that a little bit on PlayStation 4, a little bit on PC.
1730000	1740000	I'm finding that the mouse sensitivity on PlayStation 4 and just the sensation of playing on my larger TV as opposed to my not-so-large monitor is really throwing me.
1740000	1742000	Like, it's really throwing me for a loop.
1742000	1752000	So I have a hard time sometimes on the PlayStation, but it's gorgeous and the frames, I mean, it's just so smooth compared to my PC because I have kind of an older PC.
1752000	1758000	But that's one of the things I'm hoping to upgrade this week because some things, we got some good news.
1758000	1764000	Alan and I got some good news in the past week, so I'm hoping that I'm going to finally be able to get that new computer I've been wanting for like two years.
1764000	1765000	So that'll be good.
1765000	1768000	I was doing some live streaming as well on the PlayStation 4.
1768000	1773000	I really wish that Twitch and Sony was archiving those streams on PS4 right now.
1773000	1777000	I understand that's coming in an enhancement soon. I know we reported on that a couple weeks ago.
1777000	1782000	But unfortunately, you can't go see the archives of me playing PlayStation 4 because we have fun with that.
1782000	1788000	So, yeah. Otherwise, more Diablo 3. I think I'm up to Paragon level like 35 now.
1788000	1796000	I love the new adventure mode. It's so fun to just go and you can just, excuse me, you can just go into a game with randoms.
1796000	1801000	And I usually go on like a lower difficulty. I don't get as much experience, but it's so fast.
1801000	1805000	You just go through and you get all the rift coins and then I just kind of go explore those on my own.
1805000	1808000	And yeah, I'm having a great time with Diablo 3.
1808000	1811000	And that's pretty much been the two big games I've been playing this week.
1811000	1815000	I still touched a little bit of Final Fantasy X. I think I fired that up once.
1815000	1819000	South Park I still need to go back and beat, but you know, just a lot going on with me too.
1819000	1824000	So that does it for my gaming week and therefore all of our gaming weeks.
1824000	1829000	So let's quickly go over some housekeeping. Next week is Easter Sunday, right?
1829000	1830000	That's right.
1830000	1834000	So Loki will not be here next week because you have some family obligations, I know.
1834000	1838000	But Dark Soccer and I will still be here next week to put on a show for you guys.
1838000	1843000	Maybe a special guest if I can find one here locally in the next week to bring to the show.
1843000	1847000	So that'll all be something you guys can look forward to next week on the show.
1847000	1850000	We will still be here live. We will not take next week off.
1851000	1853000	Otherwise, I don't know any shows that we do have off.
1853000	1857000	Probably the next time we're going to have a show off is whenever Gamer X is.
1857000	1860000	Because we won't do a show that weekend because Jamie and I will be hungover.
1860000	1861000	So there you go.
1861000	1862000	Maybe.
1862000	1863000	Maybe. Alright.
1864000	1869000	Let's see. I think that does it for housekeeping so let's get into some gaming news.
1869000	1874000	Lots and lots of news this week actually coming out of PAX East and other events as well.
1874000	1876000	So Loki, take us away.
1876000	1888000	So there's talk about like kind of a changing opinion with the change of, I guess, the lead, you know, person at Xbox.
1888000	1895000	You know, remember with Don Mattrick, originally he said, you know, it was quoted, you know,
1895000	1898000	if you're backwards compatible, you're really backwards and everybody.
1898000	1904000	That's kind of like that whole we're all pissed at Microsoft because they're saying really dumb things, you know, part of that.
1904000	1913000	So now, you know, now that there's a new regime sort of thing, they're kind of looking at it like Phil Spencer is saying,
1913000	1916000	well, you know, we're looking at it right now.
1916000	1925000	There's not really a way we can do it, but it's something we'd love to see on the system.
1925000	1930000	You know, because like we've said, you know, it's hard to emulate that stuff right now.
1930000	1938000	Although I got to say it is probably somewhat possible because, I mean, homebrew wise, someone's already made an emulator for the Xbox 360.
1938000	1942000	It just doesn't work very well. But there is one out there somewhere.
1942000	1946000	So, yeah, it's something that they're looking at.
1946000	1952000	So if they can, you know, definitely support that, then, yeah, that support will be coming if it's feasible.
1953000	1962000	I feel like there, correct me if I'm wrong, Loki, based on some detail I might have missed, but I really feel like this is a whole bunch of smoke up our ass.
1962000	1966000	I don't think there is any intention of doing backwards compatibility whatsoever.
1966000	1969000	I think it's all wordsmithing to try and quell people down.
1969000	1978000	But I really don't see like if there was going to be backwards compatibility that would have been implemented or that would have been under like that would have started a long time ago to say,
1978000	1983000	boy, gee, golly, maybe that's something we should look at, you know, and we'll do that real soon.
1983000	1991000	I don't think that's the case. I don't think it's just, I mean, granted, it's, you know, better than saying, well, we're not looking at it at all.
1991000	1999000	But at the same time, I think that they would want to look at something like that because it gives them an opportunity to sell the back catalog again on Xbox One,
1999000	2004000	just like they're doing like, you know, the PlayStation Network right now selling PlayStation 2 games and PlayStation 1 games.
2004000	2013000	It does give it does give a leg up as well for what it's worth on PlayStation 4 as well, because, you know, the library is not instantly backwards compatible.
2013000	2015000	And that's something a lot of people kind of miss.
2015000	2021000	I highly doubt that if it is ever backwards compatible, that it's not going to be backwards compatible with disks.
2021000	2025000	I don't think that they'll have you put your disk in the system and have it read off that.
2025000	2030000	But it's still going to be a very long ways off. I don't even know if they're going to be able to do it.
2030000	2037000	One would think, too, if they get 360 compatibility working, then by nature they'll have original Xbox working as well,
2037000	2043000	because they sold original Xbox games on 360. At least the chunk that they had working.
2043000	2047000	I mean, you would literally be emulator to emulator. I mean, you'd be emulating twice.
2047000	2050000	But assuming they get 360 at full speed, it shouldn't matter.
2050000	2058000	But I know they sold original Xbox games on 360 and a big chunk, like, what, three quarters of the library of Xbox games worked on Xbox 360.
2058000	2062000	Like, you know, the Halo games. Just not the DDR games. I know games that were always missing.
2062000	2070000	I just don't know. I don't think it's going to happen. But it's something that they're looking at.
2070000	2078000	I don't know. I just don't think that they'll be able to do it unless they come up with some completely new way to emulate that stuff.
2078000	2085000	Not actually just raw emulating everything. They'd have to come up with a new way to play all that architecture and stuff.
2086000	2090000	Right. I don't know. I still can't help but feel like, just don't get your hopes up, you guys.
2090000	2095000	Because I think by the time they were to implement something like this, they'll have stopped making 360 games.
2095000	2101000	Yes. They're not in a big hurry to do this anyways, because they want you to buy a 360 still.
2101000	2106000	I mean, if you want to play 360 games, buy a 360. If you want to play Xbox One games, you buy an Xbox One.
2106000	2115000	They don't want you to just buy one system. But at some point, you know, they're not going to be making the Xbox 360 anymore.
2115000	2122000	They're going to stop making the Xbox 360 games. And maybe I can see them supporting Xbox 360 games for whatever the next console is.
2122000	2126000	You know, when the processors are that much more powerful.
2126000	2133000	I do see the point, though, about being able to get a 360 emulator working just so they can resell you a copy of Halo 3.
2133000	2139000	Or, you know, some of the big 360 titles. I do see that perspective. And maybe that'll be a ways down the line.
2139000	2148000	And everybody else does it. Nintendo's done it with Virtual Console. You've bought several games several times on your 3DS and your Wii and your Wii U.
2148000	2150000	And they do that with Virtual Console.
2150000	2152000	How many times have they sold you a Game Boy?
2152000	2158000	Right? Well, to be fair, the hardware at least goes through upgrades. Games don't change.
2158000	2163000	But anyway, and then PlayStation, you know, they get you to buy PS1 games you probably already owned.
2163000	2169000	Like, I bought Umjama Lamy so I could play it on my PlayStation 3 even though I had it on PlayStation 1 at one point.
2169000	2174000	You know, so. And, granted, if I could find the damn disc, I could just put that in my PlayStation 3.
2174000	2177000	But, eh, whatever. It was five bucks or something, right?
2177000	2184000	So, I'm sure Microsoft wants a piece of that type of pie, too. So that's the only reason I could see them doing it.
2184000	2189000	But I don't think it's, yeah, I don't know if that necessarily means you're going to put your 360 disc in and off it goes.
2189000	2192000	You know? We'll see.
2192000	2196000	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2196000	2204000	Dungeonbuster says, sounds like he's being diplomatic about it. He's not saying no, but at the same time gives reasons why it might not even happen.
2204000	2209000	ActDeft in chat says retro compatibility equals HD remakes, maybe?
2209000	2218000	Yeah, I mean, I know we have news on at least one more of those and that seems to be the popular thing to do right now is remaking games from the last gen like we saw with Tomb Raider.
2218000	2222000	Well, yeah, that's something I see happening a lot more than just this.
2222000	2224000	Nintendo sure does it, too.
2224000	2228000	They don't actually do it a whole ton anymore. I mean, Virtual Console, maybe.
2228000	2233000	Well, yeah, but I'm thinking like Wind Waker HD and some of the Wii control games.
2233000	2237000	Yeah, new play controlling. Well, that wasn't even an upgrade. That was just straight porting.
2237000	2248000	But like, you know, I think they had some Square Enix or even Sony had a way to port like some of their games like PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3 very easily.
2248000	2259000	So if they come up with something like that to port 360 games to, you know, Xbox One or something, it might be worth it if they can improve the visuals and make it worthwhile.
2259000	2261000	Right. All right.
2261000	2269000	Well, we'll see if they actually put their foot forward with this. Maybe something you'd see at E3? I don't know. That might be a little soon.
2269000	2275000	We're not going to see anything for backwards compatibility, I think ever on this, at least on the Xbox One. It's not going to happen.
2275000	2278000	One more thought here from our chat room and then I'm going to go to another story.
2278000	2285000	But VX Jason XV in our chat says they wouldn't build 360 compatibility to let you play an old Halo.
2285000	2289000	They'd port the old Halo or introduce Halo 3 mode to Halo 5 or something like that.
2289000	2295000	Like Halo 3 campaign in future Halos and Act F follows that up with Halo 3 DLC.
2295000	2304000	Yeah, I could see that. I could see that. Why not, instead of giving somebody that value, you know, why not convince somebody to just buy it again?
2304000	2305000	Well, that's a few years off.
2305000	2306000	It works. People do it.
2306000	2308000	Halo 2 anniversary later this year.
2308000	2311000	Yeah. Well, there's no official word on that.
2311000	2312000	It's official.
2312000	2315000	It's either official or it's not official.
2315000	2318000	It's official to the point where it's leaked out so many times it's official.
2318000	2320000	Yeah, they have an officially setting.
2320000	2322000	It's officially a poorly kept secret.
2322000	2324000	I want to actually say this.
2324000	2327000	Yeah, noobs I thought was official in Mortal Kombat 2.
2327000	2331000	But it did end up being official at some point.
2331000	2335000	Yeah, later because of people not shutting off, whatever.
2335000	2340000	Alright, let's move on. Hey, you know what? You know what is official?
2340000	2342000	And I could not be more excited.
2342000	2345000	A new civilization game. Yay!
2345000	2347000	You civ whore.
2347000	2348000	Yay!
2348000	2351000	Okay, here's the thing. It's not Civilization 6.
2351000	2352000	Frown.
2352000	2355000	But that's okay because Civ 5 is still awesome and I'm getting some mileage out of that.
2355000	2357000	It's like Civ X-Com.
2357000	2360000	Or it's Civilization Alpha Centauri, essentially, is what it is.
2360000	2362000	But here's the thing.
2362000	2364000	They don't own the Fire Access in 2K.
2364000	2366000	They don't own the rights to the Alpha Centauri name.
2366000	2367000	EA does.
2367000	2372000	So what they've announced instead is they've announced a game called Civilization Beyond Earth.
2372000	2373000	And that is the game.
2373000	2379000	They've put out a big trailer that just talks about, you know, we've built the Earth as much as we can.
2379000	2380000	What is next?
2380000	2382000	And it's essentially space.
2382000	2388000	And the vibe I'm getting from the game is that it's not like humans and aliens.
2388000	2392000	It's still like Americans, Egyptians.
2392000	2394000	I don't know if it's going to be modern.
2394000	2396000	I don't know if they would include historical.
2396000	2398000	Like, would the Egyptians be in it?
2398000	2399000	Well, I don't know. We'll see.
2399000	2400000	I guess Egypt is still a country.
2400000	2402000	Who knows? I don't know what they're going to do.
2402000	2407000	But they'll still have human civilizations in the game.
2407000	2409000	So like Americans and Russian and Chinese.
2409000	2414000	You know, probably all the United Nations powers and all that will probably be civilizations you can play in the game.
2414000	2416000	Colonizing a new world.
2416000	2418000	We don't have more details on that at this time.
2418000	2424000	My impression I'm getting from this and what I'm hearing about the game is it's this spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.
2424000	2434000	But imagine now that a lot of things we got from Civ V, such as the hexagon grid, are now going to be in a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.
2434000	2438000	That sounds like where civilization beyond Earth is going.
2438000	2444000	And Black Wolf in our chatroom says,
2445000	2447000	Egyptians no longer exist is a quote I said.
2447000	2448000	That's not what I said.
2448000	2455000	But when I think about the Egyptians and civilization, I think about as they're led by ancient Egypt commanders.
2455000	2457000	And that's not going to be the case anymore.
2457000	2460000	So I think you're going to see more contemporary civilizations.
2460000	2462000	So we're not going to see Space Gandhi or anything?
2462000	2464000	You know what? Anything is possible in the future.
2464000	2466000	Who knows? Who knows?
2466000	2467000	But anyway.
2467000	2469000	Yeah, so it's going to be in space.
2470000	2480000	The cool thing is that, and again hearing some of the talk coming out of the panel and the convention, is that there's no established roadmap that they have to follow.
2480000	2495000	So if you think about it, in a game like Civilization where you have the tech tree, you know that civilizations eventually will discover the wheel, which leads to advanced cars at some point, the steam engine.
2495000	2498000	Everything kind of leads to newer technology.
2498000	2502000	But the thing about when you're talking about the future, we don't know what that technology looks like.
2502000	2504000	So they can kind of make it up.
2504000	2505000	So that's going to be kind of cool.
2505000	2511000	And they talk about how the tech tree in Civilization Beyond Earth will be a web, not a tree.
2511000	2513000	So that's going to be very interesting.
2513000	2515000	So there you go.
2515000	2520000	You will assemble your culture identity and craft your colony before exploring the new world.
2520000	2522000	There's also going to be a quest system.
2522000	2526000	And that's not something you ever saw in civilization games before.
2526000	2527000	That's going to be pretty neat.
2527000	2530000	I'm very excited to it, especially if it has Sid Meier's name on it.
2530000	2533000	I'm hoping that he is a part of the development of the game.
2533000	2534000	That would be great.
2534000	2536000	But yeah, they are saying it's going to happen this fall.
2536000	2539000	So more to come on this at E3.
2539000	2544000	Please let me get to go to E3 and see a demo of this behind closed doors, please.
2544000	2546000	I'm very excited about this.
2546000	2547000	So there you go.
2547000	2549000	Civilization Beyond Earth.
2549000	2551000	Darkstalker, what do you have for us?
2551000	2555000	Well, news out of BioWare regarding Dragon Age Inquisition.
2555000	2561000	That they are not going to be doing any DLC as far as characters are concerned.
2561000	2571000	Because of what you have to do to be able to enable new characters to be provided as DLC is that you have to put part of the content on the disc.
2571000	2580000	And because of people fussing about paying for something they already own, then they just said we're not doing DLC characters at all.
2580000	2582000	What we're giving you is what you get.
2582000	2584000	So you get nine characters.
2584000	2590000	The ones confirmed are Cassandra, who we saw in Dragon Age 2, definitely.
2590000	2595000	Iron Bull, Sera, Solas, Varric, I love Varric, and Vivienne.
2595000	2598000	So that's confirmed.
2598000	2605000	I would imagine that a decision like this could impact another series that you and I love dearly and that would be Mass Effect.
2605000	2609000	Because I think about the DLC characters for those games were largely on the disc, right?
2609000	2612000	Like Javok in Mass Effect 3 had to be on the disc.
2612000	2618000	Because you think about all the dialogue that goes with that and characters interacting with Javok, it's got to be on the disc.
2618000	2622000	Just put it on the disc, but put a significant portion of it that you download.
2622000	2628000	That way people don't bitch because they feel like they're getting a significant portion and not just a key to unlock it.
2628000	2630000	Well, about mine digitally anyway.
2630000	2635000	Well, in Mass Effect, the characters usually came with missions as well.
2635000	2641000	And I don't confess to be as up to speed on Dragon Age, but did they do a similar thing where the characters at least kind of...
2641000	2643000	You got missions and quests with it as well?
2643000	2645000	I played the first Dragon Age without any DLC.
2645000	2653000	So I'm actually playing through Dragon Age 2 again now with plenty of DLC and face hacks and all kinds of stuff.
2653000	2654000	Good times.
2654000	2655000	Because Fenris.
2655000	2656000	Of course.
2656000	2660000	There's a ship that I ship almost as hard as the Garris ship. It is the Fenris ship.
2660000	2663000	So you must be looking forward very much to this new Dragon Age game.
2663000	2664000	It better have Fenris in it.
2664000	2665000	Alright.
2665000	2668000	I sail the ship of the USS Broody Elf.
2668000	2670000	There you go.
2670000	2676000	Along with my larger boat, the USS Spiky Alien.
2676000	2684000	The pagan Jew in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminds us Mass Effect 2 also had Kasumi and Zaid.
2684000	2687000	They had no interaction with anybody practically.
2687000	2689000	I think most of that was on the disc too.
2689000	2694000	Or they crafted it in such a way where they didn't really interact with the others.
2694000	2700000	Kasumi you definitely use in one part of the suicide mission if you have her.
2700000	2706000	She's the best person to go through that tunnel to hit all the...
2706000	2708000	I always have Tali do that.
2708000	2709000	Okay.
2709000	2712000	I guess there are a couple characters you can use, but I always had Kasumi do that.
2712000	2714000	I always have Kasumi escort the crew back.
2714000	2715000	Gotcha.
2715000	2717000	And shoot.
2717000	2721000	Also I just love Kasumi actually. That was some great DLC.
2721000	2722000	Yeah she's a fun character.
2722000	2723000	It really was.
2723000	2725000	Especially with the Citadel stuff later on.
2725000	2727000	No she's literally one of my favorite characters in the whole series.
2727000	2728000	Oh yeah, same here.
2728000	2729000	She's great.
2729000	2732000	That and her strange addiction to going through people's panty drawer.
2732000	2734000	I was so happy to see her in 3. But anyway.
2734000	2735000	Yeah.
2735000	2737000	We could do a Mass Effect Wang podcast.
2737000	2738000	She's such a sassy bitch.
2738000	2740000	She's great.
2740000	2744000	Well I remember her. But see. The DLC wasn't just the character.
2744000	2746000	But you had that whole quest where you went into the mansion.
2746000	2748000	That was a fun one.
2748000	2749000	Yeah.
2749000	2750000	So they didn't just come with the character.
2750000	2752000	Donovan Hawk with the weird accent.
2752000	2754000	And I finally figured out what his accent was supposed to be.
2754000	2757000	Certain region of South Africa.
2757000	2758000	Ooh.
2758000	2760000	Since we brought up Mass Effect Wank, you and I.
2760000	2762000	And we can never get enough of it here on the show.
2762000	2763000	Squirt squirt squirt.
2763000	2764000	Sorry Loki, deal with it.
2764000	2766000	But I hear at PAX East this weekend.
2766000	2772000	They did like the voice actors and face actors doing the cosplay live.
2772000	2774000	And they had like an assemblence of like what.
2774000	2776000	They had Ashley's voice actors was there.
2776000	2777000	Yeah.
2777000	2778000	Kaden's.
2778000	2779000	Luciano Costa.
2779000	2781000	Yeah Luciano Costa. The face model was there.
2781000	2782000	Twerking on stage.
2782000	2783000	Drool.
2783000	2784000	In.
2784000	2785000	Drool.
2785000	2786000	Outfit.
2786000	2787000	Drool.
2787000	2788000	Hold on. Dab dab dab dab.
2788000	2790000	Let's see. Who else was there? Samara.
2790000	2792000	She's everywhere. She goes to all the conventions.
2792000	2794000	Rana. What's her name?
2794000	2795000	Yeah.
2795000	2798000	And then they had the. I did not know they got the voice actor for Thane.
2798000	2799000	Yeah.
2799000	2802000	Oh. Many people that ship The Shepherd Thane were very happy to see that.
2802000	2805000	I didn't think the mask was all that great. But it was pretty cool to see.
2805000	2806000	To see him there.
2806000	2807000	And then.
2809000	2811000	McNamar I think is her last name.
2811000	2812000	Mm hmm.
2812000	2814000	Rana. Anyway. She's cool.
2814000	2817000	I actually. Because you know I have Mass Effecting.
2817000	2820000	I reposted some of her video tutorials for doing a sorry cosplay.
2820000	2821000	Nice.
2821000	2824000	But I've been. I've been following.
2824000	2825000	The.
2825000	2828000	Delightful Mr. Costa since he created his Tumblr.
2828000	2829000	Mm hmm.
2829000	2830000	And.
2830000	2833000	He was putting up lots of.
2833000	2836000	Progress pictures about making the body dummy.
2836000	2839000	And working on the pieces of the armor and everything.
2839000	2840000	It was pretty cool.
2840000	2842000	Yeah. That guy like. He didn't.
2842000	2845000	I don't think that guy really realized the Mass Effect fandom.
2845000	2848000	Until probably after the Mass Effect 3 stuff died down a little bit.
2848000	2849000	All that controversy.
2849000	2850000	And then he was like.
2850000	2852000	Wait a minute. There's all these people that like.
2852000	2853000	He reposted Caden porn week.
2853000	2854000	Oh yeah.
2854000	2856000	There's all these people that worship Caden out there.
2856000	2858000	And I could make money off of this.
2858000	2860000	Well and then he also went in.
2860000	2862000	I could get a free trip to Boston.
2862000	2864000	Well he also went in and.
2864000	2865000	There was a.
2865000	2866000	Posted a.
2866000	2870000	Kind of a mini photo shoot meeting with the voice actor.
2870000	2872000	Who's a.
2872000	2874000	Raphael Sparge who's also on Once Upon a Time.
2874000	2875000	Mm hmm.
2875000	2876000	He's chimney cricket.
2876000	2877000	Yep.
2877000	2878000	I actually really like him.
2878000	2879000	But.
2879000	2880000	All right.
2880000	2881000	The.
2881000	2882000	That was pretty.
2882000	2886000	The too much Mass Effect wank alarm is going off here in studio and seven.
2886000	2888000	So we need to move on with some news.
2888000	2889000	Loki.
2889000	2890000	All right.
2890000	2894800	So it was inevitable that there is going to be another Disney infinity game coming at
2894800	2896400	some point.
2896400	2901160	And with that they kind of tease their first bit of information on that.
2901160	2906480	Including these that Marvel Studios is going to be adding characters to the game.
2906480	2912120	And so one of the characters that of course they show in there is Captain America.
2912120	2917380	And so Marvel characters will be coming into Disney Infinity 2.0 which I'm guessing is
2917380	2921360	coming out later this year.
2921360	2925040	So I don't know.
2925040	2927600	I guess that's just inevitable.
2927600	2933680	And I'm sure we'll see some stuff for like Star Wars stuff soon in fact actually kind
2933680	2934680	of a little Easter egg.
2934680	2940240	If you did happen to be crazy enough to buy every single character for Disney infinity
2940240	2944400	one of the items that unlocks at the very end is a light saber.
2944400	2945600	Oh geez.
2945600	2947880	They're just they're just teasing you now.
2947880	2953480	So well you would think though if they win does episode seven come out is that next year.
2953480	2959880	That's 2015 I think or set was it 15 this thing is 2015 but it's holiday right.
2959880	2960880	Yeah.
2960880	2961880	Because they had to bump back the Warcraft movie.
2961880	2963840	It's holiday.
2963840	2969400	So I think I think Disney Infinity 3.0 will bring in the Star Wars characters because
2969400	2971120	that's still a big thing.
2971120	2974600	But I wouldn't be surprised if you see a little bit of teasing just to you know because the
2974600	2977600	hype machine is going to start rolling in later this year.
2977600	2982080	The first trailer think about it the trailer for episode seven you're going to see this
2982080	2988100	Christmas think about it and it'll just be like 30 seconds of just a look just a little
2988100	2991760	bit of wonder if it's going to be like you know was episode one where people would actually
2991760	2995320	walk and just they'd go buy a ticket to the movie just to watch the trailer.
2995320	2999640	What was it like the beach or something had the preview for her who does that actually
2999640	3003080	nowadays because now they have the Internet I guess yeah and they have the Internet when
3003080	3006920	that's the one we had the Internet but you didn't have really high speed and high speed
3006920	3009220	and it was still colleges and things like that.
3009220	3015240	So to see it on the big screen you know so there's no YouTube I'm excited about not Disney
3015240	3019880	Infinity though because I already I already went down that path and not for me I'm not
3019880	3021000	I'm too old.
3021000	3026280	Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com is referencing actually
3026280	3031540	some of our coverage from E3 2013 over at vognetwork.com because remember we had the
3031540	3035000	whole thing where you could submit your questions and Bobby would ask them on the show floor
3035000	3037880	at E3 which we're really hoping comes back this year.
3037880	3042800	But anyhow one of the questions that got asked over Disney Interactive when Bobby was there
3042800	3044500	got this response.
3044500	3048480	As for other properties the game was designed specifically to be able to include properties
3048480	3050060	that haven't been thought of yet.
3050060	3053940	So Marvel and Star Wars are definite future possibilities.
3053940	3058240	Now I think that was to tease us a little bit about the last game but I think we all
3058240	3063040	knew they'd have to do something to make you want to buy 2.0 because they can't exactly
3063040	3064040	do swap force.
3064040	3065040	Oh no.
3065040	3067140	Well they've run out of everything.
3067140	3070120	Everything is on disk as far as all the assets and stuff are on disk because you have to
3070120	3071120	buy the actual characters.
3071120	3072120	Right.
3072120	3073220	There's no DLC with that.
3073220	3075800	So they've run out of stuff.
3075800	3079320	I knew that they were going to be announcing a new game soon because the last characters
3079320	3081880	came out at the beginning of this month or at the end of this month.
3081880	3086720	The last characters came out this month so yeah.
3086720	3087720	Well we'll see.
3087720	3091280	It's going to be, it'll print them more money especially if they throw Marvel characters
3091280	3092280	in there.
3092280	3097760	Dark Sakura is the allure of Marvel enough to get you to get on board with Disney Infinity?
3097760	3098760	No.
3098760	3101760	Why not?
3101760	3105240	I'm saving up for MacBook Pro.
3105240	3107320	So in other words you don't need cheap little plastic figures.
3107320	3112200	You'd rather have a good computer that you can look up pictures of cheap little plastic
3112200	3113200	figures.
3113200	3117640	To be honest I hardly have time to play the games that I have now.
3117640	3122960	And I have no interest in, if I'm going to play a Disney game I'd like for it to actually
3122960	3128920	be a good game and not just a marketing ploy for more money.
3128920	3130080	Okay.
3130080	3132640	Shots fired a little bit.
3132640	3134520	I have heard mixed things on Infinity.
3134800	3137960	I've heard some mixed things on it but some people seem to really enjoy it.
3137960	3141560	They're welcome to enjoy it all they want to.
3141560	3145640	Alright well another game that I'm sure many people will be enjoying and they're going
3145640	3150040	to enjoy it a little sooner I think than we originally thought.
3150040	3151920	Smash Brothers.
3151920	3154640	The Nintendo Direct came out for Smash Brothers.
3154640	3158040	They still did not reveal the name did they?
3158040	3160440	They did not say what the actual name is.
3160440	3161900	We've had Melee.
3161900	3164940	We've had, what was the other?
3164940	3168380	Well just Smash Brothers was the original.
3168380	3171460	So maybe this one's going to be Punch in the Face.
3171460	3172460	I don't know.
3172460	3175260	Smash Brothers Punch to the Face.
3175260	3176340	Smash Brothers Boot to the Head.
3176340	3182460	There is Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U that are both coming this year.
3182460	3185620	The 2015 delays thankfully proved to be false.
3185620	3190400	And get this, Smash Brothers 3DS will arrive in the summer.
3190400	3191880	It's going to be coming out this summer.
3191880	3194320	Because they want you to buy both versions.
3194320	3199840	Exactly and the minute I heard that I said, oh that is so fucking smart.
3199840	3204360	Because if they release the Wii U one first and then the 3DS one later, I bet a bunch
3204360	3208880	of people would buy it on Wii U but I'm not sure as many people would buy it on 3DS.
3208880	3212200	But now that they're doing it this way, you're going to have tons of people getting on the
3212200	3217240	hype with the 3DS version and then they'll also buy that Wii U version that they can
3217240	3220840	play in tournaments and stuff later on in the winter.
3220840	3223800	So that was one of the big pieces of news right there.
3223800	3226320	Those two games will not come out the same day.
3226320	3232440	They're going to be spaced out a little bit there so interesting.
3232440	3235600	Also some new characters were announced for Smash Brothers.
3235600	3238900	Yoshi was confirmed but I mean, you know, come on.
3238900	3241360	No actual new characters is all returning stuff.
3241360	3242360	Well, no.
3242360	3244720	There is one new one because there was Charizard.
3244720	3250160	Which Charizard was part of the Pokemon trainer last time but he was not his own character.
3250160	3251280	I don't think he is his own character.
3251280	3252960	I thought they were just talking about Pokemon.
3252960	3253960	Nope.
3253960	3254960	He is his own character.
3254960	3259080	Charizard is his own character as is Greninja is now his own character which is a new.
3259080	3261120	It's the Pokemon X and Y representative.
3261120	3263220	It's Froakie's fully evolved form.
3263220	3266320	So Greninja which caught a lot of people by surprise.
3266320	3269560	Some people are thinking because of Greninja's appearance this means you're not going to
3269560	3272960	be seeing any Lucario or maybe some of the other Pokemon.
3272960	3277480	Some people are thinking Jigglypuff has been cut at this point because you have these other
3277480	3279240	playable Pokemon.
3279240	3285000	What's interesting about who is showing up is who is not showing up.
3285000	3287580	Because there are still some characters we don't have confirmed.
3287580	3289320	We do not have Ness confirmed.
3289320	3292000	We do not have Captain Falcon confirmed.
3292000	3294160	Game & Watch not confirmed.
3294160	3295160	Falcon is going to be there.
3295160	3296160	I mean, come on.
3296160	3297160	It's like a staple.
3297160	3298480	But when was the last time there was an F-Zero game?
3298480	3299480	It doesn't matter.
3299480	3302600	It's kind of synonymous with, you know.
3302600	3304480	Well and hopefully Virtual Console.
3304480	3305960	You know it's also pushing Virtual Console.
3305960	3307080	Did they confirm Pit?
3307080	3309640	I don't know if they did confirm him either.
3309640	3312840	So I don't remember.
3312840	3315520	I'm sure chatters will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.
3315520	3319120	I thought that they showed Pit.
3319120	3320120	Maybe.
3320120	3321120	I don't know.
3321120	3322120	I just know I was a fan.
3322120	3323120	But yeah.
3323120	3326080	I'm curious to see what that final roster looks like because it seems like there's a
3326080	3327680	lot of characters they haven't confirmed.
3327680	3332000	And I kind of think there's still one more third party character to come.
3332040	3337400	Because we've heard the rumblings that Namco Bandai has been assisting with this, you know,
3337400	3338400	the games.
3338400	3339400	Oh good.
3339400	3340400	Great Pac-Man.
3340400	3342400	How could Pac-Man not be another character?
3342400	3346600	If Namco is truly involved, Pac-Man as a character seems like such a given.
3346600	3348400	Like it has to be a thing.
3348400	3349720	I don't know how that would work.
3349720	3351920	I've never thought of Pac-Man as much of a fighter like that.
3351920	3355480	They'll have him as a stupid like Pac-Man in the Ghostly Adventures character.
3355480	3356480	Yeah like the cartoon.
3356480	3357480	The cartoon or whatever.
3357480	3362160	Well, Pac-Man also shows up in the driving as well.
3362160	3366960	And you might see Inky, Binky, Pinky and Clyde making an appearance.
3366960	3370960	It would be cool if they had other characters like Dig Dug or something like that.
3370960	3371960	Oh!
3371960	3373440	Actually Dig Dug is a really good possibility.
3373440	3378560	That would be hilarious to get to pump the characters up and watch them go boom.
3378560	3380240	You know what I think they should do?
3380240	3381240	Ridge Racer car.
3381240	3384120	I know it's so out there but you know.
3384120	3388080	Ridge Racer has not been on Wii U so that would be perfect.
3388080	3390600	Ok Darktits Studio confirms that Pit is back after all.
3390600	3392440	My bad, my bad.
3392440	3394440	So there you go.
3394440	3400200	And I did like how they said that they were going to not have like some of the costume
3400200	3404840	changes or whatever for characters or that they were going to be there.
3404840	3405840	Yeah!
3405840	3411760	The Metroid Prime or Samus Zero suit will be, which is actually Metroid Zero Mission,
3411760	3412760	sorry.
3412760	3416280	It will be it's own character which is basically like they're not putting Bayonetta in the
3416280	3418320	game but they're putting that in the game.
3418320	3420720	And then they are doing Sheik.
3420720	3425480	I don't know if you say controversial but a lot of people were not expecting Sheik and
3425480	3429120	Zelda to be separated into two separate characters and that is something that's happening as
3429120	3430120	well.
3430120	3434720	Alright so I'm getting linked to the official roster of characters that is in the game.
3434720	3437560	And I guess Lucario was confirmed.
3437560	3444120	I swear Shane, I swear Shane told me that he was not in the game.
3444120	3446280	He lied to me.
3446280	3448120	Totally lied to me.
3448120	3451440	But some of the other characters of course have been confirmed for the game.
3451440	3457300	The Animal Crossing villager, the Wii Fit trainers, Rosalina, Megaman, Little Mac.
3457300	3461640	So there are some really cool new characters that have been confirmed for the game.
3461640	3463240	So and I guess Pit has been confirmed.
3463240	3466740	I want the Excitebike dude.
3466740	3467740	That would be it.
3467740	3468740	That would be it.
3468740	3470960	He fights with his motorcycle.
3470960	3473640	Or the Unir- Yeah Rob, it's Lucario.
3473640	3479820	They need to totally add the Uniracer unicycle, that'd be awesome.
3479820	3484700	Or like the Stunt Race FX character.
3484700	3485700	So many things.
3485700	3487380	Yeah they're saying it's Lucario.
3487380	3491940	Excuse, sorry, sorry Pokemon character I really don't give two shits about and don't play
3491940	3492940	in the game ever so.
3492940	3496540	Well I know they have like lots of Pokeballs now and they have the Master Pokeballs that
3496540	3499860	are in there and I just don't care.
3499860	3502740	Well and also there's kind of too many Pokemon at this point.
3502740	3506860	Like if you're going to make that many Pokemon playable character just have a freaking Pokemon
3506860	3507860	fighting game.
3507860	3510500	They tried to do that remember?
3510500	3511500	Well that's right.
3511500	3514980	I still have a copy of Stadium.
3514980	3519480	Alright well there was another Nintendo Direct this week and not just one dedicated to Smash
3519480	3524340	Brothers but Tomodachi Life also got a Nintendo Direct this week.
3524340	3528940	Now this is a series that's been out in Japan for a little while but Nintendo has said they're
3528940	3533460	going to bring more titles kind of you know globally than they have in the past and so
3533460	3539060	we're going to get Tomodachi Life in the US and Europe on June 6th.
3539060	3543880	This game was that Life Simulator game there's a little controversy about it about a year
3543880	3550780	ago or so when you were able to I guess through some type of exploit in the game have a gay
3550780	3554020	relationship because you get married in the game and you have a gay relationship in the
3554020	3559260	game and Nintendo ended up patching it out or I don't know they basically said that wasn't
3559260	3564020	supposed to happen and it kind of made them look a little bit like they didn't you know
3564020	3568020	but I think a lot was lost in translation with that I don't think necessarily Nintendo
3568020	3573140	is trying to be like anti whatever whatever but I think they were just like no no like
3573140	3576580	this was not you know something that was supposed to be happening in the game.
3576580	3582340	They could pull a DC and say no one can get married and while they're at it no completely
3582340	3585700	bash their female characters and writers.
3585700	3589140	I don't think Nintendo wants to do that I don't think you want a lot of points you know
3589140	3597660	what Tomodachi means hmm means friend oh that's nice that looked fucking weird yeah the whole
3597660	3605220	direct was a little bit insane wasn't it a little bit that's cool going to our chat room
3605220	3610060	over at live.vognetwork.com Akuma JP is in our chat room and he of course is from Japan
3610060	3615660	and he says Tomodachi life was big a while but guess we got sick.
3615660	3618420	So it sounds like it was something that we're finally getting something that was big in
3618420	3621500	Japan like a few years ago but they're already over it but now we're getting their sloppy
3621500	3626380	seconds so enjoy that happened seeming happened with the wind on and then they whitewashed
3626380	3636780	it and Para Para you really want to think about it all right let's move on Dark Sakura.
3636780	3642140	Well you know we discussed about the game spy going down this was be shutting down
3642140	3648100	with player services on May 31st so there's lots of games that are going to have no multiplayer
3648100	3653520	and there are 800 different developers and publishers that were using it including Capcom
3653520	3659540	Nintendo EA Epic Ubisoft and Konami.
3659540	3666600	So I actually a question was asked of EA if they were going to be doing anything different
3666640	3671480	for their Battlefield franchises and something came out on Twitter saying we're working on
3671480	3676280	transitioning those games after the shutdown so you'll still be able to play them and later
3676280	3680060	on put out a statement says we're working on finding a transition but we still have
3680060	3684320	technical hurdles to overcome we will make an announcement when there is news to share
3684320	3688520	so they're trying to work on a work around and redirect for servers so that they can
3688520	3690800	get their games working.
3690800	3693560	So I guess that's something good EA has done.
3693560	3698440	Yeah that's hopefully some good news to come from that that they're able to get those games
3698440	3704600	working although you know I don't know I don't know how popular but I guess if it's like
3704600	3707540	we're talking battlefield and stuff those games are still pretty popular but I would
3707540	3710840	think they'd want to shift most people to the new one but if they can get their hooks
3710840	3715660	in and get them on origin then you know they can push all those ads for the new games so
3715660	3721440	I guess that's that's incentive enough to do it try to sell people on the upgrades right.
3721440	3725680	Well I'm just glad that at least they're addressing it you know.
3725680	3729160	All right well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates let's see
3729160	3733200	what games are coming out that they might pull online support for in a year.
3733200	3734200	Loki what about here in the US?
3734200	3738520	Well I hope it's not pulled in a year but Trials Fusion they have a disc version of
3738520	3743600	the game coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and you may be wondering why should I
3743600	3744600	buy it on disc?
3744600	3748880	Well it includes a season pass with it so it's 40 bucks.
3749320	3754720	2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3754720	3762600	Conception 2 Children of the Seven Stars on 3DS and Vita and that is it.
3764320	3765320	That's it.
3765320	3766320	Slow week.
3766320	3771320	All right let's go over to Japan and we're gonna check out some of the releases over
3771320	3774960	there it doesn't look like there's anything really on PlayStation 4 Xbox One this week
3775040	3780360	because I know Final Fantasy 14 was the big release on PlayStation 4 but that just happened.
3780360	3785840	So that takes us over to the PlayStation 3 and actually it doesn't look like they have
3785840	3791280	anything this week on the PlayStation 3 there's no releases until the 24th when we get games
3791280	3794040	like Muv Luv Photon Flowers.
3794040	3797040	Muv Luv's back.
3797040	3801040	There's a new Muv Luv game coming out next week so we'll talk a little more in depth
3801040	3803600	about that next week because that's on the 24th.
3803600	3809160	But at least some of the other systems Wii U doesn't have anything this week either.
3809160	3810800	They don't have anything till next week.
3810800	3811800	How about the 3DS?
3811800	3814400	Okay the 3DS has some things.
3814400	3817200	Gaikuten, Saiban, 123, Naruhodou Selection.
3817200	3818920	You know that is right?
3818920	3819920	No I don't.
3819920	3821400	That's a Capcom.
3821400	3824800	That's um, um, um.
3824800	3825800	Oh it's Ace Attorney.
3825800	3826800	It's all your game.
3826800	3827800	Yeah.
3827800	3829760	It's Ace Attorney.
3829760	3831360	So there's a new one of those coming out?
3831360	3833320	I thought they were done with that series.
3833320	3834320	Apparently not.
3834320	3835320	Hmm.
3835320	3839880	Oh no it says selection so maybe it could be a best of or something I wonder if it's
3839880	3841480	like a compilation or something like that.
3841480	3846800	Well that is out in regular and limited edition on the 17th of April.
3846800	3850520	Also Meitante Conan Phantom Rhapsody is out this week.
3850520	3855800	Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode Yokubari Sengen Tokimiki Up comes out this week and that is
3855800	3858520	from Nintendo themselves.
3858520	3860600	I've got to know what Wagamama Fashion is here.
3860600	3864360	I guess it's, oh god, look at the box art for this game.
3864360	3868640	It's very pink and it's this girl and she's holding a purse.
3868640	3878180	That looks like the cover of every shoujo manga compilation that comes out ever.
3878180	3880940	And it looks like it is just like a fashion design game.
3880940	3885000	It's like Nintendogs but for fashion people.
3885000	3887440	And instead of dogs and cats you dress people.
3888160	3891000	Oh it even has loli style.
3891000	3892000	So that's kind of cool.
3892000	3893000	Okay I want it.
3893000	3896840	I have a birthday next weekend.
3896840	3899840	You don't want the Disney Animal Crossing game but you won't want the mama fashion.
3899840	3900840	No I want Tomodachi Life.
3900840	3901840	Alright.
3901840	3903640	That's not until June though.
3903640	3904640	Okay fine get me Disney.
3904640	3905640	Alright.
3905640	3909160	Actually I still want Bravely You to Fall but hey.
3909160	3912120	Oh I forgot that you didn't have that.
3912120	3914840	That's okay I don't have time to play anything anyway.
3914840	3915840	Make time.
3915840	3916840	Just kidding.
3917240	3921640	Alright that really does it for releases over in Japan this week so let's go to the UK.
3921640	3923560	We have some stuff.
3923560	3927460	On the 14th is Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn for PS4.
3927460	3930960	On the 15th Mac's The Curse of Brotherhood.
3930960	3935600	Pure Chess for PlayStation 4 and War of the Vikings on PC.
3935600	3937840	On the 16th we have Sly trilogy.
3937840	3941680	The 17th we have Hitman Go for iOS.
3941680	3948240	We have a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil for Xbox 360 and PS3.
3948240	3952880	And The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 for PC.
3952880	3954820	That is it.
3954820	3958280	Some folks in chat by the way telling us some more information about the Phoenix Wright
3958280	3959980	game I talked about in Japan this week.
3959980	3961560	It's Phoenix Wright 1, 2, 3.
3961560	3967080	It's a re-release with slightly better graphics because it's on the 3DS now.
3967080	3969960	Another remastering basically but this time a handheld game.
3969960	3971600	There you go.
3971600	3977760	I don't know if that is coming out over here in the states or not.
3977760	3981560	I would hope so but not everything necessarily makes it over here.
3981560	3985880	Alright just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
3985880	3986880	Loki?
3986880	3995380	Alright well unfortunately Sega Europe has seen some layoffs and apparently they said
3995380	4003260	a limited number of redundancies have been removed due to a restructuring of Sega America
4003260	4006860	Sonic and Mobile divisions.
4006860	4011340	And they're saying they're in the process of consolidating certain functions of both
4011340	4016280	of those departments within Sega of America where the management and production for those
4016280	4018780	areas business reside.
4018780	4023300	And as part of the strategy a limited number of redundancies have taken effect in our European
4023300	4029900	office based in London so that's too bad.
4029900	4034340	That's never fun to hear about layoffs and you know when it's somebody cool like Sega
4034340	4038100	it makes it even harder to hear that so didn't they just go through some layoffs not that
4038100	4039100	long ago?
4039100	4042900	Well yeah I think what they're doing is because what they're probably doing is just trying
4042900	4048380	to cut the fat and so you know people have pretty much the same job position since they're
4048380	4050120	consolidating stuff.
4050120	4056560	They're just removing those I guess those workers because they don't need them.
4056560	4061360	I mean they're not releasing as many games anymore so yeah less bodies are needed.
4061360	4064480	You know but they need those bodies to who's going to make Shenmue 3?
4064480	4068440	Well they need a lot of extra bodies too because who else is going to add all the extra leg
4068440	4071720	for you know Sonic?
4071720	4077760	Right alright let's see let's talk about the PlayStation Now beta because PlayStation
4077760	4079580	Now that beta is still going on.
4079620	4085180	I haven't got to see it myself yet but some people I know are in it and I hear it doesn't
4085180	4089300	really work that great that you still get a lot of artifacting and there is a little
4089300	4095860	bit of a delay but I suppose that depends on where you are but maybe there will be some
4095860	4101780	improvements as we go to version 2.0 because version 2.0 is out and I think this is all
4101780	4105940	still under NDA but with as many people as are in this beta it's all it's all getting
4105940	4109260	out there and the news is getting out into the blogs and things like that so the update
4109260	4115860	was 42 megs and there are 19 games playable now in this new PlayStation Now beta that
4115860	4122300	includes things like Shadow of the Colossus, Dead Island, Payday the Heist, I think those
4122300	4123540	are all in the original one.
4123540	4129500	I don't remember seeing Disgaea 4 before though or Dead or Alive 5 or Mat Hazard or Earth
4129500	4132180	Defense Force Insect Armageddon so that's.
4132180	4134020	Who would play Mat Hazard?
4134020	4137260	That game was terrible.
4137260	4141420	That's when it was like oh it's a video game character and he's become like self-aware
4141420	4147860	now and he's going back and fighting all of his old, you know, old villains from different
4147860	4151460	games and stuff and it was supposed to be all cheesy and funny but it was dumb.
4151460	4156420	Well now it's worth pointing out that some games were removed from the first beta so
4156420	4162020	if you were trying to play more Ninja Gaiden 3 or Papo and Yo or Killzone 3 those games
4162020	4166740	were removed so they're mixing it around a little bit with PlayStation Now but apparently
4166740	4169540	you can still unlock trophies and things like that so that's cool.
4169540	4172340	Well you can play Puzzle Quest Galactrix too.
4172340	4175420	That's the one Puzzle Quest game that kind of flopped.
4175420	4176620	It wasn't very good.
4176620	4180180	Yeah they changed the whole formula from the match 3 and it didn't really work out the
4180180	4182460	same way it was just a different game.
4182460	4184780	Whatever happened to that series Puzzle Quest?
4184780	4189620	There was one and two in Galactrix and then I mean they were out on every stinking platform
4189620	4191620	but we haven't really seen anything in that forever.
4191620	4192620	It's taking a nap.
4192620	4193620	I guess so.
4193620	4195260	Kind of sad.
4195260	4201620	Alright well let's go back to the past a little bit and check out some classic games in a
4201620	4206660	segment we call the Classic Game of the Week and yeah I used Plural tonight we're gonna
4206660	4212020	check out some classic games in tonight's segment because Dark Sakura when she dives
4212020	4216380	into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be playing this this week she
4216380	4220660	does things her way and if she wants to do more than one game she's gonna fucking do
4220660	4221660	it.
4221660	4225020	Well I'm doing a trilogy they're all related to each other although the one I wanted to
4225020	4227060	focus on is the last game in the series.
4227060	4231980	Alright fair enough so Dark Sakura what is the classic games of the week?
4231980	4238660	The classic games start with a particular game called Final Justice that came out in
4238660	4240500	1985 for the MSX.
4240500	4247620	It's done by Pako Fujishima who also designed the sequel game Gartic.
4247620	4253020	The game after Gartic that rounds out the trilogy is Blaster Burn which after having
4253020	4259500	played Blaster Burn it honestly is a really really really a superior game but I figured
4259500	4264820	I'd just go through a little bit of basic gameplay with Final Justice it really isn't
4264820	4269420	all that special to look at it's just kind of a fun generic little shooter but really
4269420	4275940	the whole thing to bring up for that one is the fact that it did spawn Gartic which as
4275940	4282260	we know Gartic spawned a favorite game of at least two thirds of us in the room.
4282300	4285300	Oh wait let me let me switch to the Gartic foot that was all you're gonna say on Final
4285300	4287020	Justice all right let me go to Gartic.
4287020	4289420	Yeah cause Final Justice is kind of crappy.
4289420	4292020	It was basic it was early 80s what you do okay yes Gartic.
4292020	4296980	Now a lot of this music should sound familiar if I'm gonna turn it up just a little bit.
4300980	4301980	Sound familiar?
4301980	4302980	Yeah.
4302980	4308620	Gartic is the one that spawned Gartic Gaiden which we got on the Nintendo as the guardian
4308620	4316020	legend so Gartic is a weird little game Gartic is you you're sort of like in this series
4316020	4324820	of mazes and you go and shoot enemies on the screen of all of a particular type and then
4324820	4329860	you move on to the next room and you're just sort of navigating this maze where you stop
4329860	4337060	and shoot things it really is just a weird little game through Gartic you also can buy
4337060	4342940	your power-ups like extra speed you buy different weaponry and you choose these things before
4342940	4352860	each stage so it's sort of a very non-traditional kind of shooting game and as you go through
4352860	4358780	it you can sort of see where elements that it's it puts into practice were split into
4358780	4364420	the guardian legend you know it's sort of like they combine the corridor theory with
4364420	4368220	the shooter games and you know the guardian legend I think wasn't that like the first
4368220	4373940	game I ever reviewed actually no it wasn't one of the first one but it was it was early
4373940	4378860	on because it's a long-running joke quote-unquote on the show but it's not a joke it's truth
4378860	4384420	that that was what we believe to be the finest NES game they ever made which in it was it
4384420	4389340	and it was not really critically well reviewed when it came out so one of those things that
4389340	4395300	kind of aged better than a lot of NES games did but the the thing with that is that I
4395300	4400460	think that they might have realized that they were trying to pack in too much with this
4400460	4404340	game I didn't realize the blue lander was in this game yeah it's in here I see it in
4404340	4409780	a little video this is MSX graphics so it's not you know it's not the same but still but
4409780	4416400	um but yeah you know this was a really interesting game like I said it spawned a guardian legend
4416440	4423240	for us which you know for us that's a win-win now what's really what I think the best thing
4423240	4430240	well I'm gonna say the second best thing to have come out of this trilogy is the game
4430600	4437600	called a blaster burn blaster burn is a pretty traditional shooter where this game has good
4437600	4444600	music for the record where basically it's a you just go through it's a standard shooting
4445720	4451720	game you have your power-ups and you're actually playing this ship called the gardic 2 so it
4451720	4458720	is a true I think sequel to the gardic series they're kind of you know it can it's not quite
4459640	4464640	a bullet hell it's just a standard shooter but it's fun and offered some unique features
4465040	4469040	and on top of that the music and it was really good your power-ups were fun and it just has
4469040	4476040	a lot of the fun compile you know what was it was it that that feel of a compile shooter
4476440	4480240	without falling back to some of the same old traditions that were in other compile shooting
4480240	4485240	games and as you can see I mean we've got like pretty complex backgrounds for the MSX
4485240	4490240	yeah the graphics are a big step up from even gardic considering they were both on MSX yeah
4490840	4497840	but this one was the final one that came out in that trilogy now I'll rewind a little bit
4498840	4503840	and go back to gardic because I mentioned with my what if I've been playing this week
4503840	4509040	that I had another game that I've been playing and that actually is gardic I have that on
4509040	4516040	iOS so they actually did release gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you made it
4516040	4522240	gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you move around and you shoot stuff it's it
4522240	4529240	controls okay you know about as good as anything on iOS does you know for a shooter but you
4529360	4536280	know going through these games I really find it a shame that they didn't really see the
4536280	4543280	light of day over here especially blaster burn because it's it's just a fun little shooter
4543480	4550480	so I would say anyone if you have an MSX or have access to playing MSX games this is something
4552880	4558040	that you should definitely definitely check out you know play through gardic get the roots
4558040	4565040	for the guardian legend and if you don't own the guardian legend why but I think that everyone
4565040	4572040	at least if you love a good shooting game you need to play through blaster burn all
4572040	4578040	right so there you go oh I did have the years for those by the way sure go for it final
4578040	4585040	justice came out in 1985 and gardic came out you know I'm actually missing the year for
4586040	4592040	gardic but blaster burn came out in 1990 and that was the last installment in the series
4592040	4599040	I want to say gardic was 87 because I think guardian legend was 88 or 89 so yeah but I
4599040	4606040	mean these were compile games I mean they're really great so but and anyone who has you
4607040	4614040	know an iOS device and has a dollar just go get good by gardic right now do it do it because
4614040	4621040	I said so all right well there it is your classic game of the week dark sakura picked
4622040	4629040	the final justice trilogy starting with final justice gardic and then blaster burn this
4629040	4636040	is a cool name too isn't it blaster burn and look at those boss fights it's pretty fun

4664040	4668040	smash brothers stuff and whatever god knows else I got wrong in that section talking about
4668040	4672040	the new smash brothers game but we will take a quick break we'll be back after this with
4672040	4674040	more of orange lounge radio
4680040	4686040	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on april the 13th of 2014 episode 548
4686040	4692040	of our show already in progress and in part a we talked a little bit about we got a live
4692040	4698040	report from pax east in a moving vehicle going down 95 back home also from the fantastic
4698040	4703040	rama over at anime jam session also we talked a little bit about some of the things announced
4703040	4707040	at pax east including civilization beyond earth and we're gonna talk about some of the
4707040	4711040	other things that were announced a few of them here in this segment we call rapid fire
4711040	4719040	news right loki that's correct this is kind of cool there's a brand new borderlands game
4719040	4725040	that was just announced now it's not borderlands 3 but it's borderlands the pre-sequel so that
4725040	4729040	puts it in between one and two what's kind of different about this one is it's actually
4729040	4734040	going to take place not on pandora but on one of the moons of pandora and so with that
4734040	4742040	you know there's no oxygen and you actually have to collect oxygen as well as you've you
4742040	4747040	have the ability to jump very far and you have jetpacks and stuff like that some of
4747040	4752040	the characters are going to be in it are actually characters that have been in all
4752040	4759040	the other borderlands games just kind of not necessarily cameos but they've got for example
4759040	4766040	athena which is a gladiator type class and she has like some sort of like a shield type
4766040	4773040	thing that she uses to bounce off damage and stuff and i want to say she was in one of
4773040	4779040	the expansions there i just can't remember which one but uh so they have her uh oh she
4779040	4787040	was uh she was in uh borderlands one and uh they have claptrap which got anybody that's
4787040	4794040	played uh borderlands knows who claptrap is uh he's a playable character in it also wilhelm
4794040	4802040	from borderlands 2 and nisha um so it sounds like it's gonna be pretty interesting i think
4802040	4807040	it's supposed to be coming out later this year she was nisha was i guess a sheriff of
4807040	4814040	lynchwood in borderlands 2 uh athena was a former assassin and former crimson last lance
4814040	4821040	um who was in borderlands 1 wilhelm was one of the bosses in borderlands 2 and claptrap
4821040	4829040	well he's in everything so um i don't know looks very very cool uh you're supposed to
4829040	4835040	have i guess um you're gonna be working for captain or not captain jack for handsome jack
4835040	4839040	yes captain jack that's a whole different character he'll shag anyone i mean hi captain
4839040	4844040	jack mission one don't copy that floppy i was thinking of captain jack harkness thank
4844040	4850040	you mission two go left go right go pick up the circle okay like there's like three people
4850040	4855040	listening we're gonna get that joke all right so um yeah handsome jack says who you're working
4855040	4863040	for in that it's kind of his rise to power in this um this game here so uh interesting i very
4863040	4869040	very excited to check this out whenever it comes out i'm guessing probably later this year uh then
4869040	4877040	along with that atlas is funding a game they didn't quite get kick started it's called citizens
4877040	4882040	of earth and what's kind of cool about citizens of earth is it plays very much like i guess
4882040	4890040	earthbound and um sort of a game where you recruit a bunch of people and they have like uh
4890040	4900040	you know it looked it almost reminded me of the wonderful 101 but i think it's it's not exactly
4900040	4904040	gonna play out like that but they i guess they have maybe sort of like sui coden because they
4904040	4910040	have 40 different people that you can recruit in the game um and they're saying they're even
4910040	4918040	gonna create one uh the 41st one uh for the game i guess as a contest allowing fans to um design
4918040	4924040	that character and it's uh supposed to be in development for playstation 4 vita 3ds wii u and
4924040	4932040	pc and supposed to be out in september and then this is kind of a strange crossover but you
4932040	4938040	remember that game dive kick well there's going to be a cameo from johnny gatt from the saints
4938040	4942040	rose series he's going to be a playable character in that and i guess that's supposed to be coming
4942040	4948040	i guess later on to the playstation 4 and xbox one versions more reason for people to dive and
4948040	4954040	kick yes as well as i guess the playstation 3 vita and steam ones um and of course the playstation
4954040	4962040	4 version and xbox one versions aren't out yet but i guess it was coming later on so pretty cool
4962040	4968040	um man see see that that would be well it wouldn't be exactly like saints row with the whole
4968040	4974040	um you know where you create your own characters and stuff but man playing a playable johnny gatt
4974040	4978040	saints row game would be pretty awesome though even if you couldn't create your own character
4978040	4982040	you never know they're they've got to announce something they've got to come ahead they're
4982040	4988040	gonna have something at e3 they need to reboot that series we'll see we'll see we'll see oh
4988040	4992040	all right well earlier in the show we talked about smash brothers so let's talk about the
4992040	4998040	cheap knockoff version of smash brothers playstation all-stars battle royale sorry was that was that
4998040	5002040	statement too truthful for some of you sorry well there is some news to report on playstation all
5002040	5008040	stars battle royale even though it's boop boop i don't think it's even being sold anymore it's
5008040	5013040	just right i don't know it's off shelves did they finally just give it away in playstation plus i
5013040	5017040	don't think they ever did just give it away did they i don't know well whatever here's the thing
5017040	5021040	if if you if you're a big fan of playstation all-stars battle royale first i'm really sorry
5021040	5025040	for what i said but second you're going to get a new patch uh that's going to do a hundred percent
5025040	5029040	balance tweaking lots and lots and lots of balance between that's pretty much all the patch does
5029040	5035040	uh so uh the throw system in the game has been overhauled you can manually disengage a timed
5035040	5041040	super move double jumps can no longer be changed so you can get a new patch you can get a new
5041040	5047040	double jumps can no longer be chained off of certain types of attacks and certain recovery
5047040	5053040	animations and so forth also alternate costumes for isaac and zeus which were the dlc expansion
5053040	5059040	pack the graveyard pack uh it's currently on sale through april 24th for only a dollar 99
5059040	5063040	if you missed out on these characters somehow if you you know haven't played the game in over
5063040	5067040	nine months like most people i gotta be honest i'm surprised that they had an update for this at
5067040	5070640	all because this game came out like two years ago i don't think there's really been an update
5071200	5076400	in like a year on this um could it be one of those out of the blue things could it be that they're
5076400	5082560	doing a new game but like maybe it wouldn't be you know a purchase game maybe free to play or
5082560	5088320	something yeah are they gonna are would they go up against smash brothers with a free to play game
5088320	5092480	that would be a pretty ballsy counter move especially considering the first game was kind of
5093280	5100720	well it was there i don't i don't think it was bad i don't i didn't play it but it looked fun
5102320	5107520	well it looked fun but well some of these balance issues might actually help out quite a bit
5107520	5114640	actually so i don't know hey you know what diablo 3 was saved with the patch like a year and a half
5114640	5119200	after the game came out i don't know anything is possible maybe a bit a bit of like an elitist
5119840	5123840	here but like with all like the talk of pokemon and stuff and all the new pokemon that they're
5123840	5129920	adding to smash bros it just kind of made me like yeah i don't really care you know it's just
5131360	5135680	i don't know there's a lot of nintendo stuff i just don't give a shit about yeah if we lost
5135680	5142560	ness so we can get greninja not happy sorry about it if you disagree but not happy like there was
5142560	5148560	enough damn pokemon in the game or you know char char has been in the game before come on
5148560	5152560	the pokemon trainer last time around remember you get three different pokemon why couldn't they
5152560	5158560	just bring the pokemon trainer back with three different pokemon oh it's just just not possible
5158560	5164080	for whatever reason uh let's see however in the nintendo camp there's some other games to look
5164080	5169440	forward to including nes remix 2 which looks like it's going to be all the things you loved about
5169440	5175680	nes remix 1 but this time with actually good games that we remember from the past so no more
5175680	5179840	golf an urban champion and all that crap but it looks like there's going to be some actually
5179840	5186240	pretty awesome games and there's also going to be a new 1990 nintendo world championship mode
5186240	5192000	which we talked about previously on the show but there are some more details there um super mario
5192000	5198000	brothers is one of the three games in in the mode as it was in 1990 but now it will be mario brothers
5198000	5203360	3 and dr mario will be the other games and what will happen is that you'll do three successive
5203360	5209120	score based challenges to get a total score these scores can also go over to me verse and that's
5209120	5214800	how you can you know show off your ep and all your friends and all that however you have to own the
5214800	5220480	first nes remix game to get championship mode in nes remix 2 because uh super mario brothers was
5220480	5226960	in the first game so so terrible that they can't get rad racer i know but it wasn't it wasn't an
5226960	5232880	nes game or if it wasn't it wasn't a nintendo game it was a square game squaresoft back in the day
5233760	5238880	before they did final fantasy hey you know what i'd be totally 100 fine with square bringing
5239520	5244560	rad racer back i know it would be that would be kind of awesome that would be fucking awesome
5244560	5250720	especially with the hyper realistic graphics they do in like final fantasy 13 15 and stuff uh let's
5250720	5257120	see uh some of the games to look forward to an nes remix to kid icharis kirby's adventure metroid
5257120	5263280	see the good stuff you remember from nes good times that'd be exciting too bad tetra tetra
5264240	5269440	so i don't think nintendo can make tetris games anymore that would include the old stuff i don't
5269440	5275200	know all right now uh some news has come out about a game that was cancelled at lucas arts
5275200	5279680	when that company was shuttered and uh this is kind of surprising because it was a nintendo title
5279680	5285840	for the wii u the nintendo 3ds and the original wii and that was a darth maul game it was going
5285840	5290400	to be a game all about darth maul and kind of his backstory and so forth this game was actually
5290400	5294400	i'm sorry it wasn't cancelled when lucas arts was shuttered it was cancelled in 2011
5294400	5299120	so the game never did come out uh the main character was darth maul in the game
5299120	5305040	and red fly was doing the development and uh it was going to be a multi-platform release at one
5305040	5311840	point and um nintendo didn't want to make it a first party project i guess at one point uh but
5311840	5316080	the game was supposed to explore the origin story of mal's transformation into a sith lord it was
5316080	5321680	going to be a stealth action game george lucas had actually changed the direction of the game
5321680	5327760	so sounds like did he yeah i know right that probably let's be honest that's probably what
5327760	5332800	ended up ruining you know i'm glad that you made a game about darth maul but i think jar jar binks
5332800	5338480	needs to be in this somewhere now now jar jar binks is in star tours and that's actually the
5338480	5345280	best part so there like i said things can get patched years after the fact to make them better
5346080	5350960	it happens once in a while all right dark sakura what do you have over there doesn't happen enough
5352480	5356160	you should have you can't patch my childhood rob you should have flung your meatloaf at
5356160	5360640	george lucas when you had the chance i should have well here's other things that can be flung
5360640	5366800	how about the stuff in cat lateral damage which i still want to play game of the year contender
5366800	5373440	right here well it actually did um win the people's choice in indie prototype awards
5373440	5379600	for the 2014 mass digi game challenge and so right now it actually has been announced as part
5379600	5385920	of the fire hose games accelerator slash incubation program so that means that it will get the much
5385920	5392240	needed help it does to be out there and available for more people to play also um ea sports is
5392240	5401920	resurrecting the dead they've teased their mystery fighter is bruce lee and um i didn't realize bruce
5401920	5409600	lee did ufc apparently not well they brought him back from the dead so we have zombie digital bruce
5409600	5416960	lee kicking people in the face um however if you have pre-ordered i hate that word pre-order if you
5416960	5426720	have ordered the game then you get him as a day one unlock and then last but not least um sony
5426720	5433760	has confirmed of another remaster who last of us is getting a remaster treatment for ps4
5434400	5441680	um they have a release window of summer 2014 and yeah let's say that's the list what list
5442480	5447120	of games that are being remastered oh yeah for real well this one was rumored for a long time
5447120	5453680	and then they finally came out and said it's happening and we're all like no shit you know
5454160	5457440	this makes me really happy i skipped it on playstation 3 it was one of those games i
5457440	5460400	always meant to get around and play and i never did but now i'm like oh
5460400	5462560	well see i knew all along that would happen
5466240	5470720	you know what i was gonna say uh you know kind of going back to the whole ea sports eoc thing
5471280	5476000	the game looks really good as far as like you know the presentation the visual stuff on it
5476000	5482000	i really wish that like they would just make like a good arcade style fighting game because they
5482000	5488000	have an engine that can really pull it off but you know they use it for all the simulation
5488000	5496080	boxing and ufc and i guess they tried it with def jam icon but yeah back to the ufc thing
5496080	5499760	sure because we have some comments in our chat room at live i think it's tacky i think it's
5499760	5504480	fucking tacky yeah i was like we're gonna put bruce lee in it so that we can get more money
5504480	5510160	because everyone wants to be bruce lee no it's fucking tacky everybody doesn't want to be bruce
5510160	5515280	lee i mean here's the comment in the chat at live.com tiger claw says bringing in bruce lee
5515280	5519680	in the ufc is kind of an unfair fight he will beat everyone well this is true but it's still
5519680	5525360	fucking tacky yeah you know it's like for example i put it along the same lines that they did the
5527120	5532320	audrey hetburn commercials those were it was a really cool commercial the cg was very well done
5532320	5541120	i still thought that it was kind of tacky you know using the image of a dead person to promote
5541680	5546960	you know your chocolate or your whatever you know i think that
5549280	5553280	he at least should have his own game well that's actually what dungeon buster says in our chat
5553280	5557920	room at live.vognore.com dungeon buster says bruce lee still needs a good game maybe him and
5557920	5563360	ufc might be as good as we can hope for at this point that bruce lee game for the xbox was just
5563360	5568000	um and then nemesis 47 says the bruce lee game on the super nintendo was decent ish
5568000	5572560	so i mean this isn't bruce lee's first time being adapted in a video game but i would like enter the
5572560	5579360	dragon the game i just think now you know a game dedicated to bruce lee that that would be cool
5579360	5583280	bringing back for ufc that's just tacky how about a game dedicated to brandon lee
5584240	5592480	then again oh yeah that'd be awesome then again and see this is where you want to talk tacky
5592480	5598960	let's talk about the fact they're remaking the crow excuse you no excuse all that no excuse for
5598960	5604640	that as if the sequels weren't bad enough but okay and this has been brought to my attention
5604640	5610160	to not in chat but earlier today like um dan has been talking all up and down about the
5610160	5615920	wrestlemania 2k14 which granted looks really cool it recreates like some of the classic
5616640	5624080	matches some of the people in the game they're dead however they were part of that genre they
5624080	5629280	were wrestlers you have macho man in there now ultimate warriors dead but you know i did watch
5629280	5633520	the commercial he did for the game it was pretty funny is andre the giant in there i loved him i
5633520	5637840	think andre the giants in there even if you didn't like wrestling you loved andre the giant because
5637920	5642640	you probably love the princess bride if you hate wrestling and the princess bride get out of my
5642640	5646240	world you're just that person who doesn't have fun at anything you're probably you you probably
5646240	5649280	don't like video games either so i doubt you're listening to this show to be honest
5651520	5657200	what was what was it that pat and oswalt said you're gonna hate everything and die angry
5659360	5665520	is that a song no it was it was one of his a stand-up comedy but i mean but bruce lee
5665520	5672320	did never did ufc i don't even know if he would like the concept of ufc
5672320	5679920	i mean it's different for i don't know i just i totally i think it's tacky that's me uh now
5679920	5684480	some folks agree with you in chat about the enter the dragon game but tiger claw suggests game of
5684480	5689360	death game of death would be awesome and dungeon buster says a lot of fans would love that or game
5689360	5696720	of death uh and nemesis 47 confirming that andre is in wwe 2k14 you know you know what i need to
5696720	5705120	get have a bruce lee movie night and just watch game of death and just game of death uh gamer girl
5705120	5710720	says i don't really like wrestling but i love princess bride does that count no absolutely it
5710720	5715760	counts no i said i said you you you even if you don't like wrestling you love andre the giant
5715760	5720000	because of the princess bride well how's this for funny now that we're bringing up the princess
5720000	5726560	bride what well you know how awesome julian is yes becky's son yeah he was born with an extra
5726560	5732160	thumb yeah he had six fingers on his right hand i know that's great so we can just say you know
5732160	5735840	good thing that that was taken care of or else he could go around murdering people with sword
5735840	5740560	and aniga montoya might come from and he's too young to be murdering people not until he's 14
5740560	5745600	and i know becky's listening so becky tell julian not to murder anyone until he's at least 14
5745600	5750000	and then to do it with a really pretty sword but never the guy that made the sword because then his
5750000	5754560	son will come after him and that'll be all kinds of a nightmare and i will have to just get in
5754560	5759840	between that and go no well if becky is listening hey becky hey she was listening earlier we were
5759840	5764240	talking about all the mass effect wank oh good and said she wants to be on a mass effect wank show
5764240	5769760	good good because actually which is funny because when i brought up thane earlier in the show i
5769760	5777200	thought of becky like it's that like it is like becky's thane wank is so strong i now associate
5777200	5788720	the two so thane wank well anyway see she she sells the the uss uh green lizard what was what
5788720	5792720	was i going to say i i got on a tangent about gamer girl's comment here oh yeah i don't really
5792720	5797600	like wrestling but i love princess blight here's the thing i don't obsess with wrestling but i
5797600	5803440	don't i don't even go so far to say i like wrestling but i don't hate it and i get why
5803440	5809600	people like wrestling because it soaps for men it's it is it's a testosterone version of doubt
5809600	5816160	and abby when you look at it how different are the two of them really except maggie smith doesn't
5816160	5821520	exactly maggie smith is not dropping a pile driver on the rock but god it would be so fucking awesome
5821520	5826560	if she did i love maggie smith how about a doubt and abby fighting game i want to see maggie smith
5826560	5832240	in ufc 2015 she's gonna have the purse with the brick with a brick in it better yet ben de la crème
5832240	5840000	as maggie smith let's see i want to i you know what sucks is it it's my birthday coming up and
5840000	5844960	i want to get this game for dan just so i can do create a wrestler mode okay okay there's something
5844960	5848960	i had to talk about this russell mania 2k14 that is the best feature of the game all right wrap it
5848960	5853280	up and then we're going to the frugal question yes all right well you know how the shows have
5853280	5858800	like their own storylines and everything and this rivalry with that person and and oh girl did you
5858800	5864240	hear what the rock did you know oh girl gold dust was in the gym the other day and you wouldn't
5864240	5868800	believe yeah it's that kind of stuff well you can make up your own is there a podcast where
5868800	5874560	drag queens talk about wrestling oh my god this should be a thing this should be a thing
5876240	5881760	knock down drag out wrestling oh my god and then i saw the undertaker come up and i was like oh
5881760	5891360	girl no she better don't i could not even so anyway you can loki you even you would have to
5891360	5895280	listen to this i think right you don't like wrestling or drag queens but i just thought
5895280	5901520	i don't like drag queens i just in this way i don't want to watch wrestling and i i don't
5901520	5906960	know if i'd really want to hear i mean if i had the if i had to have a choice between you know
5906960	5911040	comment you know listening to commenting from the people that actually officiate you know the
5911040	5915120	wrestling stuff or drag queens i'd probably pick drag queens that's that's that's that's a fair
5915120	5921840	that's just like would you rather watch twilight breaking dawn part one or would you rather watch
5921840	5929120	twilight breaking dawn part one with rift tracks exactly can i finish my point yes please anyway
5929120	5936960	the wrestlemania 2k14 has a create your own storyline mode and yeah becky says that julian
5936960	5942640	thinks we're very silly and she says hearts rob so back see even becky's interrupting me what the
5942640	5954400	fuck becky hi i mean hi um anyway and julian never say that at school so anyway um you can create
5954400	5959280	your own storylines you know with dialogue and everything you can have different events happen
5959920	5968160	and someone redid the did one called vince russo takes over the wwe and vince russo was the guy
5968160	5978080	who was responsible for degeneration x and all of the really just wanky era of you know early 2000s
5978080	5984160	late 90s wrestling so it's actually the funniest thing i've ever seen is the vince russo takes
5984160	5989840	over for a day because it parodies everything that's wrong with wrestling and that is the
5989840	5997360	reason to have this game is just to download vince russo's day i can't stop thinking about
5997360	6005600	drag queens commenting on wrestling i'm sorry you can actually make drag queens in wwe 2k14 yes
6006160	6011680	you know what mr peanut they made mr peanut they actually had a wrestling challenge in an episode
6011680	6015840	of rupaul's drag race now that i think about it i think it was a couple seasons ago anyway
6015840	6021520	aha someone gets it john cena versus mr peanut yes i am not the only one who has seen this
6022080	6028640	it is the funniest shit i have ever i was cracking up and normally i was like dan's watching another
6028640	6034960	game you know youtube he's not playing it he just oh my god it's mr peanut uh pretty funny dark
6034960	6040960	tetsuya in our chat says down abby wrestling hey there's our next dream game um yeah i would
6040960	6046000	support that as well our dream game down abby wrestling yes you know i liked the undertaker
6046000	6050320	better when he was in the whole biker thing now that he's gone back to the undead thing is just
6050320	6056640	so unrealistic oh and i don't understand how did the undead just come up and wrestle
6058480	6065920	but they're dead what about absolutely what about absolutely fabulous wrestling wrestling all right
6066480	6072240	we need to move on rapid fire news taking over i'm just glad somebody else's has seen what i'm
6072240	6078240	talking about are you officially done are you can you officially not even anymore unspent
6079680	6081920	then let's get to the frugal question of the week
6089040	6094720	take facebook and you take google and you slam those words together and you get frugal
6096880	6102400	and we ask a question of our fan communities over at facebook.com orange launch radio and
6102400	6108240	google.com plus orange launch radio we ask questions of our fan communities there every
6108240	6112960	week and this week is all about the remastering of games that we were mentioning a minute ago
6113760	6118720	after much speculation it was confirmed this week that the last of us is being remastered
6118720	6124240	and re-released on the playstation 4 is there a game from the last era of consoles like 360
6124320	6129520	playstation 3 we that you'd like to see remastered for the new era of consoles like the one the
6129520	6135840	playstation 4 that we do or do you think these remasterings are cash grabs whose resources could
6135840	6144560	be better spent somewhere else let's get to some of the answers tonight um actdef starting us off
6144560	6151840	with a haiku our favorite form of answer i will always read a haiku actdef says hd remakes good
6151840	6154960	but only if they offer new stuff in the game
6157520	6163360	very good very good uh scott g on google plus says left for dead 2 please you know what though
6163360	6166720	if you're gonna go for left for dead 2 why not why not hold out for a left for dead 3
6166720	6170240	would you really want a left for dead 2 remake over a left for dead 3
6170240	6172400	i mean i guess that could be said for a lot of these games though
6174400	6180560	uh let's see uh we go to redertainment who says no any re-release of a 360 ps3
6180800	6184480	game is a blatant cash grab and would make me wonder loudly why they can't just make
6184480	6189200	the new consoles backwards compatible besides i still have the previous generation of consoles
6189200	6193200	in perfect working condition and can buy games for those consoles quite expediently
6193200	6197520	that being said ask me this question again in a couple years my opinion might change
6198400	6205040	um travis h says personally i don't know if the gaming devs have ran out of ideas too lazy or not
6205040	6209280	enough funds to create new titles i think we've lived in the heyday of gaming as 30 and 40
6209280	6213920	somethings that being said a game that came out less than a year ago is nothing more than a cash
6213920	6218720	grab i'm playing through the last of us right now and have no means whatsoever to spend another 60
6218720	6224880	40 or 20 to buy it again for my playstation 4 that's right even if it was 20 bucks they can
6224880	6231840	keep it i think the playstation 3 version of the game is as beautiful as is you gotta wonder is
6231840	6239440	this game really targeted for people who only missed or who didn't own playstation 3 and missed
6239440	6243840	it completely yet they have a playstation 4 because ps4 is selling so well i don't know
6244960	6252320	let's go to some of the answers over on facebook um renee uh answers and says remastered games i'd
6252320	6259200	love to see uh bayonetta on playstation 3 no more heroes on the wii no more heroes 2 on the wii and
6259280	6265360	samba de amigo on the wii yes silly i know but it was fun but that in turn if you think about
6265360	6270320	it was a remastered game for the generation before so you would be making a copy of a copy
6270320	6276160	at that point although samba de amigo is worth it samba de amigo is a good good time uh let's see
6276160	6282160	andy r says valkyria chronicles yes that would be a great one actually uh ronnie b says i think it's
6282160	6288880	silly to remaster a game instead why not make a sequel with more improvements awesome unicorn
6289440	6294080	if a game is going to be remastered my main hope would be that it would give the game a chance that
6294080	6299360	it didn't have the first time a game that seems like a prime candidate is xenoblade chronicles
6299360	6303760	the game is a masterpiece that many people overlooked simply because they had already
6303760	6308160	moved on from the wii or because they claimed that the graphics simply were not good enough
6308160	6312960	to them that's a great candidate by the way i i actually really really agree with that answer
6312960	6320720	good job um let's see uh rod l replied and said there needs to be enough of a gap in the tech
6320720	6326800	to make the remake noticeable for example final fantasy 10 and 10 2 the last of us is too recent
6326800	6331760	to make it a valuable purchase for anyone who picked it up already that said a skyrim remake
6331760	6336800	might be awesome especially considering how broken that game was on playstation 3 and have a good
6336800	6342400	show well thank you you know most people don't sign off saying have a good show or you know hope
6342400	6348080	your day is super so thank you very much i appreciate that thought uh our buddy captain
6348080	6352960	spike from the game buoy.org podcast we love those guys over game boy and let me take this
6352960	6359280	opportunity to shout out game buoy on a happy two-year special because they hit two years
6359280	6363760	and happy episode 50 because they they're on a two episode a month production schedule
6363760	6367280	but happy episode 50 to uh captain spike and first mate slidekick yay
6368000	6374480	now captain spike says i'd kill for playstation 4 remasters of infamous one
6374480	6382720	two and festival of blood uh let's see our pal delvin from the show video game realness and
6382720	6387280	that's a really fun show if uh you want to hear some sassy commentary on video games out of
6387280	6392320	toronto video game realness is your show and delvin says remastering a game less than a year
6392320	6398560	old i.e tomb raider and now the last of us an absolute cash grab it's ridiculous just release
6398560	6403920	them all at the same time when it's so soon and i guess since i'm shouting out other podcasts i'll
6403920	6409040	shout out koopa club and ian from that show answered as well and ian says i double dipped
6409040	6413680	on tomb raider but i don't plan to on the last of us the story was great but the gameplay isn't
6413680	6419200	worth it to me to go through again i like my powerful females better anyway i want to see
6419200	6425600	final fantasy 12 get the hd treatment or for some reason skyward sword yes yes yes to final
6425600	6430800	fantasy 12 that's like the one reason i want final fantasy 10 to sell really really well is i really
6430800	6437040	want fantasy 12 to get another release and another chance because when final fantasy 12 came out like
6437040	6441840	this like right around the same time the xbox 360 did it just yeah it was lost a little bit
6441840	6446960	and that game is so good and the battle system is so good like oh my god i so agree i so agree
6446960	6452160	all right lastly nemesis 47 says i may get this on the playstation 4 given this game will have
6452160	6457840	all the ps3 dlc expansions included and it's updated for the power of the playstation 4
6457840	6462240	since the last of us is a clever and epic game and in a way it's kind of the game of year edition
6462240	6466080	as for what game i want to see updated from the last gen i'd love to see the guilty gear
6466080	6471600	franchise or even blaze blue updated in hd on the playstation 4 as long as we get new content such
6471600	6476640	as characters more story or even more content than the same game we played millions of times
6476640	6482240	maybe even a batman arkham game would be awesome on the playstation 4 as well well there's gonna
6482240	6486640	be a batman arkham game on yeah there's gonna be the new one is now on playstation 4 right so
6486640	6491680	you have that to look forward to all right so those are some of the answers from our facebook
6491680	6495440	community please visit our community to read the rest of them because there's some other answers
6495440	6502880	they're worth your time facebook.com orange lounge radio uh quickly you guys thoughts on games from
6502880	6508800	the last gen that should be updated or should they stop this practice all together final
6508800	6513760	fantasy 7 final fantasy 7 now you're going back a few generations but i suppose for final fantasy
6513760	6520560	12 you're going back a few generations as well so we should accept that answer too because it's it's
6520560	6528000	long since time i mean uh and if i'm gonna go to that same era then i'm gonna say new jumping
6528000	6533040	flash as well bring back jumping flash why not because the closest thing i have to jumping flash
6533040	6538640	is robot uh drunken robot pornography um i am gonna absolutely agree with the listener who
6538640	6543520	said xenoblade chronicles i think that's a great choice as is uh you know what again because the
6543520	6550160	game was horrifically underrated lost odyssey i want to see that redone although that will never
6550160	6554960	happen how about a lost odyssey 2 throw me a freaking bone here i need to go back and finish
6554960	6559360	that game it was first i need to find the disc for that game and then i need to go back and
6559360	6563840	do you want to borrow mine i have mine somewhere but once again also i still have to finish final
6563840	6571520	fantasy 13 the first one yeah and i kind of don't want to so but that's any that because i finish
6571520	6576640	all my final fantasy games there's not this is the first 12 12 was a long one i didn't play 12
6576640	6582640	oh shame shame what about a game for you that you would remaster um twist them all black
6583280	6589200	um you were really into that simil was really terrible yeah i hear they just try to do too
6589200	6595600	much weird stuff but like just take the older ones and make them really cool looking don't do
6595600	6602640	anything fancy just you know new new levels new characters done don't don't try to add mechs or
6602640	6609440	blimps or helicopters none of that shit made any sense just new characters new maps that's all you
6609520	6614080	have to do why don't they just realize it's all you need to do new characters new maps done
6615440	6618880	something just occurred to me i'd like to see the grandia series remade
6618880	6625440	oh like make make it have all the good music and all the cool stuff that the saturn version had
6626080	6630800	but bring everything up to date you know touch up the keep it sprite based even i don't care
6630800	6636320	i just want to see you know better music you know the music remastered the levels you know touched
6636320	6642560	up and be as expansive as it was on the saturn rather than the kind of crappy uh rendition the
6642560	6648160	playstation got and then bring out grandia 2 or if we're just going to go to fan wank here i would
6648160	6653680	love to see a version of legends of link to the past um done in the style of legends all the wind
6653680	6659280	waker but i'm not talking about like a top down game i'm talking about full 3d zelda game where
6659280	6664400	i can pan that camera around wherever i want the hint of it you get in oh that pissed me off like
6664960	6670640	what the hell this could have been this and instead you're just like ah fucking flood
6670640	6676000	the shit you know it's like i was like what the hell yeah exactly that's what i'd want to see
6676000	6681360	spoiler for a years old game uh anyhow uh the other thing i was going to say uh raginator in
6681360	6684320	chat brings up a really good point i do want to move on from this topic this is a really good
6684320	6688400	point about a very important component we're missing in the equation and raginator in chat
6688400	6694240	at live dot com says we already have final fantasy 7 and 8 on steam and i have both but
6694240	6699280	now we need to get the rest of them we are leaving pc out of the equation when we talk about these
6699280	6703760	remastering how does pc fit into all this because when you're talking about grandia my mind went to
6703760	6709440	oh yeah i played the ease uh remakes that are on steam on pc and they're really good so yeah
6710720	6717600	it was surprising we had you know the east got the remakes and not you know other games that
6717600	6721680	i mean as in the east series they're all great don't get me wrong yeah but the fighting is so
6721680	6726720	weird in that game now by today's standards like the fact is like bump bump jump i wish
6726720	6732320	they would bring the uh was it the four remake um to steam you know the one that they did with
6732320	6737360	all the extra dlc stuff that they had on we and stuff remember that i wish they would bring that
6737360	6743440	back in also the remake yeah i don't know if i want the remake of six but i like six i think
6743440	6748320	the original four remade the four remake on honestly on the psp was like the best one that's
6748320	6753920	what i'm saying yeah like that this is great all right uh let's move on we're getting we're getting
6753920	6757840	hung up a little bit on the remakes thing and we want to have time for your call so let's move on
6757840	6764480	with some more news loki all right um so this is kind of neat there's an yet another game that
6764480	6772000	harmonix is announcing and not the you know they like to do games with uh you know any sort of
6772000	6778480	rhythm based elements in there and this new one is going to be um a game called record run
6778480	6784320	it's i guess they said it's like a rhythm runner and it's coming to mobile platforms uh it sounds
6784320	6792560	a lot like the uh bit trip games but um they're saying that it's going to use i guess um your
6792560	6799680	music as a way to generate you know obstacles and stuff so kind of like bit trip meets like uh
6800640	6806400	vib ribbon or something like that um i don't know so that sounds kind of cool
6808400	6811440	uh this is the game that zaku was talking about a little bit in that phone call in the beginning
6811440	6817520	of the show right i think so yeah sounds like uh it sounds like it uh it looks to be pretty cool
6817520	6822080	and it's it's nice to see some of the other stuff harmonix is working on now now we have an idea
6822080	6827920	what life is like after rock band and uh you know well although you know this this isn't in
6827920	6832240	the show role per se but i do distinctly remember reading an article about a comment was made
6832240	6836560	that rock band and dan central are not gone that they're just they're slumbering but they're they
6836560	6841920	would like to see those games come back for the you know these new eras of consoles that we have
6841920	6846800	i think we just have to figure out what to do different and how to add how do you add to that
6846800	6851840	how to convince me to buy new peripherals all the freaking over again like if that you don't
6851840	6856240	need new peripherals for run you know dance center well if they well that's essentially you don't and
6856240	6862720	then for uh come to think of it yeah for um it was all usb on playstation 3 right so they could
6862720	6869360	technically support all that which they were they should if they were smart although some of those
6869360	6876720	were wireless so that would be kind of a no-no type thing um but if you had the wired ones i
6876720	6883680	would hope that they'd still support that stuff right i don't know all right well uh i'm looking
6883680	6888720	forward to checking that out when it comes out and uh it sounds like it's uh very affordable
6889520	6897440	yeah so all right um some interesting changes at pax east and you know i forgot to ask rama
6897440	6902640	about how that diversity lounge thing oh yeah is that the first time that they did that this year
6902640	6907120	yeah i was curious about what that was what that all entailed because i haven't seen a lot of
6907120	6913440	reports on that but i have heard about some of the other um uh things that are that were interesting
6914320	6920880	uh happening at pax east for example um there were bag search stations so every entrance into
6920880	6925040	the boston convention center you had to get your bag searched which is actually a standard security
6925040	6930560	protocol they do it at e3 as well if i remember right they do it at e3 yeah yeah and also you
6930560	6936320	know since it is in boston i mean not too long ago we have the whole boston you know bombing
6936320	6941520	things so i'm sure that they're still on edge a little close to home yeah and you know most people
6941520	6944400	are like you know they understand you know if you're going to go to a big place that there's
6944400	6947600	a lot of people you understand they do it at disneyland they do it you know they do it anywhere
6947600	6953280	there's going to be a whole lot of people uh there so there is that uh what is also interesting a
6953280	6960240	last minute request from the city was to change some of the bathrooms at the convention center
6960240	6964320	because and this was a request of the city and this is important because you know unfortunately
6964320	6969840	pax has not had the best reputation in the past with some of its you know the creators of penny
6969840	6974560	arcade and some of their views on things so it's important to note that the city requested that
6974560	6981040	because of the number of people in the building and the fact that it skews male 65 35 they had
6981040	6988320	to convert some of the restrooms so some of the women's restrooms became men's restrooms so they
6988320	6995440	changed that uh so that's what they did um and they wanted to what uh actually one of the creators
6995440	7000000	of the con was a little confused because he was like did we have problems last year no
7000000	7006240	and he actually asked if they could change six women's restrooms into gender neutral rooms that
7006240	7012800	could be used by either gender and the city actually said no about that so uh very uh
7012800	7021360	interesting uh changes at pax east so that's kind of an auto request i mean i understand i guess i
7021360	7026320	get it but some of the things i'm hearing is that because of the change some women were really
7026320	7030640	inconvenienced because they couldn't use the bathrooms closest to them they had to go clear
7030640	7034560	a clock across the floor to go to the one that wasn't converted and if i was the woman there at
7034560	7038640	the show i'd be a little bit frustrated i think i think it would be hard for me to go oh well i
7038640	7044720	understand in the moment that this convention is mostly men when i'm already feeling under yeah
7044720	7048560	exactly they're not gonna think oh the city requested that they're just gonna think oh well
7048560	7053360	they're just being dicks and they don't care about women so jamie you know i've got to ask
7053360	7057760	you your thoughts on this being the woman on our panel here do you think it was fair of the city to
7057760	7067040	ask pax east to change some of those restrooms when okay excuse mail i wasn't there i mean
7068080	7071760	well we did go to pax a few years ago so you've been to something similar yeah i
7072560	7078000	i wouldn't have changed him honestly because just in my experience we have to pee more often
7078000	7083360	i mean seriously i'm not even making up anything there i have noticed that i typically have to
7083360	7090960	pee more than my male co-workers do um so i think if they were already because the whatever the
7090960	7098320	convention center is supposed to be is set for a particular standard for average use am i correct
7099520	7105280	so then all of the restrooms should have stayed the way they were all the anime cons i've gone to
7105280	7108880	have stayed the way they were when i've gone to classic gaming expo they've stayed the way
7108880	7114640	they were when we went to pax i didn't see any bathrooms being converted there and i ran into
7114640	7121680	more guys everywhere that i cared to see you know but i'm saying you know it's
7124800	7130480	get over your male privilege um now going to other convention news real quick i wanted to
7130480	7133760	throw this out there because this was some news that was kind of late breaking today
7133760	7138480	but uh some tweets from the folks behind gamer x which is the convention that you know we've
7138480	7142160	talked a lot about on this show because i went last year and i had a great time i'm dragging
7142160	7146720	dark sakura with me this year if if loki didn't have the baby at home i'd probably make him go too
7146720	7151920	but uh we're gonna go to gamer x this year uh well they've actually come out and said on twitter
7151920	7157360	this is gonna be the last year of gamer x um which is yeah it's kind of it's it's sad i mean
7157360	7160880	i understand it from a financial perspective if they're not making money on the convention
7160880	7164240	then they're not going to continue to do the convention i get that but just from the standard
7164240	7170640	of i really liked having this convention um i'm very disappointed to see it go and wish we could
7170640	7176400	somehow stick around i think i think they're really challenged with getting the perception
7176400	7181360	out there and it's really important to know so allow me to state this explicitly for folks
7182160	7189200	gamer x is not a convention just for gay lesbian transgender you know the quilt bag the whole
7189200	7195760	spectrum gamer x is not just a place for that gamer x is a place for everybody that you know
7195760	7202000	brings light and attention to some of these you know issues and most importantly is a safe space
7202000	7207840	and a common ground for gay gamers and i'm gonna tell you that was really important to me
7208400	7215280	as a gay gamer because you know in the in the nerd community sometimes you know it's like oh
7215280	7219760	you're gay i don't understand gay people gay but you know at least not i mean it's getting better
7219760	7225600	it really i mean as opposed to when i first came out 15 years ago christ i'm dating myself but
7225600	7230560	you know as opposed to when i first came out and now it is getting a lot better and you know you
7230560	7236160	have the people that are our age and younger and a little bit older to thank for that there really
7236160	7243280	is a generational shift in the way we think and tumblr don't forget tumblr i'm not i don't really
7243280	7249440	want to thank tumblr for anything except for pornography um i i had to know the stab i will
7249440	7255040	thank tumblr for this i will thank tumblr for this this is the greatest analogy that i have seen
7255040	7262800	in answering the question well if you get a gamer x why don't we have a straighter x and the analogy
7262800	7268240	on tumblr that i saw is it's the same reason that in mario kart you don't get a blue shell when
7268240	7276720	you're in first place think about it yeah now as i was saying a minute ago another reason why i
7276720	7283120	liked gamer x is because as a gay guy believe it or not you you also face some of that again little
7283120	7289120	worse 15 years ago and it is now thanks to things like gamer x but as a gay guy it's like oh you
7289120	7295920	don't like these certain things or you don't fit into these certain molds of what you know a gay
7295920	7300720	gay person is you're a you're a nerd you can't be a nerd and gay like literally i have had eyes
7300720	7305040	rolled at me yeah i have had dates in the past that have gone bad because it came out that i
7305040	7309200	did a radio show about video games and it's like oh this guy's a bit too nerdy for me i want to
7309200	7316480	talk about you know my eye rolling is at that behavior yeah i'm sorry people the bits that
7316480	7323040	you do or do not enjoy has nothing to do with the things that you like you know what i mean
7323760	7331040	you can you can like dick and mario right it's they're not mutually exclusive um at
7331040	7335600	defton chat says i hope rob didn't read the joystick commenters because joystick ran an
7335600	7339520	article on this earlier today and of course the comment section turned into a cesspool
7339520	7342880	when usually joystick has one of the better commenting sites on the internet but you know
7342880	7346880	that's just the the rule of the internet don't read the comments i made that mistake i read the
7346880	7355680	comments you know here's the thing i how do you like it as a nerd how do you like it you know
7355680	7361920	because if you're listening to if you downloaded a podcast about video games i'm going to speculate
7361920	7367040	you're probably a bit of a nerd and you've probably had certain stereotypes thrown at you
7367040	7374000	in your life like oh you grew up in your parents basement or oh you're fat you smell you have bad
7374000	7380480	hygiene or you know you you don't know how to play sports you can't do any physical activity
7380480	7386560	right i'm sure many nerds have had those things slung at them in their lives so when i and i i
7386560	7391920	think a lot of those comments are ignorant you know it's like you don't i mean being a nerd is
7391920	7397120	is empowering its culture it's part of what i what it's part of who i am and what i enjoy and
7397120	7402400	the things the things that give me pleasure in life great stories great characters superheroes
7402400	7407280	that save the day in a very mundane society all those things are great about being a nerd right
7407920	7413520	so when i go to joystick and i read comments like well this convention was just set up so
7413520	7424160	a gay a bunch of gay guys could get together and hook up really really i go that's as fucking
7424160	7430000	ignorant as those comments i i i get as a nerd about living in my parents basement and fat etc
7430000	7438000	etc that is just as ignorant because people don't hook up at straight conventions or do i have to
7438000	7443440	get rama back on this show to talk about what goes on at anime conventions or how about on the fuck
7443440	7448960	on how about you know not even so far as anime conventions but one of the big not really big
7448960	7457440	stories but one of the troll trolling for hits stories from like last year or so about uh pax
7457440	7462960	west or whatever was the whole craigslist post for you know trying to get together or swingers
7462960	7468960	party or something from you know attendees so yeah that shit kind of happens or just the thing
7468960	7475040	that you get when you cosplay when you're a girl cosplaying and you get the guys out there thinking
7475040	7481280	that they can tell you how to pose touch you without your consent i don't let anybody touch
7481280	7486720	me i punch somebody one year this is the year i did the bike in cosplay that dan didn't like because
7486720	7495200	you too much boob and some guy tried to move my shoulder to pose me in a certain way and i just
7495200	7505360	did you know flicked out my hand and and punched him in the sternum and he left cursing quite a bit
7505360	7515040	but he left and left me alone um but uh you know if if it wasn't for people you know trying to
7516160	7521440	think everything is about a hookup we wouldn't need the cosplay does not equal consent movement
7522160	7527120	we wouldn't need to have different conventions so that people can feel safe in other environments
7528400	7532480	fucking should have nothing to do with having fun it can be fun for some people
7532480	7536240	but it should not if you want a convention about fucking go to the fulsome street fair
7537360	7543040	or better yet dory alley you'll see some things that will shock you or the back end
7543040	7546400	eye blush at some of the things i've seen out of that or the back end of the castor street
7546400	7550640	fair but then again the back end of the castor street fair is also drag queen territory and
7550640	7554800	that is the best place anyway i just want to end with this thoughts here because black wolf says
7554800	7562800	this uh the joystick comments quote e3 is for everybody herder here's the message that
7562800	7570960	unfortunately is getting lost in this internet cesspool e3 is for everybody so is gamer x
7574240	7578640	that's unfortunately the message that's being lost and e3 is not for everybody e3 is for
7579600	7585120	that's true industry people oh you want to go e3 well now fuck off yeah okay then pax is for
7585120	7589920	everybody that was able to click the button within 15 minutes you know or what have you and then but
7589920	7595280	then you hear stories about well because the city said it's too much of an imbalance between men
7595280	7599360	and women women have to walk further to get to the restroom you look at that and go is pax east
7599360	7604720	really for everybody i mean granted that was out of their control i'm not harping on them for that
7604720	7609840	but it's you know you can't look at a a thing like that and go is this really for everybody
7609840	7615120	yeah but what what it what prompted the city to make that kind of decision was it because of all
7615120	7619600	was it because of all the bad press that they had gotten before about this kind of thing or is it
7619600	7626400	because of you know because i've never ever heard a convention their politicians loki they do weird
7626400	7630800	shit i've what i've met this is the very first convention i've ever heard that had the convert
7630800	7635760	bathrooms from women to men i mean this is the first you know if they're gonna do that
7635760	7641280	then why don't they just go back and segregate them again if you wanted to solve this issue we
7641280	7645280	could do like other countries do and have all bathrooms and unisex instead of a diversity
7645280	7649280	lounge let's have a men's only smoking lounge that's what we should have right oh there's
7649280	7656560	gentlemen's clubs they already have that to be fair though a lot of women i know have a great
7656560	7662720	time at a gentleman's club when when i go out with my lady friends her gentleman's club is
7662720	7667440	actually usually towards the top of the list of good ideas to be fair i would also like to respond
7667440	7672560	to what nemesis 47 said there's nothing wrong in asking for pics it's not good or gentlemanly to
7672560	7679280	touch girls in that way well it also goes the same way for a woman don't touch a man without asking
7679280	7684800	absolutely his consent or a man to touch another man you know bumping into somebody you know
7684800	7689760	nudging somebody being friendly you know wanting to shake someone's hand that's one thing that is
7689760	7698240	you are inviting contact don't force the issue if it's not reciprocated and don't and the reason why
7698240	7703120	i think that there's a little bit more focus on doing it towards women than towards men and men
7703120	7708640	can be victimized as well that that goes without saying it happens it happens regularly and it
7708640	7714000	doesn't get reported because you know there's also this sort of masculinity thing that you know men
7714000	7725520	are expected to adhere to um as well but um going back to that i think that it's still a perception
7725520	7730800	that because you really don't see it to happen that often with male cosplayers being harassed
7730800	7736160	the way that female cosplayers are all right anyway if you have more thoughts on the subject
7736160	7739360	just in the interest of keeping these rolling along because i went i went on that tangent way
7739360	7743920	too long sorry guys sometimes when things hit a little close to home i get a little ranty
7744560	7749280	participate at orange laundry.com if you want to participate in our mailbag segment with your
7749280	7753680	further thoughts we're going to get to uh our mailbag uh from this week here very soon but
7753680	7759200	we still have a few more stories to get to first dark sakura oh yeah i do have another one don't i
7759200	7765360	um well you know we've been talking about the net neutrality thing off and on well there's a
7765360	7772960	report that came out that comcast sent a campaign contributions to every member of the senate
7772960	7782800	judiciary committee um so that means they're probably uh not going to uh get well it means
7782800	7787040	they're probably going to have more than enough support for their merger with time warner cable
7787680	7794160	um but that's also you know leading more and more towards a lot of
7795840	7801760	what's the word i'm thinking of favoritism wank you know especially but see here is
7803040	7807120	the big thing here is that basically there were so many of the people in the senate
7807120	7812800	judiciary committee who um who were there for the congressional hearing on the comcast
7813680	7821760	twc merger um but a lot of the big uh people who spoke out against it including al franken
7822800	7828640	received money from comcast uh the comcast pac gave five thousand dollars to his recount fund
7828640	7837920	in 2009 and he also um received 15 grand from comcast employees since 2009 so what we're looking
7837920	7846320	at these are the ones um for democrat side we had uh chuck schumer uh patrick leary lee he um
7846320	7853760	sheldon whitehouse chris coons dick durbin amy klow bacher diane feinstein richard blumenthal
7853760	7862080	mazy hirono and al franken and on the republican side uh oren hatch chuck grassley john corn
7862880	7870480	cornin leslie gramm jeff sessions mike lee ted cruz ted cruz is an asshole anyway and jeff flake
7870480	7878240	but i mean how can we take how can we expect any of these people who we have voted for
7878960	7885680	in our government to be impartial parties when they're all on corporate bankroll
7888560	7892560	it's one of those questions that goes a lot deeper than i think this show can even get into
7892560	7896080	but just so just so we're clear because there might be people listening to this
7896080	7901600	going well this isn't necessarily video game news why does a gamer want to care about this
7902640	7907280	because first of all you know especially going back into the net neutrality stuff
7907280	7914320	if you have say that you have someone who's a company that's not comcast say that comcast
7914320	7920400	and time warner do this big merger they also get control over you know the bandwidth they get like
7920400	7925680	exclusive rights and you're left out of the loop well you know we're leaning more towards them
7925680	7930000	trying to gain a higher market share and get closer and closer i mean i honestly see a lot
7930000	7935280	of these mergers turning awfully close to almost being a monopoly you know but
7937200	7940800	especially also with so many of our games requiring that you be online
7942480	7948800	with them being able to yoke and control what you're saying while using their product yeah
7948800	7954880	there's a big thing behind it you know there's way more than i would be able to discuss but it's
7954880	7964480	still important the people know that the people that they voted for are and you as a gamer do
7964480	7970000	have a voice and that voice is your vote you know yeah and i i realize we're a worldwide show so the
7970000	7975120	circumstances may be different in your country but the you know in in most countries that listen to
7975120	7980320	this show you know they run somewhat in a democratic process one way or another so you
7980320	7988480	know you have a voice use it make your lawmakers understand why these things are bad because
7988480	7993760	i'll tell you what the threaten of not being re-elected speaks a lot louder than some of
7993760	7999760	these financial contributions i mean there was another thing that i was reading about too about
8000080	8007440	uh yi leland yi was trying to also still propose um something about uh
8008400	8012960	donation uh campaign donations not being able to be used or not being able to accept
8012960	8018720	campation campaign donations in the form of trips gifts and you know basically what should
8018720	8023920	be bribery anyway that people are passing off as donations yet he was doing all that and far more
8023920	8027680	oh and there is more the the philippine government is actually calling for him
8028400	8035600	to stand trial oh geez so yeah dude's in hot shit right now he is in boiling vats of oily shit
8037200	8043920	ew yeah all right let's move on uh an issue that we just don't have enough time here on the show
8043920	8049200	to discuss but uh you know now we've planted the seed in your head use your voices tiger
8049200	8055120	claw did post a link to the consumerist listing them as uh that one of the worst companies in
8055120	8061520	america for 2014 uh comcast oh yeah they won they won this year i don't i don't really talk
8061520	8065840	i mean when ea won that poll for a couple years i was like who fucking cares it's some website on
8065840	8071040	the internet you know and they're little they're little tin can award but so i don't think that's
8071040	8076960	too much too big of a deal but i think it does show if nothing else i mean ea was not even i
8076960	8080080	mean i think they were a contender but they didn't even make like they didn't even get past their
8080080	8085680	first round this year you know people are really fed up with some of the ways i don't think that
8085680	8091280	necessarily speaks to comcast as a company i mean it does but i think that speaks to a lot of how
8091280	8096960	people feel that comcast needs to be better regulated well also in my job at locat i hear
8096960	8105920	from a great many of our customers who use comcast as their isp and whenever i have to say well this
8105920	8110960	is something going on with comcast like i don't want to call them i really don't want to call them
8111600	8116080	and there's you know and i have friends that work for comcast and things like that and i know you
8116080	8120480	know obviously there's a lot of good people but the problem with comcast is it's getting too big
8120480	8124720	it really is i mean that's that goes for almost any big company when companies get too big the
8124720	8127920	left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing and that's when you get sent to 500 different
8127920	8131680	departments before you get your issue resolved and all that stuff and then they they talk about
8131680	8136320	they want to get even bigger that's that's a concern huge one that's one of the reasons that
8136320	8143040	i really super like locat which i can't really go into more detail about is that a lot of what
8143040	8149200	they've been doing they're big but they focus more on keeping it to certain things you know
8150960	8156000	it's there's a constant communication there's constant training there's constant making sure
8156000	8161200	everyone knows what the other party is doing and i wish other companies focused on that same type
8161280	8166240	of philosophy it sounds like from what you've told me about your organization as well as that
8166240	8172400	there's very clearly defined roles there are yet you dabble your fingers in other pots as
8172400	8176720	appropriate exactly that's a good way to do it my company kind of does that is a completely
8176720	8180240	different industry but we do that a little bit too and i think it helps a lot yeah and i honestly
8180240	8185920	think that ea has tried to do quite a number of things to clean up their reputation so they're
8185920	8195520	doing better all right um let's move on loki all right um so let's see they've got some new dlc
8195520	8205040	coming for uh titanfall and uh i should say the first of some dlc so it's a new map pack called
8205040	8211840	expedition it's coming in may and it includes uh some new maps including runoff swamp lands and
8211840	8218000	war games uh i know war games is supposed to take place in actually the training simulation
8218000	8222880	program that you use in the beginning of the game uh also they're saying that they're going to be
8222880	8229120	doing a free update which is going to include a new two uh two versus two last titan standing mode
8229120	8234000	as well as some other uh updates as well and hey uh rob this is actually kind of cool i mean you
8234000	8238080	remember one of my bitches about the game was that there was no private match mode well they
8238080	8242800	actually added that in so about time yeah so weren't they saying that was supposed to be in
8242800	8248320	like a week after release been a little while well it was technically in the week after release of
8248320	8256160	the 360 version so um and of course the dlc pack is going to be 999 or if you opt to go the season
8256160	8262000	pass they'll save you five bucks and it's 24.99 because they're going to be doing three different
8262080	8269200	dlc packs so i don't know i still want to get it on 360 but i haven't got a chance to yet
8270640	8274080	yeah i kind of want to pick up the game as well i think when i get that new computer i'll probably
8274080	8280160	end up getting titanfall on pc yeah pc looks really good yeah it i could get it on pc i guess
8281120	8284880	well something i could play on pc in the interim or if i'm in certain countries i could play it on
8284880	8290720	an ipad is hearthstone and some information coming out of packs east because blizzard was there
8290720	8295680	involves a an expansion of sorts to hearthstone it's not really an expansion but it's called
8295680	8302080	the curse of nox from us which uh was uh dungeon in that was one of my favorites yeah it was early
8302080	8307120	world of warcraft and they revived it for wrath of the lich king so um it's a hearthstone adventure
8307120	8311280	and what this is it's a single player mode because you know right now hearthstone i mean you do have
8311280	8314480	single player where it can be you versus the computer but there's not a lot that expands on
8314480	8320240	that so curse of nox from us a hearthstone adventure will have new cards a new game board
8320240	8324800	bosses and class specific challenges um so yeah that's something that's going to be coming to
8324800	8329920	hearthstone uh the adventure will not be available all at once and it will be over the course of five
8329920	8335040	weeks where the wings will open one by one which sounds a lot like the raid whatever has different
8335040	8338960	wings and so forth so that'll be kind of funny um in order to gain entry you're going to have
8338960	8345440	to purchase it with in-game gold or real money because our stone is free to play after all
8345440	8350640	so you gotta play a lot of in the games or you gotta use plunker down the 99 cents or 99 or
8350640	8356160	whatever the first wing of course will be free um so there you go when you complete a wing you will
8356160	8361440	get a new legendary card so you at least you have that to look forward to for actually completing
8361440	8366640	things 30 new cards will be added with curse of nox from us they will not be dungeon locked so
8366640	8372160	you can use them in decks when other game modes as well uh don't know when that's coming out
8372160	8377040	but it should be coming out simultaneously with pc mac and ipad i would assume that means later
8377040	8383840	this year once they get the ipad version of the game all hammered out we'll see so all right i
8383840	8390000	think it's time to take a trip to our mailbag because every week you guys email us at mailbag
8390000	8396640	oops excuse me participate you email our mailbag at participate at orange lounge radio dot com how
8396640	8402720	many how many weeks until i get the damn address right never never probably participate at orange
8402720	8407200	launch radio.com is the place to send your emails and dark remember we had to close the old one that
8407200	8416080	i can't get out of my mouth because uh i'm curious if i reopened it what i'd get if i'd still get
8416080	8421200	spam or if it finally is upon flushed out at this point it all bounced i don't know it'll all be in
8421200	8425680	russian well regardless you'll want to send those emails to participate at orange hundred dot com
8425680	8430080	dark soccer's gonna dive into the uh email bag and pick out her favorite emails to read tonight
8432000	8435840	to reach the participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com
8435840	8440960	use the passphrase forest hello jamie loki and rob i like jamie the best sorry boys
8441280	8445680	oh god it's gonna be one of those emails you know who it is who can you guess
8448400	8453440	i'm trying to think of jamie fans and i'm coming up blank i would write into horde house but as
8453440	8458800	pax is going on right now by the time oh it's gamut it's getting it it would be too late i'm
8458800	8464320	sure i'm curious what you all think about blizzard's choice to announce the azeroth choppers
8464320	8469440	before the pax events have started do you think it's to pacify the player base yearning for some
8469440	8474640	kind of blizzcon information or is it a great pr stunt to get people talking about blizzard
8474640	8480160	games before the inevitable big thing that will come from a competitor either way it seems people
8480160	8485840	will have calmed down about blizzcon and the blizzard world chatter has picked up curious
8485840	8490080	about your thoughts love the show thanks for making my horrible commute so much better jamie
8490080	8497920	rocks gamut i love you we need to be friends on facebook oh god i actually don't know much about
8497920	8503280	this i've been seeing a little bit on twitter and i was just like even from like the little bits i
8503280	8514560	was seeing it sounded dumb but here's the deal i guess it's that show um what is that american
8514560	8519760	choppers or somewhere that's about motorbikes and they're actually having an alliance team and a
8519760	8526960	horde team based on world of warcraft essentially um work on new chopper designs uh so they're
8526960	8533840	going to infuse the essence of horde and alliance into each bike uh and then one chopper will reign
8533840	8538880	supreme and uh that will be voted on by world of warcraft players around the globe so it's
8538880	8545600	essentially going to be a horde versus alliance wankfest that involves motorcycles i don't this
8545600	8550560	is really like nothing to me this has nothing to do with anything i think it's kind of lame i would
8550560	8555040	rather it be like you can do bike races in game if you have the motorcycles yeah you do have the
8555040	8559680	motorcycles already in game that's cool well the bikes that they create end up in game now that's
8559680	8566400	kind of neat if that's the case but otherwise this is this is really a blip on the screen like
8566400	8572080	i don't think this has anything to do with it's it's a weird promotion to try to keep warcraft
8572080	8582480	on the tips of people's tongues honestly that's it so anyway how about less dead space there are
8582560	8590160	no more emails in the box no one loves us except gamut loves me well at least you got that you'll
8590160	8596240	always have gamut you'll always have gamut well we need more emails in future weeks so please
8596240	8603680	um send us an email participate at orange lounge radio.com so let's move on now that we're done
8603680	8608720	with the mailbag statement we're going to go to the fus of the week and we're going to get a
8608720	8629120	little bit ranty um i forgot my fus
8629120	8632880	so as you didn't admit enough you're jumping on my head

8692640	8702400	sad but uh one of the artists better known for some of the classic um arcade cabinet artworks
8702400	8711280	as including pinball as well um has died python angelo um he did the artwork for joust
8711920	8718960	uh taxi fishtails uh high speed and pinbot some of those of course being pinball machines
8719600	8729120	and uh yes unfortunately he has passed away but uh i don't know pretty great artists i mean
8729920	8736000	iconic that artwork is iconic dark sakura i mean you as a designer you got to know some of this
8736000	8742000	guy's work between the pinbot and the joust i mean all those like old school 80s games is iconic
8742000	8749280	yeah well we had a pinbot for a while i mean dan went on a rampage just listening to music from
8749280	8755840	pinbot like the whole day and he's like man we should have kept our pinbot and the design was
8755840	8761680	great i mean definitely had that you know kind of heavy metal magazine type of artwork to it too
8762240	8767280	but it was really i mean especially if they were able to reuse the game design for jackpot
8768000	8778400	so he was apparently fighting cancer so yeah you know what fuck cancer it's awful all right uh
8778400	8782640	one more story's for you guys and then we're gonna get to the skype line at 1877 game olr
8782640	8784640	or a username on skype orange lounge radio
8787440	8793120	excuse me guys sorry um don't try to eat and do live radio and no alan it's not another granola
8793120	8802480	bar i promise all right um we have a story about the pioneer laser active i'm thinking dark sakura
8802480	8807600	must know this system i vaguely remember this system but not like super well but it was uh
8807680	8811840	there was a this system that was the laser active and it was a laser disc
8811840	8818080	machine basically that actually played some games um now here's the thing what they're trying to do
8818080	8823200	on this uh particular forum it's a it's a mega ld dumping project basically where they're trying
8823200	8828880	to actually get all of these games together so that they can preserve these games i don't know
8828880	8833520	if it's to be used on emulators or or what the deal is but basically trying to preserve preserve
8833520	8838400	these laser active games for the future now it should be noted that a lot of the laser active
8838400	8842800	games in japan were pornographic they don't care they don't want to preserve those games they're
8842800	8847200	saying don't bother oh what the heck that's not fair yeah the guy says i don't want him in my
8847200	8850800	house and i don't want him around my kids is that you know what loki i think you need to start the
8850800	8856800	effort to preserve the pornographic them yeah all right we need to get the porno games you know what
8856800	8862320	somebody needs to love those games too there you go in fact they even say like which games they
8862320	8868400	are virtual cameraman and angel mate dora dora paradise all right anyway but there are some
8868400	8874400	big sega games that were on the system uh road blasters uh was there hyperion uh high roller
8874400	8879440	battle you know there's there's some pretty neat stuff there so uh check that out this is all going
8879440	8885520	on on a website uh spritesmind.net if you check out their forums there so that's it's a pretty
8885520	8891920	neat preservation project and a system the dark sakura doesn't seem to have in the vault so
8892560	8899680	well it's because i never wanted one we had we've had chances to get them just no until until uh
8900880	8910000	until um until you find out that there's porno games on it i'm just kidding all right um
8911600	8915040	all right we're gonna move on to the skype line i think it is time

8937600	8942560	up someone else's time that's all right what's up yeah i was unpacking stuff from the car and
8942560	8949520	mako was telling me that kotaku ran an article about hooking up hooking up at cons is what you're
8949520	8955760	supposed to do no no no no it wasn't for it thankfully it wasn't an article from the evil
8955760	8961360	k it wasn't that whole thing no it was uh some comments that we were seeing is that and we i
8961360	8966640	was talking about gamer x and i said uh there's comments out there that somebody said gamer x
8967280	8972320	the only reason it exists is because gay guys want to hook up and i said if you don't think
8972320	8977600	hooking up at any convention happens then let me get rama on here to tell you about what goes down
8977600	8984160	at anime conventions let me tell you something as many years i've gone to anime conventions
8984160	8990480	and hooking up it's a i'm surprised no female cosplay walked up to me and said you're the daddy
8990480	9004800	please you know um bobby made a comment in chat earlier that was um that was something
9004800	9011360	like if you can't get laid at dragon con you can't get laid at all that's right here and so
9011360	9016800	you know hey and that's no different from what from one of the after parties i went to last night
9016800	9023120	because here's my thing i understand that these add a lot of these after parties the male the

9031200	9039520	have sworn god like i got you okay it was like that but i get that and i understand that but
9039520	9044160	the thing that gets to me the most is have these guys that go there all they do is stand there in
9044160	9051600	the corner they pick up their phone and they're like i'm at the party it is awesome geeks and
9051600	9058960	nerds most of us have no rhythm i should know i'm black and i have two left feet and i still

9074480	9079360	dot vog network dot com and tiger claw and chat says i'm sure rama hooks up with other cosplayers
9079360	9088080	that's not the reason you go to these cons yeah i care to comment not anymore i'm i'm terrible i'm

9232480	9238880	but no they had a good uh setup there though as ron as ron said about uh couch nights
9239600	9247680	um yeah no i i uh definitely tried it a bunch of the indie games which rama also say you know
9247680	9255840	there's that actually i think got a lot more uh attention than you know like some of the big
9255840	9262480	big name boots which is good because you know so you know uh well rama was saying rama was
9262480	9267280	sorry rama was saying when he was here that at like 85 of the show was indie stuff was that
9267280	9272640	kind of your experience too um game wise yeah there was a lot there was a lot more playable
9272640	9279520	games on the indie side than there were on you know the major you know developer side i mean a
9279520	9284400	lot of the developer stuff like uh the borderlands people were there but they were showing like a
9284400	9290000	video for the prequel so i didn't even i didn't bother lining up for that but there were like a
9290000	9295760	there were a lot of good games i think i tweeted to you guys about krypton the necro dancer yeah

9301040	9307600	myself too yeah no that got a that got a huge following around it people going after it uh
9307600	9316880	there was another tiny there was another small game i tried that it's called um rollers of the
9316880	9327280	realm which is actually a pinball game that's an rpg and puzzle game so basically you know it takes
9327280	9333440	place in medieval times and you're fighting your way through uh through different levels and you
9333440	9337760	have to solve puzzles you have to defeat guys or they'll destroy your flippers so you're unable to
9337760	9344400	use it which is and it has like a nice little story to it but now i had a lot of fun with that
9344400	9349840	there there were just a lot of good indie games that were there and it's good and it's nice that
9349840	9356480	you know they got a lot of local developers there they get a lot of shit and they get a lot of uh
9356480	9362640	different types of games a lot of tablet games stuff like that um but no i heard you talking
9362640	9370480	about earlier about the diversity lounge yeah did you see it i did uh i did uh check it out um
9370480	9376480	what was it now it's just really kind it was really just like a room that had a bunch of
9376480	9385200	different groups that um were all about you know like diversity in the community um there was
9386480	9398000	uh LGBT group that kind of publishes stories as publishes graphic novels
9400560	9406480	there's a webcomic there was a there was a group similar to gamer x that you know it's for a con in
9406480	9412560	toronto very similar type of atmosphere that they were that they were promoting there was a cop
9412560	9416800	there was a college there kind of just talking with people brainstorming about
9417360	9424400	how to better the community through gaming and try to kind of get you know equal uh
9425600	9431520	and you know divert diversity and everything um then there was a group that i remember called
9431520	9441440	like press xy which is about you know trans trans trans transgender group uh you know talking about
9441440	9447440	you know the struggles of being transgender through a game kind of similar to cards against
9447440	9454480	humanity which was really neat that's that's kind of neat that they were kind of showing that off
9454480	9459600	through like a game like you know kind of i guess communicating with gamers on a level that they
9459600	9464320	would absolutely understand that's that's pretty neat yeah and yeah i actually went to the actually
9464320	9468080	went to their panel and you know it was like a very you know like a light fun atmosphere but
9468080	9473680	also was very real because you know there were a lot of you know people within you know the
9473680	9478560	industry they're also they're also transgender that you know they talk about their struggles
9479120	9482400	and everything so it was like very real very you know light-hearted
9483040	9496640	type of thing and there was also a group uh about you know uh handicap gamers oh okay oh the
9496640	9502080	is that the able gamers yeah it's able gamers yeah they had a booth you know showing off you
9502080	9508080	know some of the controllers and other things and also talk about how they basically just go to
9508880	9516720	they work with other triple-a titles they work with a lot of developers on trying to make games
9516720	9523200	more accessible for to sit for a disabled gamers there are big proponents of making sure that you
9523280	9528560	know button mapping is available keyboard mapping is available in all games that there's not really
9528560	9534320	a reason quote unquote that any of that should be locked down uh being cognizant of color blindness
9534320	9538000	and you know things like that i've i've yeah i've definitely heard of those guys before so that's
9538000	9542880	really cool that's that's yeah do you think that the message was heard from those groups do you
9542880	9550960	think that enough people were hearing the message i feel that it was because of the way that it was
9551040	9556320	initially executed the way that was initially explained kind of left a sour taste in everyone's
9556320	9565360	mouth i think you know it had a lot of good i just don't think it was executed the right way
9565360	9572480	initially i there was a lot of good in it right but i kind of feel that you know the room itself
9572480	9577440	was kind of off kind of like the beaten path i don't feel it got as much attention as it should
9577440	9586960	have but it's a start it's a start all right well um what was what was probably like your favorite
9586960	9591200	game you got to play at the whole maybe already talked about it but what was your favorite game
9591200	9595120	if not one you've already brought up well yeah well the favorite game was the
9595120	9601840	prob was probably krypton and necro dancer and and the and uh rollers of the realm right those
9601840	9606640	were like the two indie games they got they got to play and also the the oculus rift was a lot of
9606640	9612960	fun right to get my hands on it and everything so you're you're a believer in the oculus rift now
9614080	9619840	i am i am if it's at the right price but you know can't be can't be choosy the price is right the
9619840	9623680	price is right all right uh s2100 mad i'm gonna i'm gonna let let you go here so we can try to
9623680	9627440	get at least one more call in here but any other thoughts on packs east or anything else you want
9627440	9634400	to get out and share with us um on the bathroom thing um i didn't i didn't notice until you
9634400	9641120	mentioned it to tell you the truth but no i had i had a couple women in my group and they didn't
9641120	9646320	they didn't really have feel is was was an issue but you know then again i didn't really use the
9646320	9650480	bathroom at pecs because you know yeah it's also kind of one of those things where like if i know
9650480	9655120	i'm going to a convention i try to uh make sure we're all wrapped up in that department because
9655120	9659600	you know there's going to be lines and all that stuff anyway and and also you know the men and
9659600	9666880	women are both hovering yeah so so exactly i try to try to save that for emergencies only
9667680	9674480	exactly so but yeah i'll let you guys finish up and by the way jamie happy pesach thank you you
9674480	9680400	too all right uh well thank you very much matt take care buddy don't ever do it on the matza
9682880	9688480	take care guys all right uh 1877 game olr username on skype orange lounge radio if you
9688480	9692000	want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about on the show so far or something
9692000	9696400	else you don't have to have gone to a pax east to call i mean sure we love hearing from the people
9696400	9700960	that were there i mean don't get me wrong those are some great calls but but i'd like to hear from
9700960	9707600	uh i'd like to hear from uh all you guys out there 1877 game ol go game olr username on skype orange
9707600	9712720	lounge radio i do have a couple tweets to read here they aren't necessarily stories but some
9712720	9721040	comments um aj twist on twitter sent us a tweet you just saw a king commercial for candy crush
9721040	9731360	saga on tv do you believe that sadly yeah i kind of do believe that um because you know they are a
9731360	9736240	publicly traded company now and they've got to prove that they're not a one-hit wonder and in
9736240	9739920	order to get there they're going to have to make that one hit of theirs last as long as they
9739920	9743600	possibly can especially after especially how does that prove that they're not a one-hit wonder
9744400	9749440	well after some bad press that one hit game they got to keep that going so they can fund those
9749440	9754800	other games but it is a little weird i think i want to say i saw like a farmville commercial
9754800	9760240	on tv once though it's is that's that's life all right let's go to the phones hi you're on
9760240	9766640	orange launch radio who's this hey did it suck death hey buddy how you doing well yeah i didn't
9766640	9772800	go to pax east it's too far inexpensive for me to go but that's all right neither did we
9772800	9779680	we'll just sit here in the not cool kids club mope mope yeah well what's up buddy but but yeah i did
9779680	9787120	uh i did do uh an interesting thing this weekend i i saw indie game the movie oh right indie game
9787120	9793280	the movie one of the movies is available on steam yeah i actually watched it through there uh uh
9793280	9799680	first first of all i want to ask you if any of you uh if you had watched it i actually own it
9799680	9805840	and have yet to watch it unfortunately i just you know i but to be fair i hardly ever watch like any
9805840	9811520	movies um i get to the movies maybe like twice a year and then on on blu-ray i'll watch like maybe
9811520	9816080	three things although um dark soccer is gonna let me frozen and i'm very excited to see that because
9816080	9820160	i still haven't seen it because again see my comment about never getting out to the movies
9820160	9825360	eventually yeah but uh so no i didn't see any movie the game but uh and i don't know if you
9825360	9830240	guys did you see it lowkey no no yeah i don't think we did so you get you gotta tell us a
9830240	9835280	little more about it here well it's a it's a pretty interesting movie it's a it's really
9836000	9843520	entertaining to watch uh for the most part but yeah uh it definitely gave me another another
9843520	9851520	view on on phil fish and jonathan blow because yeah if if you know me uh you know my my hatred
9851520	9857600	or my despise for phil fish and i have seen you make some aggressive tweets in the past yeah
9858560	9866480	definitely though though now watching this movie uh and i really understand now how phil fish uh
9866480	9871920	feels or at least how why he acts that like that most of the time because yeah it's something
9872880	9879520	something really really uh that you see in this movie that uh at least helps you understand a bit
9880080	9885920	i still think he's a douche he's his son asshole and jonathan blow is still pretentious
9886960	9894960	but at least i understand them now at least i know uh why they do and and and why they act that
9894960	9903280	way because yeah it's and and aside from that aside from that uh the team uh also teen meat
9903280	9911200	it's uh it's a really interesting story how how they started and how how the uh the development
9911200	9917920	for super meat boy uh progresses through through all of it and it's and it's really interesting you
9917920	9924480	you even though you know how it finishes how it ends you still uh go like oh my god i want those
9924480	9932160	guys to to get through and and be happy because yeah though uh i do recommend watching the movie
9932160	9938240	it's on netflix it's set on everywhere and if you have if you have steam you can watch it through
9938240	9947120	there i i watched it through steam scene since i got the uh the special edition dlc yeah and and
9947120	9952000	also those uh those extras are really worth it are really interesting to watch too you get like
9952080	9957600	achievements and trading cards and stuff too huh yeah uh i actually got all the achievements now
9957600	9962240	that's funny uh yeah no it's it's uh definitely one of those things i gotta check out when i have
9962240	9966320	more time available in the week and it's pretty cool that it kind of gives you that additional
9966320	9970400	perspective on people that you may have kind of written off one way but it gave you that
9970400	9974000	perspective it's interesting though because a lot of times when you hear that kind of talk it's
9974000	9978000	usually like a negative thing like we hear a lot about like people that go on reality shows and
9978080	9981840	figured thought they were edited in a negative context or even i think about um
9982640	9986960	you know as far as video game documentaries go i think about the king of kong and how um you know
9986960	9990400	billy mitchell i don't think necessarily agrees with some of the ways he was edited in that way
9990400	9994640	and certainly there's a big negative perception about him because of that movie um and whether
9994640	9998960	that's right or wrong i don't know because i don't know the man personally but um it is very
9998960	10006880	interesting the power that a documentary or a a reality tv documentary or whatever can kind of
10007360	10014240	have on people so and yes and and it's a really introspective view on how indie development works
10015200	10022320	at least as a general view because yeah it's a it's a lot of work for uh from so little people
10022320	10029200	in a team and like that so yeah it's it's a it's a really interesting movie if you haven't if any of
10030080	10035200	any of the listeners having watched it uh you should again it's on netflix it's
10035200	10040000	pretty much everywhere so it's really easy to find if you want to get the esteem version it's
10040800	10047600	the special version the special edition it's it's a really great auto and i'm sorry but yeah all
10047600	10053760	right uh well act deaf anything else you want to share with us before we let you go well other
10053760	10059760	than that super smash brothers i'm excited though i do want ness captain falcon and jigglypuff to
10059760	10065120	return but i will see we'll see yeah those are those are three at the top of my list too but
10065120	10070560	if they had some really really really awesome new characters then i guess i could forgive it but
10071280	10076960	if it's more pokemon i'm gonna get a little irritated no offense to the pokemon fans but
10076960	10084000	you have enough all right thanks thanks buddy you take care yeah you too all right bye well
10084000	10087200	we'll leave that we'll leave the phones open for just a little bit longer to see if anybody else
10087200	10092400	wants to sneak through for a quick call 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio
10092400	10096960	there was actually really only one other tweet um that i wanted to address here and that was
10096960	10103040	from dr noir who emailed us last week on the show and he was he was uh promoting a game that
10103040	10107280	he really enjoyed on android and he said that he sent a tweet this week saying i just listened to
10107280	10113920	last sunday's olr episode and for the record no i'm not affiliated with or paid by touch fu who's
10113920	10119040	that company that made the game they just made a killer game no i i figured that really was the
10119040	10125520	case it's just it's just fun to give you a hard time there so all right uh again trying to sneak
10125520	10131520	in one more call if you are feeling so brave 1877 i promise we don't bite unless you ask if you want
10131520	10137600	us to we'll bite a little bit 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio if you want
10137600	10144080	to give us a call otherwise there's there's no last minute stories and nothing else to talk about
10144640	10153680	no i guess i guess got stuck on uh the david bowie animated gif subreddit is that a whole tumblr or
10153680	10159680	something it's a subreddit just a few just on there but subreddit of course i should mention
10159680	10165360	another tweet actually speaking of like time wasters um uh jamie's new bff gemit actually
10165360	10172160	sent a tweet to me and uh horde house and the olr twitters that has a link to a game uh that was
10172160	10176800	like i think it was like ie killer or something like that and like i just played it real quick
10176800	10181840	like it has to it's a whole tongue-in-cheek thing about windows xp going away it was like this little
10181840	10186320	shooter game it was a little silly but i had fun with it so all right we do have another call
10186320	10189440	coming in so let's take it and then we'll probably wrap up so hi you're on orange house radio who's
10189440	10196480	this hey guys this is nemesis 47 how you guys doing i am good hey nemesis 47 how you doing
10196480	10203680	i've been okay man uh just just uh been working on all that i did i hear you i hear you what's
10203680	10211760	on your mind buddy uh nothing much um if there's one character they output in super smash brothers
10211760	10215760	the new one they output like one character one character only the angry video game nerd that
10215760	10223360	would be pretty funny to see i mean he would he probably probably attacked with a whole bunch of
10223360	10228560	expletives and stuff like that but then nintendo probably automatically put an emory in reading in
10228560	10233120	the game yeah see now i don't know if that would necessarily work because wasn't there a little
10233120	10239280	bit of a legal squabble hence why the angry video game nerd has his name because that wasn't his
10239280	10246960	original name so yeah yeah yeah when we first started he was the angry video the angry nintendo
10247040	10253760	when we first started that's right that's right you know maybe he can't be a character nemesis
10253760	10261280	but what if he was the announcer that would actually be funnier see see we were working
10261280	10266080	together here to create the killer video game here and that's you know i i can't think of a whole lot
10266080	10270960	of announcing that goes on in smash brothers maybe this is what we need we need some announcer packs
10270960	10276080	from some great uh video game commentators such as the angry video game nerd there you go
10276080	10280080	and tiger claw wants to know in our chat room what would the angry video game nerds moves be
10280080	10283920	he attacks you with bad video games see i think i think this this might be why he'd be a perfect
10283920	10289920	commentator she has jason come out or bugs bunny do you ever watch any yeah oh yeah no i saw the
10289920	10295520	one on friday the 13th and it made me sad because i like that one is great yeah oh it's great it's
10295520	10301760	great good stuff uh he probably he probably he probably attacked you with swear words he probably
10302400	10307040	probably had those uh you know the act symbol the hashtag symbol those other symbols he probably
10307040	10312320	just smash you over the head with it maybe qbert qbert swearing that type of thing yeah that yeah
10312320	10317760	there you go um i would uh yeah i i think that would be a special move it would be really funny
10317760	10323200	though is if whenever he said things like that he got censored but in that really bad like movie on
10323200	10329600	broadcast television censoring type of way like what is what is it okay y'all know snakes on a
10329600	10334000	plane right and samuel l jackson goes i am sick of all these motherfucking snakes on this
10334000	10340160	motherfucking plane like didn't they dub it for tv and it's like i am sick of all these mother
10341040	10348400	monkey loving snakes on this monday to friday plane or something really like so i think that's
10348400	10355360	what they would do is they would have to change out the swear words for uh broadcast tv or show
10355360	10361360	girls are dark sacrifice favorite movie on vh1 where they they draw on the bras and everything so
10363360	10367680	all right well nemesis any other any of the thoughts or wishes for smash brothers
10369200	10375920	oh and also and also jimmy i would i would also give give dan w2k14 but when you get it
10376560	10382000	try to get the uh season pass thing because not only because when you buy the season pass like
10382000	10389360	20 bucks you'll get you get all the uh characters all the whole bunch of other stuff i mean a bunch
10389360	10394160	of other dlc but it's pretty pretty worth getting and also not only is andre the giant in the game
10394160	10400880	also king kong's bundies in the game oh cool oh wow so pretty much you got all the heavyweights
10400880	10405040	of wrestling there you go so another wrestling fan here on the show do you like the princess

10518240	10521840	tonight's show i see jamie has her microphone up so i'll start with you dark sakura your final
10521840	10527520	thought tonight um i was watching youtube and i found this thing called musical puns where it's
10527520	10531200	basically like all kinds of different instruments but the thing that cracked me up was bassoon 5
10531840	10537680	playing maroon 5 music nice it was just really funny everyone should watch musical puns i like
10537680	10542800	hearing modern pop songs covered in other genres and things like that like the swing band that
10542880	10551280	does all the good stuff there's also another bassoon quartet called um what's it called
10551280	10560480	breaking winds the breaking winds nice and they do um uh the someone i used to know they do a
10561440	10565840	version of that that's really good so i've been really listening to a lot of bassoon music lately
10565840	10569680	all right and then my final thoughts since dark sakura brought up youtube
10569680	10575520	i have to say from my final thought tonight it's an orange it's an orange
