0	17280	This week things have been a little quiet, but you know what that means. More ports lining
17280	20280	on new systems, news of games that didn't make the cut, and interesting games that are
20280	23840	about to make their debut. In other words, it's another week in gaming. Have your favorite
23840	29760	candy at the ready and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.
29760	35120	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35120	40720	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here with episode number
40720	51000	549 for April 20th, 2014. That's right. Let me just get it out of the way now. Happy 420!
51000	54120	And Happy Easter, of course, if that's what you're into. And if you don't celebrate either
54120	57120	of those things, then I hope you're having a fine Sunday.
57120	59120	Happy fucking holiday! Hello, DarkSakura!
59120	65360	Because it's bunnies and shagging and eggs. Fertility holiday!
65360	67480	What are they calling it in Animal Crossing? You were just playing?
67480	68480	Bunny Day.
68480	69480	Bunny Day. Happy Bunny Day.
69480	75520	It's annoying in Animal Crossing. It's called the day after Jamie's birthday, so I'm a little
75520	80000	bit food hungover. And I feel sick because I've eaten nothing but crap.
80000	82360	Well, happy birthday to you, by the way.
82360	83360	Thank you. I'm old.
83360	84360	No, you're not.
84360	85360	Please.
85600	88600	It's another year of awesome. Come on.
88600	90600	Yeah, I know I'm vintage.
90600	91600	Look, we've been doing...
91600	93600	Better vintage wine than sour grapes.
93600	98600	Look, we've been doing OLR for, when we get to June, that's going to be our 12th birthday.
98600	102880	So we've been doing this show for 12 years, so y'all do the math. Obviously, we are not
102880	107280	in our 20s anymore doing this show, you know, so there's that expectation we're going to
107280	108280	be a little bit older.
108280	109800	I'm going to be doing OLR when I'm 70.
109800	115320	We very well might be. We'll see. Not here tonight, unfortunately. Tech master Loki,
115320	118160	Tech master Loki does have the night off because it is Easter and he has some family
118160	124200	obligations this evening. But joining us in studio, it's a pleasure always to have this
124200	128920	guy on the show. He's a big supporter of not just OLR, but a lot of the things at vognetwork.com
128920	132800	and just a good guy to have here on the show. Say hello, everybody, to Flocko Jones.
132800	133800	Hello, everybody.
133800	135800	How you doing, Flocko?
135800	136800	I'm doing all right.
136800	137800	Yeah?
137800	140200	I just realized I had to turn my mic on. It was off. That would have been embarrassing.
140200	143840	That happens. Loki likes to do the off and on thing. Yeah, he has to do the click, click,
143840	146480	click. Sometimes it happens. So what's new? How you been?
146480	148320	I've been pretty good. I had a really good Easter.
148320	149320	Did you?
149320	154360	I accelerated by eating four hot dogs, a hamburger, a pile of potato salad. I starved myself
154360	157600	for breakfast, though, so I could just throw down as much food as possible. They actually
157600	161560	ran out of hot dogs. I think I could have handled a dozen. I was going for a dozen,
161560	162560	but it didn't work out.
162560	168240	I love that even though Loki's not here, you still can bring it to food one way or another.
168240	169720	I know. And now we have scones.
169720	171600	I brought black court scones.
172360	175280	And tomorrow, you know what the best thing about Easter is? I don't care if you celebrate
175280	181360	Easter or not. We can all celebrate in 4-21 tomorrow, which is going to be the day that
181360	185320	all the candy is like 75% off. That's universal, people.
185320	186760	I can't eat any of it.
186760	189280	Last year, that was 4-20 and that's appropriate.
189280	191560	Yes, much better.
191560	199320	Because I have decided that now that my birthday is over and I'm feeling old and sore from
199400	204320	walking all over San Francisco yesterday, that I'm going to wake up early tomorrow and
204320	206720	do yoga and go to the gym.
206720	210360	You're going to start off this new year of your life in all the right ways?
210360	214320	Well, yeah. Well, I was doing that before, but then work was kicking my butt. So now
214320	218400	that I'm used to my work schedule and got my vitamins all sorted out and starting to
218400	220320	feel okay again, I'm going back to the gym.
220320	221320	There you go.
221320	224120	I submitted the measurements for my cosplays for GamerX.
224120	226280	Oh, you are going to be doing the cosplays.
226280	227280	Which is another motivation.
227280	228280	Nice, nice.
228280	232520	Did you make it a couple inches less so that way you'd be like, I waited until I was super
232520	237720	bloated because my costumes have to be loose anyway because they're Homestuck costumes.
237720	238720	Oh, okay.
238720	239720	Gotcha.
239720	243200	Go to our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
243200	246720	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,
246720	248680	vog network.com.
248680	250880	We have some comments in our chat room here.
250880	252880	Let's see.
252880	259240	Kaijuto is starting us off tonight saying, O-L-R becomes O-L-D. Oh, that's like a sitcom
259240	260440	in the works or something.
260440	265160	And I'm just sitting here going becomes.
265160	266160	Just wait.
266160	267400	The older we get, the older you're getting too.
267400	268400	That's right.
268400	270200	How long have you been listening?
270200	272360	Also, let's see.
272360	276280	Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf not only says congrats on surviving another year, Jamie,
276280	278320	but he also says Flaco is there.
278320	280520	Did you buy a UPS yet?
280520	283280	Now for those that don't catch the joke, the last time Flaco was on the show, actually
283280	286280	it was two times ago because I think the last time you were here, everything was fine.
286280	289560	Two times ago, the power went out mid show and that was like a lost episode because of
289560	290560	it.
290560	291560	Yes.
291560	292560	It's a legendary episode now.
292560	293560	That's how I like to look at it.
293560	294560	Yeah, it is.
294560	296680	You were on a deleted scene like me on RuPaul's Drag Race.
296680	297800	I was on a deleted scene.
297800	298800	It was so good.
298800	300720	It was so much better than the next time I was on.
300720	303080	Wait a minute.
303080	304080	I was better.
304080	305760	I mean, I was better the first time.
305760	308000	My stories didn't come back as good the second time.
308000	309000	Oh, you're always.
309000	310000	I was trying to recall.
310000	311000	It's going so well.
311000	312000	All right.
312000	315240	Well, I do have some kickoff topics I want to get into, but since Dark Soccer brought
315240	319760	up her birthday, I figured now was a good time to do a present.
319760	322000	Y'all ready for a present?
322000	323000	I like presents.
323000	324000	Okay.
324000	328440	Now I don't rap, so I just put it here in this little thing.
328440	331200	So I'm going to just open it for Dark Soccer right now.
331200	332200	Sing for me.
332200	334200	Flaco, you need to do commentary because I got to put the mic down.
334200	339760	Oh, Rob is putting the mic down and now he's going to unzip Dark Soccer's present.
340000	341240	I don't know how else to put it.
341240	343200	Which is at crotch level.
343200	346480	It is in a box.
346480	347480	Here it is.
347480	348480	He's presenting it.
348480	349480	This sounds really bad.
349480	350480	And oh, she squealed.
350480	352240	I'm sure you heard that.
352240	353240	What is that?
353240	354240	Bravely default.
354240	358440	I'm going to play the shit out of this because now I'm going with Animal Crossing.
358440	359440	There it is.
359440	360440	That's what she said.
360440	361440	I was all intent.
361440	364160	I was going to go to the store and get her that Disney game, but then last week she said,
364160	365160	I'd rather have Bravely Default.
365160	367800	And I'm like, all right.
367800	369200	Bravely Default is a great game.
369200	371120	So there you go.
371120	373880	And I could see Dark Soccer as being somebody that's really going to get into the story
373880	380120	and the characters and stuff because she likes to get into games that have story.
380120	381120	It's wrapped, Rob.
381120	382120	She's unwrapping it right now.
382120	384640	I'm shrink wrapping it right now.
384640	386200	Rob shrink-wrapped it all himself.
386200	387200	Shush.
387200	388200	Love.
388200	389200	And Dan ordered me my present.
389200	391440	So I have my present coming from Dan.
391440	393200	And then I bought myself a whole bunch of presents.
393200	394200	Nice.
394200	395200	Because I was at Sakura Monster.
395200	396200	I got myself a bunch of art supplies.
396200	397200	Nobody got you that though, right?
397200	398200	No.
398200	399200	I bought me an iPhone 5S.
399200	400200	Oh, sweet.
400200	402200	Because it's about time.
402200	403200	Right.
403200	409120	And I'm not going to reveal where my husband is employed at either in case people are listening
409120	420680	and because I also, so I'm going to say that Dan works at the land of, what should I say?
420680	427360	He works at the land of reps in service.
427360	428360	So Loras.
428360	429360	Loras.
429360	430360	Okay.
430360	431360	Dan works at Loras and I work at Locat.
431360	432360	Okay.
432360	433360	You got it.
433360	434360	All right.
434360	436200	All Homestuck references, by the way.
436200	439840	Going over to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
439840	442600	Eric RPG says, that Disney game is meh anyway.
442600	443680	I don't know.
443680	446440	I thought Dark Sakura might have got a kick out of it because Animal Crossing meets Disney,
446440	447440	but you know what?
447440	448440	Bradley default's awesome too.
448440	450320	I want to play the Tomodachi game.
450320	451320	Oh yeah.
451320	452480	Well, that's not out till June.
452480	456320	So you'll have to wait for Christmas or something, Monica.
456360	461160	I street past so many freaking people at Sakura Matsuri.
461160	462160	Tell us about your trip.
462160	466780	You want to, cause you know, a lot of nerds in the Bay area go to this.
466780	469560	You went to Sakura Matsuri yesterday in San Francisco, right?
469560	470560	Yep.
470560	471560	The Cherry Blossom Festival.
471560	479160	And if people want to see some of my pictures, if you go to kurotsubasa.tumblr.com, I have
479160	486640	some pictures I took, including a panoramic of the Peace Pagoda Plaza over at Japantown
486640	488640	or Nihonmachi.
488640	493160	At any rate, there were, there was some cosplay.
493160	499520	There were some good cosplay that I found a really good Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin.
499520	504160	I found a few others and then I found like some honestly kind of half-assed cosplay.
504160	505360	Like it was an afterthought.
505360	507680	I'm not saying anything about the cosplayers.
507680	511320	You know, if you don't want to cosplay all the way, that's fine, but you know, don't
511320	518760	think you're hot shit if you know your costume's not all the way put together.
518760	525440	I ran into some really nice people just wandering around, talked to a few people, and then I
525440	526760	found more homestucks.
526760	531160	Okay, because it was my birthday, I decided to wear my Aradia shirt, which is basically
531160	533860	big red Aries on a black shirt.
533860	538380	As I was walking down the hall, I found a person wearing the Terezi shirt, which is
538380	539380	a Libra.
539380	543780	And we're like, oh, one of us and you know, then I ran into someone wearing a Hero of
543780	546300	Space shirt at Daiso.
546300	548260	And then she's like, yeah, I found a couple other people too.
548260	553460	So we have some representation, which we are an invasive species, but we're good.
553460	555460	I have no idea what any of that means, but that's cool.
555460	558020	Well, these people know what it means.
558020	561220	Did you get to go to that arcade that they have in the little...
561220	562220	It was busy.
562220	563220	I didn't want to go.
563660	568740	And I mean, the whole place was just like all over, but we went to where they were doing
568740	569940	the food booth.
569940	576900	And I was very disappointed because I wanted to have a takoyaki, because that's like my
576900	580660	big thing when I go to Sakuramatsuri is I have to have takoyaki.
580660	587620	And they made it, it wasn't takoyaki, it was like beef inside it instead of octopus.
587620	588620	So I was like, well, screw that.
588620	591380	So I had unagi don and it was delicious.
592340	594340	Did you get a crepe?
594340	595700	Because they have some great crepes there too.
595700	596340	Great place.
596340	597940	Sophie's Crepes was like way busy.
597940	599380	I just didn't bother.
599380	606020	But I did buy some art supplies because there's certain ones that I can't get locally.
606020	608180	I had to go to Kinokaniya.
608180	612260	And what else did we do?
612260	614900	Because I actually went and bought...
614900	619460	Because I mean, now that I'm older, I was always interested in Japanese culture just
619460	621060	from having been a Japanese major.
621060	625380	And I sort of grew out of my whole anime fangirl-ness.
625380	630580	And I use grow out of in quote-y fingers just because I'm not as interested in a lot of
630580	632820	stuff because it's geared toward teenagers.
632820	635700	It's not really my thing, except I totally love Kill la Kill right now.
636260	636900	Totally awesome.
637940	641860	But I really have been trying to focus more on my art.
641860	647620	So this time I went around and looked at different types of papers and looked at textiles.
647620	648660	And I bought myself...
649940	655060	It's a huroshiki, which is like a wrapping cloth, but I got one with cats on it.
655060	656420	And I hang it in my cube.
656420	657140	It was really cute.
657700	664180	And basically my point around this time was just to find different things that I thought
664180	665140	would stimulate me.
666500	667140	Not in that way.
669140	670660	Oh, it's that kind of birthday, huh?
672500	674340	As an artist.
675300	676580	And so that was really...
676660	677620	We watched some dances.
678820	680020	We watched...
680820	684020	There was a big Taigo presentation, which was pretty awesome.
684020	684660	Nice.
684660	689860	And then I got stuff for my desk and stuff and things.
689860	690980	Well, sounds like you had a good day.
690980	694500	And let's see my friend Tamara over on Clement Street.
694500	696660	She was working for a clothing designer.
697380	701300	So I got to really check out some home done textiles and everything.
701300	704260	Well, happy birthday once again from all of us here at OLR to you.
704260	704580	Thank you.
705540	710660	And I hope you get more presents before the week's up, because some birthdays tend to
710660	712420	go all week, so you never know what might happen.
712420	714260	So all right.
714260	720020	If the OLR listeners want to send you a taco or something, because I have had people come
720020	722100	to me saying, how can I send Jamie a taco?
722100	723620	I want to make Jamie happy for her birthday.
723620	725060	How can I send her a taco?
725060	728900	So I'll tell you what, if you want to make me happy, this is what you can do.
729540	730420	You can send me money.
731700	732340	No, I'm kidding.
732900	736580	What I actually, if you want to make me happy, I want to send her a money taco.
737860	739060	This is what I want you to do.
739060	746660	I want you to find a local animal rescue and give them some cat food or adopt a cat and
746660	749060	send me a picture of the cat that you adopted.
749060	754340	Oh, that's what I want you to do for my birthday is to adopt a cat or to at least donate food
754340	756020	to because some people are allergic to cats.
756020	759140	So to animal rescues because they need it.
759140	764660	The people who foster the cats need food and it keeps, it keeps from, you know, killing
764660	765220	an animal.
765220	767540	That's only fault is that it just was homeless.
768580	769140	Well, you know what?
769140	771620	That is, that is one thing better than a taco is cats.
772340	773220	Yeah, there you go.
773220	774100	Sounds wrong, Rob.
775540	776660	I didn't mean to eat the cat.
777300	778260	Let the cat eat the taco.
778260	779540	I just didn't think you were into pussy.
781140	785620	But anyway, on a serious note, I can always make an exception, dark soccer.
786580	793940	I adopted Midna and I would really like to see, you know, more people give, especially
793940	795780	older cats, give older cats a chance.
795780	796260	That's great.
797620	801380	Well, taking it back to video games a little bit, since we are a video game podcast, I
801380	804340	want to talk here a little bit on our kickoff topic about some things going on.
804340	808980	And I want to talk to Flaco a little bit too, because Flaco, you know, you've, you've still
808980	811220	been playing quite a few games since the last time we talked to you.
811220	814340	And I know you're mostly a gamer on the Sony platforms, right?
814980	815860	Yes, I am.
816660	821300	I recently got a PS4 like a couple months ago, and I really enjoy it.
821300	824260	Played all of the games you get with PlayStation Plus.
824260	828340	But, and I guess, I don't know if you know this, or not a lot of my friends might know
828340	831940	this, but I bought my wife a Wii U for her birthday.
831940	835780	I do because you were telling me to add her on the Wii U thing.
835780	836180	Yeah, that's right.
836180	841060	I still haven't done it because you'll see my Wii U is still not hooked up from the move.
841380	844500	But I found her really, if you really want to, I guess you could.
844500	847220	I do really want to, because we want to play Wind Waker HD.
847220	849060	That's exactly the reason I got it though.
849060	850900	Because Wind Waker, but sure.
851780	855140	If you want to run it or something, yourself, I don't know.
855140	855940	It's worth it.
855940	856580	But that's the game.
856580	858740	It's my wife's favorite game ever is Wind Waker.
858740	862740	And I found a really good deal on the Wind Waker HD bundle and I got it.
862740	863860	And it was like an amazing deal.
863860	869460	It was used, but the little game pad that has the Triforce stuff.
869460	869940	Yes.
869940	870660	She loves it.
870740	871620	My wife loves it.
871620	872740	She went crazy for it.
872740	876820	So she's been playing that pretty much nonstop and I've been helping her when she gets stuck
876820	878500	and it's been really fun.
878500	879780	And the kids love it too.
879780	884420	Like my son just gets a kick whenever, uh, Link does like the different, uh, melodies,
884420	887380	you know, with the Wind Waker, he does a little conducting or whatever.
887380	889860	Uh, my son like hums along with it and it's really awesome.
890420	894740	So that is so precious hearing how the whole family gets involved in gaming.
894740	895780	Oh, it's so adorable.
895780	897220	I just want to hug you all.
897220	899380	I mean, that's such a good news story, right?
899380	902980	So why, why does Nintendo keep flopping in the eyes of the game?
902980	904820	I mean, obviously sales are sales.
904820	906420	They're not selling as many as competitors.
906420	907540	That's just, you know, the way it is.
907540	911380	But why, why is Wii U flopping when you have such positive things to say about it, you
911380	911940	think?
911940	914340	I, cause there's really not that much to play on it.
914340	916660	Like, I don't know what she's going to do when she's done with Wind Waker.
917300	918900	Mario Kart 8 will be out maybe.
918900	920260	She's not a big Mario Kart fan.
920260	921060	I want to play it though.
921060	923540	So we might rent it first and see if we both like it.
923540	925380	I see, I play, I play more on the PlayStation.
925380	927540	So, and I have a Vita too.
927540	928980	She got me a Vita for Christmas.
929380	933780	So I had to try to top that and get her a Wii U for her birthday.
933780	935220	And I got the PS4 just out of the blue.
935220	936180	I thought it was a family thing.
936180	937620	She's like, Oh no, that's your system.
937620	938260	I don't want to play that.
938260	939700	It was like, Oh, well I feel really bad.
939700	940980	Well, let me get you a Wii U.
940980	945940	So at least you guys, at least you guys can watch the PlayStation live together and enjoy
945940	948100	the people showing their titties and their dongs.
948100	948580	We did that.
948580	950660	We didn't see any of the racy stuff.
950660	953540	I mean, somewhat racy stuff, but nothing, no nudity.
953540	956660	We didn't see the night we were just perusing that we had friends over.
956660	956900	Of course.
956900	957460	So what do you do?
957460	958500	You turn on play room.
958500	958900	Right.
958900	960180	Or PlayStation live.
960180	962580	Look at the playroom streams and see how ridiculous it is.
963300	965060	So, uh, but yeah, nothing too crazy.
965060	969780	Just a lot of like, really like poor living room setups.
969780	971780	I would say really depressing.
971780	973860	Like, Oh, it's so dirty in your living room.
974500	975540	Clean up your house.
977300	979460	That's one big reason I don't do the play.
979460	982980	When you do, when you do the streams on like Final Fantasy 14, which I have streamed on
982980	986500	Twitch, your head's in a little box that they can't see anything about my little head in
986500	986980	a box.
986980	987700	That's that's nice.
987700	988500	That's enough.
988820	989940	That's all we need to see.
989940	990500	That's all you need.
990500	992260	But playroom, it's in those poor robots.
992260	994100	I feel bad for those poor robots.
994100	997620	They had to sit there and look at all that terrible debauchery going on and they look
997620	998580	so shocked sometimes.
999860	1001220	What were you going to say to our Sakura?
1001220	1001940	Nothing.
1001940	1002340	Nothing.
1003700	1004260	Nevermind.
1004260	1004900	Bad for the robots.
1004900	1007940	What have you been playing on your, on your console, the PS4?
1007940	1010100	On the PS4, I've been playing mostly don't starve.
1010660	1013940	And, uh, again, for the kids, Lego Marvel superheroes.
1013940	1014820	But yeah, don't starve.
1014820	1018100	I've really, I really got into, it's one of the reasons I really wanted the PS4.
1018500	1023060	I went to extra for his house and he has a PS4 and I, that had just come out and he's
1023060	1024180	like, it's okay.
1024180	1026820	But you could have bought that for like $7 on steam.
1026820	1028820	Well, I'm glad I didn't cause my PC's broken now.
1028820	1033140	So like all the other games I bought on steam, I can't play it now.
1033140	1035460	Touche, but no, I love it.
1035460	1037460	I just, I like controllers better anyway.
1037460	1040020	So, uh, I've really enjoyed that game.
1040020	1041860	I put a lot of time into it.
1041860	1046420	I'm not, I'm not very good at it, but I finally got to adventure mode, which to get to adventure
1046820	1047620	mode and don't starve.
1047620	1053060	You have to play the regular survival mode and then you have to find a door randomly
1053060	1055700	as you're surviving and kind of exploring.
1055700	1058340	So I just made it, made it my mission to just explore.
1058340	1061860	I just go out and try to find this stupid door that I could never find cause I'd always
1061860	1062740	die before I found it.
1062740	1063620	Mm hmm.
1063620	1064100	Cause I finally found it.
1064100	1065060	Is that the one that goes into the caves?
1065700	1069540	No, no, that's a, that's if you go into a, if you dig up a grave, I think you can go,
1069540	1071860	or you can spelunk and you can go down there.
1071860	1075620	I didn't do, I've only done a little bit of that, but no, this is, it's a giant door.
1075700	1078900	It looks like a door to hell and it's like, do you want to go inside?
1078900	1083300	And when you do, max, the villain, I guess that the game shows up and he's like, uh,
1083300	1087140	if you can survive five worlds, you know, you can find my door and find me.
1087140	1088500	That's how you beat it, I guess.
1088500	1091300	Oh, I had no idea.
1091300	1094820	There's like a, there's like a story mode in there, but unfortunately to, to, to get
1094820	1098660	in there, you have to find it first in the regular, but you kind of have to make it your
1098660	1099540	mission to find the door.
1099540	1103460	What's cool is once you find the door, whenever you die doing the five doors thing, you don't
1103460	1105060	go back to, you know, nothing.
1105060	1107860	You go back to the point you first found the door.
1107860	1110580	So that now is my save file for adventure mode.
1110580	1114100	And then if I ever want to play the game, survival style, just create another, another
1114100	1115220	new, new, new game.
1115220	1116020	And I just do that.
1116020	1116740	So, okay.
1116740	1117700	It's been really fun.
1117700	1119300	I learned something about don't starve.
1119300	1121860	Yeah, there's, there's a hidden like story mode, I guess.
1121860	1122900	So awesome.
1122900	1126420	And it being PlayStation plus, I'm sure you, you're snatching up all those free games.
1126420	1126660	Like what?
1126660	1128180	Mercenary Kings this month.
1128180	1128500	Yeah.
1128500	1131620	I had trouble playing mercenary Kings, so I haven't really got into that yet.
1131620	1133060	It's like press down to fix something up.
1133060	1133620	I pressed down.
1133620	1134420	I couldn't pick it up.
1134420	1136500	I don't know if it's because it's playing on the inventory is full.
1137300	1137860	Is that why?
1137860	1138020	Yeah.
1138020	1138980	That's what I learned first.
1138980	1141540	You can only hold like one or two things in the beginning.
1141540	1141940	Wow.
1141940	1142180	Okay.
1142180	1142980	Well, that's my problem.
1142980	1145540	I can't get past the very, it's like, put some C-shirt in this door.
1145540	1145780	Sure.
1145780	1146260	Something with me.
1146260	1147540	I sure there we go.
1147540	1149300	I was like, well, this game, I can't play.
1149300	1149940	I thought it was a bug.
1149940	1151300	Like I'm playing on the VITA.
1151300	1153220	I do a lot of remote play on my VITA.
1153220	1156740	And so I was like, well, maybe it's some VITA bug where it's not registering me pressing
1156740	1157140	down.
1157140	1158420	Like I'm like squatting.
1158420	1159860	I'm like, I'm not putting this C4 down.
1159860	1160900	Like it says I'm supposed to.
1160900	1161300	Yeah.
1161300	1163060	So I, or picking it up.
1163060	1163540	I don't know.
1163540	1166500	It's you have to use the C4 you already have, and then you can pick up the other one.
1166500	1167460	I see.
1167460	1168100	Well, there you go.
1168100	1170260	So I'm stuck on that, but yeah, we played outlast.
1170260	1171220	That was pretty awesome.
1171220	1172500	I've only, we're halfway through it.
1172500	1174980	We stopped cause we had some friends over and we're like, let's play through this.
1174980	1177460	And we got through halfway and it's like, well, we have to go home.
1177460	1178980	Like, oh, you don't want to stay up till two in the morning.
1178980	1181220	But so yeah, we didn't finish that.
1181220	1183700	But I really like, I really liked that game so far too.
1183700	1186740	And again, I know it's a PC game, but I don't really have a workable PC.
1186740	1189300	So I've enjoyed playing on the PS4.
1189300	1193300	Um, besides just talking about what you've been playing on Sony recently, I wanted to
1193300	1196260	use this as an opportunity to talk about this too, because I'm sure some of our chatters
1196260	1197540	want to bring this up as well.
1197540	1201380	But speaking of all the Sony stuff going on, I'm sure you heard about that insane sale
1201380	1206020	they're having this weekend where they're, you know, they're giving steam a little competition
1206020	1209380	with this whole deep discounting 99 cents for what?
1209380	1210020	30 games.
1210020	1212660	I think they have on sale for 99, 30 or 34, something like that.
1212660	1213540	34, 35.
1213540	1216660	And, you know, obviously you're not going to get anything new, new, and it's not just
1216660	1217300	PS Plus.
1217300	1218500	That was the other surprising thing.
1218500	1220740	I thought for sure it was going to be PlayStation Plus only, but it's not.
1220740	1221460	It's for everybody.
1221460	1222900	Should be 50 cents for PS Plus.
1223780	1224420	I'm greedy.
1224420	1226740	Um, but, uh, yeah, I'm just really surprised.
1226740	1228500	Now you've got some stuff that's like really old.
1228500	1231940	You got some classics in there, like Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot.
1231940	1235060	But like, those are games I really remember from PS One.
1235060	1237460	So I was like, oh, for 99 cents, shit, I'll pick it up again.
1237460	1238340	So I can play it on the Vita.
1238340	1238740	Why not?
1238740	1239300	Right.
1239620	1243060	But then there's some stuff that's only a couple of years old, like Telltale has quite
1243060	1246580	a few things like the Jurassic Park game, Back to the Future.
1246580	1248820	And it's not just like one episode for 99 cents.
1248820	1251140	It's all four or five episodes for 99 cents.
1251140	1252580	That's a really good deal.
1253220	1257300	So if you are a PlayStation owner, I think the sale is only good through Monday at 7
1257300	1257940	a.m.
1257940	1260340	So if you're listening live, go get them.
1260340	1264260	If you're listening on the podcast, sorry, you missed it because it's over now.
1264260	1267940	I still haven't downloaded one of them, but I was really considering Jurassic Park.
1268900	1270180	That's that's the main one.
1270180	1271380	Well, I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
1271380	1271860	All right.
1271860	1272340	I did buy it.
1274340	1274820	So you have it.
1274820	1275700	You haven't taken advantage.
1275700	1277620	I haven't taken advantage of it because like you said, mostly.
1277620	1282020	Well, the other problem is I have a huge backlog on my PS3 and my PS3 is in the bedroom now.
1282020	1284580	It got moved once the Wii U joined the...
1285140	1286420	You had to play the same game I did.
1287380	1289220	Who ultimately gets to stay on the TV.
1289220	1291700	And it could have stayed out in the living room, but it's like, it'd be nice to have
1291700	1294740	a thing in the bedroom to finally watch, you know, Netflix and stuff in the bedroom.
1294740	1299220	So we moved it back there and I still have to play the Bioshock Infinite DLC.
1299220	1301140	I had to play the Last of Us DLC extra.
1301140	1302500	Let me borrow his game so I can do that.
1302500	1309220	I saw South Park to play and I have, you know, the PlayStation 3, you know, the PS Plus games.
1309220	1309540	Yeah.
1309540	1311300	I wanted I really like remember me.
1311300	1312340	I'm like halfway through that.
1313220	1314500	I think there's too much to play.
1314500	1317540	It is like a steam thing now where it's and it's another reason I'm not too sad.
1317540	1320340	My computer broke because I'm like, well, I've got enough to play already.
1320340	1322660	So I guess I guess I can just play my console stuff.
1322660	1324180	Who needs Microsoft Word?
1324180	1325300	I've got video games to play.
1325300	1325860	There you go.
1325860	1326900	Who needs that?
1326900	1327780	I don't need an internet.
1327780	1330500	I have a 10 year old computer I can do Microsoft Word with, but I can't game on it.
1331300	1334020	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1334020	1337620	SSJ100Matt says, I actually didn't know about this sale until just now.
1337620	1339220	BRB buying all the things.
1339220	1340500	We helped one person out.
1340500	1340980	Hooray.
1340980	1342740	I feel, I feel a lot better here at OLR.
1343460	1343860	Let's see.
1343860	1346020	Gamer girl says plants versus zombies.
1346020	1347540	I'm thinking that's something she picked up.
1347540	1348580	That looks like a good one.
1348580	1349860	But again, I meant to check.
1349860	1353540	Is that on the Vita or is that just on the, I don't think that's on the Vita.
1353540	1354580	I think that's just the PS3.
1354580	1356020	I think that's only PS3.
1356020	1358020	I want to say the Vita one was a plus game.
1358020	1361140	Sometimes it was, but it was before I got the subscription.
1361140	1364900	Sadly, cause I actually, well, I'll get in that later, but all right.
1364900	1365780	Gaming week stuff.
1365780	1366340	I don't know.
1366340	1366820	That's fine.
1366820	1367460	That's fine.
1367460	1368180	Uh, let's see.
1368180	1372580	Dungeon buster says retro city rampage is 99 cents and steam marked it down to the same
1372580	1373080	price.
1373620	1375460	So, Oh, a little, little comment.
1375460	1376180	And that's a good one.
1376180	1380900	If you haven't checked that out, extra for, uh, your brother-in-law, uh, co-star of a
1380900	1383460	hoard house Wednesday nights on the network loves that game.
1384420	1385140	Talks a lot about that.
1385140	1385460	No way.
1385460	1386500	I'm getting mixed up with hotline.
1386500	1386980	Miami.
1386980	1387700	Oh, nevermind.
1387700	1388260	I'm sorry.
1388260	1391540	I was like, I've heard good things about our just city ravages, but yeah, I know he loves
1391540	1391860	hot love.
1391860	1392420	No, it's Holly.
1392420	1392740	Miami.
1392740	1393700	I was thinking of, nevermind.
1393700	1394660	That was already free anyway.
1394660	1397620	We'll just, we'll make it up and say extra for likes a retro city ramp.
1397620	1398900	I bet he would, if he played it.
1400820	1402260	Loki likes our diversity rampage.
1402980	1404100	Uh, nice.
1404100	1404660	Not to buy it.
1404660	1408900	Tokyo jungle is the other one that, but again, that sounds like a huge time sink and I'm
1408900	1412420	like, I don't, I paid $15 for that stupid game.
1412420	1413620	No, actually Tokyo jungle.
1413620	1414340	Here's the thing about that.
1414340	1418820	It plays a lot like an arcade game to me where, and if you play it in little chunks, like
1418820	1425300	every time you play and die within five minutes, you're still getting, you're still investing
1425300	1430100	in your save that you can use to buy more animals or do progress in the story a little
1430100	1430740	more later on.
1430740	1434100	Like you don't get very far each time until you kind of build.
1434100	1436500	It's one of those games you build on each death.
1436580	1441140	Uh, it's a lot like, what the hell is that game where you're in the castle?
1441140	1442180	It's like Castlevania.
1443300	1446260	Uh, God damn it slipped my mind.
1446260	1447620	I used to play this game a lot.
1447620	1448660	Jason's a big fan of it.
1448660	1448820	I know.
1449860	1450900	No, I don't know.
1450900	1451780	I've never played that.
1451780	1454340	It's the one where you play the descendants of all the characters.
1454340	1455060	Magica.
1455060	1456100	Why is it?
1456100	1458580	No, no idea.
1459220	1461380	Somebody will yell it out in chat in two seconds here.
1461380	1462340	Then I'll feel stupid.
1463700	1464740	Oh, I can't.
1464740	1469540	I remember the name of the damn game because you're old and the castle shuffles each time
1469540	1470020	you play.
1471380	1471860	Shut up.
1471860	1473300	You're the one that had a birthday.
1473300	1473940	I don't know why.
1473940	1474340	I don't know.
1477140	1477700	Thank you.
1477700	1478260	Rogue leg.
1478260	1479060	Okay.
1479060	1480100	Alan just popped in.
1482180	1483220	Alan saved me again.
1483220	1483460	Yes.
1483460	1484580	It was rogue legacy.
1484580	1485300	Thank you, Alan.
1485300	1487380	And Jason just yelled it out in chat too.
1487380	1487940	Like that.
1488900	1491380	I don't even remember why I was bringing that game up now.
1491380	1491780	All right.
1492660	1494340	Let's talk about Tokyo jungle.
1494820	1495700	That's why.
1495700	1495940	Yeah.
1495940	1498020	Tokyo jungle is a great for 99 cents.
1498020	1498580	Heck yeah.
1498580	1501700	If you got to go, if you're listening to my life, you got to go get it.
1501700	1503620	Just it's 99 cents.
1503620	1508180	Like, you know, the other cool thing about Tokyo jungle is it is one of the very few
1508180	1510500	PS3 games that works with Vita remote play.
1511140	1511940	That's right.
1511940	1513220	The very, very few.
1513220	1514100	And they look ugly.
1514100	1515140	I looked, I played Pagle.
1515140	1515700	I have Pagle.
1516580	1518100	Pagle nights on PS3.
1518100	1520660	It plays with Vita remote play and it looks terrible.
1520660	1523060	Nothing like what the PS4 games look like.
1523060	1526660	Well, PSP had remote play a little bit too, but yeah, I never had one of those.
1526660	1527620	There was so few.
1528180	1531780	Like it worked with the minis and the PS1 and the PS1 games.
1531780	1534020	And you could do some of the video streaming and that stuff too.
1534020	1537460	That all existed on the PSP, but it was just one of those features nobody really talked
1537460	1537700	about.
1537700	1540740	But I remember going like, why isn't Sony doing more with this?
1540740	1542260	Because this technology is awesome.
1542260	1545300	Well, even the PS3, they didn't do that with the PS3 and the Vita.
1545300	1548420	Maybe it's because they're working on the PS4, but Oh, and the other thing I wanted to
1548420	1552500	tell you, you got Spyro and Crash Bandicoot, but I believe those don't work on the Vita
1552500	1553220	remote play.
1553220	1553780	What?
1553780	1554580	I know.
1554580	1555540	Oh crap.
1555540	1556420	Or not even remote play.
1556420	1559620	I just mean like, you know, I guess cross play, whatever you call it, like it worked
1559620	1560420	on both platforms.
1560420	1564100	Those are some of the few titles that aren't compatible for some reason.
1564100	1564900	It's part of the reason.
1564900	1566340	I know that's one of the reasons I wanted to get them.
1566340	1569140	I saw in the comments, everybody's like, Oh, why won't you make this work on Vita?
1569140	1570180	But maybe they will eventually.
1570180	1572260	Oh, well, at least it was only two bucks.
1573860	1576260	I thought the same thing like, Oh, that'd be great to play on my Vita.
1576260	1580740	And then I read all the people in the comments saying, uh, it would be nice if these actually
1580740	1582900	worked on Vita, but it's not on the compatibility list.
1583300	1586900	I'm hoping maybe with all that PlayStation Now stuff in the future too, that putting
1586900	1590900	those games in my library, when PlayStation Now is out, will let me, I'm hoping, I mean,
1590900	1593460	they haven't really said, oh, that's all going to work yet, but I'm hoping that maybe
1593460	1596900	flagging those games as purchased will enable it in PlayStation Now down there.
1596900	1599220	I think if you got it digitally, they should do that, but you never know.
1599220	1599860	Yeah, you never know.
1599860	1600580	You really don't.
1600580	1604340	I mean, then there's this whole debacle with The Last of Us on PlayStation 4 when it just
1604340	1605860	was out, but we'll talk about that later.
1606740	1610020	Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about our frame of reference, the types of stuff
1610100	1611780	that we have been playing this week.
1611780	1614660	Dark Sakura, what have you been up to on your birthday week?
1614660	1616020	Um, Animal Crossing.
1616580	1621780	Um, I got a game called Kami, uh, which is like an origami based puzzle game.
1621780	1622420	It's kind of neat.
1623220	1629140	Um, played to Mass Effect because I've got my mods working again and my shepherd looks
1629140	1629620	awesome.
1631060	1633620	I can't wait to play Mass Effect 3 on my new PC.
1634660	1636100	Did I talk about that on this show yet?
1636100	1637460	I talked about it on Bobby's show, but not here.
1638100	1641140	Uh, Alan built me a new PC yesterday, so happy me.
1641940	1643060	They make a dude mods.
1643860	1644420	Oh yeah.
1644420	1645780	There's some good ones out there too.
1645780	1650580	There's also, um, someone did a, a version that you can use Caden's hair.
1651300	1651800	Okay.
1652580	1656580	Um, and someone made a, uh, a front curl mohawk.
1656580	1657860	That's actually kind of cool looking.
1657860	1661620	Did you see, uh, pics of the cosplay from PAX East with the, did we talk about this
1661620	1662260	this week?
1662260	1662900	Yes, we did.
1662900	1663220	Okay.
1663220	1664180	And he twerked.
1664740	1665240	Yes.
1666040	1668040	This is more of those pictures are coming out.
1668040	1669640	What's the name of my other tumbler?
1670520	1671320	Mass effecting.
1674200	1675560	I couldn't remember if we talked about the show.
1675560	1677160	Yeah, I guess the chat room is right.
1677160	1678680	I'm having Alzheimer's in my old age.
1678680	1679880	That's what Raginator says.
1679880	1680760	Thanks.
1680760	1681720	Eat more blueberries.
1682280	1682600	I guess.
1682600	1684200	Well, that's going to have blueberries in it, right?
1684200	1685160	No, that was us.
1685160	1686280	Those were black currants.
1686280	1692040	God, I think I need more ginkgo blueberries.
1692040	1693400	Thank God it's not just me.
1693400	1694840	I was like, those are blueberries, right?
1695560	1696360	They're really good though.
1696360	1696840	They're good.
1696840	1699960	Currants are better than blueberries in my opinion.
1699960	1701160	And I'm always right.
1701160	1703400	Are they, are they currently better than blueberries?
1707400	1710600	But, um, I, uh, I was going to play some fun.
1710600	1716040	I think I did play a little Final Fantasy 14 this week or I might've, but, um, I'm planning
1716040	1723560	on, um, assuming that I can get my shift trade on Tuesday, then I will be playing a good
1723560	1725080	bit of that while I'm trying to stay awake.
1725080	1727240	If not, then whatever.
1728440	1732680	But I want, I want any people to run with me and help me level some more.
1733640	1734680	Let me tag along.
1735560	1735960	We'll see.
1736760	1738520	I want to do a Brayflop again.
1739880	1741320	Wait until you get that one on hard mode.
1741320	1744840	It's hilarious because the whole dungeon is fighting over cheese.
1747320	1750040	I want someone to run me through a Brayflop tonight.
1750040	1750600	There you go.
1750600	1751480	Well, we'll see.
1751480	1752760	Maybe I can live stream now.
1752760	1754440	Cause that's something I can actually do.
1754440	1755640	I can see how cute I am.
1757240	1758440	We already know.
1758440	1758920	I know.
1758920	1763400	Well, my character's extra cute and her feline adorableness.
1764520	1764760	All right.
1764760	1767080	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I'll go over to Flocko.
1767080	1768280	Bitch I wasn't done.
1768280	1769880	I'm kidding.
1769880	1770600	Excuse me.
1770600	1771640	Go on.
1771640	1772520	No, no, no, I'm done.
1772520	1772760	All right.
1772760	1773160	Flocko.
1773160	1774360	How was your gaming week?
1774360	1777320	I had a pretty good gaming week cause I had most of the week off of work.
1777320	1783000	So I played a lot of Vita games and I played Lego Marvel superheroes on PS4 cause my kids
1783000	1784120	really liked that.
1784120	1787640	And it's funny cause my kids like to either stand in front of the TV or if I'm playing
1787640	1790760	on Vita, they stand, they like lean their heads in front of the Vita, you know, to try
1790760	1791880	to see everything.
1791880	1796280	So I actually did the remote play and when you do it on the Vita, you know, it plays
1796280	1797080	on both at once.
1797080	1799480	So if they're standing in front of the TV, I just look down on the Vita.
1799480	1801880	If they're putting their head in front of the Vita, I just look up at the TV and it
1801880	1802440	worked great.
1802440	1803960	So they love that game.
1803960	1804600	It's pretty fun.
1804600	1806120	I've never played a Lego game before.
1807800	1811720	And I'd always kind of badmouth them cause like, oh, it is kids games, whatever.
1811720	1813240	But it's actually really fun.
1813880	1816680	And it's, there's a lot of cool like inside jokes.
1816680	1822920	There's a part where you're like tumbling through a whatever portal to Asgard.
1822920	1824440	I'm not much of a Marvel guy either.
1824440	1824760	Sorry.
1825400	1827720	But you're going through some kind of portal to Asgard.
1827720	1832440	And as you're like tumbling through a TARDIS, like flies by the other way, like a little
1832440	1833160	Lego TARDIS.
1833160	1834280	It was really cute and funny.
1834840	1836440	So yeah, I played that.
1837080	1839240	I finally beat little big planet Vita after.
1839240	1839880	Oh, nice.
1839880	1840920	Yeah, it was really fun.
1841480	1843960	They did a really good job.
1843960	1847720	I had my doubts cause it's not medium molecule that did it, but they actually did probably
1847720	1850440	one of the better story modes they've ever had in a little big planet game.
1850440	1854600	I like the mechanic of the pushing the bricks by using the rear touch pad and the front
1854600	1855080	touch pad.
1855080	1856680	That was kind of a neat little thing.
1856680	1857880	Yeah, that was a fun level.
1857880	1862520	And actually my son played that one with me and I had him like touch the bricks, at least
1862520	1863400	on the front.
1863400	1864840	He got pretty good at the back touch too.
1864840	1869080	He realized when he touched it, at least on the Vita, uh, excuse me, on the, on the
1869080	1871960	little big planet Vita, as opposed to other games that have back touch, sometimes it gives
1871960	1874920	you a little indicator, like a cursor where your finger is.
1874920	1876120	And so he figured that out.
1876680	1881480	So he was able to really use that to take, hit the blocks for me or kill enemies or I
1881480	1883000	think there's a level we had to guide missiles.
1883880	1885160	He did that for me too.
1885160	1885880	It was really fun.
1885880	1887400	It was like father son play time.
1887400	1889640	And we were both sick that week bonding.
1891080	1893880	You guys are the cutest video games.
1893880	1898040	He's not great at the control stuff, but you know, in the age of like iPads and on all
1898040	1899640	that stuff, he loves touch stuff.
1899640	1902600	So the Vita stuff, he's really been able to get into more than the PS3.
1902600	1905720	Cause if he has three, he has a hard time with the controls, but touch controls are
1905720	1906360	so intuitive.
1906360	1908520	It's like, Oh, I can just put this here.
1908520	1912200	I realized my fingers moving around and, and yeah, he does a great job with that.
1912200	1914840	So, so yeah, I played some gravity rush on Vita.
1914840	1916200	I really love that game.
1916200	1917320	Almost done with that, I think.
1917960	1920360	And lots of Wind Waker with my wife playing.
1921080	1921800	Uh, let's see.
1921800	1924360	Tiger Claw in chat talking about the Lego thing you're saying.
1924360	1928600	Tiger Claw says, maybe that's a sign that we can expect Lego, Lego Doctor Who.
1928600	1930840	And Kaijuta says, Lego, stay away from Doctor Who.
1932840	1935960	Dark Tetsuya says, I kind of want the Lego movie game.
1937480	1938840	I heard that one wasn't so good though.
1938840	1941880	That's they usually get good reviews, but I heard that one didn't get very good reviews
1941880	1948120	because I feel like it's that, that classic case of a movie marketing game.
1948120	1950040	It had to come out as the movie release date.
1950040	1951400	I've heard it's kind of unfinished.
1951400	1951960	You know what I mean?
1952760	1953880	Jamie just gasped.
1953880	1954360	Are you okay?
1954360	1956520	Cause today is also George Takei's birthday.
1956520	1957000	Oh, it is?
1957000	1957560	Oh wow.
1957560	1959720	So happy birthday to my, uh,
1959720	1960360	Oh my.
1961320	1962760	To the man I want to adopt me.
1963320	1964280	Happy birthday.
1964920	1966200	Uh, let's see.
1966200	1969400	Uh, yeah, I'm just thinking about the whole, uh, Lego and Doctor Who thing.
1969400	1973080	It just makes me think like, do you want me to make every nerd out there cringe right now?
1973080	1973400	Watch.
1973400	1973800	Okay.
1973800	1974280	Watch.
1974280	1977800	So Lego does a Doctor Who video game and they let Moffat write it.
1980040	1983560	Sorry.
1983560	1984120	Sorry.
1984120	1988280	Look, art as this show is art is to elicit a reaction.
1988280	1990440	And I just gave a reaction.
1991720	1993160	I just reacted too.
1993160	1994520	Jamie showed me her middle finger.
1994520	1995320	That was the reaction.
1996040	1996440	All right.
1997320	1999640	Oh, I did what I did play one PS3 game this week.
1999640	2000440	And that was the cave.
2000440	2002680	Cause that's another game of Vaclav that I haven't finished yet.
2002680	2004120	And I think I'm almost done with that one.
2006040	2008280	Hey, Jamie says, ew, she hates the cave.
2008840	2010120	No, no, no, no.
2010120	2014120	Did you know the man who invented the Frisbee was cremated after he died and made into a Frisbee?
2015480	2016120	No.
2016120	2017240	You're so weird.
2017240	2019400	Don't bring this stuff up on the show.
2019400	2021720	It's not appropriate unless he's made into Legos.
2021720	2022520	Thank you, Rob.
2022520	2023080	Plastic.
2023080	2023720	I don't know.
2023720	2024520	Yeah, it works.
2024520	2025080	It's a toy.
2027000	2031080	And the cave is, I believe one of the games included in the recent Humble Bundle.
2031080	2032760	I don't know if it's current, but it's recent.
2032760	2033880	I think you're right.
2033880	2035080	I know for Android.
2035080	2038200	I think it's one of those ones that's on Android and PC or maybe just Android.
2038760	2041640	I think it was an Android bundle and then it was on PS Plus some time ago too.
2041640	2045400	It was also free on Amazon not long ago, Amazon mobile.
2045400	2048520	And I got it there too, but I'm still trying to play the PSV version first.
2049880	2050280	All right.
2051000	2052440	Is that it for your gaming week?
2052440	2053000	That's all.
2053000	2053560	All right.
2053560	2054680	I'll talk about my gaming week.
2054680	2054840	Okay.
2054840	2059000	So I teased one for you, Flaco, a little bit ago in that 99 cent sale.
2059000	2059800	I went crazy.
2060440	2063240	And one of the games I bought, I bought the Jurassic Park game.
2063240	2064840	And some people are saying 99 cents.
2064840	2067000	You still pay too much for the Jurassic Park game.
2067080	2070520	Here's the, I guess the game, you know, Telltale does a lot of great games.
2070520	2073880	They've done so, so much, you know, obviously walking dead was phenomenal.
2073880	2077480	And, um, the monkey islands and, you know, they do a lot of good stuff, but
2077480	2079480	Jurassic Park did not get such good reviews.
2079480	2083240	So, but I liked the movie an awful lot, Jurassic Park.
2083240	2087240	I don't read a lot, a lot of books, but I read Jurassic Park when I was younger.
2087240	2090040	I read that whole books and there's, there's so many differences between the
2090040	2092200	book and the movie, by the way, if you didn't know, like everybody dies in the
2092200	2093320	book, everybody dies in the book.
2093320	2094360	I've read the books.
2094360	2095320	You're totally right.
2095320	2095880	Yeah.
2095880	2098280	So anyway, anyway, I didn't, I didn't mean to get on that tangent, but
2098280	2101800	Jurassic Parks had a very interesting history with gaming because my first
2101800	2105960	reaction to playing the Jurassic Park game on PlayStation was this game would
2105960	2107800	have been awesome 15 years ago.
2109080	2114600	But the games we got, uh, for Jurassic Park on the Genesis and on Super
2114600	2116440	Nintendo were, were very different.
2116440	2118840	And they were, they were like the Genesis one was huge.
2118840	2121160	I don't know if you guys remember, but the Jurassic Park on the Genesis was
2121160	2125480	like a hugely popular game because you had to play as the dinosaur.
2125560	2127560	And so that made it like, it was very different and all that.
2127560	2129640	You ever, Jamie, you're the Sega fan in the house.
2129640	2132280	Did you, did you ever play Jurassic Park on the Genesis?
2132920	2135720	Cause, Oh, it's that in the lab.
2135720	2138120	Mind you, when I was growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.
2138120	2138760	That's true.
2138760	2145000	Dan was the big Sega boy and he showed me another way when I moved out here.
2145720	2148280	Well, Aladdin was the other big movie tie in game, but then on the Super
2148280	2150040	Nintendo, it was really weird.
2150040	2153480	Like that was that whole when like virtual reality was really big and like
2153480	2154200	doom and all that.
2154200	2160280	So they actually put like a doom-esque, doom-esque component first person into
2160280	2163880	Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo, where you like go in these buildings and
2163880	2166200	the velociraptors are in the buildings.
2166200	2167240	And it was actually really cool.
2167240	2169400	It was really scary for like a Super Nintendo game.
2169400	2170520	It was pretty, it was pretty neat.
2172120	2174920	I'm sure if you went back and played it today, it would be like super crude,
2174920	2176680	but there's only one thing I can think of.
2177400	2180680	Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.
2180680	2180920	Okay.
2180920	2186760	Anyway, so for whatever reason, Telltale got this license and like 15 years later
2186760	2192520	is making a Jurassic Park game that is really reminiscent in many ways of an old
2192520	2193640	Sega CD game.
2194600	2198600	Like, remember when like full motion video was all the craze and all that,
2198600	2202120	like it's the game itself is very simple.
2202760	2206600	You know, it's a lot of just like exploring different scenes and looking at
2206600	2208120	things in different scenes.
2208120	2211640	And then the other half of the game is basically like QuickTime movie, the game
2211640	2215400	where it's like, you know, press X and react really quick, press O and react
2215400	2218600	really quick and R1 and jiggle the controller and move it in circles and all
2218600	2218920	this stuff.
2218920	2221720	And, and like, if you do something right, then hooray, you live.
2221720	2224680	But if you do something wrong, Oh, a dinosaur just ate a little girl.
2224680	2227880	Like, and yes, that can happen in the game.
2228520	2232920	And so it's kind of like, it's very like, almost like, like dragon's lair meets
2232920	2235000	a CD game of yesteryear.
2235000	2237800	So it's, it's kind of retro in that respect too.
2238600	2242760	Now, this might sound like I'm dogging on the game, but I'm actually not because
2242760	2244600	I actually, I'm enjoying it.
2244600	2247880	Like I'm play, I'm halfway through episode two right now.
2247880	2254920	And what I'm getting a big kick out of is how they made this 15 year old movie
2254920	2259480	relevant again, by creating this whole side story that didn't exist in the books
2259480	2259800	and everything.
2259800	2260920	Basically, it's like fan fiction.
2260920	2264120	You're playing a fan fiction game, but it works like it.
2265000	2269960	And if you guys didn't know what they did is they use, they use some of the
2269960	2274520	unresolved subplots in the movie, because like, for example, you know,
2274520	2277320	and I have spoilers for like a 15 year old movie people.
2277320	2278280	It's probably even older than that.
2278280	2280280	I saw it in high school a long time ago.
2280280	2283800	So, so in the movie, there's the guy Nedry, right?
2283800	2286040	Who was, what's his name on Seinfeld?
2286680	2288840	Newman, Newman on Seinfeld.
2288840	2290360	You forgot to say the magic word.
2291240	2295080	Uh, so he tries, he tries to get off the island, right?
2295080	2298760	And, uh, cause he's, the whole thing is he's smuggling dinosaur embryos to a
2298760	2302040	rival company off the island, but he gets killed by the dinosaur.
2302040	2303720	He's the one that shuts down the security.
2303720	2307000	He tries to drive out, but, and he gets killed by the dinosaur because
2307000	2307880	security's shut down.
2307880	2308120	Right.
2308120	2310200	Before you say this, is this about the shaving can?
2310200	2310600	Yes.
2310600	2311240	Oh my gosh.
2311240	2312120	That's amazing.
2312120	2315400	That's like every fan fiction about Jurassic Park because they never go
2315400	2316120	anywhere with it.
2316120	2318280	It gets, it's almost like it gets preserved.
2318280	2319640	It falls into the mud.
2319640	2321160	It sinks down and you never see it again.
2321160	2323240	It's not even brought up in the game.
2323240	2323960	Oh my gosh.
2324680	2331080	Because did you know that the whole time there was a plan B because Nedry was
2331080	2333800	going to meet people at the docks and then he never showed up.
2333800	2336200	So the people at the docks go looking for him.
2336200	2337400	That's how the game starts.
2337960	2338840	That's amazing.
2338840	2341160	So, and then they have that and then they introduce these characters, but
2341160	2343800	they're making reference to what happens in the movie.
2343800	2345960	Like, you know, there's this one thing where you're looking through a
2346520	2350200	triceratops pan and you see a Jeep and they go, why is there a Jeep out
2350200	2350360	there?
2350360	2354120	And they're like, oh, uh, they have some hot shot paleontologists here looking
2354120	2355960	at the park today type of thing.
2355960	2358360	And then in another scene where you get to the visitor center, you see a
2358360	2361400	helicopter flying away in the background, which signals that that was the end of
2361400	2362120	the movie right there.
2362120	2364680	So it is kind of neat how they created this whole universe that runs
2364680	2365800	concurrently with the movies.
2365800	2370120	So from the story perspective, I'm kind of like, and I went back and read
2370120	2373640	some reviews for the games and a lot of the reviews really razzed the story.
2373640	2375480	I didn't think, I don't think the story is bad at all.
2375720	2378840	I'm like, the story's kind of better than the lost world was.
2378840	2382920	Sorry about it, but the lost world was ridiculous.
2382920	2386920	Like the chick does gymnastics to kick up a lost raptor in the face.
2386920	2387320	Really?
2388600	2390840	I mean, that reminds you guys about the plot of the lost world.
2390840	2392280	It was kind of ridiculous.
2392280	2397720	So the game in sorts is kind of a better sequel in that regard.
2398600	2403320	I will say this though, from a technical perspective, the game needed some
2403320	2403800	tightening up.
2403800	2407560	I don't know if this is unique to PS3, but like I'm talking like frame skips,
2407560	2411080	little hiccups, like you hit the button to react to something and like, I can
2411080	2415560	hear that Sega CD switching to another track in my mind and then skip, skip,
2415560	2415960	skip, skip.
2415960	2417160	Oh, play the new scene.
2417160	2418440	It's like, wow.
2419560	2423560	So I've had an issue with Telltale games on PS3, sadly, because I have, uh,
2423560	2429640	Poker Night 2 and The Walking Dead and those do have some frame rate, like lags
2429640	2431080	and some hiccups.
2431080	2434120	Like, you know, The Walking Dead always is like previously on The Walking Dead
2434120	2437800	and, and sometimes like it'll get ready to load a scene because it has to do it
2437800	2440040	from based on what you've chosen in the past.
2440040	2443560	And it tries to load it and I'll end up missing like half the scene.
2443560	2447240	So I think, I don't know, maybe it's just because the old PS3 hardware or
2447240	2449080	something, but they don't run too well on that.
2449080	2452440	But I still have enjoyed the games, but I deal with the hiccups and the problems
2453240	2454440	are kind of buggy.
2454440	2457000	Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2457000	2459480	Kaijuto says Telltale needs to make a Goonies game.
2460200	2461720	Oh, that's actually a really good idea.
2461720	2465000	Did you hear that they're actually, there's plans on working on the Goonies sequel?
2465000	2467640	They've been talking that on and off for the longest time and no,
2467640	2469800	this has nothing to do with Goonies 2 on the NES.
2469800	2470920	Can we just get that out of the way?
2471480	2474600	I love Goonies 2 on the NES, like Goonies 2 on the NES.
2475320	2476280	Oh God, here we go.
2476280	2479720	I was talking about Jurassic Park, a 15, I'm talking about a two year old video
2479720	2482760	game, but on a 15 year old movie, and now I'm going to get into an NES game,
2482760	2484200	such as an episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
2484200	2485320	Hi, new listeners.
2485880	2490680	Goonies 2 was like a Metroidvania game before like Metroidvania was really a thing.
2490680	2491880	Think about it, right?
2491880	2494680	Goonies 2 is amazing, but it really had nothing to do with the movie.
2494680	2498920	It was only Goonies 2 because there was a Goonies 1 in Japan.
2498920	2502360	It was on what, the Pay Choice 10 here, but it was never released.
2502360	2505960	So it was literally Goonies 2, the video game where there's like a
2505960	2507400	mermaid and shit that you're trying to rescue.
2507400	2509880	It has nothing to do with the movie, but it's such a good game.
2510440	2510920	It is.
2510920	2513240	Anyway, where was I?
2513240	2514200	Jurassic Park.
2514200	2515000	Okay.
2515000	2519320	So it has its flaws, but as somebody who really enjoyed the movie as a kid,
2519320	2521640	I really appreciate what they try to do with it.
2521640	2524920	I do find the quick time action scenes to be a little bit exciting because it does
2524920	2527560	kind of like it gets your, you know, like your, your character is going to get
2527560	2530520	eaten by a goddamn dinosaur if you don't like react in time.
2530520	2531960	So it does have like that tense moment.
2531960	2533400	It succeeds in doing that.
2533400	2536520	I like some of the mechanics where you flip to different points of view.
2537400	2540040	Like you'll be playing as one person and then to really solve a puzzle,
2540040	2543240	you'll have to flip to three different points of view to solve a puzzle.
2543240	2546760	And so I kind of like that, like there's, um, I don't want to spoil too heavy,
2546760	2551320	but in episode two, I just did a puzzle that involves a roller coaster because
2551320	2553640	Jurassic Park after all was going to be a theme park, right?
2553640	2557080	So there's a roller coaster you find, and there's a puzzle involving it where
2557080	2559320	you have to rotate between the three characters to solve it.
2559320	2560600	And I thought that was kind of neat.
2560600	2565400	So, you know, a little bit of a nineties cliche in adventure gaming puzzles,
2565400	2567000	but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
2567000	2570760	So, um, Jurassic Park for 99 cents people.
2571480	2573720	It's, it's a good, like, Hey, remember the movie.
2573720	2574680	Wouldn't it fun?
2574680	2576280	So yeah, I'll probably have to get that.
2576280	2578920	I wouldn't have been mad if I paid like $5.
2578920	2581560	I would have been mad even probably like 20,
2581560	2583000	which would have been five an episode.
2583000	2584600	I've been okay with, I don't know.
2584600	2586120	Did they charge 40 when it first came out?
2586120	2587080	10 an episode that might be.
2587080	2590120	I don't think so because the walking dead was only the latest walking dead.
2590120	2591560	Season two is only $20.
2591560	2591960	Okay.
2591960	2594440	Well then, then it's, it's, it's a decent price.
2594440	2597800	It's it's fine, but it isn't as strong as some of the other telltale games,
2597800	2600520	especially from a technical standpoint, I will say that.
2600520	2602200	But it's, it's worth your time.
2602200	2605800	You know, I think, uh, other games I bought, I bought everyday shooter,
2605800	2608120	which I just missed out on the first time that was out.
2608120	2611000	Um, that's a fun little Twix stick, twin stick game.
2611000	2613080	Um, that it kind of is one of those.
2613080	2615240	You, you learn the game as you go sort of things.
2615240	2618120	Speaking of shooters, I bought a game called retro grade.
2618120	2619960	I had no idea a game like this existed.
2619960	2621800	I somehow missed this on the radar the first time,
2621800	2623880	but it's like a music game as a shooter.
2624520	2630200	And it's the really neat little twist on it is that you play the entire game in reverse.
2630200	2633800	The game starts with the final boss fight and you play the game in reverse.
2634680	2638760	And the whole reason behind that is I guess beating the final boss
2638760	2640920	screwed up the space time continuum.
2640920	2643800	So you have to go back in time to undo what you did.
2643800	2646440	And because of that, everything is predetermined.
2646440	2648600	All the motions in the game are predetermined.
2648600	2653400	Enter how it's a music game because you have to move up and down in, in time.
2653400	2658600	You have to hit the buttons to fire or, or like on fire or whatever in time.
2658600	2662120	And so it's a really neat little mechanic and your score goes down, not up.
2662120	2664840	And the whole goal is to get the low score in the level.
2664840	2666120	So yeah, I liked it.
2666120	2667400	That was really for 99 cents.
2667400	2668520	That was a really cool little game.
2668520	2671880	And I know we have a lot of music game fans at OLR that would get a kick out of that.
2671880	2672920	That was retro grade.
2673960	2674840	I recommend that one.
2675400	2677320	You can also play that with a guitar controller.
2678120	2680440	I do not know where my PS3 guitar controller is.
2680440	2681560	It's probably in a dumpster somewhere.
2681560	2682680	I think I threw it out when we moved.
2683560	2686120	So I'll never get to try out that mode, but it is out there.
2686680	2688920	You could borrow one of our million wins.
2688920	2690120	Not that big a deal.
2690120	2691960	I mean, the controls are, you move up and down.
2691960	2693560	So I imagine that was what the strum did.
2693560	2695160	And then you have the different buttons.
2695160	2696440	So it's pretty.
2697800	2698300	All right.
2699080	2702920	I think that's about otherwise just a lot of the same stuff in my gaming week,
2702920	2705240	like Final Fantasy 14 and Diablo three.
2705240	2707960	I'm up to Paragon level 52 and Diablo three.
2707960	2709240	Cause I'm really enjoying it.
2709240	2712360	Like the, the expansion and the patch fixed everything.
2712360	2714920	It's, it's so much more fun to play now.
2714920	2717640	And yeah, I'll be playing more of it on my new computer this week.
2717640	2718140	Yay.
2718760	2719240	All right.
2720200	2720600	Let's see.
2720600	2726840	I'm trying to look for more chat over at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2728760	2729080	Let's see.
2729080	2730040	I'm trying to see.
2730040	2733160	Jason says, personally, I think Goonies is a horrible game.
2733160	2737160	Technically speaking, punch someone five times, punch every wall,
2737160	2739000	warping doors and hiding those behind you.
2739000	2740120	Fuck that noise.
2740120	2740520	Yeah.
2740520	2741000	You know what?
2741000	2742280	I'll give you that, Jason.
2742280	2744920	A lot of the game didn't make sense.
2744920	2747400	I wonder how much of that was lost in translation.
2747400	2751640	Because again, you remember those early NES games when they were translated from Japanese,
2751640	2753960	a lot of them lost something when they came over.
2753960	2756600	And I'm sure you guys have heard some of those infamous translations.
2756600	2759320	So I'm not sure if Goonies two is partially a victim to that.
2759320	2763400	Cause like to beat the game, you have to know to punch an old woman five times in the face.
2764120	2767960	And it's like, who would do that normally unless you have issues.
2767960	2770440	So, but I'm thinking something was lost in translation there.
2770440	2770760	I don't know.
2770760	2772840	You had to have a guide really to finish the game.
2772840	2773880	So I will give you that.
2773880	2776360	The design was not exactly intuitive.
2777000	2780120	So, uh, Tiger Claw apparently has assembled.
2780120	2783560	Here are the top 10 death scenes from Jurassic Park the game.
2783560	2786840	Would you like to look at some death scenes from Jurassic Park here in studio?
2786840	2788360	We'll look at a couple here.
2788360	2789080	Oh, sure.
2789080	2791640	And maybe, maybe Jason can put some of these on the YouTubes as well
2791640	2793000	when he puts the show together here.
2793000	2793960	Let's just look at a couple of these.
2793960	2795080	Oh, this is a six minute video.
2795080	2798920	We can't look at this whole thing here, but we can look at a couple just to,
2798920	2800520	just to get a feel for the game here.
2800520	2801800	And can we go river rafting?
2803480	2805400	No, we're not going river rafting in the commercial.
2825880	2826200	Okay.
2826200	2828360	I gotta, I gotta stop because this is spoilers.
2829080	2830200	Only if you lose, right?
2831160	2833080	I haven't, there's a part with scuba diving.
2833080	2834360	I'm not even two in the game yet.
2834360	2837320	So I need to need to, um, not do that.
2837320	2838840	What did you say the other games that you got were?
2839800	2843720	I got Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.
2843720	2845240	Retrograde was the shooter.
2845240	2845960	That's the music game.
2845960	2848120	And then Everyday Shooter was the fifth one.
2848120	2848520	Okay.
2848520	2849240	That's what I bought.
2849240	2849960	I spent like five.
2849960	2851880	There was something else I was trying to remember you mentioning,
2851880	2852920	but I don't remember what it was.
2853480	2855400	You should click on my link in chat, Rob.
2855400	2855880	Oh no.
2855880	2857000	What did you do?
2857000	2858200	It's another YouTube.
2858200	2858840	Another one.
2858840	2859400	What is this?
2859960	2860920	Dare I ask?
2860920	2861800	Just click on it.
2862520	2863000	I'm sorry.
2863000	2864120	I know this isn't a whorehouse.
2864120	2890840	Yeah, I found a way to break the show.
2890920	2894040	I would have given the game an extra half star if it had that song in it.
2895000	2898600	Cause you know, they use the infamous John Williams score in the game and they use it
2898600	2902680	very well, but I think I would have given it a half star at extra star though.
2902680	2903960	Holy shit.
2903960	2904920	It's a dinosaur.
2904920	2906600	Like when you die, just play that song.
2911560	2913000	Uh, all right.
2913000	2913480	That's it.
2914040	2915160	That's it for my gaming week.
2915160	2917240	I think that's everybody's gaming weeks.
2917240	2920440	So, uh, some quick housekeeping, please follow us on Twitter.
2920440	2921880	Twitter.com slash O L R.
2921880	2925160	And you can also follow us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash orange on radio or
2925160	2926040	Google plus.
2926040	2927320	Yes, it's still a thing.
2927320	2929960	Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
2929960	2932040	All the places to find us on social networks.
2932600	2936440	As far as I know, we still have shows every week coming up until probably July.
2936440	2937720	No, June, probably E3.
2937720	2940040	We won't be here, uh, that immediate Sunday.
2940040	2940680	We may or may not.
2941560	2943320	I'm still waiting to hear back on E3.
2943320	2947000	Bobby and I are trying to go this year to represent VOG and do some cool stuff there,
2947000	2949240	but we are at the mercy of the E3 Pope.
2949240	2953960	We are awaiting the E3 Pope's blessing and, uh, either we will be blessed or we
2953960	2955720	will be excommunicated.
2955720	2957480	We'll find out in the next couple of weeks.
2957480	2961080	Keep your fingers crossed for us because, uh, we want to, we want to do that same
2961080	2962520	thing that we did last year.
2962520	2964760	Only with two people this time, uh, covering the show.
2964760	2965320	So we'll see.
2965880	2966360	All right.
2966360	2971880	Uh, let us get into some gaming news of which there is, uh, just a little bit this
2971880	2972040	week.
2972040	2975160	It was a bit of a slower news week, but dark soccer and I are going to bounce some
2975160	2977000	game stories around here anyway.
2977000	2981480	Um, and, uh, Flaco Jones, uh, since, uh, I didn't know you were coming tonight
2981480	2982920	until your Easter plans ended early.
2982920	2985160	I didn't give you any stories, but please feel free to chime in.
2985160	2985480	Okay.
2985480	2986120	Okay.
2986120	2986440	All right.
2986440	2990440	We need your, we need your wit and your puns because according to the chat room,
2990440	2992600	according to the chat room, I forgive your puns.
2992600	2993320	Oh, really?
2993320	2997000	I yelled at Loki about it a couple of weeks ago and I've turbo puns.
2997640	3000680	So, uh, you need to make some puns so I can scold you.
3000680	3001400	So fair is fair.
3001400	3002440	I blame Irene.
3002440	3006920	She always tells the best, worst puns and I, then I, I'm challenged to do even
3006920	3008040	more terrible ones.
3008040	3008520	No, I see.
3008520	3009960	So it's, it's a pun competition.
3009960	3010840	Yes, it's a pun off.
3010840	3011720	That's okay.
3011720	3012120	Very good.
3012120	3012760	Very good.
3012760	3013080	All right.
3013080	3016920	Well, starting with this, um, this series has been dormant for a couple of years.
3016920	3019960	I think the last time it had a video game was in 2010 and then it had a movie,
3019960	3023400	which was pretty forgettable, but it's Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia,
3023400	3027480	of course, started off as a classic computer game series that was 2d back in
3027480	3030520	the day and it made the shift as a lot of games did to 3d.
3030520	3033000	And, uh, the last game was, I think on PlayStation three, what?
3033000	3033560	Sands of Time?
3033560	3035160	Was it the last one that they did?
3035160	3038760	Uh, you know, which was, which was a decent, uh, decent game as far as action
3038760	3042600	adventure goes, but the time, the series has been sitting dormant since then.
3042600	3047960	Well, there's rumors out there that Ubisoft is making a new 2d Prince of
3047960	3048520	Persia game.
3048520	3051400	So going back to their roots, but here's the deal.
3051400	3053960	They're going to borrow from another Ubisoft game to do it.
3053960	3056280	And that game is Rayman Legends.
3056280	3059160	Ooby art framework powered the Rayman Legends game.
3059160	3063320	It's also used in a game called Child of Light and a French website.
3063320	3068040	And let's remember that Ubisoft is a French company, a French website, um, is
3068040	3072600	reporting that Ubisoft is making this game using quote the same techniques of
3072600	3074840	animation used in the last Rayman.
3074840	3079000	The Prince's body is divided into several parts, torso, pelvis, leg, shin, foot,
3079000	3082280	forearm, hands, et cetera, that are animated independently.
3082280	3085800	This provides a real diversity and credibility in the postures and movements
3085800	3086760	of the hero.
3086760	3091560	So it basically gives the illusion of 3d modeling, even though it's a 2d game.
3092200	3097400	And of course my mind goes to Extifer and his love of Rayman Legends, which he
3097400	3098840	never shuts up about that game, right?
3098840	3100520	Flaco, has he made you play Rayman Legends?
3101080	3104920	He got me a copy for Christmas on Vita and I still have not taken it out of the
3104920	3105160	street.
3106360	3107720	Well, I've seen so much of it.
3107720	3113160	I feel like I have to like wait now for it to like really go away from my brain
3113160	3116600	for a little bit so I can experience it again without being like, Oh, I've
3116680	3117960	seen this a million times.
3117960	3118840	Well, I'm not sure.
3118840	3122200	My viewpoint of Rayman is a little tainted because I keep thinking about how
3122200	3123720	much Extifer loves the game.
3123720	3127000	And if you guys listen to Hoard House, he talks about the game, even on that
3127000	3128520	show, which is supposed to be about online games.
3128520	3130120	He talks about Rayman a lot.
3130120	3132680	So my perspective is, Oh, people really like Rayman Legends.
3132680	3136360	I don't really know cause I just have Extifer, but I think it's been doing
3136360	3136600	well.
3136600	3138120	They've released it on tons of platforms.
3138120	3139080	I think it does.
3139080	3139480	Okay.
3139480	3144280	I mean, I don't think it did as well as they were hoping you would do, but I
3144280	3146040	know it did pretty well in the Wii U.
3146040	3146680	Yeah.
3146680	3147240	So that's true.
3147240	3149400	Cause it was supposed to be a Wii U exclusive and it's still, I think is
3149400	3150440	where it sold the best.
3150440	3150760	Yeah.
3150760	3151640	Oh, how funny.
3151640	3151880	Yeah.
3152360	3156440	But I kind of think like, Oh, well, you know, a 2d Prince of Persia in that
3156440	3160120	same vein would actually be kind of neat because that's how Prince of Persia
3160120	3161000	started anyway.
3161000	3161160	Right.
3161160	3163480	What do you guys think of the idea of Prince of Persia going back to 2d?
3165160	3166040	I think it's pretty cool.
3166040	3168760	I mean, I don't know about like going back.
3168760	3171560	I didn't really play a lot of the Prince of Persia games, but I just know that
3171560	3173320	that Child of Light game looks awesome.
3173320	3177480	I I've seen, like you said, extra play Rayman Legends a million times.
3177480	3180040	So I think the engine is really nice.
3180040	3182360	So if they're going to put it on anything, why not do that?
3182360	3185960	It's it's proven it's beautiful and it's really smooth and fast.
3185960	3187640	So yeah, go for it.
3187640	3188280	Why not?
3188280	3190120	It can't be any worse.
3190120	3190600	Right.
3190600	3191080	Yeah.
3191080	3192440	I mean, Child of Light looks great.
3192440	3193240	I really want to play it.
3193800	3194440	Darzaka?
3195240	3196760	I think it's an interesting concept.
3196760	3199000	I mean, the whole thing is just, you know,
3199000	3205640	I I can see why there would be an advantage to doing that way,
3205640	3208120	but it seems like it would be complex programming wise.
3208120	3213480	It actually makes me think of basics of flash animation for doing motion
3213480	3216920	movement because you rig your your joints independently.
3217880	3222200	So I'm I'm actually sitting more or less not thinking of how the game would look
3222200	3224440	and play, but thinking of how it would be made.
3225480	3226360	Yeah, I really do.
3226360	3228360	You know, even if it does go back to its 2D roots,
3228360	3230760	I really hope they do modernize it in many ways.
3230760	3233640	It's not that, you know, the classics exist for a reason.
3233640	3234920	The classics are still great.
3234920	3236600	You can get the classic.
3236600	3240200	I believe they put it out on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live a couple of years
3240200	3243320	ago, they redid the classics around the time they put out the latest game.
3243320	3246760	But it's kind of like, all right, well, you know, those games also got a little
3246760	3247560	bit repetitive.
3247560	3250920	I mean, they were great in the 80s, but they don't hold up very well in today's
3250920	3251240	standards.
3251240	3255320	So I really hope if they're taking it to 2D, they're really giving it some varying
3255320	3259160	environments, some new mechanics, you know, some things to make it competitive
3259160	3261240	with today's platforming.
3261240	3264440	And dude better look Persian and not like some white dude.
3265240	3265560	Yes.
3265560	3268600	And he better look he better look like he's actually the Prince of Persia.
3268600	3269960	He can't look like Jake Gyllenhaal.
3271400	3272680	Very few people can look like him.
3273960	3276200	Actually, I'd be okay with him looking like Jake Gyllenhaal.
3277640	3279080	I saw that movie in the theater.
3279080	3279880	Oh, I'm sorry.
3280440	3282360	It was it was a movie.
3282360	3286920	I think that if you're going to have somebody represent a certain ethnicity,
3286920	3289160	they need to look like said ethnicity.
3289800	3290360	The end.
3291160	3293480	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3293480	3296200	Dungeon Buster says, I wouldn't mind seeing a 2D Prince of Persia.
3296200	3298120	It's a nice homage to its roots.
3298120	3301880	Darth Tetsuya said, I did like the 2D originals, though I think the only one I've
3301880	3305000	liked since was Sands of Time because it was similar to the originals.
3305000	3307320	But this new 2D one sounds interesting.
3307960	3312520	And Act F says, I'm in favor of Prince of Persia Origins, legends.
3312520	3313160	So there you go.
3313160	3315800	It looks like most people in our chat room are open to the idea.
3315800	3318760	So again, how much is it going to cost?
3318760	3321320	And is it going to look like a game that's worth 60 bucks?
3321320	3322600	If that's throughout, they go with it.
3322600	3323640	So we'll see.
3323640	3327000	So I hope they go download route, like with Child of Light.
3327000	3328520	Was that $15, $20?
3328520	3329080	I think so.
3329080	3331320	That could be it could end up being a network game.
3331320	3333320	I would assume since they're using the same engine,
3333320	3334520	it probably saves them a lot of money.
3334520	3335640	And you know, why not?
3336200	3339720	Well, I imagine this is one of the E3 things that is leaked out.
3339720	3342840	So we'll know if this is fact or crap come E3.
3342840	3344280	Remember, that is rumor right now.
3344280	3347240	But it's one of those rumors that has a lot of buzz around it.
3347240	3350280	Like, you know, you can usually tell the true runs from the fake ones.
3350280	3351000	So we'll see.
3351000	3351720	We'll see.
3351720	3352440	Anyhow, moving on.
3352440	3353000	Dark Sakura.
3353560	3359800	Well, there's this game that we play that involves cat people and really tall
3359800	3363480	people and really huge people and really tiny people.
3363480	3365480	Let's see Final Fantasy XIV.
3365480	3365980	No shit.
3367880	3374120	So anyway, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn has reached 2 million registered user accounts.
3375240	3380920	So that means that this is since when was the release?
3380920	3382440	It was like last year.
3382440	3387320	So with the they basically after the beta, there were another million more signups.
3387320	3390520	So it's really starting to chug along.
3391240	3395320	So I'm very pleased because that means they will at least have it for a little while longer.
3396200	3401160	And such a neat story because of the fact that, you know, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn
3401160	3406520	was essentially having to do over a video game that flocked and it worked.
3406520	3408920	And I think there was a lot of that into the story.
3409960	3410200	Yeah.
3410200	3410440	Oh, yeah.
3410440	3414520	They really had to back park the car into this spot that somebody else built, you know,
3414520	3416600	that was kind of a mess in some ways.
3416600	3418280	But they did a great job with it.
3418280	3419640	Like, it's a great MMO.
3419640	3421560	You guys know I never shut up about it.
3421560	3424920	And I'm excited that it keeps gaining steam too, because
3424920	3428280	I think Warcraft could use a little competition.
3428280	3430200	And it's not that's no disrespect towards Warcraft.
3430200	3431240	I love World of Warcraft.
3431240	3433640	I can't wait for the next expansion for World of Warcraft.
3433640	3438040	But I think Blizzard kind of tends to rest on their laurels a little bit with World of Warcraft,
3438040	3441080	because there is literally nothing going on in that game right now.
3441080	3445400	And Blizzard thinks they can get away with that for another six months until that expansion comes out.
3445960	3449800	And so I kind of think Blizzard needs a little fire under their tushies.
3449800	3450760	So I think this is only
3450760	3451480	a little?
3451480	3451980	Yeah.
3452280	3458040	Well, to be fair, I'm like, I am also obsessing about Diablo 3 right now.
3458040	3459160	And that's Blizzard.
3459160	3463640	I know tons of people that are losing their shit over Hearthstone, which is also Blizzard.
3463640	3466120	And that just had an iPad thing too.
3466120	3469080	So, you know, it's not like Blizzard isn't doing good things other places.
3469080	3473880	But it's just like, as a long time Warcraft fan, I kind of, I hate the whole...
3474440	3475560	They do a patch.
3475560	3476520	They do a patch.
3476520	3477720	They do a patch.
3477720	3478520	Drought.
3479640	3480600	$40 expansion.
3481720	3482840	Patch, patch, patch.
3482840	3483340	Drought.
3484360	3485400	$50 expansion.
3485400	3485880	Yeah.
3485880	3490120	The only thing I'm excited remotely about the next WoW anyway,
3490120	3493080	is just I want more Space Goats lore and I can read that.
3494920	3499400	They did things with the characters after the last bit that I just was not happy about.
3499400	3500680	So I'm kind of done.
3503640	3506360	Well, but you have been enjoying Final Fantasy XIV.
3507000	3508680	What do you think about Final Fantasy XIV?
3508680	3511240	Have you been enjoying it and you and your time back?
3514760	3515800	I'm really liking it.
3515800	3518200	I mean, it's not that I...
3519640	3521560	I mean, I just don't have a lot of time,
3521560	3523960	but I like that I can play it when I don't have a lot of time.
3524840	3527480	I will say this though, because I don't want to sound like I'm totally up
3527480	3531880	Squeenix's ass in my praise of Final Fantasy XIV, because the game isn't without flaws.
3531880	3534680	Like I do think Endgame right now is a little bit flawed.
3534680	3538280	I think the content itself gets a little dry,
3538920	3543640	but the good news is that Square Enix has done a very good job of giving regular updates.
3543640	3548280	And if they can actually keep sustaining that and not do these big drought phases like Warcraft has,
3548280	3549480	that's going to be the real test.
3549480	3551640	But if they can, apparently they have two teams,
3551640	3553400	one on the expansion, one on patches.
3553400	3555960	So if they really are able to kind of keep going with this,
3555960	3560760	it'll be a really, really good thing because each patch brings some like great stuff.
3560760	3563880	Like it seems like they have one every couple of months right now, right?
3563880	3567400	Yeah. And they're talking, there's going to be a, let's see, they're on 2.2 right now.
3567400	3569720	And then the next one's 2.3. That's a few months away,
3569720	3572520	but they're saying 2.25 will be out at the end of this month.
3572520	3575080	See more frequent, smaller patches. It works.
3575080	3576200	Yes. Just do it.
3576760	3580440	If I would just like take a bunch of their content and just like, you know what,
3580440	3583080	let's just put this thing in a patch.
3583080	3585240	People would, I mean, maybe it's a little artificial,
3585240	3587560	but people I think would feel better about it than getting it.
3587560	3587880	Yeah.
3587880	3590200	I don't know all at once and then getting nothing for two years.
3590200	3591960	Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
3591960	3594280	I just wish I had a little bit more time to play.
3594920	3599880	Um, but I, you know, cause everyone's sort of shot past me,
3599880	3602520	but I also have other things that I do.
3602520	3606360	So, but, but the nice thing is, is that with the whole level sinking, you know,
3606360	3609000	you can get your friends to come do the lower stuff with you.
3609000	3612680	And it's not just busy beating Titan.
3612680	3615000	They don't just raffle stomp everything and all that.
3615000	3617160	I did like tagging along for the treasure hunt,
3617160	3619880	even though I can't kill anything cause I at least get a little bit of something out of it.
3620280	3623400	But it was fun. I just stood back there and danced.
3625400	3627560	To register participation for this week's episode of orange
3627560	3630680	underrated with vog network.com. Use the passphrase journey.
3631400	3633880	Uh, C. Allen, our chat, Si Allen, our chat room.
3633880	3635320	I always mispronounce that name. So sorry, buddy.
3635880	3641320	In chat says sky is on squares payroll. I wish it would be, I can get paid for this.
3641320	3643000	How do you think you got this sweet new house?
3643000	3644280	All I have to do is sell out.
3645240	3648440	Yeah. You know, you're the first guest in studio N seven, I believe.
3648440	3648840	Really?
3649560	3651000	Wow. I guess so.
3651000	3654040	Yeah. And we actually, we have still haven't shown pictures of the new studio out there.
3654040	3656840	You want to, you want to quickly describe for listeners the new studio?
3656840	3660760	I don't have the best like way of describing things, but it's pretty cool.
3660760	3663800	We've had pictures of my feet in the new studio.
3663800	3668280	That's true. Um, no, I really like it here. I like all the geeky posters,
3668280	3670600	the game posters in your kingdom hearts. That's pretty awesome.
3670600	3671560	That was Alan's idea.
3671560	3675800	Yeah, I love it. I love all the posters. Uh, it's super cozy.
3676520	3677480	Keep it a secret.
3677480	3682840	It's like we're in, we're in like your living room or dining room area and it's just pretty,
3682840	3684360	it's pretty amazing. I really like it.
3684360	3684860	Thank you.
3685400	3689400	It's like, it's way different than being huddled over the kitchen table. The last time I was like,
3689400	3693000	that's all hit by the sit by the kitchen table and tell stories.
3693800	3696200	It's like in here you actually get to lounge around a little bit.
3696200	3700920	Yeah. I feel like I'm like kicking back. I got my brew free or die IPA product plug
3700920	3705400	and uh, it's really good. And so I'm just drinking some beers and having a good time here.
3705400	3708600	Awesome. I like, it's super cozy in here. It feels great.
3708600	3714600	We'll get a YouTube or something up soon and do all that. All right. Uh, let's see. Um,
3715800	3718520	what else do I want to say about final fantasy? I thought it was something else
3718520	3721400	I wanted to say about the game. Fat choco bows.
3721400	3726360	Yeah. Fat choco bows are great. Uh, the angle that final fantasy has that wow. Doesn't that
3726360	3731640	I think really does give them a leg up. PC PlayStation four, PlayStation three,
3731640	3736040	all coexisting peacefully on the same servers. Not a lot of games that do that.
3736040	3742760	Last game I can think of that did that final fantasy 11, which included Microsoft and Alan,
3742760	3746120	come over here. Alan. Alan's like me, me, me. I want to say something. Yes, Alan. Hi Alan.
3746120	3749160	How are you doing? I'm doing all right. Thank you for building me a PC by the way.
3749160	3752200	Maybe I'll sit in at the start of TARP part B and we can talk about it.
3752200	3755960	Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You can share everybody, the geeky specs and everything. Uh, what'd you want
3755960	3762600	to say about all this? Uh, the rumor is that the reason why, uh, final fantasy 14 is not on the
3762600	3767400	three 60 or rather the Xbox one is because Microsoft doesn't want their player base
3767400	3773400	interacting with people on the other console. They want their own 14 world. And square's like,
3773400	3777880	no, that's not what the game is. So Microsoft doesn't get 14 because they don't want to let
3777880	3782600	other kids play nice. I don't think that's a rumor. I think that's true, but it's, it's,
3782600	3788760	if the thing that gets me is that, but 11 was like, I was at the E3 where at the Microsoft
3788760	3794280	booth, they made a huge deal about 11 coming to the Xbox three 60 and that you were going to be
3794280	3799800	able to play with everybody else. And that was you, but you still had to have gold to do that.
3799800	3806280	And then the play online shed, right? Which by the way, who co-owned play online Sony. So you
3806280	3811160	had to install a Sony product on your Xbox three 60 to play final fantasy 11. That game broke all
3811160	3816680	the fucking rules and Microsoft was like Xbox one can play blu-rays. So I guess that's true.
3816680	3822280	That's true. Sony making money all over. All right. Uh, let's move on. Speaking of final
3822280	3825880	fantasy, I have another story about final fantasy for you guys. And that is about final fantasy
3825880	3832200	three fantasy three, not three America, which was actually six. Okay. But we're talking the
3832200	3837640	old school NES final fantasy three Japan that has been re-released here on America on the DS,
3837640	3842040	right? They did it in a three D format. They made it look more like the PlayStation
3842040	3846840	one era games a little bit. Um, it was on the DS and now it's on mobile phones, right?
3846840	3855320	Well, guess what? Apparently it's coming to PCs as well. Uh, this is revealed by a rating from,
3855320	3859400	you know, ratings boards tend to spill the beans all the times. It's always in another country.
3859400	3863960	Well, thank you, Germany. Germany's usk board apparently leaked the news file fantasy three
3863960	3869160	on the PC. Hey, for what it's worth, it's rated usk six, which I'm imagining means what six and
3869160	3873240	up probably type of thing. Uh, we know that final fantasy seven and five has a three already exists
3873240	3878520	on the PC, but we have not heard anything about final fantasy three. This would make sense though.
3878520	3883560	I mean, I would imagine the back structure that goes into the game can't be that much more
3883560	3890040	complicated than the already existing iOS port and excuse me, iOS port for Jamie gets me on that.
3890040	3897000	And, um, Android part heart. Uh, I, I, I imagine that it's not that difficult once those ports
3897000	3901640	exist to get it over to PC as well. I mean, granted my programming knowledge is very little,
3901640	3907400	but I can't imagine it's too difficult. But the interesting news is that would lead me to think
3907400	3912440	that if this is released and does a decent job, which final fantasy on the steam store at a
3912440	3917640	discount ought to do pretty well. This means we're going to get final fantasy four, final fantasy
3917640	3923400	five, and the, well, let's hope if they decide to put out file fantasy six, they go back and
3923400	3928120	fix some things that were wrong with it. But this could very much open the door to a lot more final
3928120	3935000	fantasy games on steam. We'll see. This could be very, very interesting. All right. Uh, going to
3935000	3941800	our chat room over at live.vog network.com Akuma JP and chat says why final fantasy three is already
3941800	3949240	everywhere. Good point. Keep in mind Akuma JP. We never, we, the game was new to us until the
3949240	3953560	DS version came out. It was the last final fantasy game to get released in the U S that
3953560	3959480	had been out in Japan, but not here. Translated Rome. Oh, look at that. Oh my gosh. On your little
3960120	3967480	Android. That's amazing. Um, Bobby Black Wolf wanting to clarify, uh, what Alan had brought
3967480	3972840	up earlier here about fantasy 11. He actually, uh, pointed to a news article from RPG site.net
3972840	3977160	that says Microsoft refuses to allow titles to share a multiplayer service between other
3977160	3982280	platforms for final fantasy 11s, Xbox three 60 release. The company made an exception,
3982280	3987480	presumably to Curry favor with square Enix to secure final fantasy thirteens release for their
3987480	3993400	console, but no such exception was made for the last latest MMO entry. Well, if the game continues
3993400	3997880	to do well, they might need to reconsider. Maybe they should pull final fantasy 15 from it. No,
3997880	4003480	just kidding. No, it worked. They got final fantasy, uh, 13 on there. So right. 12 and
4003480	4009240	did they get 12? No, just 13. Yeah. 12 was 12 was on PlayStation two. So yeah, I wish they'd done
4009240	4015000	12 on Xbox 360, but they didn't. Yeah. So no, it was just 13, 13, 13, two, 13, three, 13, four,
4015000	4020440	13. Sorry. I lost track. And presumably 15 is on the Xbox one as well. That's what I've heard.
4021400	4026440	So, so my joke was take it away from them. Well, there, there's some interesting news
4026440	4031240	we'll get into later where maybe Sony has now done some things that might not sit well with
4031240	4035320	Square Enix. So we'll see. We'll see. We'll get into that later in the show. All right. Um,
4036840	4040360	meanwhile, let's move on with some more news before we get to release date stark Sakura.
4041080	4047080	Well, there was some crap going on with elder scrolls online. They found a bug that lets you,
4048040	4055800	basically duplicate pretty much unlimited amounts of gold shows any max online studios that, uh, no,
4056360	4065000	they are, uh, going in and trying to, uh, make sure they can get the local economy back to normal
4065000	4072040	and trying to get the bug ripped out and squished like the evil that it is. Um, but they haven't
4072040	4075880	said anything about like what exactly they're going to do to address it. Well, yeah, usually
4075880	4080680	they're not going to tell you because they don't want people to duplicate the bug. That kind of
4080680	4085960	stuff is killer in MMOs, those types of exploits. Final fantasy 14 actually had one when the game
4085960	4090360	first launched on the realm reborn and they took out, not only did they patch it out without
4090360	4094520	telling people they were going to do it, they did it overnight, but then they went and like,
4094520	4099400	if you had Gil from this exploit, they either banned you or took your Gil away, all of it.
4100520	4105000	So, and like there were people that got caught up in it that weren't even like somebody had bought
4105000	4109400	something with the Gil from their auction house posting. And so they got the money taken back.
4109960	4114360	Like it's that it will fuck up an economy that good where they have to really change that.
4114360	4119800	But that's, that's crazy when, from my understanding is this bug was reported in beta.
4121160	4126760	Well, what they did since is that basically they have, um, disabled access to Guild banks
4127480	4131720	and, um, they had a patch out that changes the auto stacking in the Guild banks.
4132680	4136680	So it's basically trying to prevent it until they can, until they can fix the economy.
4137720	4142520	Oh, there you go. If you abuse it, lock it down elder scrolls online. You know,
4142520	4146120	there are some people I know that are playing it. They're really, really enjoy it. But, um,
4146120	4149400	overall the reception seems to be a little bit tepid. So I'll be interested to see if
4149400	4153960	they can keep up that sub fee thing going on. So you haven't checked that out at all, right? Flaco?
4153960	4158840	No, I have not. Not even the beta again, PCs dead, but it's supposed to be coming to BS four. So
4158840	4163160	it is. Uh, is that one of the ones that's on the one as well? I don't remember. I guess not.
4163160	4166760	I probably not. I don't think so. I don't think any, I don't think that any of these MMOs are
4166760	4171880	coming to one like world of tanks. Yeah. But then that's exclusive to them though. Right? Yeah,
4171880	4177000	it is. Yeah. So there you go. Get anything is by making it an exclusive. Uh, they had defiance on
4177000	4181320	three 60, but those servers were segregated or segregated. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's how they
4181320	4184120	got away with, I don't know. Maybe they're, maybe they're getting it and it'll be segregated.
4185080	4189800	All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates and talk about some, uh, games
4189800	4194840	coming out soon in a store near you this week, uh, in the U S since Loki's not here tonight,
4194840	4199320	I'll go ahead and do the U S releases here. Uh, we have demon gaze coming out on the PlayStation
4199320	4206280	Vita Tesla effect on a windows and Macintosh. That's a text Murphy adventure and war face on
4206280	4210920	X-Box live arcade, all those games on the 22nd, as well as on the PlayStation four Flaco. I don't
4210920	4215880	know if you've heard about this game. Octo dad, deadliest cash. I am dying. I played it actually
4215880	4221800	on a demo kiosk fries and it was so much fun and a, you know, and I'm big into those, um,
4221800	4226840	what do they got? Awesome games done quick charity marathons. Uh, two years ago they had the people
4226840	4232680	that made Octo dad come on there and demo that, that verse version of the game that I believe was
4232680	4236920	free or really cheap. It was kind of like, you know, their, their first version of it. Right.
4236920	4242360	And, uh, it was really funny to watch them play it. And that, in that game it was on the PC and
4242360	4246600	you had to take the mouse and dip it in, hold it either the left or right mouse and like move,
4246600	4252120	like slide it forward and to move your little Octo legs. And from what I saw and then from what
4252120	4255800	I played at the PlayStation four controller, they really captured that perfectly because
4255800	4260760	you had to like hold up, hold one of the shoulder buttons and move one stick to move your, like half
4260760	4265160	of your legs on the one side of your body and then do it again to move your other legs. And you pick
4265160	4268920	stuff up and you move around very surgeon, similar, like, like you knock everything down
4268920	4273640	when you move around. It was really fun to play. And you know, a part of me, you know, I'm like,
4273640	4277240	I'm such a cheapskate. I'm like, please do you play station plus, but if it isn't,
4277240	4280360	I'll probably still throw some money that way because it looks really fun. Well,
4280360	4285400	there could always be a 99 cents sale. I know, but do I want to wait now? Do I want to wait?
4285960	4290040	I could wait for PlayStation plus, which I usually do, but for this game I might make an exception
4290040	4294840	because it was so much fun. Like you had to put on your tux to get to your like wedding.
4294840	4298200	It was hilarious. And no one knows you're an octopus because you're in disguise.
4299160	4304040	Well, on the 25th, a little later in the week, you can look forward to dark souls to getting
4304040	4310440	its windows release. So you can die over and over and over and over and over and over
4311720	4318600	and over and over again on your windows machines. So dark souls two coming to kill you this week
4318600	4324040	on the 25th, also on the 25th, a lot of Wii U Nintendo fans, very excited for the release of
4324040	4331800	NES remix two AKA NES remix with the good games coming out this week on the Wii U I'll probably
4331800	4335960	be picking that up. So I enjoyed any S remix until I had to play the games that you unlock.
4336520	4344360	So I was like, wow, they usually the unlock stuff is the good stuff. But here I got golf and wrecking
4344360	4351080	crew and urban champion. Are they discounting the first one? I don't know. But if you own both,
4351080	4355720	you get like a bonus mode, you get that 90s championship mode, where you can, you know,
4355720	4360600	you get the like, remember that cartridge that was in three steps, the very rare cartridge they did,
4360600	4365080	like a wizard style tournament where you did, it was rare. I don't remember. I didn't have rare
4365080	4371720	stuff. No, no, no. I mean, it was actually a rare. That's what I meant. I only had, what was it? The
4371720	4376520	86 World Championship? Yeah, there was two of them. One of them had rad racer and Tetris and
4376520	4381880	another one had, I don't remember. Yeah. I didn't, my parents hated buying me video games. So I only
4381880	4386920	got video games that were handed down to me. So I got whatever my uncles bought. All right. So those
4386920	4391160	are the releases in the U S this week. Let's travel over to Japan real quick and see what's coming out
4391160	4396040	over there. Cause you know, what comes out here tends to come out there a little later. Sometimes
4396040	4400280	what comes out there comes out here a little later. Sometimes, uh, first off, uh, on the
4400280	4403960	PlayStation four, nothing. Cause you know, it's still kind of new over there and they did get
4403960	4408600	final fantasy this week. Uh, Xbox one still not released over there. So there's nothing to report
4408600	4414440	on that on the PlayStation three. However, there's a few things, uh, 2014 FIFA world cup Brazil on
4414440	4421160	April 24th, along with grand theft auto for the complete edition, uh, love photon flowers. You
4421160	4425160	know, we love our love love here at orange on its radio. And so that is coming out on PlayStation
4425160	4430440	three red dead redemption gets a price reduction in the complete edition comes out, uh, as well on
4430440	4438360	the 24th and ahead of him. Tengoku dah, toe, Omo, Tata, Yandere, Jiyoku data comes out this week
4438360	4444280	as well. And I have no idea what that is, but, uh, I recognize the word Tengoku that's heaven,
4444280	4453480	right? Yes. Uh, it looks like cute girls raising a cat who's and the girls sometimes their clothes
4453480	4458440	fall off. That's apparently what I'm getting from the screenshots and they're in made uniforms
4459240	4464680	and, uh, pervy kids everywhere. The cat looks up at them from very low angles. Yeah.
4466920	4468600	I think we know what kind of game that is. All right.
4470200	4473080	Those are the kind of games that for some reason don't get released here. I don't understand,
4473800	4479640	uh, on the Xbox three 60 this week, uh, monster hunter frontier GG premium package. Ooh, uh,
4480280	4487080	Jason love plus Pingo in regular limited and Sega store limited edition. Is that like the old school
4487080	4494600	Pango game? Like redone? Oh my God. It is. It's the old school Pango game. Remember the,
4494600	4498680	the penguin that you push around the cubes and everything? It's like a new version of that,
4498680	4505400	but it's like in widescreen and shit. Are we getting this here? That's kind of rad.
4506040	4511640	Not with that box art. Yeah. That box art is amazing. I love it. I guess. Yeah. Wow. I didn't
4511640	4516040	know that Pango still had like rabid fans over in Japan or something enough to necessitate this in
4516040	4520280	three different releases. That's pretty cool. All right. Well checking out the handhelds. Oh,
4520280	4525000	sorry. I strict with you real quick here. We, you does have, they get the retail release of
4525000	4529640	Famicom remix one and two. They're getting a retail release this week. So you got that as
4529640	4534600	well as a monster hunter premium package as well. I think it's just a rebranding of monster hunter
4534600	4540040	all over again. Checking the handhelds now on the PlayStation Vita blaze blue chrono phantasma,
4540040	4545560	uh, Rayman legends and sword art online hollow fragment in regular and limited edition on the
4545640	4551880	Vita and on the 3DS this week, uh, theater them final fantasy curtain call. Ooh, I want to play
4551880	4559480	that for the record. Um, Ecoma JP says that Pango is huge in Japan. Wow. I love Pango. I didn't know
4559480	4564280	it was like a huge thing over there. That's cool. Uh, and, uh, let's see if last but not least on
4564280	4572760	the 3DS this week, maple story. Unmei no shouju comes out this week. Fate of what? Uh, it's just
4572760	4576760	a maple story side story. I'm sure is all that is. It looks, I'm trying to see if it's like,
4576760	4582600	it looks like the actual maple story is so cute and it looks boring as hell to me, honestly.
4584680	4588360	All right. Some people will be into it and yes, thank you. Acted after I was thinking that
4588360	4594680	Octo dad equals chicken boo, the game where a disguise look like human guys. Isn't, um,
4594680	4600680	Octo dad more like QWOP kind of, I never played that, but I heard that control wise. Yeah.
4600680	4605480	I guess surgeon simulator, surgeon simulator meets chicken boo. Maybe that's a better
4605480	4612440	description. Anyhow, dark soccer. How about the UK? Um, there's some stuff, a few things. Um,
4612440	4619400	on the 22nd war face comes out 23rd, the walking dead season two on Vita and 25th dark souls two
4619400	4624760	and Joe Joe's bizarre adventures, all star battle. And that's it. You know, it was just funny. I'm
4625080	4627800	still kind of hilarious that Joe Joe's bizarre adventure is still like,
4628840	4636280	uh, I guess a lucrative IP, especially since it's been done for like years. Wasn't,
4636280	4641000	I think the manga was like originally out in like the mid early to mid eighties. Wasn't it?
4642200	4649960	I think so, but my, my mind just goes to Mojo Jojo or KC and Jojo, but how did the Jojo
4650200	4655880	fighting some system or the other? Yes. My kids love Powerpuff girls.
4656760	4660840	All right. One more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. And
4660840	4666840	I like being able to do gamers do good news stories this week. And there was a great,
4666840	4672920	uh, there was a really cool little fundraiser that happened this week, uh, that was taking place on
4672920	4677480	Twitch, you know, as a lot of fundraisers do for video games, but playing a game that's near and
4677480	4686200	dear to our hearts. DDR. Yes. They were playing DDR on Twitch for the team in training leukemia
4686200	4690840	and lymphoma society. Um, so they were on there. I'm trying to remember what the specific rules of
4690840	4696280	the whole thing were. I believe it was that he was going to play, uh, DDR. He was going to keep going
4696280	4701000	and, uh, his name is Jeff is the guy that did it. And, uh, Carl, his friend was the guy that was
4701000	4705160	raising money for the leukemia lymphoma society. I've actually heard of this cause I have friends
4705160	4709080	that do this. It's like a big marathon that you raise money to do. And you know, at, um,
4709080	4713080	the money goes to a good cause obviously. And they actually do good on like the Komen group
4713080	4718440	for breast cancer. Yes. Uh, and, uh, so they were doing a desert bus for hope style where
4718440	4724920	you donate and it will force them to keep playing DDR continuously. And, uh, if you donate, you can
4724920	4731080	make requests to do like weird things or play songs, make them play, keep on moving or, or what
4731080	4736040	is that song? That's so God awful in the game. Um, let them move. You can play, let them move
4736040	4740680	over and over and over again, if you want. Um, well notch, you know, the notch that made
4740680	4747960	Minecraft, he decided to drop $10,000 on it. So they got to dance all night long. They went for 16
4747960	4752920	hours. So nice. Very cool. He has all that extra money. He's not supporting the Oculus anymore.
4752920	4761800	Now, now don't shade him when he's doing good. Yes, he's doing, I said some shady things about
4761800	4765800	notch a couple of weeks ago. Cause I thought that was some, some BS, that whole thing about the
4765800	4770840	Oculus, but look, he's going to put the money towards good places. We should say thank you.
4770840	4777560	Not so good job. Not good job right off job notch. Now maybe you should reconsider some other things.
4777560	4782360	No, in all, in all seriousness, I know some of our listeners were like, I know like Jason was
4782360	4785720	watching this feed and as soon as Matt was telling me about it and dark Tetsuya,
4785720	4789240	all these people were talking about, uh, what was going on with that. So I think that's a great
4789240	4793960	thing. Uh, raising the money for good. So, uh, congrats. And I, that's awesome that it was such
4793960	4799960	a success. They raised, I think I heard it was like $17,000. Wow. Yeah. Right. God. And I thought
4799960	4804440	it was awesome when we raised a thousand dollars on Horde house last year, which was awesome.
4804440	4810280	Don't get me wrong. No, that's great. Congrats you guys. All right. And I really hope you didn't
4810280	4816360	have to play, let them move. Cause the song is so awful. So awful. Hey, uh, less awful.
4816360	4821240	A chance to take a trip down memory lane and visit a classic video game. The dark soccer things. Hey,
4822200	4830120	listen, all you little brats out there enough of this whole new fangled MMOs that aren't on your
4830120	4835000	X-Box one, those were called gemstone and they were texts and you plan through AOL. That's right.
4835000	4841320	You played Ultima online or get out. You might've been eaten by a group and you liked it. Maybe
4841320	4847560	it's the classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find
4847560	4854600	a game that she thinks, Hey, play this. Are you stupid? Dark Sakura. Yeah. You're stupid. Cause
4854600	4859560	you are the dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Alex Kidd miracle world.
4859560	4864360	Because I somehow haven't done this game yet. How have you never done Alex? I think I did
4864360	4868520	Alex Kidd in Shinobi world, which was the one I really liked. Ah, okay. Alex Kidd in miracle
4868520	4873560	world. Alex Kidd in miracle world is a very special game. Um, it was a platformer that came
4873560	4879720	out on the Sega master system and it came out in Japan on Saturday, November 1st, 1986. And then
4879720	4888920	went to, uh, the Western area and Australia in 1987. And it's probably the best known of the
4888920	4895000	Alex Kidd games. And when the master system two came out, Alex Kidd miracle world was built into
4895000	4905720	the system. And, um, it basically you play as Alex Kidd who lives in the miracle world. Um,
4906360	4912120	that's like this big fantasy world and he has the ability to punch rocks. And so he's going to look
4912120	4917880	for his, uh, long lost brother, Prince Eagle. And he punches frogs in the face.
4917880	4925240	He does. Um, to fight against Junkin the great who, um, took over the land of Radaxian.
4926520	4934040	So basically, um, you basically have to, uh, all the citizens were turned into stone.
4934680	4941320	And so you have to, uh, basically do all this crap to go rescue people. And you go around punching
4941320	4947080	rocks and punching creatures and riding. And you're on a motorcycle. Exactly. Riding
4947160	4953960	motorcycle. So you have all kinds of different stuff to go. And this feature, um, you basically
4953960	4959240	also have different ways to continue the game. It has a continue feature that's undocumented
4959240	4964120	where you can continue the game with three lives from the beginning of the level where you died.
4964120	4969720	You hold the up button and press the, uh, the two button eight times during the game over screen.
4969720	4976360	But it costs you 400 bombs, which is the, uh, the currency in game. Um, to finish,
4976360	4983560	um, you also, uh, have to face a boss who you have to win by playing, uh, Junkin Pong,
4983560	4990040	which is, you know, rock, paper, scissors. And then, um, it's such a weird way to fight bosses.
4990040	4995880	You play rock, paper, scissors. There's no, there's a strategy, but, um, to finish the stage,
4995880	5000520	you also have to grab a food object at the end of each of the stages. You can only take one hit
5000520	5007320	before you die and it doesn't have a battery save option or a password system. So what you see is
5007320	5011880	what you get. And to be good at this game, you really have to wait, wait, you die in one hit.
5014760	5022680	Back in the day, you had to be a pro. However, like I said, there was the, uh,
5022680	5032600	undocumented system. So Sega loves us. Um, so, um, well, if they really loved us,
5032600	5037960	they give us Shenmue three. So I don't think they really need to let the Shenmue thing go. I can't.
5039560	5047160	Anyway, um, this was, uh, basically the game was created to combat Super Mario Brothers.
5047960	5057160	Um, and Sega, um, was, uh, really trying to, to have a good competitor. Um, basically
5057960	5064040	what they were trying to do without Skid, they had already had, um, Wonder Boy also.
5064760	5070360	Um, but they couldn't do it with those types of platformers. They didn't actually get any
5070360	5075240	good competition until Sonic was created, but the game was received very well. Um,
5076040	5085960	they loved it in France. What don't they love in France? Americans. Oh yeah. Um, IGN, um,
5085960	5090120	for a 2008 retro review gave the game a nine out of 10 that won an editor's choice award.
5091000	5097880	Well. And there's a French band, like I said, it's loved in France. The French punk band called
5097880	5104680	Chunk No Captain Chunk have a song named after the game on their album Something for Nothing.
5106120	5110920	The game used to only be available in cartridges. There was a slightly different version in 1990
5110920	5117080	that came out, um, for the Master System 2, but like I was saying, it was also built into the,
5117080	5123080	uh, Master System 2. And, um, the game also was re-released along with Super Hang-On and Revenge
5123080	5128840	of Shinobi as part of a Sega vintage collection, Alex Kidd and Company, which came with Xbox Live
5128840	5134760	Arcade and PSN. Um, there was the sequel, there was Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle,
5134760	5140440	which is the fifth one, but it was considered the actual sequel to Miracle World. And that one came
5140440	5148520	out for this, uh, Sega Mega Drive, which was the Genesis over here. So it's, uh, that's it.
5148520	5153560	Alex Kidd and Miracle World. It's a damn good game. Why aren't you playing it?
5154360	5157960	I'd go, go, go do it. You can get it on virtual console, right? You said?
5158600	5164280	Um, PSN. And yeah, I think it's, I think it might be on virtual console. I don't know.
5165560	5170680	All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Miracle World. And you
5170680	5174360	could rock, paper, scissors. I still like Shinobi World better, but that was me.
5174360	5179320	That's all right. It's well, you know, cause it, it has, because it's kind of the marriage of the
5179320	5184520	Shinobi World as well. And it's a little, little more. That was actually the first Alex Kidd game
5184520	5188760	that I played with Shinobi World. There you go. Yep. All right. Well that is going to do it for
5188760	5192200	this part a of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys. Cause we have plenty more of the
5192200	5196760	show to come, including the FUGL question of the week. Uh, your emails, the FUs of the week and

5225800	5232440	April the 20th of 2014. So happy Easter to you or happy 420 or happy Sunday, whatever it is you're
5232440	5237800	celebrating today. Uh, welcome back. Flaco Jones joining us in studio being our extra special
5237800	5243160	guest. Uh, Loki not here tonight. Uh, he is off celebrating Easter with the fam. Dark soccer is
5243160	5248360	here in studio celebrating her birthday and uh, she got some presents earlier in the show and
5248360	5253240	then gave us presents. Those yummy scones is very delicious. Um, also joining us here at the top of
5253240	5259480	part B cause we said he'd be back here. Uh, Alan is here. Hello. How are you Alan? I'm good. How
5259480	5265160	are you? Yeah, I'm good. So Alan, thank you for building me a new computer. You're welcome. I was
5265160	5271160	due. What do you mean you were due? I usually try to upgrade my own PC every like three to five
5271160	5275480	years and I usually build them to where I can last the whole five years, but I haven't been able to
5275480	5280040	afford one. My machine that I built is still running from summer of 08. So I'm running a six
5280040	5287400	year old system. Go straight to gamer jail. Um, but uh, when you, for the longest time when we
5287400	5291400	started dating, I was like, you have a pre-made gateway, I'm going to build you a PC. And it
5291400	5295080	finally happened. Did you judge me a little bit for that? No, you didn't know any better.
5295080	5299080	Yeah, I do. I do. But yeah, no, you made it, you made it your, your mission to build me one. And
5299080	5303320	they actually said at the store we went to to buy all the parts, which it was fries, whatever.
5304040	5307000	I usually don't like naming places cause they don't pay us to mention, but whatever,
5307000	5311240	went to fries. And they were like, uh, you know, you bought all this stuff and we'll assemble it
5311240	5315000	for free. Do you want to do our assembly? I didn't, I didn't know that they even did that,
5315000	5318680	let alone for free. But I was like, I can handle it. And I did. It was fine. Yeah.
5318680	5320680	Well, except for that part you broke. That's all right.
5322680	5327400	I mean, it's the thing that was wrong out of the box. No, the chip you tried to put in your
5327400	5334920	computer today. Yeah. That I, that was my fault, but I was trying to cannibalize your PC that was
5334920	5339320	now you've replaced it. So I was like, Ooh, you've got a quad core. I want to take that. But I
5339320	5345400	somehow bent a couple of the CPU pins, which is, which is bad. But I, I got to take some Ram.
5346360	5350120	I took some of your Ram. Are you noticing any difference at all? Not really. I'm defragging it.
5350120	5354200	So there you go. Yeah. All right. So the nerds want to know what, what's, what's the specs.
5354200	5362680	What do we do? Uh, how do we build the new PC? So if to start to stop any like fan wars before
5362680	5367880	they start, I have certain allegiances to products that are just based off of my own experiences.
5367880	5371720	If I had one bad experience with one brand and then good experiences with another,
5371720	5377480	I'm just going to lean towards that. So I went with AMD just because I feel the performance that
5377480	5382760	you get in the longevity you get for the price is better than Intel. You're paying for a premium
5382760	5386600	with Intel. I know, but kind of like buying a Sony TV, why would you want to spend the extra
5386600	5391320	two grand on a Sony TV when you can get a Samsung? That's kind of my attitude about it. Um, it's an
5391320	5399960	AMD 8,358 core. It's got eight cores and the clock speed is 4.0 gigahertz, uh, 16 gigs of Ram,
5401160	5407560	uh, Corsair Ram. I'm not sure of the speed. And it was, it wasn't the most super ultra
5407560	5412840	fastest Ram cause it was just too expensive for 16 gigs. So it was kind of in the medium range.
5412840	5420680	And then for the video card, it's a EVGA is the ones who made the card and the chip set
5420680	5430680	is a, uh, Nvidia GTX, uh, 760 with two gigs on it. And it purrs. It's very quiet and I'm jealous
5430680	5434760	of it already. Oh, it's such a quiet, but I had, I had, I had a fun time. I had a great time building
5434760	5439160	it. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear it. I had a great time playing games on it last night. Yeah. Every
5439160	5444440	it's like three is so smooth and a solid state hard drive for instantaneous windows and game
5444440	5446920	loading. And that was based on Facebook recommendations. You didn't have that in the
5447000	5454600	Yeah. Well just for regular disc trade, like a SATA hard drives, you can get like a terabyte
5454600	5464040	hard drive internal for like 110 bucks. Like just the cost of space is dirt cheap. And I'm like,
5464040	5469560	if you've got a steam library, like we do with like 400 gigs worth of games that you can install,
5470120	5476040	why not get like a giant fat plate disc hard drive? But everyone's like, no, you got to go
5476040	5480200	solid state. So it's like, all right, you're the one buying it. So I'll get, I'll get you the
5480200	5485400	prettiest thing. Um, go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tiger Claw asks about
5485400	5490840	the PC case. Does it have a side panel window? It does. Um, which, which is really good because
5490840	5494600	when you hook it up and you're ready to turn it on, you hit the little switch, not the main PC
5494600	5499000	switch, but you hit the little switch on the power supply to get that power. Um, there's a little
5499000	5503560	green led on the motherboard that lights up. It says everything's good. You're, you can try
5503560	5509400	turning me on. So the, the, um, the little glass panel on the side of the case lets you see the
5509400	5513880	motherboard. And I think there's like a red light or like it'll blink. It'll blink. If like, it's
5513880	5518760	like, don't turn me on. Like you screwed something up. A lot of those things are kind of foolproof.
5518760	5521720	Now. That's great. Like I'm sure there are nightmare stories where you hook something
5521720	5525800	up wrong and turn it on and then you smell ozone and you just blew out the stuff you just bought.
5525800	5530120	But there's a lot of fail safes in that stuff now. Um, now earlier in the show, when I was talking
5530120	5533960	about the computer being built and everything, we had a chatter that said, why not just get a PC out
5533960	5539640	of box or that's, that's really nerdy building your own PC. So why, why build your own PC Alan?
5539640	5542520	Why, why did we take that route? It's kind of like, I don't know,
5544680	5549400	dudes that are into, or, or, or women or whoever, uh, who are into cars that like just buying,
5549960	5554920	restoring cars and they're all, their hands are all cut up and they've got calluses cause they like
5554920	5559800	going in and going, here's this thing I made. That's, I can look at that computer and go,
5559800	5566280	I built that. Um, also being kind of pretentious you, if you build your own,
5566280	5572200	you can get exactly what you want. Um, the only way you can really do that as a gamer is to go to
5572200	5577880	Alienware or what's that one company that they always podcasts have an affiliate program with
5577880	5582520	them. They're in Seattle. Oh, uh, no, we won't mention because they don't sponsor this show.
5583160	5589800	Well, you can, it's a cat apartment systems. Okay. All right. Um, Oh, okay. That's right.
5589800	5595080	I just remembered. Um, you can go that route, but then you're paying a huge premium for all
5595080	5603400	the souped up water cooling, dry ice, bubble led blinky shit like jet engine, weird custom
5603400	5609160	loose site stripper heel case. Well that case has these two holes in it. And I was like,
5609960	5613400	is that so you can fuck your computer? No, they're like, they're like little rubber
5613400	5617400	buttholes that you can stick your finger in. No, it's for, it's for water cooling. If you
5617400	5622600	want to run tubes, if you want to run tubes through like a chassis that will cool your
5622600	5628440	graphics card and your CPU. So, um, you know, the case, um, for anyone that wants to Google image,
5628440	5631400	search it, it's an ant tech and I love ant tech. That's one of those things where,
5631400	5635160	why did you go AMD or why did you go into video? I just, I've had good experiences. So I'm,
5635240	5640120	I'm loyal to those products. Well, and I know my current case is an ant tech 900 and I got you
5640120	5645480	or picked out for you an ant tech 302. Uh, code man in our chat says I had a bad AMD
5645480	5649800	processor once and it turned me off, but I love AMD video cards. That's actually where I'm at.
5649800	5655960	I love the AMD video cards, but since, you know, I was, I was letting Alan be the boy playing with
5655960	5662840	Legos and yes. Yeah. All right. You just, you do what you think is best and all. I had a nightmare.
5662840	5669880	The computer that I had before this one, um, the catalyst software that ATI might be better now,
5670600	5674280	but there was something about that catalyst software and the other hardware that I have,
5674280	5679480	it was, I hated it. It blue screened all the time and I just, I did not like that. But Nvidia
5680280	5684760	was always generally fine for me. So, okay. Um, gosh, I'm trying to think of what else to
5684760	5688040	ask you with that. So are you, are you already thinking about what you want to do for your new
5688040	5692680	computer now? I could upgrade. I mean, I can't get something as souped up as what you have,
5692680	5697240	but I could like, I'm still on a dual core. I could just get a new motherboard and a CPU,
5697240	5700360	even just keep the Ram that I have, even though it's like five year old Ram,
5700360	5704120	I could probably do that for like 300 bucks or less. And she's, she's thinking they might have
5704120	5707560	an extra quad core processor. I bet if we batted our eyelashes and asked very nicely,
5707560	5711320	it's probably people out there that are getting like, I just got rid of mine. So my stuff is so
5711320	5716520	old that I can't really even like the chip that I have is the highest chip that my motherboard
5716520	5719560	will take. So I have to replace the motherboard too. All right. Well, if somebody wants to donate
5719560	5725160	to your new computer fund, where can they find you on the internet? Uh, salacious pop on Twitter.
5725160	5730440	It's salacious underscore pop on Twitter. And then I'm Alan alchemy on tumblr. There you go.
5730440	5737320	And, uh, I fixed your DVD Ram drive. Usually there's one minor thing where I'll build the
5737320	5741160	computer and turn it on. And like the little activity light that blinks when like you're
5741160	5745160	reading to the hard drive that won't be hooked up. The thing that I forgot to do is your,
5745160	5750920	your DVD Ram rider drive. I didn't hook it up to the power supply. So when I turned it on,
5750920	5757080	I hit the little eject disc tray thing and I'm like, Oh, oh, DVD, DVD. Ram's not working. What
5757080	5762200	I do. I just, I just hooked it up to power. Now it works now not to be reading Facebook
5762200	5767240	messages, uh, publicly, but I have to ask you about this one because I noticed our buddy Brad
5767240	5773160	from pod culture commented on your post about how you accidentally botched the pins on the four core
5773160	5778760	Intel. And he suggests the old trick of using the barrel of a retractable ballpoint pin.
5778760	5783560	I did not know about that trick and I may still try that. The thing is, is that I didn't realize
5783560	5788760	that some of the pins were bent when I was trying to originally see it back onto the board. And by
5788760	5794680	trying to see it, I made them worse. So the pins that the pins that are bent are pretty badly bent.
5794680	5798920	They're not really kind of just leaning. One of them is pushed all the way down like flat.
5799720	5804360	So that's pretty bad. That's bad. Yeah. All right. Well, anything else you want to share
5804360	5809880	with listeners tonight? Um, I'm sorry that I don't guest on the show more, but as Rob knows,
5809880	5815720	Sundays are usually my Mondays at work. Um, so I'm at work and then when it's a holiday or work
5815720	5822360	is slow and I'm home, the show's great, but it's like, it's a free day off. I'm like,
5822360	5826520	I don't usually work on Sunday, so I'll do housework or I'll just play 14 or video games
5826520	5830360	or Diablo three. And then I'll listen. Like earlier when I was doing laundry,
5830360	5836920	I was listening to the show that's happening in the house on my cell phone on a 10 second delay.
5836920	5842600	So I would hear Flucco Jones laugh in person and then I would go down the hallway. Then I
5842600	5847640	get the laugh again in my head, in my head, in my headphones. It's a very trippy effect
5847640	5850840	to stream a show that takes place. Well, if you hurry, you can hear yourself. Yes.
5852040	5855240	Uh, quickly though, what other, what other games have you been playing lately? What have you been
5855240	5860920	into? It's a 14 and doing this stupid, it's more a conversation for a whorehouse, but the bullshit
5860920	5866200	with the new kind of like your legendary weapon that they have in, wow, the relic stuff. It's
5866200	5871240	really to chain you to a subscription because it takes so long to do. And so much of it's based off
5871240	5876440	random numbers that I'm just, I'm hooked on trying to get that done. Uh, one more tip from Brad from
5876440	5880920	pod culture in our chat room at life.vognetwork.com. Brad says really slowly bend it back with a pen
5880920	5885480	and it should work. So yeah, good luck. I mean, Hey, if that works, that'd be awesome for you.
5885480	5889880	Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. Uh, gosh, I can't think of anything that I already know. I've been playing
5889880	5895240	14 Diablo three, which Skyrim. Oh, I talked earlier about Jurassic park. You've been watching
5895240	5898600	me play that. What do you think of that? It looks fine. It looks like just one. It looks like a
5898600	5905560	telltale adventure game. I did. There's there's the, the, the, I don't know if it switches
5905560	5910280	characters in the, in the later episodes, but you're a professor, a veterinarian and his daughter.
5910840	5915640	And she was asking him a question and I kind of chimed him, daddy, why do we look drunk?
5915640	5920840	Because they kind of have this glassy eye, like the art direction's kind of weird.
5920840	5926840	Like they just look, I swear to God, he should be doing live streaming. He is so
5926840	5931800	funny. So why do you think I like him? So sometimes watching, watching the characters
5931800	5936120	kind of talk, I'm like, there's, something's wrong with them, but that has nothing to do
5936120	5940840	with the game. That's just kind of like how the people look, but it looks, it looks fine.
5940840	5944440	Well, and then my favorite, well, I don't want to give a spoiler, but it's just, you know,
5944440	5948840	the two characters that, Oh, they know each other. What a surprise because yeah, well,
5948840	5953480	they both have bandanas. They're both, they're both the two people that aren't white.
5956120	5960360	They both, they both have tattoos and it's like, and then she's like you and I'm like,
5960840	5966600	of course they knew each other. Like it's, it's, yeah, it's bad. And then I loved screaming,
5966600	5970680	like you were trying to, you were trying to solve a puzzle involving turning on the electricity.
5970680	5973160	So when she opens up the electrical cabinet, I'm like, and dinosaurs,
5974120	5978040	dinosaurs right now, lost her after right now. And he just kept waiting for dinosaurs to jump
5978040	5982360	out for no reason. Like she, you know, she, she turns over like a dinosaur.
5982360	5984200	As soon as they got the power on, what happened?
5984200	5989640	A dinosaur showed up. But I want dinosaurs, like a full T-Rex to come out of like a can of soup,
5989640	5996200	just like dinosaurs, like, like snakes in a can. But yeah, it looked fine. I don't really
5996200	6001480	understand why. It's got some, a few tech hiccups though.
6001480	6008600	Yeah. When the, when the game kind of froze, but three or four sentences of conversation audio
6008600	6013960	were still happening. And then the subtitles and the video kind of caught up with the conversation.
6013960	6018600	I was like, was that lag? Like what just happened? So yeah, there's a lot of weird tech stuff.
6020040	6024200	All right. Well, Alan, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news and emails
6024200	6025800	and all that good stuff. But thanks for dropping by.
6025800	6028600	Did you see in chat when I said there were two OLR birthdays this week?
6029160	6032920	No, tell us about the other one. I did see it, but it, our conversation had moved on.
6032920	6036040	It was a whole delay thing, right? So tell, tell listeners about the other birthday.
6036040	6042360	Our kitty Sanrio is 14. She's very old and she's still in great health. She's just,
6042360	6046520	she's old so she sleeps a lot, but she'll be around for a few more years.
6046520	6051400	That's great. Well, we'll give her extra, but we don't really celebrate cat birthdays sadly.
6051400	6055080	I would like make her some actual fish, like tuna or salmon and cook it up,
6055080	6057720	make kind of warm and give it to her. But I don't want her to have,
6057720	6061400	I'll have to deal with that in the litter box later. So she doesn't really get
6061960	6068360	a birthday feast. Her, uh, her system is too fragile for that. So she gets kibble forever.
6068360	6072120	There you go. Well, she gets extra pettings. Yes. Today. All right. Well,
6072120	6075080	Alan, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to, if you hear Flaco Jones laughing later and
6075080	6079080	you want to respond to it, feel free to just jump in here. Okay. All right. You're always welcome.
6079080	6086360	All right. Like the laughing gas left up track on big bang theory or something. I can't stop
6086360	6091000	laughing. O L R was taped in front of a live studio audience of just Flaco Jones.
6092920	6098040	All right. Uh, Oh, hack deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Sanrio.
6099880	6103560	I'm not sure how to stop with the old jokes chat. I know, right? Y'all are mean.
6104200	6107880	All right. Let's go to some rapid fire news. You guys, we're going to talk about a few things
6107880	6113240	happening in the industry quickly. Uh, starting off with, um, I gotta be honest, guys. This is
6113240	6116520	what happens when you have a week where there's not a lot of news. You get a lot of, you get a
6116520	6122440	lot of stories, you get a lot of rumors and talkings going on. And there's an interesting
6122440	6127320	story out there about apparently Sony originally wanted Titanfall on the PlayStation Vita.
6127880	6131560	Titanfall, of course, the big game that came out on Xbox one last month,
6131560	6136760	yet PlayStation four still managed to sell more consoles, but that's probably the price difference
6136760	6141240	and nothing else coming into play there. I don't know, but anyhow, Titanfall was the big app that
6141240	6145800	was, uh, going to move some Xbox ones last month. And it probably did, but it could have maybe moved
6145800	6152360	some Vitas, uh, apparently respawned and reached out to Sony before the exclusive is exclusivity
6152360	6158920	agreement, exclusive agreement, God damn with Microsoft, uh, to talk about, uh, all, all that
6158920	6165880	and putting Titanfall on the Vita. Um, this all came from the final hours app, which is, uh, was
6165880	6169960	released for Titanfall. There's been a few of these apps for games like tomb Raider and I think
6169960	6175080	portal two might've had one and some of those games. So, uh, that all came out of that. However,
6175080	6181640	respawn did after the story first broke, they did clarify that Sony wanted it to do what was called
6181640	6189080	an R one project on the Vita, not the finalized Titanfall games. In other words, it was way before
6189080	6194520	the game became what it was is when Sony wanted it, but I still kind of go, well, that's still,
6194520	6199960	you know, that's still pretty big because, you know, respawn the whole way that, you know,
6199960	6204600	kind of started and what the kinds of games they've made and so forth and in their history and
6204600	6208920	so forth, you, whoever was going to get the exclusive from them was going to be a big deal.
6208920	6214040	So it's, it's really not a surprise at all that Sony pitched it. I think the, the interesting
6214040	6217800	thing to think about is what if that game had been on the Vita? It's kind of interesting,
6217800	6221480	but I think response coming out and saying, if it had been the Vita probably would have gone
6221480	6227160	a completely different direction. So it makes sense to me. So anyhow, there is that talk going
6227160	6232520	on on the internet this week. Um, speaking of team-ups that didn't happen, Activision,
6232520	6237640	and this isn't, this is something Activision said themselves. Activision said that initially
6237640	6244840	they wanted to team up with Skylanders with Nintendo. Uh, Nintendo turned it down.
6245800	6250680	Now, even though Skylanders, uh, is on Nintendo devices, as you know, Skylanders is pretty big
6250680	6257160	and it's on all the different game consoles. Uh, here's a quote here from, um, let's see,
6257160	6264360	uh, who said this? I don't know who said this comment here because the, the source article
6264360	6269320	I'm reading never says who, who did this, but, uh, some executives at Activision said, quote,
6269320	6273000	we have been directed towards thinking about something that would play well with Nintendo.
6273000	6276840	I think there was some co-marketing money and the Wii was doing well. They had some success
6276840	6280200	with peripherals. They spent a long time looking and looking. They were just like,
6280200	6283800	we've never seen anything like this before. I've always wondered about the full meaning of that
6283800	6289400	comment. We have no idea why they didn't commit. Clearly they have got properties well suited to
6289400	6293560	this world. Why is it that they didn't rush in here will probably haunt them for the rest of
6293560	6299320	their days. So, um, that's interesting that Nintendo could have had that, but they didn't
6299320	6304680	want that. Um, but it's not that, I mean, again, Skylanders made the Nintendo platforms at the end
6304680	6309560	of the day, but Nintendo would have been more deeply involved probably with the creation and,
6309560	6313480	and considering some of the strong characters that Nintendo builds that could have made for
6313480	6323000	a very interesting partnership. So, Hmm. Um, also, uh, in kind of what the heck type of news going
6323000	6329240	on, uh, bungee, which, uh, made the halo series in the past and is now making destiny, which a
6329240	6335240	lot of people are looking forward to, including myself, uh, let go their big composer this week,
6335240	6339560	Marty O'Donnell or Martin O'Donnell, excuse me, who, uh, actually crafted some of the,
6339560	6344760	the Epic soundtrack for the halo games and was working on the destiny games was terminated by
6344760	6350680	bungee this week, which is, uh, very interesting. Uh, bungee did talk to the media at a destiny
6350680	6356120	preview quote, we don't make decisions lightly and the music from O'Donnell will remain in the
6356120	6362120	upcoming game, but there's nothing else after that. So, uh, very interesting circumstances.
6362120	6367800	The tweet from, uh, him says I'm saddened to say that bungee's board of directors terminated me
6367800	6375560	without cause on April 11th, 2014. Wow. So you got to wonder, I mean, I don't know, like, I don't
6375560	6379800	want to be all up in the business. I mean, who knew maybe the guy showed up late for work every
6379800	6384120	day or something. I don't know. I just, there could be a million, a million, billion reasons,
6384120	6389800	but it's going to be weird because this music is so, so, so good, uh, that it's not in the,
6389800	6395880	um, next game after destiny two or whatever inevitable things comes after that dark saga.
6395880	6399320	He could have just been a big diva, you know, you never, it could, I mean, there's,
6400040	6404040	we don't really, you know, companies aren't going to exactly talk about personnel issues forthright.
6404040	6407400	So we're left to rely on Twitter and reading between the lines and all that.
6408040	6413160	Well, in some other quick news, um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be available via
6413160	6420120	steam early access. Um, so you can basically play it as it's in progress and it's supposed to be a
6420120	6425160	pretty neat game. I mean, there were strange adventures in infinite space in 2002 and then
6425880	6432200	weird worlds returned to infinite space 2005. Um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be,
6432920	6440200	$9.95 and like I said, early access. And then, um, there was a little bit of talk about, uh,
6440200	6447400	the last of us, the PS4 edition about if it was going to be, um, discounted as well. And, um,
6449400	6454280	uh, uh, dude from Naughty Dog, Eric Mona, Monticelli, is that how I pronounce his name?
6454840	6461720	Um, said, uh, that they're looking into the business model for the, uh, different versions
6461720	6468920	of the game. Um, at least as far as discounting the PS3 one as well. Um, and they were looking
6468920	6473080	for owners of the, basically the big question was regarding the owners of the PS3 version
6473080	6479480	who also got the PS4 version, but they haven't given anything really committed to it.
6480040	6487720	And then, um, last but not least in Outrun, uh, 3D Outrun is going to have two new songs in it,
6487720	6493320	like brand new songs. One is, um, it's coming out April 23rd in Japan. It's Cruising Line
6493880	6502280	by, uh, Manabu Namiki and Camino Amiamor from, uh, Jane Evelyn Nisperos. And there's going to be a
6502920	6509320	new car, three different simulated cabinets, four screen modes, remappable controls,
6509320	6514840	replay saving with multi-spleet payback, uh, mid-race saving, customizable volume for game
6514840	6522360	audio, engine noise, and ambient arcade machine noise. So, yay. That's it.
6524840	6530120	Are you going to be picking that up? Huh? Are you going to be picking that up? Outrun on 3DS maybe?
6530360	6537000	Well, I'm sure Dan will probably. He's the one with the XLs and he's the bigger Outrun fan.
6538280	6543080	Gotcha. All right. Well, now is the point where we're going to, uh, turn to our listeners for
6543080	6547480	feedback on a particular question we ask in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.
6555320	6559880	Every week we ask a question of our fan communities over on Facebook and on Google Plus.
6560360	6565480	And, uh, we read some of our favorite answers here on the air. Uh, tonight was a bit of a tricky
6565480	6569400	question, but it has to do with the whole Prince of Persia thing we talked about earlier. And the
6569400	6575240	question we asked was, what classic video game franchise would you like to see done in the style
6575240	6580040	of a newer video game? So that's the question we asked because, you know, Prince of Persia being
6580040	6585720	redone like Rayman Legends. So, okay. Let's, rumor anyway. Let's see what you guys think would be a
6585720	6589480	classic video game redone, like a newer video game. We'll start with Google Plus tonight and
6589480	6594760	some of the answers over there. I love this answer for entertainment. Leisure suit Larry
6595400	6602040	done in the style of Farmville. You can help, you can help your friends to farm the necessary
6602040	6607320	materials to put together the necessary quest items in order to hopefully nail that saucy Latina
6607320	6612200	down the hall. Or you could actually talk to that equally saucy Latina in the cubicle next to you,
6612200	6617160	who has the added quality of being real. I don't know where he was going with that,
6617160	6622200	but I like the opportunity of combining Leisure Suit Larry with Farmville. It's great.
6623160	6629960	Panaxium replies. It says Kid Icarus done in the new Strider style. The new Strider game was
6629960	6635720	pretty hot. Kid Icarus, don't think that would be cool. Or Mega Man X done like the Mass Effect
6635720	6641720	trilogy. I don't know about that one. Who would be interesting? Who would Mega Man romance in that?
6641720	6647240	I don't know. That would be very, very interesting. All right. Act Deft replied on
6647240	6651960	Google Plus and said this reminds me of the 3D classics Nintendo and Sega made for the 3DS.
6651960	6655800	I would like to see more games done in that style. Well, you got Outrun to look forward to. There
6655800	6662600	you go. And Travis H says Symphony of the Night done in the style of Shadow Complex or Super
6662600	6668200	Ghosts and Goblins done in the style of Rayman Legends. Oh, Ghosts and Goblins. That's a, that's
6668200	6673160	a series that's been gone way too long that would be cool to see come back in a new modern platform
6673160	6678360	style. That's pretty cool. I like that. Let's go over to Facebook and see some of the answers
6678360	6683480	over there on facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Just a few comments on Facebook tonight,
6683480	6688360	so I'll go ahead and read them all here. Fifth Dream says I used to love an old game called
6688360	6694440	Gain Ground. I imagine it would be really cool if they revamped it to be a lot like Diablo 3.
6695160	6699320	You know that's happening with Gauntlet. Gauntlet is being redone and it's going to look like,
6699320	6702280	we talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show, it's going to look like Diablo. I'm very
6702280	6709320	interested. Awesome Unicorn says every game series ever with good music done in the style
6709320	6715480	of Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Donkey Kong Country, Castlevania, Saga, Mana, Kingdom Hearts. The
6715480	6719800	possibilities are endless. Okay, that's not what you really asked, but I still want it. You know
6719800	6723400	what? I'll accept that answer, especially because some of those games you mentioned were other
6723400	6728360	square franchises. I was kind of surprised it wasn't DLC in the first Theatrhythm,
6728360	6737000	maybe in this Theatrhythm game, who knows. AZHP, I love this answer, says Final Fantasy
6737000	6743800	done in the style of Bravely Default. Okay, do you guys get why that's funny? Because Bravely
6743800	6749080	Default is a throwback to the old Final Fantasy games, whereas Final Fantasy 13 and so forth
6749080	6754040	haven't really been like the old Final Fantasy. That's the joke. Forget it. All right,
6755480	6760760	Ospher says I'm going to do a reversal on this and say a newer game done in the style of an
6760760	6766280	older one. Who said you could change the rules? Who do you think you are? All right, fine. I'll
6766280	6772440	take it. Ace Combat, yes, the flight simulator, done in the style of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.
6772440	6781160	Okay, if you're going to flip the script, do an answer that makes more sense. I don't get that
6781160	6788520	one. I guess because it's fast. He says because it would be hilarious yet beautiful. Fabrice A
6788520	6795000	replies on Facebook and says the first Sega Rally Championship with upgraded Outrun 2 graphics.
6795880	6803800	It might be good. Good times. Burr replies and says mech warrior done in the style of Titanfall.
6803800	6808040	By that I mean more urban warfare with lots of ground units and elementals.
6808760	6813400	Lots of mechs or mechs are coming back in with Titanfall. I mean, not that mechs ever left,
6813400	6819000	but definitely Titanfall. Like everybody loves the mechs in that game. All right, there you go.
6819000	6824200	Those are the answers from Facebook and Google Plus and we look forward to seeing more answers
6824200	6830200	throughout the week. And you should add us on our communities so you can answer questions in future
6830200	6836280	weeks. There you go. Some folks in chat trying to figure out how the hell is Sonic 3 going to work
6836280	6841240	with a plane. And Orange Right says Sonic 3 with a plane. ACT-DEV says Sonic 3 already has a plane
6841240	6844920	though. That's right, like in the very beginning of the game, right? And Darted Studio just says,
6844920	6850360	I don't even know how that would work. I'm going to ask for to email us and tell us a little more
6850360	6856920	about his plans here. It is 4.20 after all. So you are going to hear some really weird ideas today
6856920	6862280	for no particular reason. Just saying it's, you know, just it's all the peeps people are eating
6862280	6869080	today. Everyone's high on peeps. Okay, fine. Everybody's chocolate peanut butter eggs.
6870120	6875320	I haven't eaten any of those yet. Tomorrow's the big day. I bought a bag of peanut butter M&M eggs
6875320	6880600	and they are delicious. Why did you not share? I should have brought those over. I brought beer.
6881720	6885800	I'll take a beer. Go for it. I got a couple left still. I'm not drinking anymore because
6885800	6890920	they're a little strong. Free beer. Jamie has to drive home, so no beer for me. Awesome. Okay.
6893480	6898360	What was I going to say? I was going to ask you guys if you had a, I know it's a tricky question.
6898360	6904360	I don't know if you guys thought about it before the show, but a old video game done in the style
6904360	6909880	of a new video game. Anything you have to think of? An old video game done in the style of a new
6909880	6915720	video game. Well, I'm in honor of my Silent Hill shirt. It's not really like that old,
6915720	6919800	but, and I said this when I first played through Heavy Rain with my friends. I was like,
6919800	6924520	why don't they do Silent Hill like this? It's so cinematic. You know, I know it's not Silent
6924520	6930600	Hill, but the series really hasn't gone very far recently. So it's not like, just say the old,
6930600	6935960	the good Silent Hill games done in the style because then maybe, you know, and I love the old
6935960	6939240	good Silent Hill games, but maybe what I'm thinking is more as a revival, do it in that
6939240	6944360	Heavy Rain. What's the other game that came out this year? Beyond Two Souls style of, you know,
6944360	6949480	choose your own adventure. Very cinematic, very scripted, but there's multiple branching paths
6949480	6954600	and it can turn out a really good story. I love those games. So maybe since Silent Hill's kind of
6954600	6958600	falling off and it's hard to recapture the magic, doing the same thing over and over again, maybe
6958600	6962440	do something like that. And I don't know, that's just something that I thought of. Not really the
6962440	6968600	exact question, but. The first Mass Effect remade with Mass Effect 3's game play. I'm not serious
6968600	6972120	about that. No, yeah, yeah. It would, it would help. That's like the one thing I don't like
6972120	6976280	about the first Mass Effect is that I like playing like the way the third one plays better than the
6976280	6980200	first one. I think a lot of games could benefit from that. I know I hated the first Uncharted
6980200	6983480	game. I liked the other two, but the first Uncharted game is such a slog to play through.
6983480	6987480	It's like, I wish it was more like this, more like this. And they really, you can tell when
6987480	6990840	a game improves on something and it's like, but then sometimes you wish they could go back and
6990840	6998120	fix the original. Gosh, I'm having a hard time thinking of a good answer for this. I thought I
6998120	7005240	had something before the show went live tonight, but maybe I kind of want to say, I don't know,
7005240	7011160	my mind goes towards, I really want to see a Gradius revival done. And I think I'd like to see
7011160	7015960	it in the style of like, like a, like a twin, like a modern twin stick shooter, maybe something like
7015960	7020120	Resogun, like really pretty like that. But like, I think I just really want a new Gradius game,
7020120	7031640	honestly, is what I want. So otherwise, maybe a rad racer game, cheesy 3D and all done in the
7031640	7040840	style of Burnout. How about that? It'd be fun. All right. Let's go back into some other news.
7040840	7044440	Huh? Actually something just occurred to me. Yeah, go for it. We were watching some
7044440	7050040	Inside Sim Racing, which is a video cast that Dan likes to watch, was doing a review of,
7050040	7056360	I think the game's called MX2. It's a, it's a motocross game. But they mentioned something
7056360	7061160	about wanting customizable tracks. I was just thinking, wouldn't doing Excitebike in the style
7061160	7066920	of MX2 be cool? Cause that actually was a really neat looking game. Just saying. Bobby Blackwolf
7066920	7071240	in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Rock Band in the style of Flappy Vog.
7071240	7081320	All right. Let's get back into some news. Let's see. I mentioned earlier in the show that there
7081320	7086360	was some interesting things going on with Square Enix and Sony and that whole thing. So news broke
7086360	7091560	earlier this week that Sony announced they're going to be selling off their stake in video
7091560	7097080	game company Square Enix. You may not have known this, but Sony was actually an investor in Square
7097080	7102600	Enix since the early two thousands, you know, around the time they got Final Fantasy 7 to come
7102600	7105880	out on the, actually it would have been more around nine probably was coming out around that
7105880	7113000	time. But yeah, Sony was once an investor in Square Enix. They owned 8.2% of the company.
7113720	7121720	So they sold off 9.5 million shares valued at $156 million, leaving a $47 million profit. However,
7121720	7129320	we won't really know what this boils down to until the end of May. Now don't think that this
7129320	7133000	is because Sony's like mad at Square Enix or something like that. Like it's not necessarily
7133000	7139720	that. This definitely seems to be a, you know, basically financial. It's business, not personal.
7139720	7144040	Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Really. They're saying that basically Sony's been streamlining
7144040	7150040	their operations. For example, Sony got rid of the VAIO computers. They laid off employees.
7150040	7155160	They restructured the TV business. They shut down some of their buildings, including the
7155160	7159560	old headquarters in Tokyo. So, and the New York City tower, as well as the Sony,
7160280	7164120	even though the PlayStation is doing very well for Sony, they're really struggling in some other
7164120	7171640	areas. So this is kind of part of how they balance the books basically. So that's what's going on.
7172680	7179320	Now, no clue what this means for Square Enix. But hopefully they'll be able to, you know,
7179320	7183320	kind of, you know, since this is a traded company, those shares will get picked up
7183320	7191640	somewhere else. We'll see. So, an interesting, interesting move. You know, Sony and Square
7191640	7195720	Enix back around that same time would have been partners in that whole play online thing. So they
7195720	7200760	were kind of, you know, they were close buddies for a long time, but now who knows what this will
7200760	7208360	cause for the future. Dar Sakura, what do you got for us? I have some stuff. Basically, given that
7208360	7213240	we were talking about Silent Hill earlier, this is pretty good to mention, is that Silent Hill
7213240	7219960	Origins and Shattered Memories are both going to the Vita. And that's soon, according to Konami.
7219960	7228840	But they will be £7.99. No, I don't really see what the word is for how it would be in US and
7228840	7242440	Japan. So, also, I accidentally closed the thing trying to make it visible. I don't think it was
7242440	7246760	just Silent Hill Origins. I want to say Shattered Memories. I did say Shattered Memories. Oh, sorry.
7247480	7253320	Rob, that's what you get for nothing. See, now we can make this the Pooh and Rob. He had to open
7253320	7258360	his beer. Yeah, I know, right? There really wasn't a whole lot else just talking about the history
7258360	7263480	of those games. Silent Hill Origins was a PSP game from 2007, and Silent Hill Shattered Memories
7263480	7269480	was PSP, PS2, and Wii, which was a little different. I played that game on the Wii.
7270840	7274520	The problem I had with that game was, and I don't know if you can do this, but the nunchuck is
7274520	7278680	corded, right? I don't know if they have wireless nunchucks, but there's an element of that game
7278680	7283720	where if a monster... Well, the move is wireless nunchucks. No, I'm just talking about the actual
7283720	7289000	Wii. The only ones I ever used were wired nunchucks, so there's a part where the enemies
7289000	7293080	have to grab onto you, and you have to shake the controller, and I kept whipping myself in the face
7293080	7298040	with the cord between the nunchuck and the Wiimote, and I'm just like, ah, get it off of me! You shake
7298040	7301160	it off, and the monsters get on you, and you zap, and you just keep whacking yourself in the face
7301160	7312200	with this stupid cord. That game was... It could have been so much better. I don't know. The worst
7312200	7317320	part about it was when you're exploring the world in that game, nothing bad can happen to you,
7318040	7322920	so it kind of takes away that tear element. It's creepy and everything, and it's got the atmosphere,
7322920	7328280	but the fact that you're completely safe at all times you're exploring is weird. It's like you're
7328280	7333000	used to walking around the corner, and there's a dog or a monster or something that can just start
7333000	7336760	getting you, and you're trapped, and you don't have any weapons or anything, but in this game,
7336760	7340360	it's just like, oh, these are exploring parts. Nothing's going to hurt you, and these are the
7340440	7343560	monster parts. You just run, run, run, run, and if something gets on you, you shake your controller
7343560	7348040	and whip yourself in the face, and that's all it was. Silent Hill for five-year-olds?
7348040	7352280	Yeah, it really wasn't. The thing is that the monster running parts were so hard I had to have
7352280	7358040	my friend Nathan do it. It's like, you do it. I get lost, and if you slow down for a second,
7358040	7364120	you just get overwhelmed. You die and just start over, but there's only a few of those segments
7364120	7367080	really in the game that are... There's three really hard ones. The rest of them are pretty
7367080	7371080	easy, so it's more of an experience than a straight-up game.
7373720	7376840	I don't know how that would translate on the Vita. Like, you shake your Vita around?
7376840	7378040	You shake the Vita?
7378040	7381320	But I never played... Apparently, there's a PS2 version, so I don't know. On that one,
7381320	7383720	I doubt... You can't shake the controller around, obviously,
7383720	7385800	so maybe you just mash a button. I don't know.
7385800	7387160	Jiggle the analog sticks.
7387160	7388360	Yeah, that's probably what it is.
7389560	7393000	Would you be interested at all in checking out either of these games on the Vita?
7393000	7396120	You know, I never played Origins, so I would be interested in playing that one.
7396680	7400280	I do have it on PS2, but I don't feel like hooking it up, so... For eight bucks,
7400280	7405080	and maybe it'll be cheaper someday. Maybe I'll get that one. I always wait out for the PS Plus
7405080	7408760	deals, so there's a chance I could get it really cheap. I would probably get that one.
7409400	7409960	That works.
7410840	7415080	All right, well, moving on to a story about the Xbox One. The Xbox One got a bit of an
7415080	7421640	update this week. They had an update roll out to the Xbox One consoles that include quite a
7421720	7428200	few things, including improved game DVR video quality, Blu-ray player supporting 50
7428200	7434920	HZ video output, where applicable, controller and headset firmware updates to help improve static
7434920	7440760	issues, Connect voice and motion improvements, which some people have been bitching about on
7440760	7446760	the Xbox Ones. That's good. Friends improvements. When favorites and friends sign into Xbox Live,
7446760	7450200	you'll get notifications. I had no idea this wasn't already on the One. It's on all the
7450200	7455720	systems that are out there today. That was interesting. And then game app and saves progress
7455720	7460680	bar updates. So you'll actually get a progress bar that shows you how far along your game is in
7460680	7464200	saving, so you don't think the whole thing's locked up and shut it off prematurely or something
7464200	7470120	like that. So that should be already out there on the Xbox Ones. If not, you should probably
7470120	7474920	connect your system to the internet and let the magic happen so you get all those fancy new
7474920	7480600	updates. All right, we're going to open up our mailbag every week. We invite you guys to
7480600	7486040	participate with our show by emailing us participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7487960	7492520	Dark soccer is going to dive into the email bag and pick out a few emails that she believes are
7492520	7497560	worthy of sharing on tonight's show. Well, we had four emails, which I am actually waiting to
7497560	7504120	load now that for some reason I keep getting disconnected. Your tablet is being very unruly
7504120	7510920	tonight. It is. But there was one that SSG100 Matt sent us that we've actually already covered.
7511480	7520840	And that was about the DDR marathon and Notch's contribution towards it. But it's definitely good
7520840	7526760	that you wanted to let us know about it. We should spread gamers doing good. We should spread the
7526760	7531720	good news with that. So I kind of knew that would come in from some of our listeners that have been
7531720	7536760	with us a very long time when we were music exclusive. Hey, that's one of the downsides
7536760	7543400	about getting into the late 30s. I could never do a marathon like that anymore. I need a marathon
7543400	7550600	where I can be seated and play the games. I can't dance for 16 hours straight. So more props to you.
7550600	7556280	It's just hold on because it keeps logging me out of the email.
7557480	7564920	So I'm very, very irritated right now. That's not good. Well, that's the joys and
7564920	7570120	adventures of doing live radio. Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights.
7570120	7572840	And those of you guys that listen to us through the podcast feed, you should try to join us
7572840	7577400	sometime. I mean, I know Game of Thrones is on and all, but you can pirate it later like everybody
7577400	7582840	else does. That's what Netflix is for. Well, actually Game of Thrones ain't on Netflix.
7582840	7587240	You have to HBO special. They do their own app. But anyway, we've got, we've got mail.
7587240	7592760	Hey guys, this show is awesome. You make a boring data entry. So much more exciting for me here at
7592760	7597960	work. I heard you need more emails. So I'm going for it. I just started playing torchlight too.
7597960	7603080	And it was my very first top down RPG experience. I started co-op with a buddy at the hardest
7603080	7608360	difficulty. I seem to die every five minutes. Any tips? Start on easy and practice.
7608360	7614120	Yeah. Honestly, you answered your own question. Uh, you've got it. You got to tone it down
7614120	7619880	and practice and then work your way up to that. I don't remember with torchlight to either if it's
7619880	7625480	like Diablo, the thing in Diablo, you start on the easiest difficulty, get gear, and then you
7625480	7630040	can amp up the difficulty to get better drops. And then once you get into like torment, which is the
7630040	7633560	hardest difficulty, you get like the best drops in the game. So you do have to work your way up.
7633560	7637560	I can't remember in torchlight. I have played torchlight and I liked torchlight to an awful lot.
7637560	7641240	I can't remember if it was that similar thing where you can take that character and move them
7641240	7645240	through different difficulty levels. I don't recall, but if you can, I would suggest doing
7645240	7650840	that for sure. But, uh, I, I think you actually answered your own question. If you really want to
7650840	7655480	otherwise, like you're all gung ho about, Nope, we're going to do this in the hardest difficulty
7655480	7661720	from the outset, then you gotta be prepared to die a lot. But I would say, know when to go in
7661720	7667320	and retreat. And especially in those types of games, I find that if you get just a little too
7667320	7672840	close, like you're running too fast, you'll pull a whole pack of mobs at once. So I would say,
7672840	7679320	move slowly, take it slowly. I still say, go start easier so that you can learn the mechanics
7679320	7683800	while you have an opportunity to use said mechanics. That would be my first answer as
7683800	7686920	well. But if, if for whatever reason you guys are like, Nope, we're going to do this
7687640	7691560	the hardest way and get our achievements and that's what we're going to do, then that would
7691560	7696200	be my strategy is make sure you're moving slowly. So you don't pull a whole screen of mobs at once.
7696200	7701160	All right. Um, also I really prayed that Titanfall would be the Call of Duty killer,
7701160	7706040	but at least on PC, the active player count has gone way down to the point where a couple
7706040	7710280	playlists are completely empty. I think it's because the game is too difficult for Call of
7710280	7714280	Duty newbies who can't take their shooter skills vertical. What do you guys think?
7715000	7722440	I think I don't like either game, so, um, I'm more interested in Titanfall and Call of Duty for sure.
7722440	7727080	Um, just, you know, I, I liked more of the sci-fi stuff and you know, that's why I was in a Mass
7727080	7732760	Effect and so forth. But, um, I haven't really played it on PC. My assumption is that the player
7732760	7738520	base is probably dwindling because a lot of attention gets diverted in other directions on PC
7738520	7742840	and especially with the cost of the game being a little high, you probably really only have the
7742840	7747320	diehards in there right now. I would imagine as soon as the game gets discounted, which is going
7747320	7751400	to be a little bit because EA doesn't always discount right away, but once the game does
7751400	7754680	get discounted, you'll probably see a lot more people jumping on board with that real quick.
7755800	7760280	Just give it a little time. It's probably a game that's going to build slowly. Um,
7761160	7765800	and I think a lot of people, you know, on the Xbox one, that was the big game for the month.
7765800	7771400	So you're going to have people that kind of last a little longer, the pool of players on there,
7771400	7775080	because there's not a bunch of other stuff on the Xbox one competing for attention right now.
7776200	7780280	Have a wonderful Sunday and keep gaming guys. That's from EA Skizie.
7781160	7782600	Thank you EA Skizie.
7783480	7783960	Next up.
7783960	7787560	Good luck typing. Because they said data entry was their thing.
7789080	7792600	I don't have any ideas, any idea what prompted this discussion topic,
7792600	7797400	but what major video game characters slash enemies come to mind? His primary attack
7797400	7804120	is self-destructing. I was thinking of Dan Hibiki because his version of the Shingoku
7804120	7810120	Satsu takes him down to like one bar of life. Um, the four most obvious ones to me would be
7810120	7817080	the creepers in Minecraft, the Bob-ombs from Mario Brothers, um, two, sorry, and the Pokemon
7817080	7822280	Voltorb and its evolution electrode and possibly the prenees from Disgaea. And that's from Robert
7822280	7828120	M. Optional P.S. I heard Weird Al's your horoscope for today and check to see if there
7828120	7833560	was an AMV style video redundant for a certain web comic, which of course there is.
7835880	7836840	That homestuck.
7836840	7840440	Yeah, even I got that reference from the shirt talk you were talking about later.
7841320	7845640	Thank you for the email. What a random question, but you hit all the big ones. I would have
7845640	7849880	thought of the prenees from Disgaea too, but one that you didn't name since we've been on
7849880	7854040	a Final Fantasy kick tonight. There's always some type of bomb. Yeah, there's a bomb,
7854040	7858280	mobs, grenade, or whatever they call it in the game. And their big attack is, uh, exploding.
7858280	7863640	So you have to kill them before they explode and kill you. It's almost always in a Final
7863640	7864760	Fantasy game. There's one of those.
7864760	7869480	Doesn't one of the weapons kill itself if you can't kill it in seven or was that something
7869480	7870040	else I'm thinking of?
7870040	7871480	I think so. It has been forever.
7871480	7878280	Some enemy will, oh, uh, pyramid head. If you don't beat, well, when you technically,
7878280	7885640	when you beat the red pyramid, it actually turns and lands on, he lands on his, uh, knife.
7885640	7886140	That's right.
7886680	7889960	So not that it's an attack that's self-destructing,
7889960	7893960	but that you don't get to be the one to get the kill hit really.
7894520	7898840	Flaco Jones, you a big fan of any self-destructing mobs in video games?
7900280	7902360	I hate self-destructing mobs in video games.
7902360	7903160	Very random question.
7903160	7904120	Me and PvP.
7905080	7909640	Chrono Trigger has those ones that they give you tons of XP and everything,
7909640	7913400	but you have to kill them before they self-destruct. There's those like rock things.
7913400	7915400	Uh, when you're up on the mountain.
7915400	7916040	Yeah.
7916040	7916540	Yeah.
7917160	7917880	Me and Spelunky.
7917880	7921720	That for me, that's like a race. Like I got the XP because they're so good for farming on,
7921720	7924280	but if they blow up ahead of time, you don't get anything.
7924280	7928760	Uh, me and Spelunky, I self-destruct myself all the time in that frustrating ass game.
7928760	7930440	That's for sure. All right.
7930440	7932120	Little big planning to blow yourself up.
7932120	7935480	They just did that to work around people getting stuck on their terribly designed levels.
7935480	7940920	You know, the first one I thought of was, was Dan in Street Fighter.
7942280	7945960	Cause he has his, that the screen goes black, everything. And he's like, almost,
7945960	7949080	he does die if you're, if you don't have a full life bar.
7950120	7954200	So, and then it does like two bars on the enemy or something like that.
7954200	7958840	Well, that was a random ass question, but you know what? I like random questions. So thanks.
7959480	7960600	This is the random show.
7961480	7965720	Um, last email then. Greetings, OLR. Since you have been light on emails lately,
7965720	7968920	I figured I'd send one that I'd been batting around for awhile.
7968920	7971240	This has to do with the dream I once had as a child.
7972200	7976680	At the time, the dream had tormented me due to its promises. And I'm wondering nowadays
7976680	7978920	if I was really onto something ahead of its time.
7980280	7985800	Run the clock back to mid 1991 with the SNES American release, uh, quickly approaching.
7986680	7989240	Having finally discovered the true glory of RPGs,
7989240	7992680	I was positively salivating over the intended power coverage
7992680	7996680	of the incredible looking Final Fantasy II, which was IV over there.
7996680	8000680	For the upcoming powerhouse of a system, the game was consuming my every waking
8000680	8003560	moment until it finally snaked its way into my dreams.
8003560	8006120	Now, I didn't actually dream about the game itself per se,
8006760	8009960	but rather I dreamed about the act of owning it.
8009960	8013000	You see, in my dream, not only did I own the cartridge for the game,
8013000	8015880	I would transform it to fit whatever system I tried to put it on.
8017000	8018520	Game Boy or SNES.
8018520	8021560	Much like the cross-saved functionality of Sony's products today,
8022200	8025240	I was carrying this game with me and playing it constantly.
8025240	8028280	At the time, the dream just left me frustrated and impatient,
8028280	8030120	and I can't help but feel like decades ago,
8030120	8033320	I foreshadowed the way I'm currently playing Final Fantasy X and X-2.
8034120	8038040	So, OLR crew, have you ever had any particular memorable dreams involving gaming,
8038040	8041160	whether it be about a game itself or just the act of gaming?
8041160	8043640	My most sincere apologies to everyone
8043640	8047560	if I tap into Hidden Well of Nocturnal Subconscious Mass Effect slash fiction.
8048680	8051800	Keep up the great work, and thanks for the hours of entertainment.
8051800	8053160	Sincerely, Awesome Unicorn.
8054120	8056440	A dream involving video games.
8056440	8058280	I know, I had one, actually, I can tell you right now.
8058280	8058600	Okay.
8058600	8060440	This is how I figured out how to play DDR properly.
8061240	8064680	It's because I actually, because I kept doing the step back to the middle thing
8064680	8069560	that everybody does when they're new, and then I just like, I went to bed,
8069560	8072120	and then I started dreaming about moving from arrow to arrow,
8072680	8075480	and then I got up and played the game fine the next day.
8075480	8081320	I went from doing like three star, or three foot songs,
8081320	8084920	to going right into, you know, sixes with no problem.
8085800	8091320	So it was just, it was just a sort of an occur to me kind of thing.
8092440	8094440	I don't really remember dreams.
8094440	8097400	I'm one of those people, like some people can't remember their dream,
8097400	8099800	which is funny because we were talking about my memory issues earlier in the show,
8099800	8104440	but like for real, once in a great, great, great, great while I'll have a dream that I remember,
8104440	8109320	but it's so rare, like, and not nothing I can think of that involves video games, actually.
8109320	8110120	Sorry.
8110120	8115160	I do almost, almost always remember at least something I would have dreamt the night before.
8115160	8116360	I'm a lucid dreamer.
8116360	8117000	No, not me.
8117560	8122040	So like, wow, that's one thing that that always crept into my dreams.
8122040	8125480	It's like, because you stop playing, but the game is so like,
8125480	8127400	I don't know, monotonous, I guess, in a way.
8128280	8131560	I just, I would go to sleep and I would just imagine I'm still grinding on something.
8131560	8133960	You have to go to kill 10 chickens in your sleep.
8133960	8135880	Yeah, killing like, I'm still doing all this.
8135880	8136840	It really is like that.
8136840	8139160	It's weird, but it's not, it's not a bad dream.
8139160	8139960	It's like, hey, cool.
8139960	8141480	I'm still questing while I'm sleeping.
8141480	8142360	And it's fun.
8142360	8143560	My wife has them too.
8143560	8144360	She tells me all the time.
8144360	8148040	She's like, oh, I just, I just dreamed I was like riding my mount through the barrens.
8148040	8149400	And that's just something that happened.
8150040	8151880	At least in the dreams, there's no barrens chat.
8151880	8152600	At least not for me.
8152600	8155160	I did kind of have the dream about, wow, one time.
8155560	8159080	Do you remember after, this was when we were still on Blade's Edge,
8159640	8163160	and I was playing as Rebecca Black when I finally decided to level her.
8163160	8163660	Yes.
8164680	8168360	And the one guy was following around, making up his own lyrics to Friday.
8169400	8172920	I dreamt about that last night that I was playing through like
8173560	8177960	a 16 bit version of wow, with that being the background music.
8178600	8179320	That's awesome.
8180440	8181880	With me playing on Rebecca Black.
8182040	8183160	It was pretty funny.
8184040	8184520	Wow.
8184520	8188280	What, what made you want to roll a character named Rebecca Black in the first place?
8188280	8190360	I was bored and I was going to make a tank.
8190360	8191800	And so I couldn't think of a name.
8191800	8192840	So just made Rebecca Black.
8192840	8194360	Did you roll the character on Friday?
8195320	8196120	I don't know.
8196840	8199640	However, those details are important.
8199640	8204280	I use the dorky human female with the long black hair.
8204280	8206680	So the only, the only human female model.
8206680	8210280	Well, yeah, but she had the, the one with the long black hair.
8210280	8212760	Yeah, but she had the, the long black hair and everything.
8212760	8213260	Okay.
8213480	8215720	And, um, I actually got her to 85.
8216280	8216780	Wow.
8217400	8222120	And I had one person drop out of a Headless Horseman pug.
8223640	8228280	Because, and our healer, mind you, I ain't healing Rebecca Black.
8230760	8231880	And oh hell no drop.
8232600	8234600	Well, next week I'll know to ask you, I'll say,
8234600	8236440	Hey, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
8236440	8237400	And you'll say something like,
8237400	8245240	I super like Saturday.
8246520	8248280	Oh, the sequel song that she did.
8248280	8249880	It's actually really good.
8249880	8250380	Yeah.
8251640	8254680	It's actually like, she's actually learned how to sing.
8255640	8257800	Uh, but it's not, it's not technically her, is it?
8257800	8258760	It's her and somebody else.
8258760	8264600	Well, no, she's her and some other guy, but it's mostly her.
8264600	8266520	I like Conan's version of Thursday.
8267720	8269480	That's my favorite parody.
8270200	8274200	Uh, let me see if I can get a little clip of Saturday here for Flaco Jones.
8274200	8276520	And if you're pissed and I'm playing this, blame Flaco Jones.
8277400	8278760	Don't, don't play it.
8279320	8280280	No, you can't blame me.
8290920	8292680	The lyrics are actually kind of funny.
8293640	8295640	The lyrics are for Friday or Friday.
8296600	8297560	We so excited.
8299240	8300520	Look, she wrote in the sand.
8300520	8301560	So excited.
8301560	8302600	Oh my gosh.
8304280	8305960	So she made a parody video.
8305960	8306600	Pretty much.
8307320	8307960	Pretty much.
8307960	8311960	And like my favorite side is the guy who's singing it with her.
8311960	8314120	She's like, Oh my God, come over.
8314120	8315400	You know, completely messing up.
8315400	8316440	And he's like, sure.
8316440	8320680	As soon as I find my pants, it was really funny.
8320680	8321320	I thought it was,
8322520	8327080	Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is cursing out Flaco Jones in our chat room and revoking all of his loot.
8328760	8329960	I said, don't play it.
8332040	8333560	I actually, I actually do.
8333560	8335880	Saturday is sort of like my guilty pleasure song now.
8335880	8338920	I hated Friday because I can't stand auto tune out of tune.
8340120	8340600	Okay.
8340600	8341560	Saturday is actually good.
8341560	8343240	Everybody has a guilty pleasure song.
8343240	8346520	Well, if I'm already having all my loot revoked, then just play Chinese food.
8347960	8348680	Is that your favorite?
8348680	8349720	Is that your guilty pleasure song?
8349720	8350760	The Chinese food song.
8350760	8354120	It is now take down the network.
8354120	8359800	Uh, my favorite guilty pleasure song is two one two by Asphiela Banks.
8359800	8363480	But anyway, just listen to it on your own time.
8363480	8365160	I confusion.
8366440	8368360	All right, Rob, I have to have paintberry tonight.
8369000	8369800	It's Easter Sunday.
8369800	8370840	They're probably closed.
8370840	8372040	So we'll break in.
8375000	8375400	All right.
8375960	8376200	Yes.
8376200	8377320	Thank you, gamer girl.
8377320	8377880	I agree.
8378760	8381880	What says, Oh my, Rebecca Black actually has a voice.
8381880	8386360	Well, she was only like 13 when that Friday thing, but that's why I couldn't like some
8386360	8388760	she's actually done more music since then.
8388760	8391960	Some of the things that people said about her when that video is huge.
8391960	8393720	I was like, you know, she's like 13, right?
8393720	8398840	Did you know that they did a Rebecca Black, uh, reacts video to Friday?
8398840	8399320	Oh yeah.
8399320	8401320	And it's her reacting to it two years later.
8401320	8404920	My favorite was, there was, um, there was like a, it was, it was either death metal
8404920	8406840	or screamo version of Friday.
8406840	8407160	Funny.
8408040	8410600	And I'll still post that on people's Facebook to this day.
8414760	8417080	Not good shooting any conversation.
8417080	8419080	The best thing to come out of Friday was gang fight.
8420520	8420680	Yeah.
8420680	8423240	The bad lip sync or whatever, which I still have.
8423240	8424120	Don't, don't judge me.
8424120	8425480	I still have it on my playlist.
8425480	8425800	All right.
8425800	8429640	So, uh, somehow our emails on dreams turn into a discussion on Rebecca Black.
8430200	8433080	So thank you to the emailers.
8433080	8434280	Man, that's my fault too.
8434280	8435080	I talked about, wow.

8494840	8498600	It's the can't evens of the week.
8498600	8499480	Dark Sakura.
8499480	8500840	Marissa's in chat.
8500840	8501640	Hi, Marissa.
8502680	8503560	We love you, Marissa.
8503560	8504600	Why aren't you here, Marissa?
8504600	8505080	I can't.
8505640	8506520	I can't either.
8507160	8510040	Uh, but, um, fuck.
8510040	8513160	Um, this thing that's suddenly appeared on the side of my face.
8514120	8514600	It hurts.
8517080	8518920	It's because I've been, it was because.
8518920	8519800	Are they flames?
8520360	8522600	No, that was Victoria already today.
8524040	8525320	I'm rehashing jokes.
8526120	8527400	On the side of my face.
8528040	8529480	No, well, no.
8529480	8535960	I was going to say, um, I've been eating nothing but crap and my body feels like crap and I
8535960	8537320	miss the gym a whole lot.
8538120	8539080	So just F you.
8539080	8540120	Gym's right here.
8540120	8540920	Yeah, I'm right here.
8542280	8542520	Yeah.
8542520	8543640	Can I bench press you?
8544440	8545400	I don't know.
8545400	8549160	I had, remember four hot dogs and a hamburger and a pile of potato salad today.
8549720	8550680	Probably not.
8550680	8555320	But I miss, I miss being more active like that and how good I felt all the time.
8556200	8567000	And so, and this weird gas, it's like having to burp and can't burp.
8567000	8569000	So I actually literally can't right now.
8570040	8574520	Literally can't, uh, my, a few of the weeks, the stark soccer, I brought her up.
8574520	8578520	My few of the week goes to Victoria because you know, of all the years I've been doing
8578520	8580120	these shows and have known Victoria.
8580120	8582760	I think she's only ever been on OLR once.
8582760	8585400	And that was back when we were in the garage studio.
8585400	8586600	It was way too long ago.
8587400	8588920	Victoria, get your ass over to Bob.
8590440	8593800	Yeah, she needs a game of throne show on the network or something like that.
8594760	8596360	She call it chair of swords.
8596360	8598920	Something game of complaints.
8598920	8600600	That's all you people will do to watch that show.
8600600	8601880	You just complain a lot.
8601880	8602360	All right.
8602360	8604440	Uh, or game of spoilers.
8604440	8606760	Game of spoilers for a 10 year old book.
8606760	8610520	Uh, Blanco Jones, your FUs of the week.
8610520	8612040	Uh, it says, Loki's not here.
8612040	8617560	I'll complain about bad drivers, uh, trying to get here today and like stuck behind a
8617560	8619480	slow moving car, but it's like a Mercedes.
8619480	8620600	Like drive your car faster.
8620600	8623320	If you have an expensive car, you can afford to get tickets to drive faster.
8624920	8629160	Of course I finally pass him and he's like, he's like drinking a soda and looking down
8629160	8629960	at a phone.
8629960	8632840	So of course it's like, all right, well, at least he can kill anybody.
8634680	8635180	All right.
8635960	8636440	There it is.
8636520	8639080	Your FUs of the week.
8639080	8639800	Love it.
8639800	8640040	All right.
8640040	8641160	One more story for you guys.
8641160	8642840	And then we're going to open up the Skype line.
8642840	8644760	Cause we want you to call in and be with our show.
8644760	8649720	Uh, one eight seven seven game, O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
8649720	8653480	And the last story tonight has to go with a sale.
8655240	8659720	And it's something you want to get now on sale because the game will no longer be available
8659720	8665960	after April 30th, a moment of silence internet for burger time world tour.
8666680	8667480	That's right.
8667480	8672360	The moderate envisioning to one of the greatest classic video games of all time,
8672360	8677320	time, time, time, time is, uh, no longer going to be a thing.
8677320	8678520	And let's be real.
8678520	8685640	The re-imagining was kind of jank, but it was a great game, uh, back in the eighties.
8685640	8688680	And, you know, we, we love these reimaginings of games.
8688680	8694680	They, they remind us of the past a little bit, but anyhow, uh, the game is on sale on
8694680	8696440	Xbox live arcade PlayStation network.
8696440	8699640	And we were for $4 and 99 cents.
8699640	8705320	Monkey paw who published the game is, uh, having some expired licensing agreements for
8705320	8708120	Peter pepper and all his, all his friends.
8708120	8710680	Cause monkey paw games didn't create burger time.
8710680	8712840	They had to license it from somebody else.
8712840	8719320	So burger time world tour will be a shutdown by the food and drug administration on April
8719320	8720120	30th.
8720120	8725960	I guess, I guess, I guess you could call it, say that this video game got assaulted.
8727880	8730520	I could see the pun coming from so far away.
8731640	8732600	You weren't doing it.
8732600	8735400	I was face palming before you said it all the way.
8735400	8736840	That was a preemptive face palm.
8738520	8739800	I love burger time.
8739800	8743640	Who doesn't, who doesn't people that don't know their games?
8743640	8744360	That's who all right.
8745160	8750120	One eight seven seven game, O L R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
8750120	8753400	You can give us a call right now and we can talk about anything we've talked about on
8753400	8756280	the show world tonight so far, or maybe you have something else you want to bring up with
8756280	8757960	us or what have you.
8757960	8761400	This is where I'd usually turn to Loki and go, Hey, you have any last minute news, but
8761400	8762360	he's not here.
8762360	8764280	Flaco, you have any last minute news?
8764280	8767560	Uh, I wish I could drink more beer, but I have to drive home.
8767560	8769800	I'm going to leave that last can for another day.
8769800	8769960	Yeah.
8769960	8771080	So I save it for a rainy day.
8771720	8773000	How do you like it by the way?
8773000	8774360	It's pretty, it's pretty hoppy.
8774360	8775720	It's, it's an interesting kind of flavor.
8775720	8778120	It's not as dark as it was in a hoppy brew.
8778120	8778680	Is that where it is?
8778680	8779080	Very hoppy.
8779080	8781240	Yeah, it's, it's, it's an IPA and you pay a little.
8781240	8783320	So yeah, it's hot, but it's got a nice maltiness.
8783320	8784680	It kind of offsets the bitterness.
8784680	8785000	Yeah.
8785000	8786040	I like it.
8786040	8786360	All right.
8786360	8787560	Hey, we've got a call coming in.
8787560	8788120	Talk.
8788120	8790280	We'll, we'll ask our caller if there's any last minute stories.
8790280	8790520	Hi.
8790520	8791320	I'm orange launch radio.
8791320	8791720	Who's this?
8792360	8793240	That's your residence.
8793240	8795720	Your favorite anime con whore Rama.
8795720	8797640	Hey, anime con whore Rama.
8797640	8799080	Were you a wonder con this weekend?
8799960	8802840	Uh, no, I was at sleep con.
8803320	8805880	You know what, with all the cons you go to, I'm not surprised at all.
8805880	8808760	You don't, or that you, you have to sit one out once in a while.
8809320	8809560	Yeah.
8809560	8810440	Cause I'm gear.
8810440	8810600	Yeah.
8810600	8815240	Cause after PAX East and Castle Point, we're gearing up for another con this
8815240	8817000	weekend and another one after that.
8817000	8817560	Oh God.
8817560	8818520	What's this weekend?
8819480	8820520	Uh, Zenkai con.
8820520	8824680	It's a local con out in Philly, Lancaster County area.
8824680	8828360	And after that as a con, I think the entire OLR staff should go to call it
8829240	8833480	as a 21 plus convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
8833480	8836760	Oh, this could be a fun convention.
8837640	8839400	No, not a con is not Otacon.
8840280	8840840	Oh sure.
8840840	8841080	Okay.
8841800	8842040	All right.
8842040	8843160	Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8843800	8848040	Well, we're talking about something a little bit different now, just out of
8848040	8853320	curiosity, have you ever heard of record store day only this year?
8855480	8858040	Yeah, I heard about it this year.
8858280	8861240	I didn't know about it from years past, but apparently this is the fifth or sixth
8861240	8861640	year.
8861640	8865320	I think it's, it's a similar thing to like free comic book day, right?
8865320	8869880	Where they try to entice people to go, you know, fuck iTunes and, and, uh,
8869880	8872120	Amazon MP3 stores and all that.
8872120	8877080	And, and go back to the roots of the, of a retail music store, I believe is the,
8877080	8878280	the concept behind it, right?
8878920	8880280	Yeah, that, yeah.
8880280	8881320	Which is pretty cool.
8881320	8885400	I didn't even know about it till late Friday night till a couple of the nerd
8885400	8890200	core rappers I follow on Facebook linked me to a special album that was coming
8890200	8892040	out as part of record store day.
8892040	8892280	Yeah.
8894040	8896760	Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to play a quick track from it.
8896760	8898680	Cause I think everybody here knows it.
8899320	8899640	Okay.
8900840	8901560	Can you hear it?
8903880	8904120	No.
8905400	8905720	Yeah.
8905720	8908280	Well, if you can't hear it, then my system sucks.
8908280	8908920	Well, anyway.
8908920	8911720	Is that the Manamanaguchi song?
8911720	8912760	Oh, yup.
8913800	8914360	There we go.
8916360	8917360	Yeah.
8917360	8922760	I heard that there was something involved in the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack and them put
8922760	8926760	out on LP, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game.
8928200	8928920	Hmm.
8928920	8930040	That's awesome though.
8930040	8932840	But yeah, a lot of people are saying they missed out on it.
8932840	8936440	Even Bobby and chat right now is saying they didn't allocate any of the video game releases
8936440	8937320	to my local store.
8937960	8943800	So, cause what happened was when I first heard about it, I pull up the list and I'm like,
8943800	8947080	okay, I'm going to do some side questing and find it.
8947080	8949720	Cause I got four requests on Facebook to find this.
8950360	8952040	One person never got back to me.
8952040	8957080	Another person found it in Ohio and our friendly neighborhood Mexicans getting the other copy
8957080	8958360	I was able to track down for him.
8959000	8961240	Well, you can always buy it on eBay for like 50 bucks.
8961800	8962840	That's okay.
8962840	8964680	I'm keeping my copy sealed.
8964680	8967800	I went to like three different stores called two.
8967800	8969640	Most of them all said we didn't get it.
8969640	8971800	So I found a place called turntable lab that had it.
8973800	8974300	Huh.
8974920	8976680	Well, congrats on your find.
8978600	8979080	Thank you.
8980360	8983080	I kind of wish I did have a turntable lab to be perfectly honest.
8983080	8986360	I'm going to keep this sealed just for sentimental value.
8986360	8990920	Cause when we have kids, when we pull this out, they're going to be like, what is that?
8990920	8995240	And then we'll have to sit down and explain to him to them back in the day before it was
8995240	9001560	digital music, before it was CDs, you had cassettes, LPs, and we go back a little bit
9001560	9003000	further eight track.
9003800	9006600	Bobby Black Wolf says they only made like 2000 of them.
9006600	9009240	And there were 1200 stores participating in record store day.
9009240	9011240	So that's why they were kind of hard to find.
9011240	9015080	I would show, you know, if you're going to show you talk to your grandkids about records,
9015080	9019400	show them those pictures of like a record player and the needle in the record at like
9019400	9020680	1000 magnified.
9020680	9024040	Cause it's really cool what those things look like close up like that.
9024840	9026600	That sounds like a great idea.
9027800	9030760	It's like an old episode of three, two, one contact or something like that.
9030760	9031560	Well, that's cool.
9033000	9035880	I'm glad you were able to get out there on record store day.
9037000	9038360	Anything else to share with listeners tonight?
9040280	9041560	Let's see.
9041560	9046840	Oh, besides the fact that Dr. Luigi and fan Mario were a smash hit at PAX East, I can't
9046840	9047880	think of anything else.
9049160	9052040	Are you getting to see some of those pictures as they go up on the internet from PAX East?
9052680	9053400	Yeah.
9053400	9057400	Me and Marco are in a couple of videos that are flowing around at PAX.
9057400	9061480	I shared on my Facebook page and I have to get my photos up as well.
9062040	9062600	Very cool.
9063240	9063640	Excuse me.
9063640	9064120	Very cool.
9064120	9065880	I'm glad to hear you guys had a good time at PAX East.
9065880	9070680	I, I really need to get it back out there for some, one of the PAX is obviously my feathers
9070680	9076760	were a little ruffled at some of the comments that they'd made and just the, how fast that
9076760	9077560	shit sells out.
9077560	9079800	And I'm usually working during the day when those tickets go on sale.
9079800	9081880	So I'm gonna have to be a little more on it in the future.
9081880	9084120	So well, do what I do.
9084120	9087640	If you got friends at you that you, I got friends I have room with every year.
9087640	9089400	It's like, we sit there and plan.
9089400	9094120	One person handles the, the credit cards and the badges.
9094120	9098520	Then I handle the credit cards and the hotel room because whoever has the best internet
9098520	9102280	can handle, you know, and we just delegate like that and we get shit done.
9102280	9105880	Well, I am, I am hoping to do something like that, at least for Dragon Con.
9105880	9109560	I've kind of got some like that running and who knows, I'm hoping to get out properly
9109560	9113400	to the, I would say the East coast, but Atlanta's really East coast to me.
9113400	9117480	So to the Northeast coast soon, because it's been forever since I've been to NYC.
9117480	9118200	Been forever.
9118200	9118840	Yes.
9118840	9123320	You need to come and hang out for a weekend, have a good time with the, with the New York
9123320	9124120	OL army.
9124120	9126440	I will, I will make it a point to do so soon.
9126440	9131400	And if nothing else, the motivation of Neil Patrick Harris's Hedwig is a huge, huge motivation.
9131960	9135880	A friend of mine saw, saw that yesterday and got, got his autograph.
9137000	9138520	Well, consider me a jealous bitch.
9138520	9143560	Oh, Rob, what are we going to do with you?
9144680	9146280	The same thing you've done with me for 12 years.
9146280	9146840	All right, Rama.
9146840	9147800	I'm going to let you go get more calls.
9147800	9149320	That's illegal in 38 states.
9150600	9151560	Not this one.
9151560	9151880	All right.
9152440	9153320	Hey, yo.
9153320	9154280	Bye Rama.
9154280	9154600	Bye.
9157720	9160760	That's illegal in 38 states, but I thought the Supreme court, nevermind.
9160760	9161080	All right.
9161080	9166040	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9166680	9168280	Give us a call and we'll talk.
9168840	9169560	Whatever you'd like.
9170360	9171240	I must apologize.
9171240	9173160	I have lost my connection to the chat room.
9173160	9173400	What?
9174040	9174920	Unacceptable.
9174920	9175240	I know.
9175240	9175960	Just kidding.
9175960	9176280	All right.
9176280	9178920	We do, we do have more calls coming in, so let's get to it.
9178920	9180040	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9180040	9180520	Who's that?
9180520	9181400	Who's this?
9181400	9181960	Hello.
9183640	9184920	Is this Marissa?
9185720	9186600	Yes, it is.
9187880	9188840	How you doing, girl?
9189720	9190120	I'm good.
9190120	9190760	How are you?
9190760	9194840	I have nothing relevant or on topic to talk about, but I'm sure that we'll have a giggle
9194840	9195800	fest anyway, right?
9195800	9196680	Who gives a shit?
9196680	9198120	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
9198680	9200600	We don't have to talk.
9200600	9201960	We'll talk about whatever we want.
9203240	9203640	Damn it.
9203640	9204200	Yeah.
9204200	9207880	One of these days I will come up there and we'll do a series of episodes and then we'll
9207880	9210520	like syndicate it and we'll be Robin Rose's giggle time.
9210520	9212840	I have a computer good enough to do YouTubes now.
9212840	9214280	We can, we can look at doing something like that.
9214280	9214760	It'd be fun.
9216760	9218360	Well, you're talking about cons earlier.
9218360	9218760	It's funny.
9218760	9221000	I wonder con has been going on down here.
9221000	9223000	I have not been able to sneak my way in.
9223000	9227400	I didn't get a ticket at the last second and then a friend offered me one at the last second,
9227400	9229640	which would require me driving two, three hours.
9229640	9234040	You know, but by the time I got there, the ticket would have been useless, but it was
9234040	9234520	just funny.
9234520	9239960	Anyway, everyone that went there had a wonderful time and they had a great, um, uh, voice actor
9239960	9244440	panel and you know, that, that's my shtick, but everyone has been saying good things about
9244440	9244520	it.
9245160	9245400	Yeah.
9245400	9250200	It would do wonder con happened on two coasts at the same time or something because I know
9250200	9253320	there were people going to LA, but I had some friends in the Northeast that were going to
9253320	9253880	something too.
9254520	9257880	So I guess there was like a bi-coastal con or something going on.
9258840	9260360	Sweetheart, I live in Los Angeles.
9260360	9261640	There's other parts of the world.
9263320	9264680	Typical Los Angeles.
9268120	9273160	I hadn't heard about that, uh, heard about that, but I was hearing the feedback and people
9273160	9274280	were having a great time.
9274840	9275000	Yeah.
9275800	9276600	It's funny though.
9276600	9280440	I wasn't able to go and I thought I was talking to Jamie about this might be able to appreciate
9280440	9285960	it since you were talking about booze earlier as well since I can connect anything randomly.
9285960	9291160	Um, I didn't get to go that, but I got to go to my friend, uh, uh, my long time friends
9291160	9297080	since, uh, like, uh, elementary school, she had a birthday party and the Hollywood Hills
9297080	9298760	were getting all glam up in this shit.
9299400	9305480	And there were some actually people involved in, in the gaming and whatnot, but it overlooked
9305480	9309480	the entire hall, you know, and I'm not used to getting into this, this type of glam stuff.
9309480	9312840	You know, I'm like, well, I didn't make it to WonderCon, but at least this is fascinating.
9312840	9315800	I can see all of LA and this beautiful house with the tower.
9316600	9320120	And early on in the evening though, I decided to try rum.
9321800	9322680	Oh yeah.
9322680	9324200	I don't, I'm not a big drinker.
9324840	9328600	So, you know, like I just, you know, like I say stupid shit without any assistance.
9329400	9332200	So, but here's the thing.
9332200	9333080	Okay.
9333080	9336840	So in my disappointment, not being able to make it to WonderCon, I'm like, okay, I'm
9336840	9337640	going to have a good time.
9337640	9339080	I'm going to get more social.
9339080	9341960	I learned that rum makes me want to nap.
9344600	9348040	I motherfucking power nap that bitch.
9348040	9348760	Okay.
9348760	9354040	You want to talk about stars and celebrity and shit and all the magic of Los Angeles.
9354040	9354600	Yeah.
9354600	9356840	I napped in every room of that house.
9357560	9358120	Oh yeah.
9358760	9359480	Uh huh.
9359480	9361240	That's what I would do.
9361240	9364920	That was, I used to be infamous at parties for drinking some Malibu and whatever, and
9364920	9366440	then falling asleep under the table.
9366920	9369160	That's just, that's just how we roll.
9369160	9369880	Yeah, exactly.
9370760	9372920	Look, I can't, I just geek at a party.
9372920	9374280	Like I can't even do that normally.
9374280	9376840	It's like, yeah, like friends, like, how'd you have that big glamorous time?
9376840	9378360	Like, Oh honey, the couch upstairs.
9380920	9381720	Perfect.
9381720	9383480	Look at our chat room.
9383480	9386200	Look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9386200	9389560	Fifth dream in chat says her voice reminds me of someone a lot, but I can't think of
9389560	9391480	who an anime character maybe.
9392440	9393800	Oh, I do that sometimes.
9393800	9394680	Oh, I don't know.
9395080	9400760	I love it when you slip into the voices.
9400760	9401320	It's great.
9402280	9406520	You know, the funny thing was that I, I, you know, I, I studied this intently and I, and
9406520	9410600	I love it, but the first time I ever, um, did anything with regard to anime, I was kind
9410600	9413640	of nervous in the class and I wasn't sure what to do.
9413640	9415320	So I thought, you know what?
9416120	9416620	Fuck it.
9417240	9421160	I'm going to do like the stereotype.
9421800	9427400	And, um, I fully expected to be scolded, but I was just having a drop the mic moment.
9427400	9428760	I was like, just fuck this.
9428760	9429320	I'm nervous.
9429320	9431320	I'm just going to go in and I'm going to going to do that.
9431320	9436440	And I fully expected them to just drop their pens, you know, and go, this is very serious
9436440	9441000	business and there is so much more to this and you can't just stereotype.
9441000	9442120	This is an art.
9442120	9445880	But I went up there and like the last bite of the popsicle and I just did a round of
9445880	9446280	applause.
9446280	9447720	Like, yes, bravo.
9448040	9452280	That's such an LA story.
9453960	9460360	I was so expecting to be reamed about the arts and everything, but brilliant.
9460360	9460920	Brilliant.
9460920	9461240	Yes.
9461240	9461720	Oscar.
9465240	9465560	Fuck it.
9465560	9466360	Where's my check?
9468680	9470360	When in doubt, stereotypes.
9472360	9476040	Although there weren't two people in that room that found it a little too erotic.
9476680	9482520	So, man, I'm just pissing off everyone.
9484040	9489400	Marissa, I can't wait for the day that, you know, I find some Yuri video online and you're
9489400	9490280	one of the voices.
9493800	9494680	I would love that.
9494680	9499080	But until then, everything probably for me, it seems to be like one nine hundred girls
9499080	9499640	dot com.
9499640	9504360	That's like, what's going to be a tone app for me when I'm having that not so fresh
9504360	9504840	feeling.
9506760	9507400	That's what happened.
9507400	9511400	I tried to record like a professional sounding answering machine for myself.
9511400	9513880	And you know how much like cell phone reception sucks.
9513880	9514280	Yeah.
9514280	9517720	And but I just I just record it like bam, done.
9517720	9518600	I didn't listen to it.
9518600	9523240	But the message I found out later sounded like, hi, this is Marissa.
9524040	9526920	I can't come to the phone right now, but I'd sure love to hear from you.
9528280	9532680	And then my doctor leaves me a message one day, you know, calling to say like, oh, you
9532680	9534440	know, you're healthy from your physical and everything.
9534520	9538520	Just Marissa, what's just a sounding answering machine you have?
9540360	9542040	Which made sense.
9542040	9544840	Looking back at the types of messages I received.
9548440	9553160	Marissa, you know, yes, you need to do a stand up comedy show where you just talk about your
9553160	9553400	life.
9553400	9554600	And that is a compliment.
9554600	9560280	I'm not like, not like saying like, Marissa, you're a crazy hoe.
9560280	9561400	Like, I'm not saying that.
9561960	9564360	Like, you're really funny when you tell these nuts.
9564360	9565880	You got to put this shit on tape.
9568280	9568920	No, I love you.
9571160	9572360	Marissa, I love you, too.
9572360	9573480	Thanks for calling in the show.
9573480	9575480	I don't give a fuck that had nothing to do with games.
9575480	9576520	It's always good to hear from you.
9578440	9579000	All right.
9579000	9581480	Well, it's always great to talk to you guys, too.
9581480	9582440	Miss Jamie, my love.
9586440	9588200	Getting a little your reaction going on right now.
9588200	9588600	All right.
9591400	9596440	Consistently here that interestingly enough, voice actors talk about video games being
9596440	9597720	the most challenging.
9597720	9599080	I found that really interesting.
9599080	9599480	Really?
9600360	9603000	Yeah, this well, apparently doesn't pay as well either.
9603000	9605000	But they're trying to work on that in the union.
9605000	9610120	But well, aren't you normally like in a booth by yourself instead of around with other people?
9611720	9616280	Well, only American, you know, like only American animation is traditionally when you work with
9616280	9620680	other people, which is considered like the height and the best, you know, the best art.
9621400	9624520	But with video games, you know, they rush to push it out so much.
9624520	9627320	And yeah, you are often separated from the other actors.
9627320	9629480	And sometimes they give you little context.
9629480	9631480	And then you have to do all the various efforts.
9631480	9634040	It's very hard on actors vocal chords as well, too.
9634680	9637080	I bet with all the voice that goes into it.
9637080	9639960	You know, you've got offers in our chair, by the way, over at live.voguenetwork.com
9639960	9643320	Bonds006 says I need Marissa to make a voicemail for my cell now.
9644760	9645400	Who said that?
9646120	9647400	Bonds006.
9648040	9650200	Oh, Bonds006, hi.
9650200	9651480	He's the sexiest guy ever.
9651480	9654040	You have to leave him answering machine messages as soon as possible.
9657080	9657960	Get back to him.
9657960	9658460	Yes.
9659560	9660360	Now hold on.
9660360	9661880	You got to charge listeners for this.
9661880	9663320	We got a fun vog somehow.
9663880	9666040	Pay $10 get sexy Marissa talk.
9666040	9667240	All right, Marissa.
9667240	9669960	I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.
9669960	9671240	But thank you so much, Marissa.
9671800	9672840	A great night, you guys.
9672840	9673480	I love you.
9673480	9673980	Take care.
9675480	9676120	Oh, God.
9676120	9677480	Always great to hear from her.
9677480	9678600	You know, here's the thing, though.
9678600	9682360	I know Marissa is a big fan of the thief series of video games.
9682360	9686200	So seeing as that new thief just came out, she probably didn't want to talk about it.
9686200	9688040	She probably didn't want to talk about it.
9688040	9690520	Based on what I've heard about that, she probably didn't want to talk about that, actually.
9691400	9693400	I don't think that was a topic out of discussion.
9693400	9696280	So, so we get, we get voicemail messages instead.
9696280	9697320	I don't mind whatsoever.
9698040	9698540	All right.
9699880	9701960	Now people in chat.
9701960	9702520	Now me.
9702520	9702760	Yeah.
9702760	9703560	Okay, now me.
9707240	9707740	I love it.
9708600	9709100	All right.
9709480	9709800	Let's see.
9709800	9714200	I'm trying to go to the Twitter while we wait for some more calls over at 1-877-GAME-OLR
9714200	9716760	or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9716760	9719240	Bonds006 says, I'll lose my job with that.
9722760	9723080	Let's see.
9723080	9727560	DarkTetsuya tweeted us saying, I found an interesting homebrew MSX game this week.
9727560	9729480	It's called Blue Warrior.
9729480	9732520	It's a scrolling shooter with an amazing soundtrack.
9732520	9733640	We'll have to check that out.
9733640	9737560	I like, I like, I like homebrew games for old systems.
9737560	9739960	Like, I love it when people make Atari 2600 games.
9739960	9740600	It's like, why?
9741160	9742360	Because.
9742360	9743000	Why not?
9743000	9743480	Why not?
9744040	9744680	Exactly.
9745880	9746280	Let's see.
9748120	9753880	DaBlueGuy tweeted us and said, PlayStation 4 still outsold Xbox One in March, even though
9753880	9754920	with Titanfall.
9755560	9758040	Yeah, that was news that was getting a bit of steam this week.
9758920	9762280	And if I'm not mistaken, haven't they sold worldwide?
9762280	9764920	Haven't they sold more Wii Us than Xbox Ones?
9764920	9767320	I mean, granted, Wii U has had a year up on it.
9767800	9769000	But they're already almost tied.
9769000	9771000	And like you said, they've had a year head start.
9771000	9771640	That's true.
9771640	9772920	But there's nothing to brag about.
9772920	9774200	There's that cynical side of me.
9774200	9777400	That's like, well, when's EA going to stop making games for Xbox One then?
9777400	9779400	If that's, you know, little bastards.
9780680	9782440	Yeah, I'm not trying to shade Nintendo.
9782440	9784440	I'm trying to shade everybody that abandoned ship.
9785640	9789800	But in all seriousness, it's the price difference straight up.
9791080	9792840	Everybody's been saying this till they're blue in the face.
9792840	9793640	And it's true.
9793640	9796040	Like they're charging the extra money for Kinect.
9796040	9798120	Nobody understands why Kinect is needed.
9798120	9800280	I mean, I'm sure there's the Xbox loyalists.
9800280	9801640	There's probably some Xbox fans out there
9801640	9803560	screaming at me on their podcast right now.
9803560	9805000	Like, you don't understand.
9805560	9808200	But it's like, no, most people don't give a shit.
9808200	9811160	Well, shouldn't all that really matters in the end be the money?
9811160	9812360	If they're selling it for a higher price,
9812360	9815640	they've probably made almost as much money as Sony has, right?
9815640	9816680	That's true.
9816680	9818040	But there's $100 more.
9818040	9821240	They've sold what we say two or three million fewer units.
9821240	9825560	But that $100 for those millions of units adds up quick.
9825640	9827960	And can equal a lot of Sony sales, I would think.
9827960	9828520	I don't know.
9828520	9833240	There's that fuzzy math too where Xbox sold to stores,
9833880	9836360	but Sony sold through to homes.
9836360	9837400	Yeah, I read that too.
9837400	9840120	There's a bit of a difference between the numbers that are being reported.
9840120	9843320	But I don't think it's doom and gloom for Microsoft
9843320	9847240	because a lot of systems have a slow first quarter.
9847240	9848920	Sony's just in a good position.
9848920	9852360	This is where Final Fantasy XIV worked out well for him.
9852360	9854520	Sitting on Infamous Second Son and Drive Club
9854520	9856600	are going to help them get through the year and some of those.
9856600	9859240	So I think this is where that's paying off for them a little bit.
9859240	9863400	I would say if we're at the holiday season and Xbox is still struggling,
9863400	9864760	then we've got a story.
9864760	9867240	But for right now, a lot can still happen.
9869000	9871720	Microsoft could come out in E3 and pronounce a price reduction.
9871720	9871960	Yeah.
9871960	9873720	I mean, it's not like they're doing poorly.
9873720	9877880	Like you said, they've already sold, or like if you say to stores,
9877880	9882360	they've still gotten close to you in a very smaller amount of time.
9883080	9883800	Exactly.
9883800	9884360	Exactly.
9885640	9889960	But again, I don't want to also dump on Wii U is dead and all that
9889960	9893640	because Mario Kart 8 is a big deal and Smash Brothers is going to be huge too.
9893640	9894360	I've got a Wii U now.
9894360	9897560	Of course, I didn't really help them out because I bought a used one.
9900920	9901560	Let's see.
9901560	9905480	I think a lot of this other stuff is news that we covered earlier in the show.
9905480	9909080	But if you want to tweet us sometime, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9909080	9911880	I'll put out one more call for calls.
9911880	9917320	If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
9917880	9919000	Um, let's see.
9920040	9924200	Bonds double 06 says my brother-in-law came over today to help me upgrade my iMac.
9924200	9926520	And he also asked why I don't have an Xbox one.
9926520	9929960	And my reply was I won't buy it at the current price.
9930600	9934360	Akuma JP says Xbox is dead to me though.
9934360	9935720	Yeah, but you live in Japan.
9935720	9937240	Xbox was always dead over there.
9937240	9939080	Like, did they ever sell a lot of 360s?
9939080	9941000	I mean, you think the Wii U sells bad here?
9941560	9943480	Check the 360 sales in Japan.
9943480	9943980	Okay.
9944760	9947720	And then, um, you know, the ones not even out there yet.
9947720	9953080	So, you know, I'd be curious though, if they are going to make a big push in Japan, that's
9953080	9953800	what the rumors are.
9953800	9957640	Xbox one is supposed to be making a big push in Japan when they launch in the holiday.
9957640	9963720	So you would expect to see at E3, what is that big Japanese based game exclusive going
9963720	9966360	to be that they have in their back pocket?
9966360	9967480	Is it Shenmue 3?
9968280	9969960	No, it's probably not.
9969960	9974680	Cause even though that's the game that most people want on Xbox, Sega is in bed with Nintendo
9974680	9979960	right now is seems to be where, you know, which is so weird being the eighties gamer,
9979960	9981560	but Sega and Nintendo are besties.
9981560	9984360	So I would expect any exclusives like that would be on Wii U.
9984360	9985880	So anything's possible.
9985880	9987000	Anything's possible, certainly.
9987800	9988200	All right.
9988760	9992360	Um, well, I guess, I guess that's it.
9992360	9993720	I guess nobody else is going to call in.
9994840	9998120	Well, it is a slow, it is a bit of a slower night just because, you know, it's, it's a
9998120	10000840	holiday and stuff and people are doing their dinners and things like that.
10001400	10006280	But if you are listening to the show after the fact, and you want to send us something
10006280	10008840	to talk about on a future show, you can always send us an email.
10008840	10013560	Participate at orange down orange, lounge, radio.com is our email address.
10013560	10016840	And that's another great way you can participate with the show, or you can send us a tweet
10016840	10017720	or anything else like that.
10018440	10023560	Anyhow, it's about time we get around to wrapping up the show and going around and closing out
10023560	10024760	shop for the night.
10024760	10027640	Flaco, thank you so much for being here tonight, especially on short notice.
10028520	10030360	I guess I gave you the short notice.
10030360	10030840	That's okay.
10031480	10035400	I got back home and like, Hey, I wonder, I, I haven't even finished last week.
10035400	10039400	So LR, cause like I said, I've had the week off, haven't really been commuting or going
10039400	10040200	to work and listening.
10040200	10043320	I've just been, you know, hanging out with the family and going to San Francisco, having
10043320	10044040	fun times there.
10044040	10048440	So yeah, but I heard pretty much right where I got to, he's like, Oh, we don't have anybody
10048440	10048840	next week.
10048840	10050280	I'm like, I wonder if they ever found someone.
10050280	10051880	So send you a message.
10051880	10052760	No, I was totally planning.
10052760	10055000	I'll just be Jamie and I will just do a quick hour long show.
10056440	10057160	Three hour show.
10057240	10057800	Let's go.
10057800	10062760	That would be and me, not, and I object object.
10062760	10063800	I don't even care.
10063800	10064120	All right.
10065160	10065640	You know what?
10065640	10067960	I don't butcher grammar as bad as MTV.
10067960	10068280	All right.
10069480	10071080	Anyway, Flaco, thank you for being here.
10071080	10072040	You are always welcome.
10072040	10073320	You didn't break the show tonight.
10073320	10073800	I didn't.
10073800	10076360	Well, I did with the Rebecca black stuff.
10076360	10081080	Apparently that was, that was all you and not chat at all or Jamie or anything.
10081080	10082680	It's all me, all you 100%.
10083880	10086680	But you're always welcome here and you did a great job tonight.
10086680	10087000	Cool.
10087000	10088920	I loved being here and I like the new place.
10088920	10089880	It's awesome.
10089880	10090520	Me too.
10090520	10090920	Hello.
10093160	10096200	I know it is still a little echoey in here, but we're working on it.
10096200	10096680	All right.
10096680	10098200	Your final thought tonight for us, please.
10098200	10099160	Oh, my final thought?
10100120	10101240	My beer is good.
10101240	10102360	I've sweated it all out.
10102360	10102840	I'm good to go.
10103880	10104280	All right.
10105000	10106760	I want to thank you guys for listening to the show.
10106760	10111080	And remember, if you do like orange on radio, all we ask is tell a friend or two about the
10111080	10111240	show.
10111240	10112760	You know, word of mouth is all we have.
10113320	10116760	Even if you can't think of anybody to tell right off the top of your head, please leave
10116760	10121000	us a nice review on Stitcher or iTunes or any place that you may have found this show
10121000	10125160	because those kind reviews go a long way in helping for exposure.
10126520	10129000	My final thought for tonight before, and then we'll go over to Jamie.
10129000	10132200	My final thought tonight is I can't wait for the first time in my life.
10132200	10135880	I can't wait to edit tonight's show because, you know, I try to edit the show, which I
10135880	10137480	don't, I don't really edit it.
10137480	10138680	I don't edit it for content.
10138680	10143400	I just crop it, clean it up and say, I can't wait to edit tonight's show on the new computer
10143400	10148680	because usually like saving the YouTube file alone because YouTube is encoded at a different
10148680	10149000	quality.
10149000	10150680	It's 96 44 for YouTube.
10151240	10153880	That file alone will take me 10 minutes to save.
10153880	10157320	And I'm thinking on the new computer, maybe only a couple.
10157320	10158520	I'm so excited to try.
10158520	10159880	I'm going to be a time saver.
10159880	10162600	Yeah, money well spent because my time is valuable.
10162600	10163080	Damn it.
10163080	10164200	That's my final thought tonight.
10164200	10165080	My time is valuable.
10165080	10165480	Damn it.
10166200	10167000	Dark Sakura.
10167000	10169160	Once again, happy birthday.
10169160	10169640	Thank you.
10169640	10170600	Thank you for the game.
10170600	10171320	You're welcome.
10171320	10171880	Enjoy it.
10171880	10172760	Play it this week.
10172760	10174120	I want a full report next week.
10174120	10174680	Okay.
10174680	10175240	All right.
10175240	10177400	And your final thoughts tonight are talker.
10177400	10179480	I'm, I'm actually hungry.
10179480	10184920	And if Adilberto's is open, I'm getting a burrito and then tomorrow back on track.
10184920	10192280	And I'm going to actually be visible with what I'm doing at the gym and do a regular report.
10192280	10194600	So I'm actually making my own N seven challenge.
10194600	10195960	Are you going to do gym selfies?
10196920	10198840	No, I'm not doing gym selfies.
10198840	10206040	I'm going to actually, unless they're me sweating and red and sore after having dead lifted 110
10206040	10206680	pounds.
10206680	10209160	I have a friend on Facebook that does gym selfies.
10209160	10211640	And that's the way he says, if you don't see me take a gym selfie today,
10211640	10212360	that means I didn't go.
10212360	10213320	So I need to get yelled at.
10213320	10215800	So that's like his whole little, like he needs Facebook to police him.
10215800	10221480	Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, um, everybody, I have a tumblr called dieting can bite me.
10222600	10224040	My picture is King hippo.
10224040	10230040	And you're going to, well, yeah.
10230040	10232520	And you're going to see, you're going to see activity on there.
10232520	10237640	And I made them making it public on the show because I, I need to play.
10237640	10241320	I need to put things where people are going to see it for the purpose of accountability.
10241880	10244680	But it's dieting can bite me dot tumblr.com.
10245560	10249880	And I will, I'm going to make this a thing.
10249880	10250440	All right.
10250440	10257720	And I'm going to try to, maybe I will be playing bravely default as my reward for gym time.
10258520	10259320	There you go.
10259320	10260280	You can play at the gym.
10260920	10262920	No, I can't because I don't do hamster wheel stuff.
10262920	10264440	Oh, I lift.
10264440	10265400	I lift heavy weights.
10265400	10265720	Fine.
10266520	10267880	I like hamster wheel stuff.
10268600	10268760	Yeah.
10268760	10271960	But all that does is build up your endurance is it doesn't actually make you stronger.
10273960	10276600	If I can lose fat doing it, it's something I need to be doing.
10276600	10277800	Weights are better for that.
10277800	10278200	We'll see.
10278200	10278600	We'll see.
10278600	10278920	All right.
10279720	10280520	That's it, everybody.
10280520	10283640	Thank you very much for tuning into the show and we'll see you again next week.
10283640	10284040	Next week.
10284040	10286280	I guess, I guess kind of a big number next week.
10286280	10286680	I don't know.
10286680	10291560	Like you hit your 10th episode, your 50th episode, your 100th episode, your 500th episode.
10291560	10292920	And then it's like, well, what else?
10292920	10295400	I guess there's always episode 1000.
10295400	10300680	But can you believe we'll be in our fifties when we hit episode 1000.
10301960	10304120	But tomorrow is episode or tomorrow.
10306760	10307880	What the hell is wrong with you?
10307880	10312440	Rob Roberts, next week, we will be hitting episode 550.
10313400	10314280	So that's me.
10314280	10316600	That's an episode of, or that's a multiple of 50.
10317320	10321240	We need to actually celebrate episode 555 because we're just a little bit less than evil.
10321240	10324440	I think, you know, what's funny is I think we joked like way back in the day.
10324440	10325800	We were like at episode 200.
10325800	10329960	We're like, we're going to hit episode 666 in like 2016.
10329960	10331800	And we always joked, Oh, we'll never get that far.
10331800	10336600	And now I'm like, we might actually get to episode 666 at this rate we're going.
10336600	10337240	So we'll see.
10337880	10339400	I think that we should never stop.
10340440	10341480	That's the hope.
10341480	10346520	I mean, it has to end someday, but no, I never, I don't.
10346520	10351480	We're going to be dead and our voices will be digitized and we'll have, we'll be glad
10351480	10351960	us.
10351960	10352520	Hello.

10372280	10373640	All right, that's it.
10373640	10375080	No, we're really closing up shop.
