WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.280
This week things have been a little quiet, but you know what that means. More ports lining

00:17.280 --> 00:20.280
on new systems, news of games that didn't make the cut, and interesting games that are

00:20.280 --> 00:23.840
about to make their debut. In other words, it's another week in gaming. Have your favorite

00:23.840 --> 00:29.760
candy at the ready and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.120 --> 00:40.720
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live here with episode number

00:40.720 --> 00:51.000
549 for April 20th, 2014. That's right. Let me just get it out of the way now. Happy 420!

00:51.000 --> 00:54.120
And Happy Easter, of course, if that's what you're into. And if you don't celebrate either

00:54.120 --> 00:57.120
of those things, then I hope you're having a fine Sunday.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.120
Happy fucking holiday! Hello, DarkSakura!

00:59.120 --> 01:05.360
Because it's bunnies and shagging and eggs. Fertility holiday!

01:05.360 --> 01:07.480
What are they calling it in Animal Crossing? You were just playing?

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
Bunny Day.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
Bunny Day. Happy Bunny Day.

01:09.480 --> 01:15.520
It's annoying in Animal Crossing. It's called the day after Jamie's birthday, so I'm a little

01:15.520 --> 01:20.000
bit food hungover. And I feel sick because I've eaten nothing but crap.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.360
Well, happy birthday to you, by the way.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
Thank you. I'm old.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
No, you're not.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.360
Please.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.600
It's another year of awesome. Come on.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.600
Yeah, I know I'm vintage.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
Look, we've been doing...

01:31.600 --> 01:33.600
Better vintage wine than sour grapes.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.600
Look, we've been doing OLR for, when we get to June, that's going to be our 12th birthday.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.880
So we've been doing this show for 12 years, so y'all do the math. Obviously, we are not

01:42.880 --> 01:47.280
in our 20s anymore doing this show, you know, so there's that expectation we're going to

01:47.280 --> 01:48.280
be a little bit older.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.800
I'm going to be doing OLR when I'm 70.

01:49.800 --> 01:55.320
We very well might be. We'll see. Not here tonight, unfortunately. Tech master Loki,

01:55.320 --> 01:58.160
Tech master Loki does have the night off because it is Easter and he has some family

01:58.160 --> 02:04.200
obligations this evening. But joining us in studio, it's a pleasure always to have this

02:04.200 --> 02:08.920
guy on the show. He's a big supporter of not just OLR, but a lot of the things at vognetwork.com

02:08.920 --> 02:12.800
and just a good guy to have here on the show. Say hello, everybody, to Flocko Jones.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Hello, everybody.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.800
How you doing, Flocko?

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
I'm doing all right.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
Yeah?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.200
I just realized I had to turn my mic on. It was off. That would have been embarrassing.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.840
That happens. Loki likes to do the off and on thing. Yeah, he has to do the click, click,

02:23.840 --> 02:26.480
click. Sometimes it happens. So what's new? How you been?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.320
I've been pretty good. I had a really good Easter.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.320
Did you?

02:29.320 --> 02:34.360
I accelerated by eating four hot dogs, a hamburger, a pile of potato salad. I starved myself

02:34.360 --> 02:37.600
for breakfast, though, so I could just throw down as much food as possible. They actually

02:37.600 --> 02:41.560
ran out of hot dogs. I think I could have handled a dozen. I was going for a dozen,

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
but it didn't work out.

02:42.560 --> 02:48.240
I love that even though Loki's not here, you still can bring it to food one way or another.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.720
I know. And now we have scones.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.600
I brought black court scones.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.280
And tomorrow, you know what the best thing about Easter is? I don't care if you celebrate

02:55.280 --> 03:01.360
Easter or not. We can all celebrate in 4-21 tomorrow, which is going to be the day that

03:01.360 --> 03:05.320
all the candy is like 75% off. That's universal, people.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.760
I can't eat any of it.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.280
Last year, that was 4-20 and that's appropriate.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.560
Yes, much better.

03:11.560 --> 03:19.320
Because I have decided that now that my birthday is over and I'm feeling old and sore from

03:19.400 --> 03:24.320
walking all over San Francisco yesterday, that I'm going to wake up early tomorrow and

03:24.320 --> 03:26.720
do yoga and go to the gym.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.360
You're going to start off this new year of your life in all the right ways?

03:30.360 --> 03:34.320
Well, yeah. Well, I was doing that before, but then work was kicking my butt. So now

03:34.320 --> 03:38.400
that I'm used to my work schedule and got my vitamins all sorted out and starting to

03:38.400 --> 03:40.320
feel okay again, I'm going back to the gym.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
There you go.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.120
I submitted the measurements for my cosplays for GamerX.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.280
Oh, you are going to be doing the cosplays.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
Which is another motivation.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.280
Nice, nice.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.520
Did you make it a couple inches less so that way you'd be like, I waited until I was super

03:52.520 --> 03:57.720
bloated because my costumes have to be loose anyway because they're Homestuck costumes.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
Oh, okay.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
Gotcha.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.200
Go to our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.720
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

04:06.720 --> 04:08.680
vog network.com.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.880
We have some comments in our chat room here.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
Let's see.

04:12.880 --> 04:19.240
Kaijuto is starting us off tonight saying, O-L-R becomes O-L-D. Oh, that's like a sitcom

04:19.240 --> 04:20.440
in the works or something.

04:20.440 --> 04:25.160
And I'm just sitting here going becomes.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.160
Just wait.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.400
The older we get, the older you're getting too.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
That's right.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.200
How long have you been listening?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.360
Also, let's see.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.280
Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf not only says congrats on surviving another year, Jamie,

04:36.280 --> 04:38.320
but he also says Flaco is there.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.520
Did you buy a UPS yet?

04:40.520 --> 04:43.280
Now for those that don't catch the joke, the last time Flaco was on the show, actually

04:43.280 --> 04:46.280
it was two times ago because I think the last time you were here, everything was fine.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.560
Two times ago, the power went out mid show and that was like a lost episode because of

04:49.560 --> 04:50.560
it.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.560
Yes.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.560
It's a legendary episode now.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.560
That's how I like to look at it.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.560
Yeah, it is.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.680
You were on a deleted scene like me on RuPaul's Drag Race.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.800
I was on a deleted scene.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
It was so good.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.720
It was so much better than the next time I was on.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.080
Wait a minute.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
I was better.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.760
I mean, I was better the first time.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.000
My stories didn't come back as good the second time.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, you're always.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I was trying to recall.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's going so well.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
All right.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.240
Well, I do have some kickoff topics I want to get into, but since Dark Soccer brought

05:15.240 --> 05:19.760
up her birthday, I figured now was a good time to do a present.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.000
Y'all ready for a present?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I like presents.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.440
Now I don't rap, so I just put it here in this little thing.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.200
So I'm going to just open it for Dark Soccer right now.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
Sing for me.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.200
Flaco, you need to do commentary because I got to put the mic down.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.760
Oh, Rob is putting the mic down and now he's going to unzip Dark Soccer's present.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.240
I don't know how else to put it.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.200
Which is at crotch level.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.480
It is in a box.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
Here it is.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
He's presenting it.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.480
This sounds really bad.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
And oh, she squealed.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.240
I'm sure you heard that.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.240
What is that?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.240
Bravely default.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.440
I'm going to play the shit out of this because now I'm going with Animal Crossing.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.440
There it is.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
That's what she said.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
I was all intent.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.160
I was going to go to the store and get her that Disney game, but then last week she said,

06:04.160 --> 06:05.160
I'd rather have Bravely Default.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.800
And I'm like, all right.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.200
Bravely Default is a great game.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.120
So there you go.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.880
And I could see Dark Soccer as being somebody that's really going to get into the story

06:13.880 --> 06:20.120
and the characters and stuff because she likes to get into games that have story.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
It's wrapped, Rob.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
She's unwrapping it right now.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.640
I'm shrink wrapping it right now.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.200
Rob shrink-wrapped it all himself.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
Shush.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
Love.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
And Dan ordered me my present.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.440
So I have my present coming from Dan.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.200
And then I bought myself a whole bunch of presents.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.200
Nice.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
Because I was at Sakura Monster.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
I got myself a bunch of art supplies.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.200
Nobody got you that though, right?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
No.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
I bought me an iPhone 5S.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
Oh, sweet.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.200
Because it's about time.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
Right.

06:43.200 --> 06:49.120
And I'm not going to reveal where my husband is employed at either in case people are listening

06:49.120 --> 07:00.680
and because I also, so I'm going to say that Dan works at the land of, what should I say?

07:00.680 --> 07:07.360
He works at the land of reps in service.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.360
So Loras.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
Loras.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.360
Okay.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.360
Dan works at Loras and I work at Locat.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
Okay.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
You got it.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
All right.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.200
All Homestuck references, by the way.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.840
Going over to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.600
Eric RPG says, that Disney game is meh anyway.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.680
I don't know.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.440
I thought Dark Sakura might have got a kick out of it because Animal Crossing meets Disney,

07:26.440 --> 07:27.440
but you know what?

07:27.440 --> 07:28.440
Bradley default's awesome too.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.320
I want to play the Tomodachi game.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.320
Oh yeah.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.480
Well, that's not out till June.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.320
So you'll have to wait for Christmas or something, Monica.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.160
I street past so many freaking people at Sakura Matsuri.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
Tell us about your trip.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.780
You want to, cause you know, a lot of nerds in the Bay area go to this.

07:46.780 --> 07:49.560
You went to Sakura Matsuri yesterday in San Francisco, right?

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
Yep.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.560
The Cherry Blossom Festival.

07:51.560 --> 07:59.160
And if people want to see some of my pictures, if you go to kurotsubasa.tumblr.com, I have

07:59.160 --> 08:06.640
some pictures I took, including a panoramic of the Peace Pagoda Plaza over at Japantown

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
or Nihonmachi.

08:08.640 --> 08:13.160
At any rate, there were, there was some cosplay.

08:13.160 --> 08:19.520
There were some good cosplay that I found a really good Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin.

08:19.520 --> 08:24.160
I found a few others and then I found like some honestly kind of half-assed cosplay.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.360
Like it was an afterthought.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.680
I'm not saying anything about the cosplayers.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.320
You know, if you don't want to cosplay all the way, that's fine, but you know, don't

08:31.320 --> 08:38.760
think you're hot shit if you know your costume's not all the way put together.

08:38.760 --> 08:45.440
I ran into some really nice people just wandering around, talked to a few people, and then I

08:45.440 --> 08:46.760
found more homestucks.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.160
Okay, because it was my birthday, I decided to wear my Aradia shirt, which is basically

08:51.160 --> 08:53.860
big red Aries on a black shirt.

08:53.860 --> 08:58.380
As I was walking down the hall, I found a person wearing the Terezi shirt, which is

08:58.380 --> 08:59.380
a Libra.

08:59.380 --> 09:03.780
And we're like, oh, one of us and you know, then I ran into someone wearing a Hero of

09:03.780 --> 09:06.300
Space shirt at Daiso.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.260
And then she's like, yeah, I found a couple other people too.

09:08.260 --> 09:13.460
So we have some representation, which we are an invasive species, but we're good.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
I have no idea what any of that means, but that's cool.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.020
Well, these people know what it means.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.220
Did you get to go to that arcade that they have in the little...

09:21.220 --> 09:22.220
It was busy.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.220
I didn't want to go.

09:23.660 --> 09:28.740
And I mean, the whole place was just like all over, but we went to where they were doing

09:28.740 --> 09:29.940
the food booth.

09:29.940 --> 09:36.900
And I was very disappointed because I wanted to have a takoyaki, because that's like my

09:36.900 --> 09:40.660
big thing when I go to Sakuramatsuri is I have to have takoyaki.

09:40.660 --> 09:47.620
And they made it, it wasn't takoyaki, it was like beef inside it instead of octopus.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.620
So I was like, well, screw that.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.380
So I had unagi don and it was delicious.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.340
Did you get a crepe?

09:54.340 --> 09:55.700
Because they have some great crepes there too.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.340
Great place.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.940
Sophie's Crepes was like way busy.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.380
I just didn't bother.

09:59.380 --> 10:06.020
But I did buy some art supplies because there's certain ones that I can't get locally.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.180
I had to go to Kinokaniya.

10:08.180 --> 10:12.260
And what else did we do?

10:12.260 --> 10:14.900
Because I actually went and bought...

10:14.900 --> 10:19.460
Because I mean, now that I'm older, I was always interested in Japanese culture just

10:19.460 --> 10:21.060
from having been a Japanese major.

10:21.060 --> 10:25.380
And I sort of grew out of my whole anime fangirl-ness.

10:25.380 --> 10:30.580
And I use grow out of in quote-y fingers just because I'm not as interested in a lot of

10:30.580 --> 10:32.820
stuff because it's geared toward teenagers.

10:32.820 --> 10:35.700
It's not really my thing, except I totally love Kill la Kill right now.

10:36.260 --> 10:36.900
Totally awesome.

10:37.940 --> 10:41.860
But I really have been trying to focus more on my art.

10:41.860 --> 10:47.620
So this time I went around and looked at different types of papers and looked at textiles.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.660
And I bought myself...

10:49.940 --> 10:55.060
It's a huroshiki, which is like a wrapping cloth, but I got one with cats on it.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.420
And I hang it in my cube.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.140
It was really cute.

10:57.700 --> 11:04.180
And basically my point around this time was just to find different things that I thought

11:04.180 --> 11:05.140
would stimulate me.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.140
Not in that way.

11:09.140 --> 11:10.660
Oh, it's that kind of birthday, huh?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.340
As an artist.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.580
And so that was really...

11:16.660 --> 11:17.620
We watched some dances.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.020
We watched...

11:20.820 --> 11:24.020
There was a big Taigo presentation, which was pretty awesome.

11:24.020 --> 11:24.660
Nice.

11:24.660 --> 11:29.860
And then I got stuff for my desk and stuff and things.

11:29.860 --> 11:30.980
Well, sounds like you had a good day.

11:30.980 --> 11:34.500
And let's see my friend Tamara over on Clement Street.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.660
She was working for a clothing designer.

11:37.380 --> 11:41.300
So I got to really check out some home done textiles and everything.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.260
Well, happy birthday once again from all of us here at OLR to you.

11:44.260 --> 11:44.580
Thank you.

11:45.540 --> 11:50.660
And I hope you get more presents before the week's up, because some birthdays tend to

11:50.660 --> 11:52.420
go all week, so you never know what might happen.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.260
So all right.

11:54.260 --> 12:00.020
If the OLR listeners want to send you a taco or something, because I have had people come

12:00.020 --> 12:02.100
to me saying, how can I send Jamie a taco?

12:02.100 --> 12:03.620
I want to make Jamie happy for her birthday.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.060
How can I send her a taco?

12:05.060 --> 12:08.900
So I'll tell you what, if you want to make me happy, this is what you can do.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.420
You can send me money.

12:11.700 --> 12:12.340
No, I'm kidding.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.580
What I actually, if you want to make me happy, I want to send her a money taco.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.060
This is what I want you to do.

12:19.060 --> 12:26.660
I want you to find a local animal rescue and give them some cat food or adopt a cat and

12:26.660 --> 12:29.060
send me a picture of the cat that you adopted.

12:29.060 --> 12:34.340
Oh, that's what I want you to do for my birthday is to adopt a cat or to at least donate food

12:34.340 --> 12:36.020
to because some people are allergic to cats.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.140
So to animal rescues because they need it.

12:39.140 --> 12:44.660
The people who foster the cats need food and it keeps, it keeps from, you know, killing

12:44.660 --> 12:45.220
an animal.

12:45.220 --> 12:47.540
That's only fault is that it just was homeless.

12:48.580 --> 12:49.140
Well, you know what?

12:49.140 --> 12:51.620
That is, that is one thing better than a taco is cats.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.220
Yeah, there you go.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.100
Sounds wrong, Rob.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.660
I didn't mean to eat the cat.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.260
Let the cat eat the taco.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.540
I just didn't think you were into pussy.

13:01.140 --> 13:05.620
But anyway, on a serious note, I can always make an exception, dark soccer.

13:06.580 --> 13:13.940
I adopted Midna and I would really like to see, you know, more people give, especially

13:13.940 --> 13:15.780
older cats, give older cats a chance.

13:15.780 --> 13:16.260
That's great.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.380
Well, taking it back to video games a little bit, since we are a video game podcast, I

13:21.380 --> 13:24.340
want to talk here a little bit on our kickoff topic about some things going on.

13:24.340 --> 13:28.980
And I want to talk to Flaco a little bit too, because Flaco, you know, you've, you've still

13:28.980 --> 13:31.220
been playing quite a few games since the last time we talked to you.

13:31.220 --> 13:34.340
And I know you're mostly a gamer on the Sony platforms, right?

13:34.980 --> 13:35.860
Yes, I am.

13:36.660 --> 13:41.300
I recently got a PS4 like a couple months ago, and I really enjoy it.

13:41.300 --> 13:44.260
Played all of the games you get with PlayStation Plus.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.340
But, and I guess, I don't know if you know this, or not a lot of my friends might know

13:48.340 --> 13:51.940
this, but I bought my wife a Wii U for her birthday.

13:51.940 --> 13:55.780
I do because you were telling me to add her on the Wii U thing.

13:55.780 --> 13:56.180
Yeah, that's right.

13:56.180 --> 14:01.060
I still haven't done it because you'll see my Wii U is still not hooked up from the move.

14:01.380 --> 14:04.500
But I found her really, if you really want to, I guess you could.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.220
I do really want to, because we want to play Wind Waker HD.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.060
That's exactly the reason I got it though.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.900
Because Wind Waker, but sure.

14:11.780 --> 14:15.140
If you want to run it or something, yourself, I don't know.

14:15.140 --> 14:15.940
It's worth it.

14:15.940 --> 14:16.580
But that's the game.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.740
It's my wife's favorite game ever is Wind Waker.

14:18.740 --> 14:22.740
And I found a really good deal on the Wind Waker HD bundle and I got it.

14:22.740 --> 14:23.860
And it was like an amazing deal.

14:23.860 --> 14:29.460
It was used, but the little game pad that has the Triforce stuff.

14:29.460 --> 14:29.940
Yes.

14:29.940 --> 14:30.660
She loves it.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.620
My wife loves it.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.740
She went crazy for it.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.820
So she's been playing that pretty much nonstop and I've been helping her when she gets stuck

14:36.820 --> 14:38.500
and it's been really fun.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.780
And the kids love it too.

14:39.780 --> 14:44.420
Like my son just gets a kick whenever, uh, Link does like the different, uh, melodies,

14:44.420 --> 14:47.380
you know, with the Wind Waker, he does a little conducting or whatever.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.860
Uh, my son like hums along with it and it's really awesome.

14:50.420 --> 14:54.740
So that is so precious hearing how the whole family gets involved in gaming.

14:54.740 --> 14:55.780
Oh, it's so adorable.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.220
I just want to hug you all.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.380
I mean, that's such a good news story, right?

14:59.380 --> 15:02.980
So why, why does Nintendo keep flopping in the eyes of the game?

15:02.980 --> 15:04.820
I mean, obviously sales are sales.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.420
They're not selling as many as competitors.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.540
That's just, you know, the way it is.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.380
But why, why is Wii U flopping when you have such positive things to say about it, you

15:11.380 --> 15:11.940
think?

15:11.940 --> 15:14.340
I, cause there's really not that much to play on it.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.660
Like, I don't know what she's going to do when she's done with Wind Waker.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.900
Mario Kart 8 will be out maybe.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.260
She's not a big Mario Kart fan.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.060
I want to play it though.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.540
So we might rent it first and see if we both like it.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.380
I see, I play, I play more on the PlayStation.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.540
So, and I have a Vita too.

15:27.540 --> 15:28.980
She got me a Vita for Christmas.

15:29.380 --> 15:33.780
So I had to try to top that and get her a Wii U for her birthday.

15:33.780 --> 15:35.220
And I got the PS4 just out of the blue.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.180
I thought it was a family thing.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.620
She's like, Oh no, that's your system.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.260
I don't want to play that.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.700
It was like, Oh, well I feel really bad.

15:39.700 --> 15:40.980
Well, let me get you a Wii U.

15:40.980 --> 15:45.940
So at least you guys, at least you guys can watch the PlayStation live together and enjoy

15:45.940 --> 15:48.100
the people showing their titties and their dongs.

15:48.100 --> 15:48.580
We did that.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.660
We didn't see any of the racy stuff.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.540
I mean, somewhat racy stuff, but nothing, no nudity.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.660
We didn't see the night we were just perusing that we had friends over.

15:56.660 --> 15:56.900
Of course.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.460
So what do you do?

15:57.460 --> 15:58.500
You turn on play room.

15:58.500 --> 15:58.900
Right.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.180
Or PlayStation live.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.580
Look at the playroom streams and see how ridiculous it is.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.060
So, uh, but yeah, nothing too crazy.

16:05.060 --> 16:09.780
Just a lot of like, really like poor living room setups.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.780
I would say really depressing.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.860
Like, Oh, it's so dirty in your living room.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.540
Clean up your house.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.460
That's one big reason I don't do the play.

16:19.460 --> 16:22.980
When you do, when you do the streams on like Final Fantasy 14, which I have streamed on

16:22.980 --> 16:26.500
Twitch, your head's in a little box that they can't see anything about my little head in

16:26.500 --> 16:26.980
a box.

16:26.980 --> 16:27.700
That's that's nice.

16:27.700 --> 16:28.500
That's enough.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.940
That's all we need to see.

16:29.940 --> 16:30.500
That's all you need.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.260
But playroom, it's in those poor robots.

16:32.260 --> 16:34.100
I feel bad for those poor robots.

16:34.100 --> 16:37.620
They had to sit there and look at all that terrible debauchery going on and they look

16:37.620 --> 16:38.580
so shocked sometimes.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.220
What were you going to say to our Sakura?

16:41.220 --> 16:41.940
Nothing.

16:41.940 --> 16:42.340
Nothing.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.260
Nevermind.

16:44.260 --> 16:44.900
Bad for the robots.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.940
What have you been playing on your, on your console, the PS4?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.100
On the PS4, I've been playing mostly don't starve.

16:50.660 --> 16:53.940
And, uh, again, for the kids, Lego Marvel superheroes.

16:53.940 --> 16:54.820
But yeah, don't starve.

16:54.820 --> 16:58.100
I've really, I really got into, it's one of the reasons I really wanted the PS4.

16:58.500 --> 17:03.060
I went to extra for his house and he has a PS4 and I, that had just come out and he's

17:03.060 --> 17:04.180
like, it's okay.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.820
But you could have bought that for like $7 on steam.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.820
Well, I'm glad I didn't cause my PC's broken now.

17:08.820 --> 17:13.140
So like all the other games I bought on steam, I can't play it now.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.460
Touche, but no, I love it.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.460
I just, I like controllers better anyway.

17:17.460 --> 17:20.020
So, uh, I've really enjoyed that game.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.860
I put a lot of time into it.

17:21.860 --> 17:26.420
I'm not, I'm not very good at it, but I finally got to adventure mode, which to get to adventure

17:26.820 --> 17:27.620
mode and don't starve.

17:27.620 --> 17:33.060
You have to play the regular survival mode and then you have to find a door randomly

17:33.060 --> 17:35.700
as you're surviving and kind of exploring.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.340
So I just made it, made it my mission to just explore.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.860
I just go out and try to find this stupid door that I could never find cause I'd always

17:41.860 --> 17:42.740
die before I found it.

17:42.740 --> 17:43.620
Mm hmm.

17:43.620 --> 17:44.100
Cause I finally found it.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.060
Is that the one that goes into the caves?

17:45.700 --> 17:49.540
No, no, that's a, that's if you go into a, if you dig up a grave, I think you can go,

17:49.540 --> 17:51.860
or you can spelunk and you can go down there.

17:51.860 --> 17:55.620
I didn't do, I've only done a little bit of that, but no, this is, it's a giant door.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.900
It looks like a door to hell and it's like, do you want to go inside?

17:58.900 --> 18:03.300
And when you do, max, the villain, I guess that the game shows up and he's like, uh,

18:03.300 --> 18:07.140
if you can survive five worlds, you know, you can find my door and find me.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.500
That's how you beat it, I guess.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.300
Oh, I had no idea.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.820
There's like a, there's like a story mode in there, but unfortunately to, to, to get

18:14.820 --> 18:18.660
in there, you have to find it first in the regular, but you kind of have to make it your

18:18.660 --> 18:19.540
mission to find the door.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.460
What's cool is once you find the door, whenever you die doing the five doors thing, you don't

18:23.460 --> 18:25.060
go back to, you know, nothing.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.860
You go back to the point you first found the door.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.580
So that now is my save file for adventure mode.

18:30.580 --> 18:34.100
And then if I ever want to play the game, survival style, just create another, another

18:34.100 --> 18:35.220
new, new, new game.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.020
And I just do that.

18:36.020 --> 18:36.740
So, okay.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.700
It's been really fun.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.300
I learned something about don't starve.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.860
Yeah, there's, there's a hidden like story mode, I guess.

18:41.860 --> 18:42.900
So awesome.

18:42.900 --> 18:46.420
And it being PlayStation plus, I'm sure you, you're snatching up all those free games.

18:46.420 --> 18:46.660
Like what?

18:46.660 --> 18:48.180
Mercenary Kings this month.

18:48.180 --> 18:48.500
Yeah.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.620
I had trouble playing mercenary Kings, so I haven't really got into that yet.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.060
It's like press down to fix something up.

18:53.060 --> 18:53.620
I pressed down.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.420
I couldn't pick it up.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.500
I don't know if it's because it's playing on the inventory is full.

18:57.300 --> 18:57.860
Is that why?

18:57.860 --> 18:58.020
Yeah.

18:58.020 --> 18:58.980
That's what I learned first.

18:58.980 --> 19:01.540
You can only hold like one or two things in the beginning.

19:01.540 --> 19:01.940
Wow.

19:01.940 --> 19:02.180
Okay.

19:02.180 --> 19:02.980
Well, that's my problem.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.540
I can't get past the very, it's like, put some C-shirt in this door.

19:05.540 --> 19:05.780
Sure.

19:05.780 --> 19:06.260
Something with me.

19:06.260 --> 19:07.540
I sure there we go.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.300
I was like, well, this game, I can't play.

19:09.300 --> 19:09.940
I thought it was a bug.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.300
Like I'm playing on the VITA.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.220
I do a lot of remote play on my VITA.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.740
And so I was like, well, maybe it's some VITA bug where it's not registering me pressing

19:16.740 --> 19:17.140
down.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.420
Like I'm like squatting.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.860
I'm like, I'm not putting this C4 down.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.900
Like it says I'm supposed to.

19:20.900 --> 19:21.300
Yeah.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.060
So I, or picking it up.

19:23.060 --> 19:23.540
I don't know.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.500
It's you have to use the C4 you already have, and then you can pick up the other one.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.460
I see.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.100
Well, there you go.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.260
So I'm stuck on that, but yeah, we played outlast.

19:30.260 --> 19:31.220
That was pretty awesome.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.500
I've only, we're halfway through it.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.980
We stopped cause we had some friends over and we're like, let's play through this.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.460
And we got through halfway and it's like, well, we have to go home.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.980
Like, oh, you don't want to stay up till two in the morning.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.220
But so yeah, we didn't finish that.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.700
But I really like, I really liked that game so far too.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.740
And again, I know it's a PC game, but I don't really have a workable PC.

19:46.740 --> 19:49.300
So I've enjoyed playing on the PS4.

19:49.300 --> 19:53.300
Um, besides just talking about what you've been playing on Sony recently, I wanted to

19:53.300 --> 19:56.260
use this as an opportunity to talk about this too, because I'm sure some of our chatters

19:56.260 --> 19:57.540
want to bring this up as well.

19:57.540 --> 20:01.380
But speaking of all the Sony stuff going on, I'm sure you heard about that insane sale

20:01.380 --> 20:06.020
they're having this weekend where they're, you know, they're giving steam a little competition

20:06.020 --> 20:09.380
with this whole deep discounting 99 cents for what?

20:09.380 --> 20:10.020
30 games.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.660
I think they have on sale for 99, 30 or 34, something like that.

20:12.660 --> 20:13.540
34, 35.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.660
And, you know, obviously you're not going to get anything new, new, and it's not just

20:16.660 --> 20:17.300
PS Plus.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.500
That was the other surprising thing.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.740
I thought for sure it was going to be PlayStation Plus only, but it's not.

20:20.740 --> 20:21.460
It's for everybody.

20:21.460 --> 20:22.900
Should be 50 cents for PS Plus.

20:23.780 --> 20:24.420
I'm greedy.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.740
Um, but, uh, yeah, I'm just really surprised.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.500
Now you've got some stuff that's like really old.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.940
You got some classics in there, like Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.060
But like, those are games I really remember from PS One.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.460
So I was like, oh, for 99 cents, shit, I'll pick it up again.

20:37.460 --> 20:38.340
So I can play it on the Vita.

20:38.340 --> 20:38.740
Why not?

20:38.740 --> 20:39.300
Right.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.060
But then there's some stuff that's only a couple of years old, like Telltale has quite

20:43.060 --> 20:46.580
a few things like the Jurassic Park game, Back to the Future.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.820
And it's not just like one episode for 99 cents.

20:48.820 --> 20:51.140
It's all four or five episodes for 99 cents.

20:51.140 --> 20:52.580
That's a really good deal.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.300
So if you are a PlayStation owner, I think the sale is only good through Monday at 7

20:57.300 --> 20:57.940
a.m.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.340
So if you're listening live, go get them.

21:00.340 --> 21:04.260
If you're listening on the podcast, sorry, you missed it because it's over now.

21:04.260 --> 21:07.940
I still haven't downloaded one of them, but I was really considering Jurassic Park.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.180
That's that's the main one.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.380
Well, I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

21:11.380 --> 21:11.860
All right.

21:11.860 --> 21:12.340
I did buy it.

21:14.340 --> 21:14.820
So you have it.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.700
You haven't taken advantage.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.620
I haven't taken advantage of it because like you said, mostly.

21:17.620 --> 21:22.020
Well, the other problem is I have a huge backlog on my PS3 and my PS3 is in the bedroom now.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.580
It got moved once the Wii U joined the...

21:25.140 --> 21:26.420
You had to play the same game I did.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.220
Who ultimately gets to stay on the TV.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.700
And it could have stayed out in the living room, but it's like, it'd be nice to have

21:31.700 --> 21:34.740
a thing in the bedroom to finally watch, you know, Netflix and stuff in the bedroom.

21:34.740 --> 21:39.220
So we moved it back there and I still have to play the Bioshock Infinite DLC.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.140
I had to play the Last of Us DLC extra.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.500
Let me borrow his game so I can do that.

21:42.500 --> 21:49.220
I saw South Park to play and I have, you know, the PlayStation 3, you know, the PS Plus games.

21:49.220 --> 21:49.540
Yeah.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.300
I wanted I really like remember me.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.340
I'm like halfway through that.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.500
I think there's too much to play.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.540
It is like a steam thing now where it's and it's another reason I'm not too sad.

21:57.540 --> 22:00.340
My computer broke because I'm like, well, I've got enough to play already.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.660
So I guess I guess I can just play my console stuff.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.180
Who needs Microsoft Word?

22:04.180 --> 22:05.300
I've got video games to play.

22:05.300 --> 22:05.860
There you go.

22:05.860 --> 22:06.900
Who needs that?

22:06.900 --> 22:07.780
I don't need an internet.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.500
I have a 10 year old computer I can do Microsoft Word with, but I can't game on it.

22:11.300 --> 22:14.020
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

22:14.020 --> 22:17.620
SSJ100Matt says, I actually didn't know about this sale until just now.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.220
BRB buying all the things.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.500
We helped one person out.

22:20.500 --> 22:20.980
Hooray.

22:20.980 --> 22:22.740
I feel, I feel a lot better here at OLR.

22:23.460 --> 22:23.860
Let's see.

22:23.860 --> 22:26.020
Gamer girl says plants versus zombies.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.540
I'm thinking that's something she picked up.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.580
That looks like a good one.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.860
But again, I meant to check.

22:29.860 --> 22:33.540
Is that on the Vita or is that just on the, I don't think that's on the Vita.

22:33.540 --> 22:34.580
I think that's just the PS3.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.020
I think that's only PS3.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.020
I want to say the Vita one was a plus game.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.140
Sometimes it was, but it was before I got the subscription.

22:41.140 --> 22:44.900
Sadly, cause I actually, well, I'll get in that later, but all right.

22:44.900 --> 22:45.780
Gaming week stuff.

22:45.780 --> 22:46.340
I don't know.

22:46.340 --> 22:46.820
That's fine.

22:46.820 --> 22:47.460
That's fine.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.180
Uh, let's see.

22:48.180 --> 22:52.580
Dungeon buster says retro city rampage is 99 cents and steam marked it down to the same

22:52.580 --> 22:53.080
price.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.460
So, Oh, a little, little comment.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.180
And that's a good one.

22:56.180 --> 23:00.900
If you haven't checked that out, extra for, uh, your brother-in-law, uh, co-star of a

23:00.900 --> 23:03.460
hoard house Wednesday nights on the network loves that game.

23:04.420 --> 23:05.140
Talks a lot about that.

23:05.140 --> 23:05.460
No way.

23:05.460 --> 23:06.500
I'm getting mixed up with hotline.

23:06.500 --> 23:06.980
Miami.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.700
Oh, nevermind.

23:07.700 --> 23:08.260
I'm sorry.

23:08.260 --> 23:11.540
I was like, I've heard good things about our just city ravages, but yeah, I know he loves

23:11.540 --> 23:11.860
hot love.

23:11.860 --> 23:12.420
No, it's Holly.

23:12.420 --> 23:12.740
Miami.

23:12.740 --> 23:13.700
I was thinking of, nevermind.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.660
That was already free anyway.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.620
We'll just, we'll make it up and say extra for likes a retro city ramp.

23:17.620 --> 23:18.900
I bet he would, if he played it.

23:20.820 --> 23:22.260
Loki likes our diversity rampage.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.100
Uh, nice.

23:24.100 --> 23:24.660
Not to buy it.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.900
Tokyo jungle is the other one that, but again, that sounds like a huge time sink and I'm

23:28.900 --> 23:32.420
like, I don't, I paid $15 for that stupid game.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.620
No, actually Tokyo jungle.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.340
Here's the thing about that.

23:34.340 --> 23:38.820
It plays a lot like an arcade game to me where, and if you play it in little chunks, like

23:38.820 --> 23:45.300
every time you play and die within five minutes, you're still getting, you're still investing

23:45.300 --> 23:50.100
in your save that you can use to buy more animals or do progress in the story a little

23:50.100 --> 23:50.740
more later on.

23:50.740 --> 23:54.100
Like you don't get very far each time until you kind of build.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.500
It's one of those games you build on each death.

23:56.580 --> 24:01.140
Uh, it's a lot like, what the hell is that game where you're in the castle?

24:01.140 --> 24:02.180
It's like Castlevania.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.260
Uh, God damn it slipped my mind.

24:06.260 --> 24:07.620
I used to play this game a lot.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.660
Jason's a big fan of it.

24:08.660 --> 24:08.820
I know.

24:09.860 --> 24:10.900
No, I don't know.

24:10.900 --> 24:11.780
I've never played that.

24:11.780 --> 24:14.340
It's the one where you play the descendants of all the characters.

24:14.340 --> 24:15.060
Magica.

24:15.060 --> 24:16.100
Why is it?

24:16.100 --> 24:18.580
No, no idea.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.380
Somebody will yell it out in chat in two seconds here.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.340
Then I'll feel stupid.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.740
Oh, I can't.

24:24.740 --> 24:29.540
I remember the name of the damn game because you're old and the castle shuffles each time

24:29.540 --> 24:30.020
you play.

24:31.380 --> 24:31.860
Shut up.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.300
You're the one that had a birthday.

24:33.300 --> 24:33.940
I don't know why.

24:33.940 --> 24:34.340
I don't know.

24:37.140 --> 24:37.700
Thank you.

24:37.700 --> 24:38.260
Rogue leg.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.060
Okay.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.100
Alan just popped in.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.220
Alan saved me again.

24:43.220 --> 24:43.460
Yes.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.580
It was rogue legacy.

24:44.580 --> 24:45.300
Thank you, Alan.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.380
And Jason just yelled it out in chat too.

24:47.380 --> 24:47.940
Like that.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.380
I don't even remember why I was bringing that game up now.

24:51.380 --> 24:51.780
All right.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.340
Let's talk about Tokyo jungle.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.700
That's why.

24:55.700 --> 24:55.940
Yeah.

24:55.940 --> 24:58.020
Tokyo jungle is a great for 99 cents.

24:58.020 --> 24:58.580
Heck yeah.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.700
If you got to go, if you're listening to my life, you got to go get it.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.620
Just it's 99 cents.

25:03.620 --> 25:08.180
Like, you know, the other cool thing about Tokyo jungle is it is one of the very few

25:08.180 --> 25:10.500
PS3 games that works with Vita remote play.

25:11.140 --> 25:11.940
That's right.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.220
The very, very few.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.100
And they look ugly.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.140
I looked, I played Pagle.

25:15.140 --> 25:15.700
I have Pagle.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.100
Pagle nights on PS3.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.660
It plays with Vita remote play and it looks terrible.

25:20.660 --> 25:23.060
Nothing like what the PS4 games look like.

25:23.060 --> 25:26.660
Well, PSP had remote play a little bit too, but yeah, I never had one of those.

25:26.660 --> 25:27.620
There was so few.

25:28.180 --> 25:31.780
Like it worked with the minis and the PS1 and the PS1 games.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.020
And you could do some of the video streaming and that stuff too.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.460
That all existed on the PSP, but it was just one of those features nobody really talked

25:37.460 --> 25:37.700
about.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.740
But I remember going like, why isn't Sony doing more with this?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.260
Because this technology is awesome.

25:42.260 --> 25:45.300
Well, even the PS3, they didn't do that with the PS3 and the Vita.

25:45.300 --> 25:48.420
Maybe it's because they're working on the PS4, but Oh, and the other thing I wanted to

25:48.420 --> 25:52.500
tell you, you got Spyro and Crash Bandicoot, but I believe those don't work on the Vita

25:52.500 --> 25:53.220
remote play.

25:53.220 --> 25:53.780
What?

25:53.780 --> 25:54.580
I know.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.540
Oh crap.

25:55.540 --> 25:56.420
Or not even remote play.

25:56.420 --> 25:59.620
I just mean like, you know, I guess cross play, whatever you call it, like it worked

25:59.620 --> 26:00.420
on both platforms.

26:00.420 --> 26:04.100
Those are some of the few titles that aren't compatible for some reason.

26:04.100 --> 26:04.900
It's part of the reason.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.340
I know that's one of the reasons I wanted to get them.

26:06.340 --> 26:09.140
I saw in the comments, everybody's like, Oh, why won't you make this work on Vita?

26:09.140 --> 26:10.180
But maybe they will eventually.

26:10.180 --> 26:12.260
Oh, well, at least it was only two bucks.

26:13.860 --> 26:16.260
I thought the same thing like, Oh, that'd be great to play on my Vita.

26:16.260 --> 26:20.740
And then I read all the people in the comments saying, uh, it would be nice if these actually

26:20.740 --> 26:22.900
worked on Vita, but it's not on the compatibility list.

26:23.300 --> 26:26.900
I'm hoping maybe with all that PlayStation Now stuff in the future too, that putting

26:26.900 --> 26:30.900
those games in my library, when PlayStation Now is out, will let me, I'm hoping, I mean,

26:30.900 --> 26:33.460
they haven't really said, oh, that's all going to work yet, but I'm hoping that maybe

26:33.460 --> 26:36.900
flagging those games as purchased will enable it in PlayStation Now down there.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.220
I think if you got it digitally, they should do that, but you never know.

26:39.220 --> 26:39.860
Yeah, you never know.

26:39.860 --> 26:40.580
You really don't.

26:40.580 --> 26:44.340
I mean, then there's this whole debacle with The Last of Us on PlayStation 4 when it just

26:44.340 --> 26:45.860
was out, but we'll talk about that later.

26:46.740 --> 26:50.020
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about our frame of reference, the types of stuff

26:50.100 --> 26:51.780
that we have been playing this week.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.660
Dark Sakura, what have you been up to on your birthday week?

26:54.660 --> 26:56.020
Um, Animal Crossing.

26:56.580 --> 27:01.780
Um, I got a game called Kami, uh, which is like an origami based puzzle game.

27:01.780 --> 27:02.420
It's kind of neat.

27:03.220 --> 27:09.140
Um, played to Mass Effect because I've got my mods working again and my shepherd looks

27:09.140 --> 27:09.620
awesome.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.620
I can't wait to play Mass Effect 3 on my new PC.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.100
Did I talk about that on this show yet?

27:16.100 --> 27:17.460
I talked about it on Bobby's show, but not here.

27:18.100 --> 27:21.140
Uh, Alan built me a new PC yesterday, so happy me.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.060
They make a dude mods.

27:23.860 --> 27:24.420
Oh yeah.

27:24.420 --> 27:25.780
There's some good ones out there too.

27:25.780 --> 27:30.580
There's also, um, someone did a, a version that you can use Caden's hair.

27:31.300 --> 27:31.800
Okay.

27:32.580 --> 27:36.580
Um, and someone made a, uh, a front curl mohawk.

27:36.580 --> 27:37.860
That's actually kind of cool looking.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.620
Did you see, uh, pics of the cosplay from PAX East with the, did we talk about this

27:41.620 --> 27:42.260
this week?

27:42.260 --> 27:42.900
Yes, we did.

27:42.900 --> 27:43.220
Okay.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.180
And he twerked.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.240
Yes.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.040
This is more of those pictures are coming out.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.640
What's the name of my other tumbler?

27:50.520 --> 27:51.320
Mass effecting.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.560
I couldn't remember if we talked about the show.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.160
Yeah, I guess the chat room is right.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.680
I'm having Alzheimer's in my old age.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.880
That's what Raginator says.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.760
Thanks.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.720
Eat more blueberries.

28:02.280 --> 28:02.600
I guess.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.200
Well, that's going to have blueberries in it, right?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.160
No, that was us.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.280
Those were black currants.

28:06.280 --> 28:12.040
God, I think I need more ginkgo blueberries.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.400
Thank God it's not just me.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.840
I was like, those are blueberries, right?

28:15.560 --> 28:16.360
They're really good though.

28:16.360 --> 28:16.840
They're good.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.960
Currants are better than blueberries in my opinion.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.160
And I'm always right.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.400
Are they, are they currently better than blueberries?

28:27.400 --> 28:30.600
But, um, I, uh, I was going to play some fun.

28:30.600 --> 28:36.040
I think I did play a little Final Fantasy 14 this week or I might've, but, um, I'm planning

28:36.040 --> 28:43.560
on, um, assuming that I can get my shift trade on Tuesday, then I will be playing a good

28:43.560 --> 28:45.080
bit of that while I'm trying to stay awake.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.240
If not, then whatever.

28:48.440 --> 28:52.680
But I want, I want any people to run with me and help me level some more.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.680
Let me tag along.

28:55.560 --> 28:55.960
We'll see.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.520
I want to do a Brayflop again.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.320
Wait until you get that one on hard mode.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.840
It's hilarious because the whole dungeon is fighting over cheese.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.040
I want someone to run me through a Brayflop tonight.

29:10.040 --> 29:10.600
There you go.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.480
Well, we'll see.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.760
Maybe I can live stream now.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.440
Cause that's something I can actually do.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.640
I can see how cute I am.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.440
We already know.

29:18.440 --> 29:18.920
I know.

29:18.920 --> 29:23.400
Well, my character's extra cute and her feline adorableness.

29:24.520 --> 29:24.760
All right.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.080
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I'll go over to Flocko.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.280
Bitch I wasn't done.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.880
I'm kidding.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.600
Excuse me.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.640
Go on.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.520
No, no, no, I'm done.

29:32.520 --> 29:32.760
All right.

29:32.760 --> 29:33.160
Flocko.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.360
How was your gaming week?

29:34.360 --> 29:37.320
I had a pretty good gaming week cause I had most of the week off of work.

29:37.320 --> 29:43.000
So I played a lot of Vita games and I played Lego Marvel superheroes on PS4 cause my kids

29:43.000 --> 29:44.120
really liked that.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.640
And it's funny cause my kids like to either stand in front of the TV or if I'm playing

29:47.640 --> 29:50.760
on Vita, they stand, they like lean their heads in front of the Vita, you know, to try

29:50.760 --> 29:51.880
to see everything.

29:51.880 --> 29:56.280
So I actually did the remote play and when you do it on the Vita, you know, it plays

29:56.280 --> 29:57.080
on both at once.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.480
So if they're standing in front of the TV, I just look down on the Vita.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.880
If they're putting their head in front of the Vita, I just look up at the TV and it

30:01.880 --> 30:02.440
worked great.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.960
So they love that game.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.600
It's pretty fun.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.120
I've never played a Lego game before.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.720
And I'd always kind of badmouth them cause like, oh, it is kids games, whatever.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.240
But it's actually really fun.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.680
And it's, there's a lot of cool like inside jokes.

30:16.680 --> 30:22.920
There's a part where you're like tumbling through a whatever portal to Asgard.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.440
I'm not much of a Marvel guy either.

30:24.440 --> 30:24.760
Sorry.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.720
But you're going through some kind of portal to Asgard.

30:27.720 --> 30:32.440
And as you're like tumbling through a TARDIS, like flies by the other way, like a little

30:32.440 --> 30:33.160
Lego TARDIS.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.280
It was really cute and funny.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.440
So yeah, I played that.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.240
I finally beat little big planet Vita after.

30:39.240 --> 30:39.880
Oh, nice.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.920
Yeah, it was really fun.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.960
They did a really good job.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.720
I had my doubts cause it's not medium molecule that did it, but they actually did probably

30:47.720 --> 30:50.440
one of the better story modes they've ever had in a little big planet game.

30:50.440 --> 30:54.600
I like the mechanic of the pushing the bricks by using the rear touch pad and the front

30:54.600 --> 30:55.080
touch pad.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.680
That was kind of a neat little thing.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.880
Yeah, that was a fun level.

30:57.880 --> 31:02.520
And actually my son played that one with me and I had him like touch the bricks, at least

31:02.520 --> 31:03.400
on the front.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.840
He got pretty good at the back touch too.

31:04.840 --> 31:09.080
He realized when he touched it, at least on the Vita, uh, excuse me, on the, on the

31:09.080 --> 31:11.960
little big planet Vita, as opposed to other games that have back touch, sometimes it gives

31:11.960 --> 31:14.920
you a little indicator, like a cursor where your finger is.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.120
And so he figured that out.

31:16.680 --> 31:21.480
So he was able to really use that to take, hit the blocks for me or kill enemies or I

31:21.480 --> 31:23.000
think there's a level we had to guide missiles.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.160
He did that for me too.

31:25.160 --> 31:25.880
It was really fun.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.400
It was like father son play time.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.640
And we were both sick that week bonding.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.880
You guys are the cutest video games.

31:33.880 --> 31:38.040
He's not great at the control stuff, but you know, in the age of like iPads and on all

31:38.040 --> 31:39.640
that stuff, he loves touch stuff.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.600
So the Vita stuff, he's really been able to get into more than the PS3.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.720
Cause if he has three, he has a hard time with the controls, but touch controls are

31:45.720 --> 31:46.360
so intuitive.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.520
It's like, Oh, I can just put this here.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.200
I realized my fingers moving around and, and yeah, he does a great job with that.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.840
So, so yeah, I played some gravity rush on Vita.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.200
I really love that game.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.320
Almost done with that, I think.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.360
And lots of Wind Waker with my wife playing.

32:01.080 --> 32:01.800
Uh, let's see.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.360
Tiger Claw in chat talking about the Lego thing you're saying.

32:04.360 --> 32:08.600
Tiger Claw says, maybe that's a sign that we can expect Lego, Lego Doctor Who.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.840
And Kaijuta says, Lego, stay away from Doctor Who.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.960
Dark Tetsuya says, I kind of want the Lego movie game.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.840
I heard that one wasn't so good though.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.880
That's they usually get good reviews, but I heard that one didn't get very good reviews

32:21.880 --> 32:28.120
because I feel like it's that, that classic case of a movie marketing game.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.040
It had to come out as the movie release date.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.400
I've heard it's kind of unfinished.

32:31.400 --> 32:31.960
You know what I mean?

32:32.760 --> 32:33.880
Jamie just gasped.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.360
Are you okay?

32:34.360 --> 32:36.520
Cause today is also George Takei's birthday.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.000
Oh, it is?

32:37.000 --> 32:37.560
Oh wow.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.720
So happy birthday to my, uh,

32:39.720 --> 32:40.360
Oh my.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.760
To the man I want to adopt me.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.280
Happy birthday.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.200
Uh, let's see.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.400
Uh, yeah, I'm just thinking about the whole, uh, Lego and Doctor Who thing.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.080
It just makes me think like, do you want me to make every nerd out there cringe right now?

32:53.080 --> 32:53.400
Watch.

32:53.400 --> 32:53.800
Okay.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.280
Watch.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.800
So Lego does a Doctor Who video game and they let Moffat write it.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.560
Sorry.

33:03.560 --> 33:04.120
Sorry.

33:04.120 --> 33:08.280
Look, art as this show is art is to elicit a reaction.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.440
And I just gave a reaction.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.160
I just reacted too.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.520
Jamie showed me her middle finger.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.320
That was the reaction.

33:16.040 --> 33:16.440
All right.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.640
Oh, I did what I did play one PS3 game this week.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.440
And that was the cave.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.680
Cause that's another game of Vaclav that I haven't finished yet.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.120
And I think I'm almost done with that one.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.280
Hey, Jamie says, ew, she hates the cave.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.120
No, no, no, no.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.120
Did you know the man who invented the Frisbee was cremated after he died and made into a Frisbee?

33:35.480 --> 33:36.120
No.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.240
You're so weird.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.400
Don't bring this stuff up on the show.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.720
It's not appropriate unless he's made into Legos.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.520
Thank you, Rob.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.080
Plastic.

33:43.080 --> 33:43.720
I don't know.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.520
Yeah, it works.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.080
It's a toy.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.080
And the cave is, I believe one of the games included in the recent Humble Bundle.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.760
I don't know if it's current, but it's recent.

33:52.760 --> 33:53.880
I think you're right.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.080
I know for Android.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.200
I think it's one of those ones that's on Android and PC or maybe just Android.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.640
I think it was an Android bundle and then it was on PS Plus some time ago too.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.400
It was also free on Amazon not long ago, Amazon mobile.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.520
And I got it there too, but I'm still trying to play the PSV version first.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.280
All right.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.440
Is that it for your gaming week?

34:12.440 --> 34:13.000
That's all.

34:13.000 --> 34:13.560
All right.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.680
I'll talk about my gaming week.

34:14.680 --> 34:14.840
Okay.

34:14.840 --> 34:19.000
So I teased one for you, Flaco, a little bit ago in that 99 cent sale.

34:19.000 --> 34:19.800
I went crazy.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.240
And one of the games I bought, I bought the Jurassic Park game.

34:23.240 --> 34:24.840
And some people are saying 99 cents.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.000
You still pay too much for the Jurassic Park game.

34:27.080 --> 34:30.520
Here's the, I guess the game, you know, Telltale does a lot of great games.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.880
They've done so, so much, you know, obviously walking dead was phenomenal.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.480
And, um, the monkey islands and, you know, they do a lot of good stuff, but

34:37.480 --> 34:39.480
Jurassic Park did not get such good reviews.

34:39.480 --> 34:43.240
So, but I liked the movie an awful lot, Jurassic Park.

34:43.240 --> 34:47.240
I don't read a lot, a lot of books, but I read Jurassic Park when I was younger.

34:47.240 --> 34:50.040
I read that whole books and there's, there's so many differences between the

34:50.040 --> 34:52.200
book and the movie, by the way, if you didn't know, like everybody dies in the

34:52.200 --> 34:53.320
book, everybody dies in the book.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.360
I've read the books.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.320
You're totally right.

34:55.320 --> 34:55.880
Yeah.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.280
So anyway, anyway, I didn't, I didn't mean to get on that tangent, but

34:58.280 --> 35:01.800
Jurassic Parks had a very interesting history with gaming because my first

35:01.800 --> 35:05.960
reaction to playing the Jurassic Park game on PlayStation was this game would

35:05.960 --> 35:07.800
have been awesome 15 years ago.

35:09.080 --> 35:14.600
But the games we got, uh, for Jurassic Park on the Genesis and on Super

35:14.600 --> 35:16.440
Nintendo were, were very different.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.840
And they were, they were like the Genesis one was huge.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.160
I don't know if you guys remember, but the Jurassic Park on the Genesis was

35:21.160 --> 35:25.480
like a hugely popular game because you had to play as the dinosaur.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.560
And so that made it like, it was very different and all that.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.640
You ever, Jamie, you're the Sega fan in the house.

35:29.640 --> 35:32.280
Did you, did you ever play Jurassic Park on the Genesis?

35:32.920 --> 35:35.720
Cause, Oh, it's that in the lab.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.120
Mind you, when I was growing up, I had a Super Nintendo.

35:38.120 --> 35:38.760
That's true.

35:38.760 --> 35:45.000
Dan was the big Sega boy and he showed me another way when I moved out here.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.280
Well, Aladdin was the other big movie tie in game, but then on the Super

35:48.280 --> 35:50.040
Nintendo, it was really weird.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.480
Like that was that whole when like virtual reality was really big and like

35:53.480 --> 35:54.200
doom and all that.

35:54.200 --> 36:00.280
So they actually put like a doom-esque, doom-esque component first person into

36:00.280 --> 36:03.880
Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo, where you like go in these buildings and

36:03.880 --> 36:06.200
the velociraptors are in the buildings.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.240
And it was actually really cool.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.400
It was really scary for like a Super Nintendo game.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.520
It was pretty, it was pretty neat.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.920
I'm sure if you went back and played it today, it would be like super crude,

36:14.920 --> 36:16.680
but there's only one thing I can think of.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.680
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

36:20.680 --> 36:20.920
Okay.

36:20.920 --> 36:26.760
Anyway, so for whatever reason, Telltale got this license and like 15 years later

36:26.760 --> 36:32.520
is making a Jurassic Park game that is really reminiscent in many ways of an old

36:32.520 --> 36:33.640
Sega CD game.

36:34.600 --> 36:38.600
Like, remember when like full motion video was all the craze and all that,

36:38.600 --> 36:42.120
like it's the game itself is very simple.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.600
You know, it's a lot of just like exploring different scenes and looking at

36:46.600 --> 36:48.120
things in different scenes.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.640
And then the other half of the game is basically like QuickTime movie, the game

36:51.640 --> 36:55.400
where it's like, you know, press X and react really quick, press O and react

36:55.400 --> 36:58.600
really quick and R1 and jiggle the controller and move it in circles and all

36:58.600 --> 36:58.920
this stuff.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.720
And, and like, if you do something right, then hooray, you live.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.680
But if you do something wrong, Oh, a dinosaur just ate a little girl.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.880
Like, and yes, that can happen in the game.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.920
And so it's kind of like, it's very like, almost like, like dragon's lair meets

37:12.920 --> 37:15.000
a CD game of yesteryear.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.800
So it's, it's kind of retro in that respect too.

37:18.600 --> 37:22.760
Now, this might sound like I'm dogging on the game, but I'm actually not because

37:22.760 --> 37:24.600
I actually, I'm enjoying it.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.880
Like I'm play, I'm halfway through episode two right now.

37:27.880 --> 37:34.920
And what I'm getting a big kick out of is how they made this 15 year old movie

37:34.920 --> 37:39.480
relevant again, by creating this whole side story that didn't exist in the books

37:39.480 --> 37:39.800
and everything.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.920
Basically, it's like fan fiction.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.120
You're playing a fan fiction game, but it works like it.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.960
And if you guys didn't know what they did is they use, they use some of the

37:49.960 --> 37:54.520
unresolved subplots in the movie, because like, for example, you know,

37:54.520 --> 37:57.320
and I have spoilers for like a 15 year old movie people.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.280
It's probably even older than that.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.280
I saw it in high school a long time ago.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.800
So, so in the movie, there's the guy Nedry, right?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.040
Who was, what's his name on Seinfeld?

38:06.680 --> 38:08.840
Newman, Newman on Seinfeld.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.360
You forgot to say the magic word.

38:11.240 --> 38:15.080
Uh, so he tries, he tries to get off the island, right?

38:15.080 --> 38:18.760
And, uh, cause he's, the whole thing is he's smuggling dinosaur embryos to a

38:18.760 --> 38:22.040
rival company off the island, but he gets killed by the dinosaur.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.720
He's the one that shuts down the security.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.000
He tries to drive out, but, and he gets killed by the dinosaur because

38:27.000 --> 38:27.880
security's shut down.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.120
Right.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.200
Before you say this, is this about the shaving can?

38:30.200 --> 38:30.600
Yes.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.240
Oh my gosh.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.120
That's amazing.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.400
That's like every fan fiction about Jurassic Park because they never go

38:35.400 --> 38:36.120
anywhere with it.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.280
It gets, it's almost like it gets preserved.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.640
It falls into the mud.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.160
It sinks down and you never see it again.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.240
It's not even brought up in the game.

38:43.240 --> 38:43.960
Oh my gosh.

38:44.680 --> 38:51.080
Because did you know that the whole time there was a plan B because Nedry was

38:51.080 --> 38:53.800
going to meet people at the docks and then he never showed up.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.200
So the people at the docks go looking for him.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.400
That's how the game starts.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.840
That's amazing.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.160
So, and then they have that and then they introduce these characters, but

39:01.160 --> 39:03.800
they're making reference to what happens in the movie.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.960
Like, you know, there's this one thing where you're looking through a

39:06.520 --> 39:10.200
triceratops pan and you see a Jeep and they go, why is there a Jeep out

39:10.200 --> 39:10.360
there?

39:10.360 --> 39:14.120
And they're like, oh, uh, they have some hot shot paleontologists here looking

39:14.120 --> 39:15.960
at the park today type of thing.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.360
And then in another scene where you get to the visitor center, you see a

39:18.360 --> 39:21.400
helicopter flying away in the background, which signals that that was the end of

39:21.400 --> 39:22.120
the movie right there.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.680
So it is kind of neat how they created this whole universe that runs

39:24.680 --> 39:25.800
concurrently with the movies.

39:25.800 --> 39:30.120
So from the story perspective, I'm kind of like, and I went back and read

39:30.120 --> 39:33.640
some reviews for the games and a lot of the reviews really razzed the story.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.480
I didn't think, I don't think the story is bad at all.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.840
I'm like, the story's kind of better than the lost world was.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.920
Sorry about it, but the lost world was ridiculous.

39:42.920 --> 39:46.920
Like the chick does gymnastics to kick up a lost raptor in the face.

39:46.920 --> 39:47.320
Really?

39:48.600 --> 39:50.840
I mean, that reminds you guys about the plot of the lost world.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.280
It was kind of ridiculous.

39:52.280 --> 39:57.720
So the game in sorts is kind of a better sequel in that regard.

39:58.600 --> 40:03.320
I will say this though, from a technical perspective, the game needed some

40:03.320 --> 40:03.800
tightening up.

40:03.800 --> 40:07.560
I don't know if this is unique to PS3, but like I'm talking like frame skips,

40:07.560 --> 40:11.080
little hiccups, like you hit the button to react to something and like, I can

40:11.080 --> 40:15.560
hear that Sega CD switching to another track in my mind and then skip, skip,

40:15.560 --> 40:15.960
skip, skip.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.160
Oh, play the new scene.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.440
It's like, wow.

40:19.560 --> 40:23.560
So I've had an issue with Telltale games on PS3, sadly, because I have, uh,

40:23.560 --> 40:29.640
Poker Night 2 and The Walking Dead and those do have some frame rate, like lags

40:29.640 --> 40:31.080
and some hiccups.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.120
Like, you know, The Walking Dead always is like previously on The Walking Dead

40:34.120 --> 40:37.800
and, and sometimes like it'll get ready to load a scene because it has to do it

40:37.800 --> 40:40.040
from based on what you've chosen in the past.

40:40.040 --> 40:43.560
And it tries to load it and I'll end up missing like half the scene.

40:43.560 --> 40:47.240
So I think, I don't know, maybe it's just because the old PS3 hardware or

40:47.240 --> 40:49.080
something, but they don't run too well on that.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.440
But I still have enjoyed the games, but I deal with the hiccups and the problems

40:53.240 --> 40:54.440
are kind of buggy.

40:54.440 --> 40:57.000
Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.480
Kaijuto says Telltale needs to make a Goonies game.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.720
Oh, that's actually a really good idea.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.000
Did you hear that they're actually, there's plans on working on the Goonies sequel?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.640
They've been talking that on and off for the longest time and no,

41:07.640 --> 41:09.800
this has nothing to do with Goonies 2 on the NES.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.920
Can we just get that out of the way?

41:11.480 --> 41:14.600
I love Goonies 2 on the NES, like Goonies 2 on the NES.

41:15.320 --> 41:16.280
Oh God, here we go.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.720
I was talking about Jurassic Park, a 15, I'm talking about a two year old video

41:19.720 --> 41:22.760
game, but on a 15 year old movie, and now I'm going to get into an NES game,

41:22.760 --> 41:24.200
such as an episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.320
Hi, new listeners.

41:25.880 --> 41:30.680
Goonies 2 was like a Metroidvania game before like Metroidvania was really a thing.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.880
Think about it, right?

41:31.880 --> 41:34.680
Goonies 2 is amazing, but it really had nothing to do with the movie.

41:34.680 --> 41:38.920
It was only Goonies 2 because there was a Goonies 1 in Japan.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.360
It was on what, the Pay Choice 10 here, but it was never released.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.960
So it was literally Goonies 2, the video game where there's like a

41:45.960 --> 41:47.400
mermaid and shit that you're trying to rescue.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.880
It has nothing to do with the movie, but it's such a good game.

41:50.440 --> 41:50.920
It is.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.240
Anyway, where was I?

41:53.240 --> 41:54.200
Jurassic Park.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.000
Okay.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.320
So it has its flaws, but as somebody who really enjoyed the movie as a kid,

41:59.320 --> 42:01.640
I really appreciate what they try to do with it.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.920
I do find the quick time action scenes to be a little bit exciting because it does

42:04.920 --> 42:07.560
kind of like it gets your, you know, like your, your character is going to get

42:07.560 --> 42:10.520
eaten by a goddamn dinosaur if you don't like react in time.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.960
So it does have like that tense moment.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.400
It succeeds in doing that.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.520
I like some of the mechanics where you flip to different points of view.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.040
Like you'll be playing as one person and then to really solve a puzzle,

42:20.040 --> 42:23.240
you'll have to flip to three different points of view to solve a puzzle.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.760
And so I kind of like that, like there's, um, I don't want to spoil too heavy,

42:26.760 --> 42:31.320
but in episode two, I just did a puzzle that involves a roller coaster because

42:31.320 --> 42:33.640
Jurassic Park after all was going to be a theme park, right?

42:33.640 --> 42:37.080
So there's a roller coaster you find, and there's a puzzle involving it where

42:37.080 --> 42:39.320
you have to rotate between the three characters to solve it.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.600
And I thought that was kind of neat.

42:40.600 --> 42:45.400
So, you know, a little bit of a nineties cliche in adventure gaming puzzles,

42:45.400 --> 42:47.000
but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.760
So, um, Jurassic Park for 99 cents people.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.720
It's, it's a good, like, Hey, remember the movie.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.680
Wouldn't it fun?

42:54.680 --> 42:56.280
So yeah, I'll probably have to get that.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.920
I wouldn't have been mad if I paid like $5.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.560
I would have been mad even probably like 20,

43:01.560 --> 43:03.000
which would have been five an episode.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.600
I've been okay with, I don't know.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.120
Did they charge 40 when it first came out?

43:06.120 --> 43:07.080
10 an episode that might be.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.120
I don't think so because the walking dead was only the latest walking dead.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.560
Season two is only $20.

43:11.560 --> 43:11.960
Okay.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.440
Well then, then it's, it's, it's a decent price.

43:14.440 --> 43:17.800
It's it's fine, but it isn't as strong as some of the other telltale games,

43:17.800 --> 43:20.520
especially from a technical standpoint, I will say that.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.200
But it's, it's worth your time.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.800
You know, I think, uh, other games I bought, I bought everyday shooter,

43:25.800 --> 43:28.120
which I just missed out on the first time that was out.

43:28.120 --> 43:31.000
Um, that's a fun little Twix stick, twin stick game.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.080
Um, that it kind of is one of those.

43:33.080 --> 43:35.240
You, you learn the game as you go sort of things.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.120
Speaking of shooters, I bought a game called retro grade.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.960
I had no idea a game like this existed.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.800
I somehow missed this on the radar the first time,

43:41.800 --> 43:43.880
but it's like a music game as a shooter.

43:44.520 --> 43:50.200
And it's the really neat little twist on it is that you play the entire game in reverse.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.800
The game starts with the final boss fight and you play the game in reverse.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.760
And the whole reason behind that is I guess beating the final boss

43:58.760 --> 44:00.920
screwed up the space time continuum.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.800
So you have to go back in time to undo what you did.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.440
And because of that, everything is predetermined.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.600
All the motions in the game are predetermined.

44:08.600 --> 44:13.400
Enter how it's a music game because you have to move up and down in, in time.

44:13.400 --> 44:18.600
You have to hit the buttons to fire or, or like on fire or whatever in time.

44:18.600 --> 44:22.120
And so it's a really neat little mechanic and your score goes down, not up.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.840
And the whole goal is to get the low score in the level.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.120
So yeah, I liked it.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.400
That was really for 99 cents.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.520
That was a really cool little game.

44:28.520 --> 44:31.880
And I know we have a lot of music game fans at OLR that would get a kick out of that.

44:31.880 --> 44:32.920
That was retro grade.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.840
I recommend that one.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.320
You can also play that with a guitar controller.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.440
I do not know where my PS3 guitar controller is.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.560
It's probably in a dumpster somewhere.

44:41.560 --> 44:42.680
I think I threw it out when we moved.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.120
So I'll never get to try out that mode, but it is out there.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.920
You could borrow one of our million wins.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.120
Not that big a deal.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.960
I mean, the controls are, you move up and down.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.560
So I imagine that was what the strum did.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.160
And then you have the different buttons.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.440
So it's pretty.

44:57.800 --> 44:58.300
All right.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.920
I think that's about otherwise just a lot of the same stuff in my gaming week,

45:02.920 --> 45:05.240
like Final Fantasy 14 and Diablo three.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.960
I'm up to Paragon level 52 and Diablo three.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.240
Cause I'm really enjoying it.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.360
Like the, the expansion and the patch fixed everything.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.920
It's, it's so much more fun to play now.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.640
And yeah, I'll be playing more of it on my new computer this week.

45:17.640 --> 45:18.140
Yay.

45:18.760 --> 45:19.240
All right.

45:20.200 --> 45:20.600
Let's see.

45:20.600 --> 45:26.840
I'm trying to look for more chat over at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:28.760 --> 45:29.080
Let's see.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.040
I'm trying to see.

45:30.040 --> 45:33.160
Jason says, personally, I think Goonies is a horrible game.

45:33.160 --> 45:37.160
Technically speaking, punch someone five times, punch every wall,

45:37.160 --> 45:39.000
warping doors and hiding those behind you.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.120
Fuck that noise.

45:40.120 --> 45:40.520
Yeah.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.000
You know what?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.280
I'll give you that, Jason.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.920
A lot of the game didn't make sense.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.400
I wonder how much of that was lost in translation.

45:47.400 --> 45:51.640
Because again, you remember those early NES games when they were translated from Japanese,

45:51.640 --> 45:53.960
a lot of them lost something when they came over.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.600
And I'm sure you guys have heard some of those infamous translations.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.320
So I'm not sure if Goonies two is partially a victim to that.

45:59.320 --> 46:03.400
Cause like to beat the game, you have to know to punch an old woman five times in the face.

46:04.120 --> 46:07.960
And it's like, who would do that normally unless you have issues.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.440
So, but I'm thinking something was lost in translation there.

46:10.440 --> 46:10.760
I don't know.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.840
You had to have a guide really to finish the game.

46:12.840 --> 46:13.880
So I will give you that.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.360
The design was not exactly intuitive.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.120
So, uh, Tiger Claw apparently has assembled.

46:20.120 --> 46:23.560
Here are the top 10 death scenes from Jurassic Park the game.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.840
Would you like to look at some death scenes from Jurassic Park here in studio?

46:26.840 --> 46:28.360
We'll look at a couple here.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.080
Oh, sure.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.640
And maybe, maybe Jason can put some of these on the YouTubes as well

46:31.640 --> 46:33.000
when he puts the show together here.

46:33.000 --> 46:33.960
Let's just look at a couple of these.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.080
Oh, this is a six minute video.

46:35.080 --> 46:38.920
We can't look at this whole thing here, but we can look at a couple just to,

46:38.920 --> 46:40.520
just to get a feel for the game here.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.800
And can we go river rafting?

46:43.480 --> 46:45.400
No, we're not going river rafting in the commercial.

47:05.880 --> 47:06.200
Okay.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.360
I gotta, I gotta stop because this is spoilers.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.200
Only if you lose, right?

47:11.160 --> 47:13.080
I haven't, there's a part with scuba diving.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.360
I'm not even two in the game yet.

47:14.360 --> 47:17.320
So I need to need to, um, not do that.

47:17.320 --> 47:18.840
What did you say the other games that you got were?

47:19.800 --> 47:23.720
I got Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.240
Retrograde was the shooter.

47:25.240 --> 47:25.960
That's the music game.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.120
And then Everyday Shooter was the fifth one.

47:28.120 --> 47:28.520
Okay.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.240
That's what I bought.

47:29.240 --> 47:29.960
I spent like five.

47:29.960 --> 47:31.880
There was something else I was trying to remember you mentioning,

47:31.880 --> 47:32.920
but I don't remember what it was.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.400
You should click on my link in chat, Rob.

47:35.400 --> 47:35.880
Oh no.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.000
What did you do?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.200
It's another YouTube.

47:38.200 --> 47:38.840
Another one.

47:38.840 --> 47:39.400
What is this?

47:39.960 --> 47:40.920
Dare I ask?

47:40.920 --> 47:41.800
Just click on it.

47:42.520 --> 47:43.000
I'm sorry.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.120
I know this isn't a whorehouse.

47:44.120 --> 48:10.840
Yeah, I found a way to break the show.

48:10.920 --> 48:14.040
I would have given the game an extra half star if it had that song in it.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.600
Cause you know, they use the infamous John Williams score in the game and they use it

48:18.600 --> 48:22.680
very well, but I think I would have given it a half star at extra star though.

48:22.680 --> 48:23.960
Holy shit.

48:23.960 --> 48:24.920
It's a dinosaur.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.600
Like when you die, just play that song.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.000
Uh, all right.

48:33.000 --> 48:33.480
That's it.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.160
That's it for my gaming week.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.240
I think that's everybody's gaming weeks.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.440
So, uh, some quick housekeeping, please follow us on Twitter.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.880
Twitter.com slash O L R.

48:41.880 --> 48:45.160
And you can also follow us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash orange on radio or

48:45.160 --> 48:46.040

48:46.040 --> 48:47.320
Yes, it's still a thing.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.960

48:49.960 --> 48:52.040
All the places to find us on social networks.

48:52.600 --> 48:56.440
As far as I know, we still have shows every week coming up until probably July.

48:56.440 --> 48:57.720
No, June, probably E3.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.040
We won't be here, uh, that immediate Sunday.

49:00.040 --> 49:00.680
We may or may not.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.320
I'm still waiting to hear back on E3.

49:03.320 --> 49:07.000
Bobby and I are trying to go this year to represent VOG and do some cool stuff there,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.240
but we are at the mercy of the E3 Pope.

49:09.240 --> 49:13.960
We are awaiting the E3 Pope's blessing and, uh, either we will be blessed or we

49:13.960 --> 49:15.720
will be excommunicated.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.480
We'll find out in the next couple of weeks.

49:17.480 --> 49:21.080
Keep your fingers crossed for us because, uh, we want to, we want to do that same

49:21.080 --> 49:22.520
thing that we did last year.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.760
Only with two people this time, uh, covering the show.

49:24.760 --> 49:25.320
So we'll see.

49:25.880 --> 49:26.360
All right.

49:26.360 --> 49:31.880
Uh, let us get into some gaming news of which there is, uh, just a little bit this

49:31.880 --> 49:32.040
week.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.160
It was a bit of a slower news week, but dark soccer and I are going to bounce some

49:35.160 --> 49:37.000
game stories around here anyway.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.480
Um, and, uh, Flaco Jones, uh, since, uh, I didn't know you were coming tonight

49:41.480 --> 49:42.920
until your Easter plans ended early.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.160
I didn't give you any stories, but please feel free to chime in.

49:45.160 --> 49:45.480
Okay.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.120
Okay.

49:46.120 --> 49:46.440
All right.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.440
We need your, we need your wit and your puns because according to the chat room,

49:50.440 --> 49:52.600
according to the chat room, I forgive your puns.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.320
Oh, really?

49:53.320 --> 49:57.000
I yelled at Loki about it a couple of weeks ago and I've turbo puns.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.680
So, uh, you need to make some puns so I can scold you.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.400
So fair is fair.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.440
I blame Irene.

50:02.440 --> 50:06.920
She always tells the best, worst puns and I, then I, I'm challenged to do even

50:06.920 --> 50:08.040
more terrible ones.

50:08.040 --> 50:08.520
No, I see.

50:08.520 --> 50:09.960
So it's, it's a pun competition.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.840
Yes, it's a pun off.

50:10.840 --> 50:11.720
That's okay.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.120
Very good.

50:12.120 --> 50:12.760
Very good.

50:12.760 --> 50:13.080
All right.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.920
Well, starting with this, um, this series has been dormant for a couple of years.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.960
I think the last time it had a video game was in 2010 and then it had a movie,

50:19.960 --> 50:23.400
which was pretty forgettable, but it's Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia,

50:23.400 --> 50:27.480
of course, started off as a classic computer game series that was 2d back in

50:27.480 --> 50:30.520
the day and it made the shift as a lot of games did to 3d.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.000
And, uh, the last game was, I think on PlayStation three, what?

50:33.000 --> 50:33.560
Sands of Time?

50:33.560 --> 50:35.160
Was it the last one that they did?

50:35.160 --> 50:38.760
Uh, you know, which was, which was a decent, uh, decent game as far as action

50:38.760 --> 50:42.600
adventure goes, but the time, the series has been sitting dormant since then.

50:42.600 --> 50:47.960
Well, there's rumors out there that Ubisoft is making a new 2d Prince of

50:47.960 --> 50:48.520
Persia game.

50:48.520 --> 50:51.400
So going back to their roots, but here's the deal.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.960
They're going to borrow from another Ubisoft game to do it.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.280
And that game is Rayman Legends.

50:56.280 --> 50:59.160
Ooby art framework powered the Rayman Legends game.

50:59.160 --> 51:03.320
It's also used in a game called Child of Light and a French website.

51:03.320 --> 51:08.040
And let's remember that Ubisoft is a French company, a French website, um, is

51:08.040 --> 51:12.600
reporting that Ubisoft is making this game using quote the same techniques of

51:12.600 --> 51:14.840
animation used in the last Rayman.

51:14.840 --> 51:19.000
The Prince's body is divided into several parts, torso, pelvis, leg, shin, foot,

51:19.000 --> 51:22.280
forearm, hands, et cetera, that are animated independently.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.800
This provides a real diversity and credibility in the postures and movements

51:25.800 --> 51:26.760
of the hero.

51:26.760 --> 51:31.560
So it basically gives the illusion of 3d modeling, even though it's a 2d game.

51:32.200 --> 51:37.400
And of course my mind goes to Extifer and his love of Rayman Legends, which he

51:37.400 --> 51:38.840
never shuts up about that game, right?

51:38.840 --> 51:40.520
Flaco, has he made you play Rayman Legends?

51:41.080 --> 51:44.920
He got me a copy for Christmas on Vita and I still have not taken it out of the

51:44.920 --> 51:45.160
street.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.720
Well, I've seen so much of it.

51:47.720 --> 51:53.160
I feel like I have to like wait now for it to like really go away from my brain

51:53.160 --> 51:56.600
for a little bit so I can experience it again without being like, Oh, I've

51:56.680 --> 51:57.960
seen this a million times.

51:57.960 --> 51:58.840
Well, I'm not sure.

51:58.840 --> 52:02.200
My viewpoint of Rayman is a little tainted because I keep thinking about how

52:02.200 --> 52:03.720
much Extifer loves the game.

52:03.720 --> 52:07.000
And if you guys listen to Hoard House, he talks about the game, even on that

52:07.000 --> 52:08.520
show, which is supposed to be about online games.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.120
He talks about Rayman a lot.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.680
So my perspective is, Oh, people really like Rayman Legends.

52:12.680 --> 52:16.360
I don't really know cause I just have Extifer, but I think it's been doing

52:16.360 --> 52:16.600
well.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.120
They've released it on tons of platforms.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.080
I think it does.

52:19.080 --> 52:19.480
Okay.

52:19.480 --> 52:24.280
I mean, I don't think it did as well as they were hoping you would do, but I

52:24.280 --> 52:26.040
know it did pretty well in the Wii U.

52:26.040 --> 52:26.680
Yeah.

52:26.680 --> 52:27.240
So that's true.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.400
Cause it was supposed to be a Wii U exclusive and it's still, I think is

52:29.400 --> 52:30.440
where it sold the best.

52:30.440 --> 52:30.760
Yeah.

52:30.760 --> 52:31.640
Oh, how funny.

52:31.640 --> 52:31.880
Yeah.

52:32.360 --> 52:36.440
But I kind of think like, Oh, well, you know, a 2d Prince of Persia in that

52:36.440 --> 52:40.120
same vein would actually be kind of neat because that's how Prince of Persia

52:40.120 --> 52:41.000
started anyway.

52:41.000 --> 52:41.160
Right.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.480
What do you guys think of the idea of Prince of Persia going back to 2d?

52:45.160 --> 52:46.040
I think it's pretty cool.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.760
I mean, I don't know about like going back.

52:48.760 --> 52:51.560
I didn't really play a lot of the Prince of Persia games, but I just know that

52:51.560 --> 52:53.320
that Child of Light game looks awesome.

52:53.320 --> 52:57.480
I I've seen, like you said, extra play Rayman Legends a million times.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.040
So I think the engine is really nice.

53:00.040 --> 53:02.360
So if they're going to put it on anything, why not do that?

53:02.360 --> 53:05.960
It's it's proven it's beautiful and it's really smooth and fast.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.640
So yeah, go for it.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.280
Why not?

53:08.280 --> 53:10.120
It can't be any worse.

53:10.120 --> 53:10.600
Right.

53:10.600 --> 53:11.080
Yeah.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.440
I mean, Child of Light looks great.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.240
I really want to play it.

53:13.800 --> 53:14.440
Darzaka?

53:15.240 --> 53:16.760
I think it's an interesting concept.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.000
I mean, the whole thing is just, you know,

53:19.000 --> 53:25.640
I I can see why there would be an advantage to doing that way,

53:25.640 --> 53:28.120
but it seems like it would be complex programming wise.

53:28.120 --> 53:33.480
It actually makes me think of basics of flash animation for doing motion

53:33.480 --> 53:36.920
movement because you rig your your joints independently.

53:37.880 --> 53:42.200
So I'm I'm actually sitting more or less not thinking of how the game would look

53:42.200 --> 53:44.440
and play, but thinking of how it would be made.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.360
Yeah, I really do.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.360
You know, even if it does go back to its 2D roots,

53:48.360 --> 53:50.760
I really hope they do modernize it in many ways.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.640
It's not that, you know, the classics exist for a reason.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.920
The classics are still great.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.600
You can get the classic.

53:56.600 --> 54:00.200
I believe they put it out on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live a couple of years

54:00.200 --> 54:03.320
ago, they redid the classics around the time they put out the latest game.

54:03.320 --> 54:06.760
But it's kind of like, all right, well, you know, those games also got a little

54:06.760 --> 54:07.560
bit repetitive.

54:07.560 --> 54:10.920
I mean, they were great in the 80s, but they don't hold up very well in today's

54:10.920 --> 54:11.240
standards.

54:11.240 --> 54:15.320
So I really hope if they're taking it to 2D, they're really giving it some varying

54:15.320 --> 54:19.160
environments, some new mechanics, you know, some things to make it competitive

54:19.160 --> 54:21.240
with today's platforming.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.440
And dude better look Persian and not like some white dude.

54:25.240 --> 54:25.560
Yes.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.600
And he better look he better look like he's actually the Prince of Persia.

54:28.600 --> 54:29.960
He can't look like Jake Gyllenhaal.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.680
Very few people can look like him.

54:33.960 --> 54:36.200
Actually, I'd be okay with him looking like Jake Gyllenhaal.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.080
I saw that movie in the theater.

54:39.080 --> 54:39.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.360
It was it was a movie.

54:42.360 --> 54:46.920
I think that if you're going to have somebody represent a certain ethnicity,

54:46.920 --> 54:49.160
they need to look like said ethnicity.

54:49.800 --> 54:50.360
The end.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.480
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

54:53.480 --> 54:56.200
Dungeon Buster says, I wouldn't mind seeing a 2D Prince of Persia.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.120
It's a nice homage to its roots.

54:58.120 --> 55:01.880
Darth Tetsuya said, I did like the 2D originals, though I think the only one I've

55:01.880 --> 55:05.000
liked since was Sands of Time because it was similar to the originals.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.320
But this new 2D one sounds interesting.

55:07.960 --> 55:12.520
And Act F says, I'm in favor of Prince of Persia Origins, legends.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.160
So there you go.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.800
It looks like most people in our chat room are open to the idea.

55:15.800 --> 55:18.760
So again, how much is it going to cost?

55:18.760 --> 55:21.320
And is it going to look like a game that's worth 60 bucks?

55:21.320 --> 55:22.600
If that's throughout, they go with it.

55:22.600 --> 55:23.640
So we'll see.

55:23.640 --> 55:27.000
So I hope they go download route, like with Child of Light.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.520
Was that $15, $20?

55:28.520 --> 55:29.080
I think so.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.320
That could be it could end up being a network game.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.320
I would assume since they're using the same engine,

55:33.320 --> 55:34.520
it probably saves them a lot of money.

55:34.520 --> 55:35.640
And you know, why not?

55:36.200 --> 55:39.720
Well, I imagine this is one of the E3 things that is leaked out.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.840
So we'll know if this is fact or crap come E3.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.280
Remember, that is rumor right now.

55:44.280 --> 55:47.240
But it's one of those rumors that has a lot of buzz around it.

55:47.240 --> 55:50.280
Like, you know, you can usually tell the true runs from the fake ones.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.000
So we'll see.

55:51.000 --> 55:51.720
We'll see.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.440
Anyhow, moving on.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.000
Dark Sakura.

55:53.560 --> 55:59.800
Well, there's this game that we play that involves cat people and really tall

55:59.800 --> 56:03.480
people and really huge people and really tiny people.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.480
Let's see Final Fantasy XIV.

56:05.480 --> 56:05.980
No shit.

56:07.880 --> 56:14.120
So anyway, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn has reached 2 million registered user accounts.

56:15.240 --> 56:20.920
So that means that this is since when was the release?

56:20.920 --> 56:22.440
It was like last year.

56:22.440 --> 56:27.320
So with the they basically after the beta, there were another million more signups.

56:27.320 --> 56:30.520
So it's really starting to chug along.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.320
So I'm very pleased because that means they will at least have it for a little while longer.

56:36.200 --> 56:41.160
And such a neat story because of the fact that, you know, Final Fantasy Realm Reborn

56:41.160 --> 56:46.520
was essentially having to do over a video game that flocked and it worked.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.920
And I think there was a lot of that into the story.

56:49.960 --> 56:50.200
Yeah.

56:50.200 --> 56:50.440
Oh, yeah.

56:50.440 --> 56:54.520
They really had to back park the car into this spot that somebody else built, you know,

56:54.520 --> 56:56.600
that was kind of a mess in some ways.

56:56.600 --> 56:58.280
But they did a great job with it.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.640
Like, it's a great MMO.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.560
You guys know I never shut up about it.

57:01.560 --> 57:04.920
And I'm excited that it keeps gaining steam too, because

57:04.920 --> 57:08.280
I think Warcraft could use a little competition.

57:08.280 --> 57:10.200
And it's not that's no disrespect towards Warcraft.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.240
I love World of Warcraft.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.640
I can't wait for the next expansion for World of Warcraft.

57:13.640 --> 57:18.040
But I think Blizzard kind of tends to rest on their laurels a little bit with World of Warcraft,

57:18.040 --> 57:21.080
because there is literally nothing going on in that game right now.

57:21.080 --> 57:25.400
And Blizzard thinks they can get away with that for another six months until that expansion comes out.

57:25.960 --> 57:29.800
And so I kind of think Blizzard needs a little fire under their tushies.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.760
So I think this is only

57:30.760 --> 57:31.480
a little?

57:31.480 --> 57:31.980
Yeah.

57:32.280 --> 57:38.040
Well, to be fair, I'm like, I am also obsessing about Diablo 3 right now.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.160
And that's Blizzard.

57:39.160 --> 57:43.640
I know tons of people that are losing their shit over Hearthstone, which is also Blizzard.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.120
And that just had an iPad thing too.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.080
So, you know, it's not like Blizzard isn't doing good things other places.

57:49.080 --> 57:53.880
But it's just like, as a long time Warcraft fan, I kind of, I hate the whole...

57:54.440 --> 57:55.560
They do a patch.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.520
They do a patch.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.720
They do a patch.

57:57.720 --> 57:58.520
Drought.

57:59.640 --> 58:00.600
$40 expansion.

58:01.720 --> 58:02.840
Patch, patch, patch.

58:02.840 --> 58:03.340
Drought.

58:04.360 --> 58:05.400
$50 expansion.

58:05.400 --> 58:05.880
Yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:10.120
The only thing I'm excited remotely about the next WoW anyway,

58:10.120 --> 58:13.080
is just I want more Space Goats lore and I can read that.

58:14.920 --> 58:19.400
They did things with the characters after the last bit that I just was not happy about.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.680
So I'm kind of done.

58:23.640 --> 58:26.360
Well, but you have been enjoying Final Fantasy XIV.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.680
What do you think about Final Fantasy XIV?

58:28.680 --> 58:31.240
Have you been enjoying it and you and your time back?

58:34.760 --> 58:35.800
I'm really liking it.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.200
I mean, it's not that I...

58:39.640 --> 58:41.560
I mean, I just don't have a lot of time,

58:41.560 --> 58:43.960
but I like that I can play it when I don't have a lot of time.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.480
I will say this though, because I don't want to sound like I'm totally up

58:47.480 --> 58:51.880
Squeenix's ass in my praise of Final Fantasy XIV, because the game isn't without flaws.

58:51.880 --> 58:54.680
Like I do think Endgame right now is a little bit flawed.

58:54.680 --> 58:58.280
I think the content itself gets a little dry,

58:58.920 --> 59:03.640
but the good news is that Square Enix has done a very good job of giving regular updates.

59:03.640 --> 59:08.280
And if they can actually keep sustaining that and not do these big drought phases like Warcraft has,

59:08.280 --> 59:09.480
that's going to be the real test.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.640
But if they can, apparently they have two teams,

59:11.640 --> 59:13.400
one on the expansion, one on patches.

59:13.400 --> 59:15.960
So if they really are able to kind of keep going with this,

59:15.960 --> 59:20.760
it'll be a really, really good thing because each patch brings some like great stuff.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.880
Like it seems like they have one every couple of months right now, right?

59:23.880 --> 59:27.400
Yeah. And they're talking, there's going to be a, let's see, they're on 2.2 right now.

59:27.400 --> 59:29.720
And then the next one's 2.3. That's a few months away,

59:29.720 --> 59:32.520
but they're saying 2.25 will be out at the end of this month.

59:32.520 --> 59:35.080
See more frequent, smaller patches. It works.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.200
Yes. Just do it.

59:36.760 --> 59:40.440
If I would just like take a bunch of their content and just like, you know what,

59:40.440 --> 59:43.080
let's just put this thing in a patch.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.240
People would, I mean, maybe it's a little artificial,

59:45.240 --> 59:47.560
but people I think would feel better about it than getting it.

59:47.560 --> 59:47.880
Yeah.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.200
I don't know all at once and then getting nothing for two years.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.960
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

59:51.960 --> 59:54.280
I just wish I had a little bit more time to play.

59:54.920 --> 59:59.880
Um, but I, you know, cause everyone's sort of shot past me,

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.520
but I also have other things that I do.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.360
So, but, but the nice thing is, is that with the whole level sinking, you know,

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.000
you can get your friends to come do the lower stuff with you.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.680
And it's not just busy beating Titan.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.000
They don't just raffle stomp everything and all that.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.160
I did like tagging along for the treasure hunt,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.880
even though I can't kill anything cause I at least get a little bit of something out of it.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.400
But it was fun. I just stood back there and danced.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.560
To register participation for this week's episode of orange

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.680
underrated with vog network.com. Use the passphrase journey.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.880
Uh, C. Allen, our chat, Si Allen, our chat room.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.320
I always mispronounce that name. So sorry, buddy.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:41.320
In chat says sky is on squares payroll. I wish it would be, I can get paid for this.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.000
How do you think you got this sweet new house?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.280
All I have to do is sell out.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.440
Yeah. You know, you're the first guest in studio N seven, I believe.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:48.840
Really?

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.000
Wow. I guess so.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.040
Yeah. And we actually, we have still haven't shown pictures of the new studio out there.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.840
You want to, you want to quickly describe for listeners the new studio?

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.760
I don't have the best like way of describing things, but it's pretty cool.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.800
We've had pictures of my feet in the new studio.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.280
That's true. Um, no, I really like it here. I like all the geeky posters,

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.600
the game posters in your kingdom hearts. That's pretty awesome.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.560
That was Alan's idea.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.800
Yeah, I love it. I love all the posters. Uh, it's super cozy.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.480
Keep it a secret.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.840
It's like we're in, we're in like your living room or dining room area and it's just pretty,

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.360
it's pretty amazing. I really like it.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:24.860
Thank you.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.400
It's like, it's way different than being huddled over the kitchen table. The last time I was like,

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.000
that's all hit by the sit by the kitchen table and tell stories.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.200
It's like in here you actually get to lounge around a little bit.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.920
Yeah. I feel like I'm like kicking back. I got my brew free or die IPA product plug

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.400
and uh, it's really good. And so I'm just drinking some beers and having a good time here.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.600
Awesome. I like, it's super cozy in here. It feels great.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:54.600
We'll get a YouTube or something up soon and do all that. All right. Uh, let's see. Um,

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.520
what else do I want to say about final fantasy? I thought it was something else

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.400
I wanted to say about the game. Fat choco bows.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.360
Yeah. Fat choco bows are great. Uh, the angle that final fantasy has that wow. Doesn't that

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.640
I think really does give them a leg up. PC PlayStation four, PlayStation three,

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.040
all coexisting peacefully on the same servers. Not a lot of games that do that.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:22.760
Last game I can think of that did that final fantasy 11, which included Microsoft and Alan,

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.120
come over here. Alan. Alan's like me, me, me. I want to say something. Yes, Alan. Hi Alan.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.160
How are you doing? I'm doing all right. Thank you for building me a PC by the way.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.200
Maybe I'll sit in at the start of TARP part B and we can talk about it.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.960
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You can share everybody, the geeky specs and everything. Uh, what'd you want

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:42.600
to say about all this? Uh, the rumor is that the reason why, uh, final fantasy 14 is not on the

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.400
three 60 or rather the Xbox one is because Microsoft doesn't want their player base

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.400
interacting with people on the other console. They want their own 14 world. And square's like,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.880
no, that's not what the game is. So Microsoft doesn't get 14 because they don't want to let

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.600
other kids play nice. I don't think that's a rumor. I think that's true, but it's, it's,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.760
if the thing that gets me is that, but 11 was like, I was at the E3 where at the Microsoft

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:14.280
booth, they made a huge deal about 11 coming to the Xbox three 60 and that you were going to be

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.800
able to play with everybody else. And that was you, but you still had to have gold to do that.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:26.280
And then the play online shed, right? Which by the way, who co-owned play online Sony. So you

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.160
had to install a Sony product on your Xbox three 60 to play final fantasy 11. That game broke all

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.680
the fucking rules and Microsoft was like Xbox one can play blu-rays. So I guess that's true.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:42.280
That's true. Sony making money all over. All right. Uh, let's move on. Speaking of final

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.880
fantasy, I have another story about final fantasy for you guys. And that is about final fantasy

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:52.200
three fantasy three, not three America, which was actually six. Okay. But we're talking the

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.640
old school NES final fantasy three Japan that has been re-released here on America on the DS,

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.040
right? They did it in a three D format. They made it look more like the PlayStation

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.840
one era games a little bit. Um, it was on the DS and now it's on mobile phones, right?

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:15.320
Well, guess what? Apparently it's coming to PCs as well. Uh, this is revealed by a rating from,

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.400
you know, ratings boards tend to spill the beans all the times. It's always in another country.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.960
Well, thank you, Germany. Germany's usk board apparently leaked the news file fantasy three

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.160
on the PC. Hey, for what it's worth, it's rated usk six, which I'm imagining means what six and

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.240
up probably type of thing. Uh, we know that final fantasy seven and five has a three already exists

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.520
on the PC, but we have not heard anything about final fantasy three. This would make sense though.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.560
I mean, I would imagine the back structure that goes into the game can't be that much more

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:50.040
complicated than the already existing iOS port and excuse me, iOS port for Jamie gets me on that.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:57.000
And, um, Android part heart. Uh, I, I, I imagine that it's not that difficult once those ports

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.640
exist to get it over to PC as well. I mean, granted my programming knowledge is very little,

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.400
but I can't imagine it's too difficult. But the interesting news is that would lead me to think

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:12.440
that if this is released and does a decent job, which final fantasy on the steam store at a

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.640
discount ought to do pretty well. This means we're going to get final fantasy four, final fantasy

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.400
five, and the, well, let's hope if they decide to put out file fantasy six, they go back and

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.120
fix some things that were wrong with it. But this could very much open the door to a lot more final

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:35.000
fantasy games on steam. We'll see. This could be very, very interesting. All right. Uh, going to

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.800
our chat room over at live.vog network.com Akuma JP and chat says why final fantasy three is already

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:49.240
everywhere. Good point. Keep in mind Akuma JP. We never, we, the game was new to us until the

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.560
DS version came out. It was the last final fantasy game to get released in the U S that

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:59.480
had been out in Japan, but not here. Translated Rome. Oh, look at that. Oh my gosh. On your little

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:07.480
Android. That's amazing. Um, Bobby Black Wolf wanting to clarify, uh, what Alan had brought

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.840
up earlier here about fantasy 11. He actually, uh, pointed to a news article from RPG site.net

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:17.160
that says Microsoft refuses to allow titles to share a multiplayer service between other

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.280
platforms for final fantasy 11s, Xbox three 60 release. The company made an exception,

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:27.480
presumably to Curry favor with square Enix to secure final fantasy thirteens release for their

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:33.400
console, but no such exception was made for the last latest MMO entry. Well, if the game continues

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.880
to do well, they might need to reconsider. Maybe they should pull final fantasy 15 from it. No,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:43.480
just kidding. No, it worked. They got final fantasy, uh, 13 on there. So right. 12 and

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:49.240
did they get 12? No, just 13. Yeah. 12 was 12 was on PlayStation two. So yeah, I wish they'd done

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.000
12 on Xbox 360, but they didn't. Yeah. So no, it was just 13, 13, 13, two, 13, three, 13, four,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.440
13. Sorry. I lost track. And presumably 15 is on the Xbox one as well. That's what I've heard.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.440
So, so my joke was take it away from them. Well, there, there's some interesting news

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.240
we'll get into later where maybe Sony has now done some things that might not sit well with

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.320
Square Enix. So we'll see. We'll see. We'll get into that later in the show. All right. Um,

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.360
meanwhile, let's move on with some more news before we get to release date stark Sakura.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:27.080
Well, there was some crap going on with elder scrolls online. They found a bug that lets you,

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:35.800
basically duplicate pretty much unlimited amounts of gold shows any max online studios that, uh, no,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:45.000
they are, uh, going in and trying to, uh, make sure they can get the local economy back to normal

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.040
and trying to get the bug ripped out and squished like the evil that it is. Um, but they haven't

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.880
said anything about like what exactly they're going to do to address it. Well, yeah, usually

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.680
they're not going to tell you because they don't want people to duplicate the bug. That kind of

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.960
stuff is killer in MMOs, those types of exploits. Final fantasy 14 actually had one when the game

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.360
first launched on the realm reborn and they took out, not only did they patch it out without

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.520
telling people they were going to do it, they did it overnight, but then they went and like,

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.400
if you had Gil from this exploit, they either banned you or took your Gil away, all of it.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.000
So, and like there were people that got caught up in it that weren't even like somebody had bought

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.400
something with the Gil from their auction house posting. And so they got the money taken back.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.360
Like it's that it will fuck up an economy that good where they have to really change that.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.800
But that's, that's crazy when, from my understanding is this bug was reported in beta.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.760
Well, what they did since is that basically they have, um, disabled access to Guild banks

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.720
and, um, they had a patch out that changes the auto stacking in the Guild banks.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.680
So it's basically trying to prevent it until they can, until they can fix the economy.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:02.520
Oh, there you go. If you abuse it, lock it down elder scrolls online. You know,

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.120
there are some people I know that are playing it. They're really, really enjoy it. But, um,

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.400
overall the reception seems to be a little bit tepid. So I'll be interested to see if

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.960
they can keep up that sub fee thing going on. So you haven't checked that out at all, right? Flaco?

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.840
No, I have not. Not even the beta again, PCs dead, but it's supposed to be coming to BS four. So

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.160
it is. Uh, is that one of the ones that's on the one as well? I don't remember. I guess not.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.760
I probably not. I don't think so. I don't think any, I don't think that any of these MMOs are

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.880
coming to one like world of tanks. Yeah. But then that's exclusive to them though. Right? Yeah,

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.000
it is. Yeah. So there you go. Get anything is by making it an exclusive. Uh, they had defiance on

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.320
three 60, but those servers were segregated or segregated. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's how they

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.120
got away with, I don't know. Maybe they're, maybe they're getting it and it'll be segregated.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.800
All right, let's travel around the world and check out release dates and talk about some, uh, games

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.840
coming out soon in a store near you this week, uh, in the U S since Loki's not here tonight,

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.320
I'll go ahead and do the U S releases here. Uh, we have demon gaze coming out on the PlayStation

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:06.280
Vita Tesla effect on a windows and Macintosh. That's a text Murphy adventure and war face on

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.920
X-Box live arcade, all those games on the 22nd, as well as on the PlayStation four Flaco. I don't

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.880
know if you've heard about this game. Octo dad, deadliest cash. I am dying. I played it actually

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.800
on a demo kiosk fries and it was so much fun and a, you know, and I'm big into those, um,

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.840
what do they got? Awesome games done quick charity marathons. Uh, two years ago they had the people

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.680
that made Octo dad come on there and demo that, that verse version of the game that I believe was

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.920
free or really cheap. It was kind of like, you know, their, their first version of it. Right.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.360
And, uh, it was really funny to watch them play it. And that, in that game it was on the PC and

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.600
you had to take the mouse and dip it in, hold it either the left or right mouse and like move,

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.120
like slide it forward and to move your little Octo legs. And from what I saw and then from what

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.800
I played at the PlayStation four controller, they really captured that perfectly because

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:00.760
you had to like hold up, hold one of the shoulder buttons and move one stick to move your, like half

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.160
of your legs on the one side of your body and then do it again to move your other legs. And you pick

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.920
stuff up and you move around very surgeon, similar, like, like you knock everything down

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.640
when you move around. It was really fun to play. And you know, a part of me, you know, I'm like,

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.240
I'm such a cheapskate. I'm like, please do you play station plus, but if it isn't,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.360
I'll probably still throw some money that way because it looks really fun. Well,

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.400
there could always be a 99 cents sale. I know, but do I want to wait now? Do I want to wait?

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.040
I could wait for PlayStation plus, which I usually do, but for this game I might make an exception

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.840
because it was so much fun. Like you had to put on your tux to get to your like wedding.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.200
It was hilarious. And no one knows you're an octopus because you're in disguise.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.040
Well, on the 25th, a little later in the week, you can look forward to dark souls to getting

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:50.440
its windows release. So you can die over and over and over and over and over and over

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.600
and over and over again on your windows machines. So dark souls two coming to kill you this week

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.040
on the 25th, also on the 25th, a lot of Wii U Nintendo fans, very excited for the release of

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:11.800
NES remix two AKA NES remix with the good games coming out this week on the Wii U I'll probably

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.960
be picking that up. So I enjoyed any S remix until I had to play the games that you unlock.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:24.360
So I was like, wow, they usually the unlock stuff is the good stuff. But here I got golf and wrecking

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:31.080
crew and urban champion. Are they discounting the first one? I don't know. But if you own both,

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.720
you get like a bonus mode, you get that 90s championship mode, where you can, you know,

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.600
you get the like, remember that cartridge that was in three steps, the very rare cartridge they did,

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.080
like a wizard style tournament where you did, it was rare. I don't remember. I didn't have rare

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:51.720
stuff. No, no, no. I mean, it was actually a rare. That's what I meant. I only had, what was it? The

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.520
86 World Championship? Yeah, there was two of them. One of them had rad racer and Tetris and

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.880
another one had, I don't remember. Yeah. I didn't, my parents hated buying me video games. So I only

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.920
got video games that were handed down to me. So I got whatever my uncles bought. All right. So those

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.160
are the releases in the U S this week. Let's travel over to Japan real quick and see what's coming out

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.040
over there. Cause you know, what comes out here tends to come out there a little later. Sometimes

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.280
what comes out there comes out here a little later. Sometimes, uh, first off, uh, on the

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.960
PlayStation four, nothing. Cause you know, it's still kind of new over there and they did get

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.600
final fantasy this week. Uh, Xbox one still not released over there. So there's nothing to report

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.440
on that on the PlayStation three. However, there's a few things, uh, 2014 FIFA world cup Brazil on

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:41.160
April 24th, along with grand theft auto for the complete edition, uh, love photon flowers. You

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.160
know, we love our love love here at orange on its radio. And so that is coming out on PlayStation

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.440
three red dead redemption gets a price reduction in the complete edition comes out, uh, as well on

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:58.360
the 24th and ahead of him. Tengoku dah, toe, Omo, Tata, Yandere, Jiyoku data comes out this week

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:04.280
as well. And I have no idea what that is, but, uh, I recognize the word Tengoku that's heaven,

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:13.480
right? Yes. Uh, it looks like cute girls raising a cat who's and the girls sometimes their clothes

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.440
fall off. That's apparently what I'm getting from the screenshots and they're in made uniforms

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.680
and, uh, pervy kids everywhere. The cat looks up at them from very low angles. Yeah.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.600
I think we know what kind of game that is. All right.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.080
Those are the kind of games that for some reason don't get released here. I don't understand,

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.640
uh, on the Xbox three 60 this week, uh, monster hunter frontier GG premium package. Ooh, uh,

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:47.080
Jason love plus Pingo in regular limited and Sega store limited edition. Is that like the old school

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:54.600
Pango game? Like redone? Oh my God. It is. It's the old school Pango game. Remember the,

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.680
the penguin that you push around the cubes and everything? It's like a new version of that,

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:05.400
but it's like in widescreen and shit. Are we getting this here? That's kind of rad.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.640
Not with that box art. Yeah. That box art is amazing. I love it. I guess. Yeah. Wow. I didn't

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.040
know that Pango still had like rabid fans over in Japan or something enough to necessitate this in

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.280
three different releases. That's pretty cool. All right. Well checking out the handhelds. Oh,

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.000
sorry. I strict with you real quick here. We, you does have, they get the retail release of

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.640
Famicom remix one and two. They're getting a retail release this week. So you got that as

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.600
well as a monster hunter premium package as well. I think it's just a rebranding of monster hunter

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:40.040
all over again. Checking the handhelds now on the PlayStation Vita blaze blue chrono phantasma,

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.560
uh, Rayman legends and sword art online hollow fragment in regular and limited edition on the

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.880
Vita and on the 3DS this week, uh, theater them final fantasy curtain call. Ooh, I want to play

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:59.480
that for the record. Um, Ecoma JP says that Pango is huge in Japan. Wow. I love Pango. I didn't know

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.280
it was like a huge thing over there. That's cool. Uh, and, uh, let's see if last but not least on

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:12.760
the 3DS this week, maple story. Unmei no shouju comes out this week. Fate of what? Uh, it's just

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.760
a maple story side story. I'm sure is all that is. It looks, I'm trying to see if it's like,

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.600
it looks like the actual maple story is so cute and it looks boring as hell to me, honestly.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.360
All right. Some people will be into it and yes, thank you. Acted after I was thinking that

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.680
Octo dad equals chicken boo, the game where a disguise look like human guys. Isn't, um,

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.680
Octo dad more like QWOP kind of, I never played that, but I heard that control wise. Yeah.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.480
I guess surgeon simulator, surgeon simulator meets chicken boo. Maybe that's a better

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:52.440
description. Anyhow, dark soccer. How about the UK? Um, there's some stuff, a few things. Um,

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:59.400
on the 22nd war face comes out 23rd, the walking dead season two on Vita and 25th dark souls two

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.760
and Joe Joe's bizarre adventures, all star battle. And that's it. You know, it was just funny. I'm

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.800
still kind of hilarious that Joe Joe's bizarre adventure is still like,

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:16.280
uh, I guess a lucrative IP, especially since it's been done for like years. Wasn't,

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.000
I think the manga was like originally out in like the mid early to mid eighties. Wasn't it?

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:29.960
I think so, but my, my mind just goes to Mojo Jojo or KC and Jojo, but how did the Jojo

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.880
fighting some system or the other? Yes. My kids love Powerpuff girls.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.840
All right. One more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. And

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:46.840
I like being able to do gamers do good news stories this week. And there was a great,

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:52.920
uh, there was a really cool little fundraiser that happened this week, uh, that was taking place on

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.480
Twitch, you know, as a lot of fundraisers do for video games, but playing a game that's near and

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:06.200
dear to our hearts. DDR. Yes. They were playing DDR on Twitch for the team in training leukemia

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.840
and lymphoma society. Um, so they were on there. I'm trying to remember what the specific rules of

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.280
the whole thing were. I believe it was that he was going to play, uh, DDR. He was going to keep going

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.000
and, uh, his name is Jeff is the guy that did it. And, uh, Carl, his friend was the guy that was

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.160
raising money for the leukemia lymphoma society. I've actually heard of this cause I have friends

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.080
that do this. It's like a big marathon that you raise money to do. And you know, at, um,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.080
the money goes to a good cause obviously. And they actually do good on like the Komen group

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.440
for breast cancer. Yes. Uh, and, uh, so they were doing a desert bus for hope style where

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:44.920
you donate and it will force them to keep playing DDR continuously. And, uh, if you donate, you can

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:51.080
make requests to do like weird things or play songs, make them play, keep on moving or, or what

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.040
is that song? That's so God awful in the game. Um, let them move. You can play, let them move

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.680
over and over and over again, if you want. Um, well notch, you know, the notch that made

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:07.960
Minecraft, he decided to drop $10,000 on it. So they got to dance all night long. They went for 16

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.920
hours. So nice. Very cool. He has all that extra money. He's not supporting the Oculus anymore.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:21.800
Now, now don't shade him when he's doing good. Yes, he's doing, I said some shady things about

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.800
notch a couple of weeks ago. Cause I thought that was some, some BS, that whole thing about the

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.840
Oculus, but look, he's going to put the money towards good places. We should say thank you.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:37.560
Not so good job. Not good job right off job notch. Now maybe you should reconsider some other things.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.360
No, in all, in all seriousness, I know some of our listeners were like, I know like Jason was

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.720
watching this feed and as soon as Matt was telling me about it and dark Tetsuya,

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.240
all these people were talking about, uh, what was going on with that. So I think that's a great

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.960
thing. Uh, raising the money for good. So, uh, congrats. And I, that's awesome that it was such

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:59.960
a success. They raised, I think I heard it was like $17,000. Wow. Yeah. Right. God. And I thought

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.440
it was awesome when we raised a thousand dollars on Horde house last year, which was awesome.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.280
Don't get me wrong. No, that's great. Congrats you guys. All right. And I really hope you didn't

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:16.360
have to play, let them move. Cause the song is so awful. So awful. Hey, uh, less awful.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.240
A chance to take a trip down memory lane and visit a classic video game. The dark soccer things. Hey,

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:30.120
listen, all you little brats out there enough of this whole new fangled MMOs that aren't on your

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.000
X-Box one, those were called gemstone and they were texts and you plan through AOL. That's right.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.320
You played Ultima online or get out. You might've been eaten by a group and you liked it. Maybe

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.560
it's the classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:54.600
a game that she thinks, Hey, play this. Are you stupid? Dark Sakura. Yeah. You're stupid. Cause

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.560
you are the dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Alex Kidd miracle world.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.360
Because I somehow haven't done this game yet. How have you never done Alex? I think I did

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.520
Alex Kidd in Shinobi world, which was the one I really liked. Ah, okay. Alex Kidd in miracle

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:13.560
world. Alex Kidd in miracle world is a very special game. Um, it was a platformer that came

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:19.720
out on the Sega master system and it came out in Japan on Saturday, November 1st, 1986. And then

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:28.920
went to, uh, the Western area and Australia in 1987. And it's probably the best known of the

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:35.000
Alex Kidd games. And when the master system two came out, Alex Kidd miracle world was built into

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:45.720
the system. And, um, it basically you play as Alex Kidd who lives in the miracle world. Um,

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:52.120
that's like this big fantasy world and he has the ability to punch rocks. And so he's going to look

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:57.880
for his, uh, long lost brother, Prince Eagle. And he punches frogs in the face.

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:05.240
He does. Um, to fight against Junkin the great who, um, took over the land of Radaxian.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:14.040
So basically, um, you basically have to, uh, all the citizens were turned into stone.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:21.320
And so you have to, uh, basically do all this crap to go rescue people. And you go around punching

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:27.080
rocks and punching creatures and riding. And you're on a motorcycle. Exactly. Riding

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:33.960
motorcycle. So you have all kinds of different stuff to go. And this feature, um, you basically

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.240
also have different ways to continue the game. It has a continue feature that's undocumented

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.120
where you can continue the game with three lives from the beginning of the level where you died.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.720
You hold the up button and press the, uh, the two button eight times during the game over screen.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:56.360
But it costs you 400 bombs, which is the, uh, the currency in game. Um, to finish,

01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:03.560
um, you also, uh, have to face a boss who you have to win by playing, uh, Junkin Pong,

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:10.040
which is, you know, rock, paper, scissors. And then, um, it's such a weird way to fight bosses.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:15.880
You play rock, paper, scissors. There's no, there's a strategy, but, um, to finish the stage,

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.520
you also have to grab a food object at the end of each of the stages. You can only take one hit

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:27.320
before you die and it doesn't have a battery save option or a password system. So what you see is

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.880
what you get. And to be good at this game, you really have to wait, wait, you die in one hit.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:42.680
Back in the day, you had to be a pro. However, like I said, there was the, uh,

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:52.600
undocumented system. So Sega loves us. Um, so, um, well, if they really loved us,

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.960
they give us Shenmue three. So I don't think they really need to let the Shenmue thing go. I can't.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:07.160
Anyway, um, this was, uh, basically the game was created to combat Super Mario Brothers.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:17.160
Um, and Sega, um, was, uh, really trying to, to have a good competitor. Um, basically

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:24.040
what they were trying to do without Skid, they had already had, um, Wonder Boy also.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.360
Um, but they couldn't do it with those types of platformers. They didn't actually get any

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:35.240
good competition until Sonic was created, but the game was received very well. Um,

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:45.960
they loved it in France. What don't they love in France? Americans. Oh yeah. Um, IGN, um,

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.120
for a 2008 retro review gave the game a nine out of 10 that won an editor's choice award.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.880
Well. And there's a French band, like I said, it's loved in France. The French punk band called

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:04.680
Chunk No Captain Chunk have a song named after the game on their album Something for Nothing.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.920
The game used to only be available in cartridges. There was a slightly different version in 1990

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:17.080
that came out, um, for the Master System 2, but like I was saying, it was also built into the,

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:23.080
uh, Master System 2. And, um, the game also was re-released along with Super Hang-On and Revenge

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.840
of Shinobi as part of a Sega vintage collection, Alex Kidd and Company, which came with Xbox Live

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.760
Arcade and PSN. Um, there was the sequel, there was Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle,

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.440
which is the fifth one, but it was considered the actual sequel to Miracle World. And that one came

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:48.520
out for this, uh, Sega Mega Drive, which was the Genesis over here. So it's, uh, that's it.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.560
Alex Kidd and Miracle World. It's a damn good game. Why aren't you playing it?

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.960
I'd go, go, go do it. You can get it on virtual console, right? You said?

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:04.280
Um, PSN. And yeah, I think it's, I think it might be on virtual console. I don't know.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.680
All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Miracle World. And you

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.360
could rock, paper, scissors. I still like Shinobi World better, but that was me.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.320
That's all right. It's well, you know, cause it, it has, because it's kind of the marriage of the

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.520
Shinobi World as well. And it's a little, little more. That was actually the first Alex Kidd game

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.760
that I played with Shinobi World. There you go. Yep. All right. Well that is going to do it for

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.200
this part a of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys. Cause we have plenty more of the

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.760

So we'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:05.800

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.240
then gave us presents. Those yummy scones is very delicious. Um, also joining us here at the top of

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:39.480
part B cause we said he'd be back here. Uh, Alan is here. Hello. How are you Alan? I'm good. How

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:45.160
are you? Yeah, I'm good. So Alan, thank you for building me a new computer. You're welcome. I was

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:51.160
due. What do you mean you were due? I usually try to upgrade my own PC every like three to five

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.480
years and I usually build them to where I can last the whole five years, but I haven't been able to

01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.040
afford one. My machine that I built is still running from summer of 08. So I'm running a six

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:07.400
year old system. Go straight to gamer jail. Um, but uh, when you, for the longest time when we

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.400
started dating, I was like, you have a pre-made gateway, I'm going to build you a PC. And it

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.080
finally happened. Did you judge me a little bit for that? No, you didn't know any better.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.080
Yeah, I do. I do. But yeah, no, you made it, you made it your, your mission to build me one. And

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.320
they actually said at the store we went to to buy all the parts, which it was fries, whatever.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.000
I usually don't like naming places cause they don't pay us to mention, but whatever,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.240
went to fries. And they were like, uh, you know, you bought all this stuff and we'll assemble it

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.000
for free. Do you want to do our assembly? I didn't, I didn't know that they even did that,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.680
let alone for free. But I was like, I can handle it. And I did. It was fine. Yeah.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.680
Well, except for that part you broke. That's all right.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.400
I mean, it's the thing that was wrong out of the box. No, the chip you tried to put in your

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:54.920
computer today. Yeah. That I, that was my fault, but I was trying to cannibalize your PC that was

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.320
now you've replaced it. So I was like, Ooh, you've got a quad core. I want to take that. But I

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:05.400
somehow bent a couple of the CPU pins, which is, which is bad. But I, I got to take some Ram.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.120
I took some of your Ram. Are you noticing any difference at all? Not really. I'm defragging it.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.200
So there you go. Yeah. All right. So the nerds want to know what, what's, what's the specs.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:22.680
What do we do? Uh, how do we build the new PC? So if to start to stop any like fan wars before

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.880
they start, I have certain allegiances to products that are just based off of my own experiences.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.720
If I had one bad experience with one brand and then good experiences with another,

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:37.480
I'm just going to lean towards that. So I went with AMD just because I feel the performance that

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:42.760
you get in the longevity you get for the price is better than Intel. You're paying for a premium

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.600
with Intel. I know, but kind of like buying a Sony TV, why would you want to spend the extra

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.320
two grand on a Sony TV when you can get a Samsung? That's kind of my attitude about it. Um, it's an

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:59.960
AMD 8,358 core. It's got eight cores and the clock speed is 4.0 gigahertz, uh, 16 gigs of Ram,

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:07.560
uh, Corsair Ram. I'm not sure of the speed. And it was, it wasn't the most super ultra

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.840
fastest Ram cause it was just too expensive for 16 gigs. So it was kind of in the medium range.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:20.680
And then for the video card, it's a EVGA is the ones who made the card and the chip set

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:30.680
is a, uh, Nvidia GTX, uh, 760 with two gigs on it. And it purrs. It's very quiet and I'm jealous

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.760
of it already. Oh, it's such a quiet, but I had, I had, I had a fun time. I had a great time building

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.160
it. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear it. I had a great time playing games on it last night. Yeah. Every

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.440
it's like three is so smooth and a solid state hard drive for instantaneous windows and game

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.920
loading. And that was based on Facebook recommendations. You didn't have that in the

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.600
Yeah. Well just for regular disc trade, like a SATA hard drives, you can get like a terabyte

01:30:54.600 --> 01:31:04.040
hard drive internal for like 110 bucks. Like just the cost of space is dirt cheap. And I'm like,

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:09.560
if you've got a steam library, like we do with like 400 gigs worth of games that you can install,

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:16.040
why not get like a giant fat plate disc hard drive? But everyone's like, no, you got to go

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:20.200
solid state. So it's like, all right, you're the one buying it. So I'll get, I'll get you the

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.400
prettiest thing. Um, go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tiger Claw asks about

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.840
the PC case. Does it have a side panel window? It does. Um, which, which is really good because

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.600
when you hook it up and you're ready to turn it on, you hit the little switch, not the main PC

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:39.000
switch, but you hit the little switch on the power supply to get that power. Um, there's a little

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.560
green led on the motherboard that lights up. It says everything's good. You're, you can try

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:49.400
turning me on. So the, the, um, the little glass panel on the side of the case lets you see the

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.880
motherboard. And I think there's like a red light or like it'll blink. It'll blink. If like, it's

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.760
like, don't turn me on. Like you screwed something up. A lot of those things are kind of foolproof.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.720
Now. That's great. Like I'm sure there are nightmare stories where you hook something

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.800
up wrong and turn it on and then you smell ozone and you just blew out the stuff you just bought.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.120
But there's a lot of fail safes in that stuff now. Um, now earlier in the show, when I was talking

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.960
about the computer being built and everything, we had a chatter that said, why not just get a PC out

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:19.640
of box or that's, that's really nerdy building your own PC. So why, why build your own PC Alan?

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.520
Why, why did we take that route? It's kind of like, I don't know,

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:29.400
dudes that are into, or, or, or women or whoever, uh, who are into cars that like just buying,

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.920
restoring cars and they're all, their hands are all cut up and they've got calluses cause they like

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:39.800
going in and going, here's this thing I made. That's, I can look at that computer and go,

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:46.280
I built that. Um, also being kind of pretentious you, if you build your own,

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:52.200
you can get exactly what you want. Um, the only way you can really do that as a gamer is to go to

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:57.880
Alienware or what's that one company that they always podcasts have an affiliate program with

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.520
them. They're in Seattle. Oh, uh, no, we won't mention because they don't sponsor this show.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:09.800
Well, you can, it's a cat apartment systems. Okay. All right. Um, Oh, okay. That's right.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:15.080
I just remembered. Um, you can go that route, but then you're paying a huge premium for all

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:23.400
the souped up water cooling, dry ice, bubble led blinky shit like jet engine, weird custom

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:29.160
loose site stripper heel case. Well that case has these two holes in it. And I was like,

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.400
is that so you can fuck your computer? No, they're like, they're like little rubber

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.400
buttholes that you can stick your finger in. No, it's for, it's for water cooling. If you

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:42.600
want to run tubes, if you want to run tubes through like a chassis that will cool your

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.440
graphics card and your CPU. So, um, you know, the case, um, for anyone that wants to Google image,

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.400
search it, it's an ant tech and I love ant tech. That's one of those things where,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.160
why did you go AMD or why did you go into video? I just, I've had good experiences. So I'm,

01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:00.120
I'm loyal to those products. Well, and I know my current case is an ant tech 900 and I got you

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.480
or picked out for you an ant tech 302. Uh, code man in our chat says I had a bad AMD

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.800
processor once and it turned me off, but I love AMD video cards. That's actually where I'm at.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:15.960
I love the AMD video cards, but since, you know, I was, I was letting Alan be the boy playing with

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:22.840
Legos and yes. Yeah. All right. You just, you do what you think is best and all. I had a nightmare.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:29.880
The computer that I had before this one, um, the catalyst software that ATI might be better now,

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.280
but there was something about that catalyst software and the other hardware that I have,

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.480
it was, I hated it. It blue screened all the time and I just, I did not like that. But Nvidia

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.760
was always generally fine for me. So, okay. Um, gosh, I'm trying to think of what else to

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.040
ask you with that. So are you, are you already thinking about what you want to do for your new

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.680
computer now? I could upgrade. I mean, I can't get something as souped up as what you have,

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.240
but I could like, I'm still on a dual core. I could just get a new motherboard and a CPU,

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.360
even just keep the Ram that I have, even though it's like five year old Ram,

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.120
I could probably do that for like 300 bucks or less. And she's, she's thinking they might have

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.560
an extra quad core processor. I bet if we batted our eyelashes and asked very nicely,

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.320
it's probably people out there that are getting like, I just got rid of mine. So my stuff is so

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.520
old that I can't really even like the chip that I have is the highest chip that my motherboard

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.560
will take. So I have to replace the motherboard too. All right. Well, if somebody wants to donate

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:25.160
to your new computer fund, where can they find you on the internet? Uh, salacious pop on Twitter.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.440
It's salacious underscore pop on Twitter. And then I'm Alan alchemy on tumblr. There you go.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:37.320
And, uh, I fixed your DVD Ram drive. Usually there's one minor thing where I'll build the

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.160
computer and turn it on. And like the little activity light that blinks when like you're

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.160
reading to the hard drive that won't be hooked up. The thing that I forgot to do is your,

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.920
your DVD Ram rider drive. I didn't hook it up to the power supply. So when I turned it on,

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:57.080
I hit the little eject disc tray thing and I'm like, Oh, oh, DVD, DVD. Ram's not working. What

01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.200
I do. I just, I just hooked it up to power. Now it works now not to be reading Facebook

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.240
messages, uh, publicly, but I have to ask you about this one because I noticed our buddy Brad

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.160
from pod culture commented on your post about how you accidentally botched the pins on the four core

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.760
Intel. And he suggests the old trick of using the barrel of a retractable ballpoint pin.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.560
I did not know about that trick and I may still try that. The thing is, is that I didn't realize

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.760
that some of the pins were bent when I was trying to originally see it back onto the board. And by

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.680
trying to see it, I made them worse. So the pins that the pins that are bent are pretty badly bent.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.920
They're not really kind of just leaning. One of them is pushed all the way down like flat.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.360
So that's pretty bad. That's bad. Yeah. All right. Well, anything else you want to share

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.880
with listeners tonight? Um, I'm sorry that I don't guest on the show more, but as Rob knows,

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:55.720
Sundays are usually my Mondays at work. Um, so I'm at work and then when it's a holiday or work

01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:02.360
is slow and I'm home, the show's great, but it's like, it's a free day off. I'm like,

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.520
I don't usually work on Sunday, so I'll do housework or I'll just play 14 or video games

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.360
or Diablo three. And then I'll listen. Like earlier when I was doing laundry,

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.920
I was listening to the show that's happening in the house on my cell phone on a 10 second delay.

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:22.600
So I would hear Flucco Jones laugh in person and then I would go down the hallway. Then I

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.640
get the laugh again in my head, in my head, in my headphones. It's a very trippy effect

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.840
to stream a show that takes place. Well, if you hurry, you can hear yourself. Yes.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.240
Uh, quickly though, what other, what other games have you been playing lately? What have you been

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.920
into? It's a 14 and doing this stupid, it's more a conversation for a whorehouse, but the bullshit

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.200
with the new kind of like your legendary weapon that they have in, wow, the relic stuff. It's

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.240
really to chain you to a subscription because it takes so long to do. And so much of it's based off

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.440
random numbers that I'm just, I'm hooked on trying to get that done. Uh, one more tip from Brad from

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.920
pod culture in our chat room at life.vognetwork.com. Brad says really slowly bend it back with a pen

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.480
and it should work. So yeah, good luck. I mean, Hey, if that works, that'd be awesome for you.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.880
Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. Uh, gosh, I can't think of anything that I already know. I've been playing

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:15.240
14 Diablo three, which Skyrim. Oh, I talked earlier about Jurassic park. You've been watching

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.600
me play that. What do you think of that? It looks fine. It looks like just one. It looks like a

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:25.560
telltale adventure game. I did. There's there's the, the, the, I don't know if it switches

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.280
characters in the, in the later episodes, but you're a professor, a veterinarian and his daughter.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.640
And she was asking him a question and I kind of chimed him, daddy, why do we look drunk?

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.840
Because they kind of have this glassy eye, like the art direction's kind of weird.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:46.840
Like they just look, I swear to God, he should be doing live streaming. He is so

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.800
funny. So why do you think I like him? So sometimes watching, watching the characters

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.120
kind of talk, I'm like, there's, something's wrong with them, but that has nothing to do

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.840
with the game. That's just kind of like how the people look, but it looks, it looks fine.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.440
Well, and then my favorite, well, I don't want to give a spoiler, but it's just, you know,

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.840
the two characters that, Oh, they know each other. What a surprise because yeah, well,

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.480
they both have bandanas. They're both, they're both the two people that aren't white.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.360
They both, they both have tattoos and it's like, and then she's like you and I'm like,

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:26.600
of course they knew each other. Like it's, it's, yeah, it's bad. And then I loved screaming,

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.680
like you were trying to, you were trying to solve a puzzle involving turning on the electricity.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.160
So when she opens up the electrical cabinet, I'm like, and dinosaurs,

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:38.040
dinosaurs right now, lost her after right now. And he just kept waiting for dinosaurs to jump

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.360
out for no reason. Like she, you know, she, she turns over like a dinosaur.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.200
As soon as they got the power on, what happened?

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:49.640
A dinosaur showed up. But I want dinosaurs, like a full T-Rex to come out of like a can of soup,

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.200
just like dinosaurs, like, like snakes in a can. But yeah, it looked fine. I don't really

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.480
understand why. It's got some, a few tech hiccups though.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:08.600
Yeah. When the, when the game kind of froze, but three or four sentences of conversation audio

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:13.960
were still happening. And then the subtitles and the video kind of caught up with the conversation.

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.600
I was like, was that lag? Like what just happened? So yeah, there's a lot of weird tech stuff.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.200
All right. Well, Alan, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news and emails

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.800
and all that good stuff. But thanks for dropping by.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.600
Did you see in chat when I said there were two OLR birthdays this week?

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.920
No, tell us about the other one. I did see it, but it, our conversation had moved on.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.040
It was a whole delay thing, right? So tell, tell listeners about the other birthday.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.360
Our kitty Sanrio is 14. She's very old and she's still in great health. She's just,

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:46.520
she's old so she sleeps a lot, but she'll be around for a few more years.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.400
That's great. Well, we'll give her extra, but we don't really celebrate cat birthdays sadly.

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:55.080
I would like make her some actual fish, like tuna or salmon and cook it up,

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.720
make kind of warm and give it to her. But I don't want her to have,

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.400
I'll have to deal with that in the litter box later. So she doesn't really get

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:08.360
a birthday feast. Her, uh, her system is too fragile for that. So she gets kibble forever.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.120
There you go. Well, she gets extra pettings. Yes. Today. All right. Well,

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.080
Alan, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to, if you hear Flaco Jones laughing later and

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.080
you want to respond to it, feel free to just jump in here. Okay. All right. You're always welcome.

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:26.360
All right. Like the laughing gas left up track on big bang theory or something. I can't stop

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.000
laughing. O L R was taped in front of a live studio audience of just Flaco Jones.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.040
All right. Uh, Oh, hack deft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Sanrio.

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.560
I'm not sure how to stop with the old jokes chat. I know, right? Y'all are mean.

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.880
All right. Let's go to some rapid fire news. You guys, we're going to talk about a few things

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.240
happening in the industry quickly. Uh, starting off with, um, I gotta be honest, guys. This is

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.520
what happens when you have a week where there's not a lot of news. You get a lot of, you get a

01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:02.440
lot of stories, you get a lot of rumors and talkings going on. And there's an interesting

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:07.320
story out there about apparently Sony originally wanted Titanfall on the PlayStation Vita.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.560
Titanfall, of course, the big game that came out on Xbox one last month,

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.760
yet PlayStation four still managed to sell more consoles, but that's probably the price difference

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.240
and nothing else coming into play there. I don't know, but anyhow, Titanfall was the big app that

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.800
was, uh, going to move some Xbox ones last month. And it probably did, but it could have maybe moved

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:32.360
some Vitas, uh, apparently respawned and reached out to Sony before the exclusive is exclusivity

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:38.920
agreement, exclusive agreement, God damn with Microsoft, uh, to talk about, uh, all, all that

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:45.880
and putting Titanfall on the Vita. Um, this all came from the final hours app, which is, uh, was

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.960
released for Titanfall. There's been a few of these apps for games like tomb Raider and I think

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:55.080
portal two might've had one and some of those games. So, uh, that all came out of that. However,

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:01.640
respawn did after the story first broke, they did clarify that Sony wanted it to do what was called

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:09.080
an R one project on the Vita, not the finalized Titanfall games. In other words, it was way before

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.520
the game became what it was is when Sony wanted it, but I still kind of go, well, that's still,

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.960
you know, that's still pretty big because, you know, respawn the whole way that, you know,

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.600
kind of started and what the kinds of games they've made and so forth and in their history and

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.920
so forth, you, whoever was going to get the exclusive from them was going to be a big deal.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:34.040
So it's, it's really not a surprise at all that Sony pitched it. I think the, the interesting

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.800
thing to think about is what if that game had been on the Vita? It's kind of interesting,

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:41.480
but I think response coming out and saying, if it had been the Vita probably would have gone

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:47.160
a completely different direction. So it makes sense to me. So anyhow, there is that talk going

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:52.520
on on the internet this week. Um, speaking of team-ups that didn't happen, Activision,

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.640
and this isn't, this is something Activision said themselves. Activision said that initially

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:04.840
they wanted to team up with Skylanders with Nintendo. Uh, Nintendo turned it down.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.680
Now, even though Skylanders, uh, is on Nintendo devices, as you know, Skylanders is pretty big

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.160
and it's on all the different game consoles. Uh, here's a quote here from, um, let's see,

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:24.360
uh, who said this? I don't know who said this comment here because the, the source article

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.320
I'm reading never says who, who did this, but, uh, some executives at Activision said, quote,

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.000
we have been directed towards thinking about something that would play well with Nintendo.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.840
I think there was some co-marketing money and the Wii was doing well. They had some success

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.200
with peripherals. They spent a long time looking and looking. They were just like,

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.800
we've never seen anything like this before. I've always wondered about the full meaning of that

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.400
comment. We have no idea why they didn't commit. Clearly they have got properties well suited to

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.560
this world. Why is it that they didn't rush in here will probably haunt them for the rest of

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.320
their days. So, um, that's interesting that Nintendo could have had that, but they didn't

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:04.680
want that. Um, but it's not that, I mean, again, Skylanders made the Nintendo platforms at the end

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.560
of the day, but Nintendo would have been more deeply involved probably with the creation and,

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.480
and considering some of the strong characters that Nintendo builds that could have made for

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:23.000
a very interesting partnership. So, Hmm. Um, also, uh, in kind of what the heck type of news going

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.240
on, uh, bungee, which, uh, made the halo series in the past and is now making destiny, which a

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:35.240
lot of people are looking forward to, including myself, uh, let go their big composer this week,

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:39.560
Marty O'Donnell or Martin O'Donnell, excuse me, who, uh, actually crafted some of the,

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:44.760
the Epic soundtrack for the halo games and was working on the destiny games was terminated by

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.680
bungee this week, which is, uh, very interesting. Uh, bungee did talk to the media at a destiny

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.120
preview quote, we don't make decisions lightly and the music from O'Donnell will remain in the

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:02.120
upcoming game, but there's nothing else after that. So, uh, very interesting circumstances.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:07.800
The tweet from, uh, him says I'm saddened to say that bungee's board of directors terminated me

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:15.560
without cause on April 11th, 2014. Wow. So you got to wonder, I mean, I don't know, like, I don't

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:19.800
want to be all up in the business. I mean, who knew maybe the guy showed up late for work every

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:24.120
day or something. I don't know. I just, there could be a million, a million, billion reasons,

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.800
but it's going to be weird because this music is so, so, so good, uh, that it's not in the,

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.880
um, next game after destiny two or whatever inevitable things comes after that dark saga.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.320
He could have just been a big diva, you know, you never, it could, I mean, there's,

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.040
we don't really, you know, companies aren't going to exactly talk about personnel issues forthright.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.400
So we're left to rely on Twitter and reading between the lines and all that.

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:53.160
Well, in some other quick news, um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be available via

01:46:53.160 --> 01:47:00.120
steam early access. Um, so you can basically play it as it's in progress and it's supposed to be a

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.160
pretty neat game. I mean, there were strange adventures in infinite space in 2002 and then

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:12.200
weird worlds returned to infinite space 2005. Um, infinite space three sea of stars is going to be,

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:20.200
$9.95 and like I said, early access. And then, um, there was a little bit of talk about, uh,

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:27.400
the last of us, the PS4 edition about if it was going to be, um, discounted as well. And, um,

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:34.280
uh, uh, dude from Naughty Dog, Eric Mona, Monticelli, is that how I pronounce his name?

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:41.720
Um, said, uh, that they're looking into the business model for the, uh, different versions

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:48.920
of the game. Um, at least as far as discounting the PS3 one as well. Um, and they were looking

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:53.080
for owners of the, basically the big question was regarding the owners of the PS3 version

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:59.480
who also got the PS4 version, but they haven't given anything really committed to it.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:07.720
And then, um, last but not least in Outrun, uh, 3D Outrun is going to have two new songs in it,

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.320
like brand new songs. One is, um, it's coming out April 23rd in Japan. It's Cruising Line

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:22.280
by, uh, Manabu Namiki and Camino Amiamor from, uh, Jane Evelyn Nisperos. And there's going to be a

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:29.320
new car, three different simulated cabinets, four screen modes, remappable controls,

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.840
replay saving with multi-spleet payback, uh, mid-race saving, customizable volume for game

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:42.360
audio, engine noise, and ambient arcade machine noise. So, yay. That's it.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:50.120
Are you going to be picking that up? Huh? Are you going to be picking that up? Outrun on 3DS maybe?

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:57.000
Well, I'm sure Dan will probably. He's the one with the XLs and he's the bigger Outrun fan.

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.080
Gotcha. All right. Well, now is the point where we're going to, uh, turn to our listeners for

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.480
feedback on a particular question we ask in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.880
Every week we ask a question of our fan communities over on Facebook and on Google Plus.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:25.480
And, uh, we read some of our favorite answers here on the air. Uh, tonight was a bit of a tricky

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.400
question, but it has to do with the whole Prince of Persia thing we talked about earlier. And the

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:35.240
question we asked was, what classic video game franchise would you like to see done in the style

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.040
of a newer video game? So that's the question we asked because, you know, Prince of Persia being

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:45.720
redone like Rayman Legends. So, okay. Let's, rumor anyway. Let's see what you guys think would be a

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.480
classic video game redone, like a newer video game. We'll start with Google Plus tonight and

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.760
some of the answers over there. I love this answer for entertainment. Leisure suit Larry

01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:02.040
done in the style of Farmville. You can help, you can help your friends to farm the necessary

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:07.320
materials to put together the necessary quest items in order to hopefully nail that saucy Latina

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:12.200
down the hall. Or you could actually talk to that equally saucy Latina in the cubicle next to you,

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.160
who has the added quality of being real. I don't know where he was going with that,

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:22.200
but I like the opportunity of combining Leisure Suit Larry with Farmville. It's great.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:29.960
Panaxium replies. It says Kid Icarus done in the new Strider style. The new Strider game was

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:35.720
pretty hot. Kid Icarus, don't think that would be cool. Or Mega Man X done like the Mass Effect

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:41.720
trilogy. I don't know about that one. Who would be interesting? Who would Mega Man romance in that?

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:47.240
I don't know. That would be very, very interesting. All right. Act Deft replied on

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.960
Google Plus and said this reminds me of the 3D classics Nintendo and Sega made for the 3DS.

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:55.800
I would like to see more games done in that style. Well, you got Outrun to look forward to. There

01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:02.600
you go. And Travis H says Symphony of the Night done in the style of Shadow Complex or Super

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:08.200
Ghosts and Goblins done in the style of Rayman Legends. Oh, Ghosts and Goblins. That's a, that's

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:13.160
a series that's been gone way too long that would be cool to see come back in a new modern platform

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:18.360
style. That's pretty cool. I like that. Let's go over to Facebook and see some of the answers

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.480
over there on facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Just a few comments on Facebook tonight,

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.360
so I'll go ahead and read them all here. Fifth Dream says I used to love an old game called

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:34.440
Gain Ground. I imagine it would be really cool if they revamped it to be a lot like Diablo 3.

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.320
You know that's happening with Gauntlet. Gauntlet is being redone and it's going to look like,

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.280
we talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show, it's going to look like Diablo. I'm very

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:49.320
interested. Awesome Unicorn says every game series ever with good music done in the style

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:55.480
of Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Donkey Kong Country, Castlevania, Saga, Mana, Kingdom Hearts. The

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.800
possibilities are endless. Okay, that's not what you really asked, but I still want it. You know

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.400
what? I'll accept that answer, especially because some of those games you mentioned were other

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.360
square franchises. I was kind of surprised it wasn't DLC in the first Theatrhythm,

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:17.000
maybe in this Theatrhythm game, who knows. AZHP, I love this answer, says Final Fantasy

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:23.800
done in the style of Bravely Default. Okay, do you guys get why that's funny? Because Bravely

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:29.080
Default is a throwback to the old Final Fantasy games, whereas Final Fantasy 13 and so forth

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.040
haven't really been like the old Final Fantasy. That's the joke. Forget it. All right,

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:40.760
Ospher says I'm going to do a reversal on this and say a newer game done in the style of an

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:46.280
older one. Who said you could change the rules? Who do you think you are? All right, fine. I'll

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:52.440
take it. Ace Combat, yes, the flight simulator, done in the style of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:53:01.160
Okay, if you're going to flip the script, do an answer that makes more sense. I don't get that

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:08.520
one. I guess because it's fast. He says because it would be hilarious yet beautiful. Fabrice A

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:15.000
replies on Facebook and says the first Sega Rally Championship with upgraded Outrun 2 graphics.

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:23.800
It might be good. Good times. Burr replies and says mech warrior done in the style of Titanfall.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:28.040
By that I mean more urban warfare with lots of ground units and elementals.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:33.400
Lots of mechs or mechs are coming back in with Titanfall. I mean, not that mechs ever left,

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:39.000
but definitely Titanfall. Like everybody loves the mechs in that game. All right, there you go.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.200
Those are the answers from Facebook and Google Plus and we look forward to seeing more answers

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:50.200
throughout the week. And you should add us on our communities so you can answer questions in future

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:56.280
weeks. There you go. Some folks in chat trying to figure out how the hell is Sonic 3 going to work

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:01.240
with a plane. And Orange Right says Sonic 3 with a plane. ACT-DEV says Sonic 3 already has a plane

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.920
though. That's right, like in the very beginning of the game, right? And Darted Studio just says,

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:10.360
I don't even know how that would work. I'm going to ask for to email us and tell us a little more

01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:16.920
about his plans here. It is 4.20 after all. So you are going to hear some really weird ideas today

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:22.280
for no particular reason. Just saying it's, you know, just it's all the peeps people are eating

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:29.080
today. Everyone's high on peeps. Okay, fine. Everybody's chocolate peanut butter eggs.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.320
I haven't eaten any of those yet. Tomorrow's the big day. I bought a bag of peanut butter M&M eggs

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.600
and they are delicious. Why did you not share? I should have brought those over. I brought beer.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.800
I'll take a beer. Go for it. I got a couple left still. I'm not drinking anymore because

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:50.920
they're a little strong. Free beer. Jamie has to drive home, so no beer for me. Awesome. Okay.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.360
What was I going to say? I was going to ask you guys if you had a, I know it's a tricky question.

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:04.360
I don't know if you guys thought about it before the show, but a old video game done in the style

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:09.880
of a new video game. Anything you have to think of? An old video game done in the style of a new

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:15.720
video game. Well, I'm in honor of my Silent Hill shirt. It's not really like that old,

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:19.800
but, and I said this when I first played through Heavy Rain with my friends. I was like,

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.520
why don't they do Silent Hill like this? It's so cinematic. You know, I know it's not Silent

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:30.600
Hill, but the series really hasn't gone very far recently. So it's not like, just say the old,

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.960
the good Silent Hill games done in the style because then maybe, you know, and I love the old

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.240
good Silent Hill games, but maybe what I'm thinking is more as a revival, do it in that

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:44.360
Heavy Rain. What's the other game that came out this year? Beyond Two Souls style of, you know,

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:49.480
choose your own adventure. Very cinematic, very scripted, but there's multiple branching paths

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:54.600
and it can turn out a really good story. I love those games. So maybe since Silent Hill's kind of

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.600
falling off and it's hard to recapture the magic, doing the same thing over and over again, maybe

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.440
do something like that. And I don't know, that's just something that I thought of. Not really the

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.600
exact question, but. The first Mass Effect remade with Mass Effect 3's game play. I'm not serious

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:12.120
about that. No, yeah, yeah. It would, it would help. That's like the one thing I don't like

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:16.280
about the first Mass Effect is that I like playing like the way the third one plays better than the

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.200
first one. I think a lot of games could benefit from that. I know I hated the first Uncharted

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.480
game. I liked the other two, but the first Uncharted game is such a slog to play through.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.480
It's like, I wish it was more like this, more like this. And they really, you can tell when

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:30.840
a game improves on something and it's like, but then sometimes you wish they could go back and

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:38.120
fix the original. Gosh, I'm having a hard time thinking of a good answer for this. I thought I

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:45.240
had something before the show went live tonight, but maybe I kind of want to say, I don't know,

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:51.160
my mind goes towards, I really want to see a Gradius revival done. And I think I'd like to see

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.960
it in the style of like, like a, like a twin, like a modern twin stick shooter, maybe something like

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:00.120
Resogun, like really pretty like that. But like, I think I just really want a new Gradius game,

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:11.640
honestly, is what I want. So otherwise, maybe a rad racer game, cheesy 3D and all done in the

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:20.840
style of Burnout. How about that? It'd be fun. All right. Let's go back into some other news.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.440
Huh? Actually something just occurred to me. Yeah, go for it. We were watching some

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:30.040
Inside Sim Racing, which is a video cast that Dan likes to watch, was doing a review of,

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:36.360
I think the game's called MX2. It's a, it's a motocross game. But they mentioned something

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:41.160
about wanting customizable tracks. I was just thinking, wouldn't doing Excitebike in the style

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.920
of MX2 be cool? Cause that actually was a really neat looking game. Just saying. Bobby Blackwolf

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:51.240
in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says Rock Band in the style of Flappy Vog.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:58:01.320
All right. Let's get back into some news. Let's see. I mentioned earlier in the show that there

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:06.360
was some interesting things going on with Square Enix and Sony and that whole thing. So news broke

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.560
earlier this week that Sony announced they're going to be selling off their stake in video

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:17.080
game company Square Enix. You may not have known this, but Sony was actually an investor in Square

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.600
Enix since the early two thousands, you know, around the time they got Final Fantasy 7 to come

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:25.880
out on the, actually it would have been more around nine probably was coming out around that

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:33.000
time. But yeah, Sony was once an investor in Square Enix. They owned 8.2% of the company.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:41.720
So they sold off 9.5 million shares valued at $156 million, leaving a $47 million profit. However,

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:49.320
we won't really know what this boils down to until the end of May. Now don't think that this

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:53.000
is because Sony's like mad at Square Enix or something like that. Like it's not necessarily

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.720
that. This definitely seems to be a, you know, basically financial. It's business, not personal.

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:04.040
Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Really. They're saying that basically Sony's been streamlining

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:10.040
their operations. For example, Sony got rid of the VAIO computers. They laid off employees.

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:15.160
They restructured the TV business. They shut down some of their buildings, including the

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.560
old headquarters in Tokyo. So, and the New York City tower, as well as the Sony,

01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.120
even though the PlayStation is doing very well for Sony, they're really struggling in some other

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:31.640
areas. So this is kind of part of how they balance the books basically. So that's what's going on.

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:39.320
Now, no clue what this means for Square Enix. But hopefully they'll be able to, you know,

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:43.320
kind of, you know, since this is a traded company, those shares will get picked up

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:51.640
somewhere else. We'll see. So, an interesting, interesting move. You know, Sony and Square

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:55.720
Enix back around that same time would have been partners in that whole play online thing. So they

01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.760
were kind of, you know, they were close buddies for a long time, but now who knows what this will

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:08.360
cause for the future. Dar Sakura, what do you got for us? I have some stuff. Basically, given that

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:13.240
we were talking about Silent Hill earlier, this is pretty good to mention, is that Silent Hill

02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:19.960
Origins and Shattered Memories are both going to the Vita. And that's soon, according to Konami.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:28.840
But they will be £7.99. No, I don't really see what the word is for how it would be in US and

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:42.440
Japan. So, also, I accidentally closed the thing trying to make it visible. I don't think it was

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.760
just Silent Hill Origins. I want to say Shattered Memories. I did say Shattered Memories. Oh, sorry.

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:53.320
Rob, that's what you get for nothing. See, now we can make this the Pooh and Rob. He had to open

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.360
his beer. Yeah, I know, right? There really wasn't a whole lot else just talking about the history

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:03.480
of those games. Silent Hill Origins was a PSP game from 2007, and Silent Hill Shattered Memories

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:09.480
was PSP, PS2, and Wii, which was a little different. I played that game on the Wii.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.520
The problem I had with that game was, and I don't know if you can do this, but the nunchuck is

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:18.680
corded, right? I don't know if they have wireless nunchucks, but there's an element of that game

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.720
where if a monster... Well, the move is wireless nunchucks. No, I'm just talking about the actual

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:29.000
Wii. The only ones I ever used were wired nunchucks, so there's a part where the enemies

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.080
have to grab onto you, and you have to shake the controller, and I kept whipping myself in the face

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.040
with the cord between the nunchuck and the Wiimote, and I'm just like, ah, get it off of me! You shake

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.160
it off, and the monsters get on you, and you zap, and you just keep whacking yourself in the face

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:52.200
with this stupid cord. That game was... It could have been so much better. I don't know. The worst

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.320
part about it was when you're exploring the world in that game, nothing bad can happen to you,

02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.920
so it kind of takes away that tear element. It's creepy and everything, and it's got the atmosphere,

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:08.280
but the fact that you're completely safe at all times you're exploring is weird. It's like you're

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.000
used to walking around the corner, and there's a dog or a monster or something that can just start

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.760
getting you, and you're trapped, and you don't have any weapons or anything, but in this game,

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.360
it's just like, oh, these are exploring parts. Nothing's going to hurt you, and these are the

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.560
monster parts. You just run, run, run, run, and if something gets on you, you shake your controller

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:28.040
and whip yourself in the face, and that's all it was. Silent Hill for five-year-olds?

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.280
Yeah, it really wasn't. The thing is that the monster running parts were so hard I had to have

02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:38.040
my friend Nathan do it. It's like, you do it. I get lost, and if you slow down for a second,

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:44.120
you just get overwhelmed. You die and just start over, but there's only a few of those segments

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.080
really in the game that are... There's three really hard ones. The rest of them are pretty

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:51.080
easy, so it's more of an experience than a straight-up game.

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.840
I don't know how that would translate on the Vita. Like, you shake your Vita around?

02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:58.040
You shake the Vita?

02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:01.320
But I never played... Apparently, there's a PS2 version, so I don't know. On that one,

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.720
I doubt... You can't shake the controller around, obviously,

02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:05.800
so maybe you just mash a button. I don't know.

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:07.160
Jiggle the analog sticks.

02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:08.360
Yeah, that's probably what it is.

02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:13.000
Would you be interested at all in checking out either of these games on the Vita?

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.120
You know, I never played Origins, so I would be interested in playing that one.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.280
I do have it on PS2, but I don't feel like hooking it up, so... For eight bucks,

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.080
and maybe it'll be cheaper someday. Maybe I'll get that one. I always wait out for the PS Plus

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:28.760
deals, so there's a chance I could get it really cheap. I would probably get that one.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:29.960
That works.

02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:35.080
All right, well, moving on to a story about the Xbox One. The Xbox One got a bit of an

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:41.640
update this week. They had an update roll out to the Xbox One consoles that include quite a

02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:48.200
few things, including improved game DVR video quality, Blu-ray player supporting 50

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:54.920
HZ video output, where applicable, controller and headset firmware updates to help improve static

02:03:54.920 --> 02:04:00.760
issues, Connect voice and motion improvements, which some people have been bitching about on

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:06.760
the Xbox Ones. That's good. Friends improvements. When favorites and friends sign into Xbox Live,

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:10.200
you'll get notifications. I had no idea this wasn't already on the One. It's on all the

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.720
systems that are out there today. That was interesting. And then game app and saves progress

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:20.680
bar updates. So you'll actually get a progress bar that shows you how far along your game is in

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:24.200
saving, so you don't think the whole thing's locked up and shut it off prematurely or something

02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:30.120
like that. So that should be already out there on the Xbox Ones. If not, you should probably

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.920
connect your system to the internet and let the magic happen so you get all those fancy new

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:40.600
updates. All right, we're going to open up our mailbag every week. We invite you guys to

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:46.040
participate with our show by emailing us participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:52.520
Dark soccer is going to dive into the email bag and pick out a few emails that she believes are

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:57.560
worthy of sharing on tonight's show. Well, we had four emails, which I am actually waiting to

02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:04.120
load now that for some reason I keep getting disconnected. Your tablet is being very unruly

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:10.920
tonight. It is. But there was one that SSG100 Matt sent us that we've actually already covered.

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:20.840
And that was about the DDR marathon and Notch's contribution towards it. But it's definitely good

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.760
that you wanted to let us know about it. We should spread gamers doing good. We should spread the

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:31.720
good news with that. So I kind of knew that would come in from some of our listeners that have been

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:36.760
with us a very long time when we were music exclusive. Hey, that's one of the downsides

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:43.400
about getting into the late 30s. I could never do a marathon like that anymore. I need a marathon

02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:50.600
where I can be seated and play the games. I can't dance for 16 hours straight. So more props to you.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:56.280
It's just hold on because it keeps logging me out of the email.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:04.920
So I'm very, very irritated right now. That's not good. Well, that's the joys and

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.120
adventures of doing live radio. Because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:12.840
And those of you guys that listen to us through the podcast feed, you should try to join us

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:17.400
sometime. I mean, I know Game of Thrones is on and all, but you can pirate it later like everybody

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:22.840
else does. That's what Netflix is for. Well, actually Game of Thrones ain't on Netflix.

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:27.240
You have to HBO special. They do their own app. But anyway, we've got, we've got mail.

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:32.760
Hey guys, this show is awesome. You make a boring data entry. So much more exciting for me here at

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:37.960
work. I heard you need more emails. So I'm going for it. I just started playing torchlight too.

02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:43.080
And it was my very first top down RPG experience. I started co-op with a buddy at the hardest

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:48.360
difficulty. I seem to die every five minutes. Any tips? Start on easy and practice.

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:54.120
Yeah. Honestly, you answered your own question. Uh, you've got it. You got to tone it down

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:59.880
and practice and then work your way up to that. I don't remember with torchlight to either if it's

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:05.480
like Diablo, the thing in Diablo, you start on the easiest difficulty, get gear, and then you

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:10.040
can amp up the difficulty to get better drops. And then once you get into like torment, which is the

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:13.560
hardest difficulty, you get like the best drops in the game. So you do have to work your way up.

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:17.560
I can't remember in torchlight. I have played torchlight and I liked torchlight to an awful lot.

02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:21.240
I can't remember if it was that similar thing where you can take that character and move them

02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.240
through different difficulty levels. I don't recall, but if you can, I would suggest doing

02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:30.840
that for sure. But, uh, I, I think you actually answered your own question. If you really want to

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:35.480
otherwise, like you're all gung ho about, Nope, we're going to do this in the hardest difficulty

02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:41.720
from the outset, then you gotta be prepared to die a lot. But I would say, know when to go in

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:47.320
and retreat. And especially in those types of games, I find that if you get just a little too

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:52.840
close, like you're running too fast, you'll pull a whole pack of mobs at once. So I would say,

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:59.320
move slowly, take it slowly. I still say, go start easier so that you can learn the mechanics

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:03.800
while you have an opportunity to use said mechanics. That would be my first answer as

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.920
well. But if, if for whatever reason you guys are like, Nope, we're going to do this

02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:11.560
the hardest way and get our achievements and that's what we're going to do, then that would

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:16.200
be my strategy is make sure you're moving slowly. So you don't pull a whole screen of mobs at once.

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:21.160
All right. Um, also I really prayed that Titanfall would be the Call of Duty killer,

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:26.040
but at least on PC, the active player count has gone way down to the point where a couple

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:30.280
playlists are completely empty. I think it's because the game is too difficult for Call of

02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:34.280
Duty newbies who can't take their shooter skills vertical. What do you guys think?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:42.440
I think I don't like either game, so, um, I'm more interested in Titanfall and Call of Duty for sure.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.080
Um, just, you know, I, I liked more of the sci-fi stuff and you know, that's why I was in a Mass

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:52.760
Effect and so forth. But, um, I haven't really played it on PC. My assumption is that the player

02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:58.520
base is probably dwindling because a lot of attention gets diverted in other directions on PC

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.840
and especially with the cost of the game being a little high, you probably really only have the

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.320
diehards in there right now. I would imagine as soon as the game gets discounted, which is going

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:11.400
to be a little bit because EA doesn't always discount right away, but once the game does

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.680
get discounted, you'll probably see a lot more people jumping on board with that real quick.

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:20.280
Just give it a little time. It's probably a game that's going to build slowly. Um,

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.800
and I think a lot of people, you know, on the Xbox one, that was the big game for the month.

02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:31.400
So you're going to have people that kind of last a little longer, the pool of players on there,

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.080
because there's not a bunch of other stuff on the Xbox one competing for attention right now.

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.280
Have a wonderful Sunday and keep gaming guys. That's from EA Skizie.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.600
Thank you EA Skizie.

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:43.960
Next up.

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.560
Good luck typing. Because they said data entry was their thing.

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:52.600
I don't have any ideas, any idea what prompted this discussion topic,

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:57.400
but what major video game characters slash enemies come to mind? His primary attack

02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:04.120
is self-destructing. I was thinking of Dan Hibiki because his version of the Shingoku

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:10.120
Satsu takes him down to like one bar of life. Um, the four most obvious ones to me would be

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:17.080
the creepers in Minecraft, the Bob-ombs from Mario Brothers, um, two, sorry, and the Pokemon

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:22.280
Voltorb and its evolution electrode and possibly the prenees from Disgaea. And that's from Robert

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:28.120
M. Optional P.S. I heard Weird Al's your horoscope for today and check to see if there

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:33.560
was an AMV style video redundant for a certain web comic, which of course there is.

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:36.840
That homestuck.

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.440
Yeah, even I got that reference from the shirt talk you were talking about later.

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.640
Thank you for the email. What a random question, but you hit all the big ones. I would have

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.880
thought of the prenees from Disgaea too, but one that you didn't name since we've been on

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:54.040
a Final Fantasy kick tonight. There's always some type of bomb. Yeah, there's a bomb,

02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:58.280
mobs, grenade, or whatever they call it in the game. And their big attack is, uh, exploding.

02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:03.640
So you have to kill them before they explode and kill you. It's almost always in a Final

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:04.760
Fantasy game. There's one of those.

02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.480
Doesn't one of the weapons kill itself if you can't kill it in seven or was that something

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.040
else I'm thinking of?

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.480
I think so. It has been forever.

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:18.280
Some enemy will, oh, uh, pyramid head. If you don't beat, well, when you technically,

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:25.640
when you beat the red pyramid, it actually turns and lands on, he lands on his, uh, knife.

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:26.140
That's right.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:29.960
So not that it's an attack that's self-destructing,

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.960
but that you don't get to be the one to get the kill hit really.

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.840
Flaco Jones, you a big fan of any self-destructing mobs in video games?

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.360
I hate self-destructing mobs in video games.

02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:43.160
Very random question.

02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.120
Me and PvP.

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:49.640
Chrono Trigger has those ones that they give you tons of XP and everything,

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.400
but you have to kill them before they self-destruct. There's those like rock things.

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.400
Uh, when you're up on the mountain.

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.040
Yeah.

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:56.540
Yeah.

02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:57.880
Me and Spelunky.

02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.720
That for me, that's like a race. Like I got the XP because they're so good for farming on,

02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:04.280
but if they blow up ahead of time, you don't get anything.

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.760
Uh, me and Spelunky, I self-destruct myself all the time in that frustrating ass game.

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:10.440
That's for sure. All right.

02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.120
Little big planning to blow yourself up.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.480
They just did that to work around people getting stuck on their terribly designed levels.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.920
You know, the first one I thought of was, was Dan in Street Fighter.

02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:25.960
Cause he has his, that the screen goes black, everything. And he's like, almost,

02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:29.080
he does die if you're, if you don't have a full life bar.

02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:34.200
So, and then it does like two bars on the enemy or something like that.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.840
Well, that was a random ass question, but you know what? I like random questions. So thanks.

02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:40.600
This is the random show.

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.720
Um, last email then. Greetings, OLR. Since you have been light on emails lately,

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:48.920
I figured I'd send one that I'd been batting around for awhile.

02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:51.240
This has to do with the dream I once had as a child.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.680
At the time, the dream had tormented me due to its promises. And I'm wondering nowadays

02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:58.920
if I was really onto something ahead of its time.

02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:05.800
Run the clock back to mid 1991 with the SNES American release, uh, quickly approaching.

02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:09.240
Having finally discovered the true glory of RPGs,

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:12.680
I was positively salivating over the intended power coverage

02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:16.680
of the incredible looking Final Fantasy II, which was IV over there.

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.680
For the upcoming powerhouse of a system, the game was consuming my every waking

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.560
moment until it finally snaked its way into my dreams.

02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:26.120
Now, I didn't actually dream about the game itself per se,

02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:29.960
but rather I dreamed about the act of owning it.

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.000
You see, in my dream, not only did I own the cartridge for the game,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.880
I would transform it to fit whatever system I tried to put it on.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.520
Game Boy or SNES.

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:41.560
Much like the cross-saved functionality of Sony's products today,

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.240
I was carrying this game with me and playing it constantly.

02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.280
At the time, the dream just left me frustrated and impatient,

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.120
and I can't help but feel like decades ago,

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.320
I foreshadowed the way I'm currently playing Final Fantasy X and X-2.

02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.040
So, OLR crew, have you ever had any particular memorable dreams involving gaming,

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.160
whether it be about a game itself or just the act of gaming?

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.640
My most sincere apologies to everyone

02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:07.560
if I tap into Hidden Well of Nocturnal Subconscious Mass Effect slash fiction.

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:11.800
Keep up the great work, and thanks for the hours of entertainment.

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:13.160
Sincerely, Awesome Unicorn.

02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:16.440
A dream involving video games.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.280
I know, I had one, actually, I can tell you right now.

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:18.600
Okay.

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.440
This is how I figured out how to play DDR properly.

02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:24.680
It's because I actually, because I kept doing the step back to the middle thing

02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.560
that everybody does when they're new, and then I just like, I went to bed,

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:32.120
and then I started dreaming about moving from arrow to arrow,

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:35.480
and then I got up and played the game fine the next day.

02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:41.320
I went from doing like three star, or three foot songs,

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:44.920
to going right into, you know, sixes with no problem.

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:51.320
So it was just, it was just a sort of an occur to me kind of thing.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440
I don't really remember dreams.

02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.400
I'm one of those people, like some people can't remember their dream,

02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:59.800
which is funny because we were talking about my memory issues earlier in the show,

02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:04.440
but like for real, once in a great, great, great, great while I'll have a dream that I remember,

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.320
but it's so rare, like, and not nothing I can think of that involves video games, actually.

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:10.120
Sorry.

02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:15.160
I do almost, almost always remember at least something I would have dreamt the night before.

02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:16.360
I'm a lucid dreamer.

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.000
No, not me.

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:22.040
So like, wow, that's one thing that that always crept into my dreams.

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.480
It's like, because you stop playing, but the game is so like,

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:27.400
I don't know, monotonous, I guess, in a way.

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.560
I just, I would go to sleep and I would just imagine I'm still grinding on something.

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.960
You have to go to kill 10 chickens in your sleep.

02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.880
Yeah, killing like, I'm still doing all this.

02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:36.840
It really is like that.

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.160
It's weird, but it's not, it's not a bad dream.

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:39.960
It's like, hey, cool.

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.480
I'm still questing while I'm sleeping.

02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:42.360
And it's fun.

02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.560
My wife has them too.

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.360
She tells me all the time.

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.040
She's like, oh, I just, I just dreamed I was like riding my mount through the barrens.

02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:49.400
And that's just something that happened.

02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:51.880
At least in the dreams, there's no barrens chat.

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:52.600
At least not for me.

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.160
I did kind of have the dream about, wow, one time.

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.080
Do you remember after, this was when we were still on Blade's Edge,

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:03.160
and I was playing as Rebecca Black when I finally decided to level her.

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:03.660
Yes.

02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:08.360
And the one guy was following around, making up his own lyrics to Friday.

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:12.920
I dreamt about that last night that I was playing through like

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:17.960
a 16 bit version of wow, with that being the background music.

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:19.320
That's awesome.

02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.880
With me playing on Rebecca Black.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.160
It was pretty funny.

02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:24.520
Wow.

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.280
What, what made you want to roll a character named Rebecca Black in the first place?

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.360
I was bored and I was going to make a tank.

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:31.800
And so I couldn't think of a name.

02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:32.840
So just made Rebecca Black.

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:34.360
Did you roll the character on Friday?

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.120
I don't know.

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:39.640
However, those details are important.

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:44.280
I use the dorky human female with the long black hair.

02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:46.680
So the only, the only human female model.

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.280
Well, yeah, but she had the, the one with the long black hair.

02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.760
Yeah, but she had the, the long black hair and everything.

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:53.260
Okay.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:55.720
And, um, I actually got her to 85.

02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:56.780
Wow.

02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:02.120
And I had one person drop out of a Headless Horseman pug.

02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:08.280
Because, and our healer, mind you, I ain't healing Rebecca Black.

02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:11.880
And oh hell no drop.

02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:14.600
Well, next week I'll know to ask you, I'll say,

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:16.440
Hey, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:17.400
And you'll say something like,

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:25.240
I super like Saturday.

02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:28.280
Oh, the sequel song that she did.

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:29.880
It's actually really good.

02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.380
Yeah.

02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:34.680
It's actually like, she's actually learned how to sing.

02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:37.800
Uh, but it's not, it's not technically her, is it?

02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:38.760
It's her and somebody else.

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:44.600
Well, no, she's her and some other guy, but it's mostly her.

02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.520
I like Conan's version of Thursday.

02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:49.480
That's my favorite parody.

02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:54.200
Uh, let me see if I can get a little clip of Saturday here for Flaco Jones.

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:56.520
And if you're pissed and I'm playing this, blame Flaco Jones.

02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:58.760
Don't, don't play it.

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:00.280
No, you can't blame me.

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.680
The lyrics are actually kind of funny.

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.640
The lyrics are for Friday or Friday.

02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:17.560
We so excited.

02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:20.520
Look, she wrote in the sand.

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:21.560
So excited.

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:22.600
Oh my gosh.

02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:25.960
So she made a parody video.

02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:26.600
Pretty much.

02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:27.960
Pretty much.

02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:31.960
And like my favorite side is the guy who's singing it with her.

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.120
She's like, Oh my God, come over.

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:35.400
You know, completely messing up.

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:36.440
And he's like, sure.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:40.680
As soon as I find my pants, it was really funny.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:41.320
I thought it was,

02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:47.080
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf is cursing out Flaco Jones in our chat room and revoking all of his loot.

02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:49.960
I said, don't play it.

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:53.560
I actually, I actually do.

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.880
Saturday is sort of like my guilty pleasure song now.

02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:58.920
I hated Friday because I can't stand auto tune out of tune.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:00.600
Okay.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.560
Saturday is actually good.

02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:03.240
Everybody has a guilty pleasure song.

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.520
Well, if I'm already having all my loot revoked, then just play Chinese food.

02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:08.680
Is that your favorite?

02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:09.720
Is that your guilty pleasure song?

02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:10.760
The Chinese food song.

02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.120
It is now take down the network.

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:19.800
Uh, my favorite guilty pleasure song is two one two by Asphiela Banks.

02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.480
But anyway, just listen to it on your own time.

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:25.160
I confusion.

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.360
All right, Rob, I have to have paintberry tonight.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:29.800
It's Easter Sunday.

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.840
They're probably closed.

02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.040
So we'll break in.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:35.400
All right.

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:36.200
Yes.

02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:37.320
Thank you, gamer girl.

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:37.880
I agree.

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:41.880
What says, Oh my, Rebecca Black actually has a voice.

02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:46.360
Well, she was only like 13 when that Friday thing, but that's why I couldn't like some

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.760
she's actually done more music since then.

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:51.960
Some of the things that people said about her when that video is huge.

02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.720
I was like, you know, she's like 13, right?

02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:58.840
Did you know that they did a Rebecca Black, uh, reacts video to Friday?

02:19:58.840 --> 02:19:59.320
Oh yeah.

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:01.320
And it's her reacting to it two years later.

02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:04.920
My favorite was, there was, um, there was like a, it was, it was either death metal

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:06.840
or screamo version of Friday.

02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:07.160
Funny.

02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:10.600
And I'll still post that on people's Facebook to this day.

02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:17.080
Not good shooting any conversation.

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.080
The best thing to come out of Friday was gang fight.

02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:20.680
Yeah.

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.240
The bad lip sync or whatever, which I still have.

02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.120
Don't, don't judge me.

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.480
I still have it on my playlist.

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:25.800
All right.

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:29.640
So, uh, somehow our emails on dreams turn into a discussion on Rebecca Black.

02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:33.080
So thank you to the emailers.

02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:34.280
Man, that's my fault too.

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.080
I talked about, wow.

02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:36.120
All right.

02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.040
Uh, any other emails tonight or is that it?

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.320
That was it.

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.040
And I'm sorry.

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:41.000
SSJ 100, Matt.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.840
Your email was super long and we already talked about it, but I still love you.

02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.280
I hope you're enjoying Passover.

02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:46.600
All right.

02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:49.960
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:52.280
If you'd like dark soccer to dismiss your email as well.

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:55.640
I acknowledge it right from the beginning.

02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:56.440
Oh my God.

02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:02.920
Rob, I can't believe that you, you know what I can't, I can't now thrice acknowledge.

02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:03.960
This is me.

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.160
Unable to cancel.

02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.120
Oh, she is unable to even right now.

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:08.920
I can't even.

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:10.600
It's happened.

02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:12.840
It's it's not happened.

02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:17.480
It's it just, I just right now.

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:17.980
Okay.

02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:20.360
Dark soccer is getting wound up.

02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:31.800
You guys, you know what that means?

02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:38.600
It's the can't evens of the week.

02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:39.480
Dark Sakura.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.840
Marissa's in chat.

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:41.640
Hi, Marissa.

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:43.560
We love you, Marissa.

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:44.600
Why aren't you here, Marissa?

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:45.080
I can't.

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:46.520
I can't either.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:50.040
Uh, but, um, fuck.

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.160
Um, this thing that's suddenly appeared on the side of my face.

02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:54.600
It hurts.

02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:58.920
It's because I've been, it was because.

02:21:58.920 --> 02:21:59.800
Are they flames?

02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.600
No, that was Victoria already today.

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:05.320
I'm rehashing jokes.

02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:07.400
On the side of my face.

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.480
No, well, no.

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:15.960
I was going to say, um, I've been eating nothing but crap and my body feels like crap and I

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:17.320
miss the gym a whole lot.

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.080
So just F you.

02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:20.120
Gym's right here.

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:20.920
Yeah, I'm right here.

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:22.520
Yeah.

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.640
Can I bench press you?

02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:25.400
I don't know.

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:29.160
I had, remember four hot dogs and a hamburger and a pile of potato salad today.

02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:30.680
Probably not.

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:35.320
But I miss, I miss being more active like that and how good I felt all the time.

02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:47.000
And so, and this weird gas, it's like having to burp and can't burp.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
So I actually literally can't right now.

02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:54.520
Literally can't, uh, my, a few of the weeks, the stark soccer, I brought her up.

02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:58.520
My few of the week goes to Victoria because you know, of all the years I've been doing

02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:00.120
these shows and have known Victoria.

02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:02.760
I think she's only ever been on OLR once.

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:05.400
And that was back when we were in the garage studio.

02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:06.600
It was way too long ago.

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.920
Victoria, get your ass over to Bob.

02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:13.800
Yeah, she needs a game of throne show on the network or something like that.

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.360
She call it chair of swords.

02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:18.920
Something game of complaints.

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.600
That's all you people will do to watch that show.

02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:21.880
You just complain a lot.

02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:22.360
All right.

02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.440
Uh, or game of spoilers.

02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.760
Game of spoilers for a 10 year old book.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:30.520
Uh, Blanco Jones, your FUs of the week.

02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:32.040
Uh, it says, Loki's not here.

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:37.560
I'll complain about bad drivers, uh, trying to get here today and like stuck behind a

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:39.480
slow moving car, but it's like a Mercedes.

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:40.600
Like drive your car faster.

02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:43.320
If you have an expensive car, you can afford to get tickets to drive faster.

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:49.160
Of course I finally pass him and he's like, he's like drinking a soda and looking down

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:49.960
at a phone.

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:52.840
So of course it's like, all right, well, at least he can kill anybody.

02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:55.180
All right.

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:56.440
There it is.

02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:59.080
Your FUs of the week.

02:23:59.080 --> 02:23:59.800
Love it.

02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:00.040
All right.

02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:01.160
One more story for you guys.

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:02.840
And then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:04.760
Cause we want you to call in and be with our show.

02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:09.720
Uh, one eight seven seven game, O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.480
And the last story tonight has to go with a sale.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.720
And it's something you want to get now on sale because the game will no longer be available

02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:25.960
after April 30th, a moment of silence internet for burger time world tour.

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:27.480
That's right.

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:32.360
The moderate envisioning to one of the greatest classic video games of all time,

02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:37.320
time, time, time, time is, uh, no longer going to be a thing.

02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.520
And let's be real.

02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:45.640
The re-imagining was kind of jank, but it was a great game, uh, back in the eighties.

02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:48.680
And, you know, we, we love these reimaginings of games.

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:54.680
They, they remind us of the past a little bit, but anyhow, uh, the game is on sale on

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:56.440
Xbox live arcade PlayStation network.

02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:59.640
And we were for $4 and 99 cents.

02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:05.320
Monkey paw who published the game is, uh, having some expired licensing agreements for

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:08.120
Peter pepper and all his, all his friends.

02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.680
Cause monkey paw games didn't create burger time.

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:12.840
They had to license it from somebody else.

02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:19.320
So burger time world tour will be a shutdown by the food and drug administration on April

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:20.120
30th.

02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:25.960
I guess, I guess, I guess you could call it, say that this video game got assaulted.

02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:30.520
I could see the pun coming from so far away.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:32.600
You weren't doing it.

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.400
I was face palming before you said it all the way.

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:36.840
That was a preemptive face palm.

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:39.800
I love burger time.

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.640
Who doesn't, who doesn't people that don't know their games?

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:44.360
That's who all right.

02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:50.120
One eight seven seven game, O L R or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.400
You can give us a call right now and we can talk about anything we've talked about on

02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:56.280
the show world tonight so far, or maybe you have something else you want to bring up with

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:57.960
us or what have you.

02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:01.400
This is where I'd usually turn to Loki and go, Hey, you have any last minute news, but

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:02.360
he's not here.

02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:04.280
Flaco, you have any last minute news?

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.560
Uh, I wish I could drink more beer, but I have to drive home.

02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:09.800
I'm going to leave that last can for another day.

02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:09.960
Yeah.

02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:11.080
So I save it for a rainy day.

02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:13.000
How do you like it by the way?

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.360
It's pretty, it's pretty hoppy.

02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:15.720
It's, it's an interesting kind of flavor.

02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:18.120
It's not as dark as it was in a hoppy brew.

02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:18.680
Is that where it is?

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:19.080
Very hoppy.

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.240
Yeah, it's, it's, it's an IPA and you pay a little.

02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:23.320
So yeah, it's hot, but it's got a nice maltiness.

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.680
It kind of offsets the bitterness.

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:25.000
Yeah.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.040
I like it.

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:26.360
All right.

02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:27.560
Hey, we've got a call coming in.

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.120
Talk.

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.280
We'll, we'll ask our caller if there's any last minute stories.

02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:30.520
Hi.

02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:31.320
I'm orange launch radio.

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:31.720
Who's this?

02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.240
That's your residence.

02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:35.720
Your favorite anime con whore Rama.

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.640
Hey, anime con whore Rama.

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.080
Were you a wonder con this weekend?

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.840
Uh, no, I was at sleep con.

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:45.880
You know what, with all the cons you go to, I'm not surprised at all.

02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:48.760
You don't, or that you, you have to sit one out once in a while.

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:49.560
Yeah.

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.440
Cause I'm gear.

02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:50.600
Yeah.

02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:55.240
Cause after PAX East and Castle Point, we're gearing up for another con this

02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:57.000
weekend and another one after that.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:57.560
Oh God.

02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.520
What's this weekend?

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:00.520
Uh, Zenkai con.

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:04.680
It's a local con out in Philly, Lancaster County area.

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.360
And after that as a con, I think the entire OLR staff should go to call it

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:13.480
as a 21 plus convention in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.760
Oh, this could be a fun convention.

02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:19.400
No, not a con is not Otacon.

02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:20.840
Oh sure.

02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:21.080
Okay.

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:22.040
All right.

02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:23.160
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:28.040
Well, we're talking about something a little bit different now, just out of

02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:33.320
curiosity, have you ever heard of record store day only this year?

02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.040
Yeah, I heard about it this year.

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:41.240
I didn't know about it from years past, but apparently this is the fifth or sixth

02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:41.640
year.

02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.320
I think it's, it's a similar thing to like free comic book day, right?

02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.880
Where they try to entice people to go, you know, fuck iTunes and, and, uh,

02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:52.120
Amazon MP3 stores and all that.

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.080
And, and go back to the roots of the, of a retail music store, I believe is the,

02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:58.280
the concept behind it, right?

02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:00.280
Yeah, that, yeah.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.320
Which is pretty cool.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.400
I didn't even know about it till late Friday night till a couple of the nerd

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:10.200
core rappers I follow on Facebook linked me to a special album that was coming

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:12.040
out as part of record store day.

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:12.280
Yeah.

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:16.760
Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to play a quick track from it.

02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.680
Cause I think everybody here knows it.

02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:19.640
Okay.

02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.560
Can you hear it?

02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:24.120
No.

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:25.720
Yeah.

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:28.280
Well, if you can't hear it, then my system sucks.

02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:28.920
Well, anyway.

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.720
Is that the Manamanaguchi song?

02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:32.760
Oh, yup.

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:34.360
There we go.

02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.360
Yeah.

02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.760
I heard that there was something involved in the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack and them put

02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:46.760
out on LP, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game.

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:48.920
Hmm.

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:50.040
That's awesome though.

02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:52.840
But yeah, a lot of people are saying they missed out on it.

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:56.440
Even Bobby and chat right now is saying they didn't allocate any of the video game releases

02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.320
to my local store.

02:28:57.960 --> 02:29:03.800
So, cause what happened was when I first heard about it, I pull up the list and I'm like,

02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:07.080
okay, I'm going to do some side questing and find it.

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:09.720
Cause I got four requests on Facebook to find this.

02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:12.040
One person never got back to me.

02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:17.080
Another person found it in Ohio and our friendly neighborhood Mexicans getting the other copy

02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.360
I was able to track down for him.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.240
Well, you can always buy it on eBay for like 50 bucks.

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:22.840
That's okay.

02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.680
I'm keeping my copy sealed.

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:27.800
I went to like three different stores called two.

02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:29.640
Most of them all said we didn't get it.

02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:31.800
So I found a place called turntable lab that had it.

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:34.300
Huh.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:36.680
Well, congrats on your find.

02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:39.080
Thank you.

02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:43.080
I kind of wish I did have a turntable lab to be perfectly honest.

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:46.360
I'm going to keep this sealed just for sentimental value.

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:50.920
Cause when we have kids, when we pull this out, they're going to be like, what is that?

02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:55.240
And then we'll have to sit down and explain to him to them back in the day before it was

02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:01.560
digital music, before it was CDs, you had cassettes, LPs, and we go back a little bit

02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:03.000
further eight track.

02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:06.600
Bobby Black Wolf says they only made like 2000 of them.

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:09.240
And there were 1200 stores participating in record store day.

02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:11.240
So that's why they were kind of hard to find.

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:15.080
I would show, you know, if you're going to show you talk to your grandkids about records,

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:19.400
show them those pictures of like a record player and the needle in the record at like

02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:20.680
1000 magnified.

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:24.040
Cause it's really cool what those things look like close up like that.

02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:26.600
That sounds like a great idea.

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:30.760
It's like an old episode of three, two, one contact or something like that.

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:31.560
Well, that's cool.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.880
I'm glad you were able to get out there on record store day.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.360
Anything else to share with listeners tonight?

02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:41.560
Let's see.

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:46.840
Oh, besides the fact that Dr. Luigi and fan Mario were a smash hit at PAX East, I can't

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:47.880
think of anything else.

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:52.040
Are you getting to see some of those pictures as they go up on the internet from PAX East?

02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:53.400
Yeah.

02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:57.400
Me and Marco are in a couple of videos that are flowing around at PAX.

02:30:57.400 --> 02:31:01.480
I shared on my Facebook page and I have to get my photos up as well.

02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:02.600
Very cool.

02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:03.640
Excuse me.

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:04.120
Very cool.

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:05.880
I'm glad to hear you guys had a good time at PAX East.

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:10.680
I, I really need to get it back out there for some, one of the PAX is obviously my feathers

02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:16.760
were a little ruffled at some of the comments that they'd made and just the, how fast that

02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:17.560
shit sells out.

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.800
And I'm usually working during the day when those tickets go on sale.

02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:21.880
So I'm gonna have to be a little more on it in the future.

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:24.120
So well, do what I do.

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:27.640
If you got friends at you that you, I got friends I have room with every year.

02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:29.400
It's like, we sit there and plan.

02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:34.120
One person handles the, the credit cards and the badges.

02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.520
Then I handle the credit cards and the hotel room because whoever has the best internet

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:42.280
can handle, you know, and we just delegate like that and we get shit done.

02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:45.880
Well, I am, I am hoping to do something like that, at least for Dragon Con.

02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:49.560
I've kind of got some like that running and who knows, I'm hoping to get out properly

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:53.400
to the, I would say the East coast, but Atlanta's really East coast to me.

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:57.480
So to the Northeast coast soon, because it's been forever since I've been to NYC.

02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:58.200
Been forever.

02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:58.840
Yes.

02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:03.320
You need to come and hang out for a weekend, have a good time with the, with the New York

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:04.120
OL army.

02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:06.440
I will, I will make it a point to do so soon.

02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:11.400
And if nothing else, the motivation of Neil Patrick Harris's Hedwig is a huge, huge motivation.

02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:15.880
A friend of mine saw, saw that yesterday and got, got his autograph.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.520
Well, consider me a jealous bitch.

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:23.560
Oh, Rob, what are we going to do with you?

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.280
The same thing you've done with me for 12 years.

02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:26.840
All right, Rama.

02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:27.800
I'm going to let you go get more calls.

02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:29.320
That's illegal in 38 states.

02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:31.560
Not this one.

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:31.880
All right.

02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:33.320
Hey, yo.

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.280
Bye Rama.

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:34.600
Bye.

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:40.760
That's illegal in 38 states, but I thought the Supreme court, nevermind.

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:41.080
All right.

02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:46.040
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:48.280
Give us a call and we'll talk.

02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:49.560
Whatever you'd like.

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.240
I must apologize.

02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:53.160
I have lost my connection to the chat room.

02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:53.400
What?

02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:54.920
Unacceptable.

02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:55.240
I know.

02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:55.960
Just kidding.

02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:56.280
All right.

02:32:56.280 --> 02:32:58.920
We do, we do have more calls coming in, so let's get to it.

02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:00.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:00.520
Who's that?

02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:01.400
Who's this?

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:01.960
Hello.

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:04.920
Is this Marissa?

02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:06.600
Yes, it is.

02:33:07.880 --> 02:33:08.840
How you doing, girl?

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.120
I'm good.

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:10.760
How are you?

02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:14.840
I have nothing relevant or on topic to talk about, but I'm sure that we'll have a giggle

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:15.800
fest anyway, right?

02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:16.680
Who gives a shit?

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:18.120
It's Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:20.600
We don't have to talk.

02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:21.960
We'll talk about whatever we want.

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:23.640
Damn it.

02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:24.200
Yeah.

02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:27.880
One of these days I will come up there and we'll do a series of episodes and then we'll

02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.520
like syndicate it and we'll be Robin Rose's giggle time.

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.840
I have a computer good enough to do YouTubes now.

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.280
We can, we can look at doing something like that.

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:34.760
It'd be fun.

02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:38.360
Well, you're talking about cons earlier.

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:38.760
It's funny.

02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:41.000
I wonder con has been going on down here.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I have not been able to sneak my way in.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:47.400
I didn't get a ticket at the last second and then a friend offered me one at the last second,

02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.640
which would require me driving two, three hours.

02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:54.040
You know, but by the time I got there, the ticket would have been useless, but it was

02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:54.520
just funny.

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.960
Anyway, everyone that went there had a wonderful time and they had a great, um, uh, voice actor

02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.440
panel and you know, that, that's my shtick, but everyone has been saying good things about

02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:04.520
it.

02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:05.400
Yeah.

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:10.200
It would do wonder con happened on two coasts at the same time or something because I know

02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:13.320
there were people going to LA, but I had some friends in the Northeast that were going to

02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:13.880
something too.

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:17.880
So I guess there was like a bi-coastal con or something going on.

02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:20.360
Sweetheart, I live in Los Angeles.

02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:21.640
There's other parts of the world.

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:24.680
Typical Los Angeles.

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:33.160
I hadn't heard about that, uh, heard about that, but I was hearing the feedback and people

02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.280
were having a great time.

02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:35.000
Yeah.

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:36.600
It's funny though.

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.440
I wasn't able to go and I thought I was talking to Jamie about this might be able to appreciate

02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:45.960
it since you were talking about booze earlier as well since I can connect anything randomly.

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:51.160
Um, I didn't get to go that, but I got to go to my friend, uh, uh, my long time friends

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:57.080
since, uh, like, uh, elementary school, she had a birthday party and the Hollywood Hills

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.760
were getting all glam up in this shit.

02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:05.480
And there were some actually people involved in, in the gaming and whatnot, but it overlooked

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:09.480
the entire hall, you know, and I'm not used to getting into this, this type of glam stuff.

02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:12.840
You know, I'm like, well, I didn't make it to WonderCon, but at least this is fascinating.

02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:15.800
I can see all of LA and this beautiful house with the tower.

02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.120
And early on in the evening though, I decided to try rum.

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.680
Oh yeah.

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.200
I don't, I'm not a big drinker.

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:28.600
So, you know, like I just, you know, like I say stupid shit without any assistance.

02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:32.200
So, but here's the thing.

02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.080
Okay.

02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:36.840
So in my disappointment, not being able to make it to WonderCon, I'm like, okay, I'm

02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.640
going to have a good time.

02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:39.080
I'm going to get more social.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.960
I learned that rum makes me want to nap.

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:48.040
I motherfucking power nap that bitch.

02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:48.760
Okay.

02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:54.040
You want to talk about stars and celebrity and shit and all the magic of Los Angeles.

02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:54.600
Yeah.

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:56.840
I napped in every room of that house.

02:35:57.560 --> 02:35:58.120
Oh yeah.

02:35:58.760 --> 02:35:59.480
Uh huh.

02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:01.240
That's what I would do.

02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:04.920
That was, I used to be infamous at parties for drinking some Malibu and whatever, and

02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:06.440
then falling asleep under the table.

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:09.160
That's just, that's just how we roll.

02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:09.880
Yeah, exactly.

02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.920
Look, I can't, I just geek at a party.

02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:14.280
Like I can't even do that normally.

02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.840
It's like, yeah, like friends, like, how'd you have that big glamorous time?

02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.360
Like, Oh honey, the couch upstairs.

02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:21.720
Perfect.

02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:23.480
Look at our chat room.

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:26.200
Look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.560
Fifth dream in chat says her voice reminds me of someone a lot, but I can't think of

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:31.480
who an anime character maybe.

02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:33.800
Oh, I do that sometimes.

02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:34.680
Oh, I don't know.

02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:40.760
I love it when you slip into the voices.

02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:41.320
It's great.

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.520
You know, the funny thing was that I, I, you know, I, I studied this intently and I, and

02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:50.600
I love it, but the first time I ever, um, did anything with regard to anime, I was kind

02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.640
of nervous in the class and I wasn't sure what to do.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:55.320
So I thought, you know what?

02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:56.620
Fuck it.

02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:01.160
I'm going to do like the stereotype.

02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:07.400
And, um, I fully expected to be scolded, but I was just having a drop the mic moment.

02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:08.760
I was like, just fuck this.

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.320
I'm nervous.

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:11.320
I'm just going to go in and I'm going to going to do that.

02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:16.440
And I fully expected them to just drop their pens, you know, and go, this is very serious

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:21.000
business and there is so much more to this and you can't just stereotype.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.120
This is an art.

02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.880
But I went up there and like the last bite of the popsicle and I just did a round of

02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:26.280
applause.

02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:27.720
Like, yes, bravo.

02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:32.280
That's such an LA story.

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:40.360
I was so expecting to be reamed about the arts and everything, but brilliant.

02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:40.920
Brilliant.

02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:41.240
Yes.

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:41.720
Oscar.

02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:45.560
Fuck it.

02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.360
Where's my check?

02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:50.360
When in doubt, stereotypes.

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:56.040
Although there weren't two people in that room that found it a little too erotic.

02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:02.520
So, man, I'm just pissing off everyone.

02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:09.400
Marissa, I can't wait for the day that, you know, I find some Yuri video online and you're

02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:10.280
one of the voices.

02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:14.680
I would love that.

02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:19.080
But until then, everything probably for me, it seems to be like one nine hundred girls

02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:19.640
dot com.

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.360
That's like, what's going to be a tone app for me when I'm having that not so fresh

02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:24.840
feeling.

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:27.400
That's what happened.

02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.400
I tried to record like a professional sounding answering machine for myself.

02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.880
And you know how much like cell phone reception sucks.

02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:34.280
Yeah.

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:37.720
And but I just I just record it like bam, done.

02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:38.600
I didn't listen to it.

02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:43.240
But the message I found out later sounded like, hi, this is Marissa.

02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:46.920
I can't come to the phone right now, but I'd sure love to hear from you.

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:52.680
And then my doctor leaves me a message one day, you know, calling to say like, oh, you

02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.440
know, you're healthy from your physical and everything.

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:58.520
Just Marissa, what's just a sounding answering machine you have?

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.040
Which made sense.

02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:04.840
Looking back at the types of messages I received.

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:13.160
Marissa, you know, yes, you need to do a stand up comedy show where you just talk about your

02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:13.400
life.

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:14.600
And that is a compliment.

02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:20.280
I'm not like, not like saying like, Marissa, you're a crazy hoe.

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:21.400
Like, I'm not saying that.

02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:24.360
Like, you're really funny when you tell these nuts.

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:25.880
You got to put this shit on tape.

02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:28.920
No, I love you.

02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:32.360
Marissa, I love you, too.

02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.480
Thanks for calling in the show.

02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:35.480
I don't give a fuck that had nothing to do with games.

02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:36.520
It's always good to hear from you.

02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:39.000
All right.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.480
Well, it's always great to talk to you guys, too.

02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:42.440
Miss Jamie, my love.

02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:48.200
Getting a little your reaction going on right now.

02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:48.600
All right.

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:56.440
Consistently here that interestingly enough, voice actors talk about video games being

02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:57.720
the most challenging.

02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:59.080
I found that really interesting.

02:39:59.080 --> 02:39:59.480
Really?

02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:03.000
Yeah, this well, apparently doesn't pay as well either.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
But they're trying to work on that in the union.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.120
But well, aren't you normally like in a booth by yourself instead of around with other people?

02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:16.280
Well, only American, you know, like only American animation is traditionally when you work with

02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:20.680
other people, which is considered like the height and the best, you know, the best art.

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.520
But with video games, you know, they rush to push it out so much.

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:27.320
And yeah, you are often separated from the other actors.

02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:29.480
And sometimes they give you little context.

02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:31.480
And then you have to do all the various efforts.

02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.040
It's very hard on actors vocal chords as well, too.

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.080
I bet with all the voice that goes into it.

02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:39.960
You know, you've got offers in our chair, by the way, over at live.voguenetwork.com

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:43.320
Bonds006 says I need Marissa to make a voicemail for my cell now.

02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:45.400
Who said that?

02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:47.400
Bonds006.

02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:50.200
Oh, Bonds006, hi.

02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:51.480
He's the sexiest guy ever.

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.040
You have to leave him answering machine messages as soon as possible.

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:57.960
Get back to him.

02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:58.460
Yes.

02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:00.360
Now hold on.

02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:01.880
You got to charge listeners for this.

02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:03.320
We got a fun vog somehow.

02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:06.040
Pay $10 get sexy Marissa talk.

02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:07.240
All right, Marissa.

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:09.960
I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.240
But thank you so much, Marissa.

02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:12.840
A great night, you guys.

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:13.480
I love you.

02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:13.980
Take care.

02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:16.120
Oh, God.

02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:17.480
Always great to hear from her.

02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:18.600
You know, here's the thing, though.

02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.360
I know Marissa is a big fan of the thief series of video games.

02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.200
So seeing as that new thief just came out, she probably didn't want to talk about it.

02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.040
She probably didn't want to talk about it.

02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:30.520
Based on what I've heard about that, she probably didn't want to talk about that, actually.

02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.400
I don't think that was a topic out of discussion.

02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:36.280
So, so we get, we get voicemail messages instead.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:37.320
I don't mind whatsoever.

02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:38.540
All right.

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:41.960
Now people in chat.

02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:42.520
Now me.

02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:42.760
Yeah.

02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:43.560
Okay, now me.

02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:47.740
I love it.

02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:49.100
All right.

02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:49.800
Let's see.

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:54.200
I'm trying to go to the Twitter while we wait for some more calls over at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:56.760
or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.240
Bonds006 says, I'll lose my job with that.

02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:03.080
Let's see.

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.560
DarkTetsuya tweeted us saying, I found an interesting homebrew MSX game this week.

02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:09.480
It's called Blue Warrior.

02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:12.520
It's a scrolling shooter with an amazing soundtrack.

02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:13.640
We'll have to check that out.

02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:17.560
I like, I like, I like homebrew games for old systems.

02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:19.960
Like, I love it when people make Atari 2600 games.

02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:20.600
It's like, why?

02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:22.360
Because.

02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:23.000
Why not?

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:23.480
Why not?

02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:24.680
Exactly.

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:26.280
Let's see.

02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.880
DaBlueGuy tweeted us and said, PlayStation 4 still outsold Xbox One in March, even though

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:34.920
with Titanfall.

02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:38.040
Yeah, that was news that was getting a bit of steam this week.

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:42.280
And if I'm not mistaken, haven't they sold worldwide?

02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:44.920
Haven't they sold more Wii Us than Xbox Ones?

02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:47.320
I mean, granted, Wii U has had a year up on it.

02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:49.000
But they're already almost tied.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
And like you said, they've had a year head start.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:51.640
That's true.

02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:52.920
But there's nothing to brag about.

02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:54.200
There's that cynical side of me.

02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:57.400
That's like, well, when's EA going to stop making games for Xbox One then?

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.400
If that's, you know, little bastards.

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:02.440
Yeah, I'm not trying to shade Nintendo.

02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:04.440
I'm trying to shade everybody that abandoned ship.

02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.800
But in all seriousness, it's the price difference straight up.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:12.840
Everybody's been saying this till they're blue in the face.

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:13.640
And it's true.

02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:16.040
Like they're charging the extra money for Kinect.

02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:18.120
Nobody understands why Kinect is needed.

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:20.280
I mean, I'm sure there's the Xbox loyalists.

02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:21.640
There's probably some Xbox fans out there

02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:23.560
screaming at me on their podcast right now.

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:25.000
Like, you don't understand.

02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:28.200
But it's like, no, most people don't give a shit.

02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:31.160
Well, shouldn't all that really matters in the end be the money?

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:32.360
If they're selling it for a higher price,

02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:35.640
they've probably made almost as much money as Sony has, right?

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:36.680
That's true.

02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:38.040
But there's $100 more.

02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:41.240
They've sold what we say two or three million fewer units.

02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:45.560
But that $100 for those millions of units adds up quick.

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:47.960
And can equal a lot of Sony sales, I would think.

02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:48.520
I don't know.

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:53.240
There's that fuzzy math too where Xbox sold to stores,

02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:56.360
but Sony sold through to homes.

02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:57.400
Yeah, I read that too.

02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:00.120
There's a bit of a difference between the numbers that are being reported.

02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.320
But I don't think it's doom and gloom for Microsoft

02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:07.240
because a lot of systems have a slow first quarter.

02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:08.920
Sony's just in a good position.

02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:12.360
This is where Final Fantasy XIV worked out well for him.

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:14.520
Sitting on Infamous Second Son and Drive Club

02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:16.600
are going to help them get through the year and some of those.

02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.240
So I think this is where that's paying off for them a little bit.

02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.400
I would say if we're at the holiday season and Xbox is still struggling,

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:24.760
then we've got a story.

02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:27.240
But for right now, a lot can still happen.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.720
Microsoft could come out in E3 and pronounce a price reduction.

02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:31.960
Yeah.

02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:33.720
I mean, it's not like they're doing poorly.

02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:37.880
Like you said, they've already sold, or like if you say to stores,

02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.360
they've still gotten close to you in a very smaller amount of time.

02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:43.800
Exactly.

02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:44.360
Exactly.

02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:49.960
But again, I don't want to also dump on Wii U is dead and all that

02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:53.640
because Mario Kart 8 is a big deal and Smash Brothers is going to be huge too.

02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:54.360
I've got a Wii U now.

02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:57.560
Of course, I didn't really help them out because I bought a used one.

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:01.560
Let's see.

02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:05.480
I think a lot of this other stuff is news that we covered earlier in the show.

02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:09.080
But if you want to tweet us sometime, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:11.880
I'll put out one more call for calls.

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:17.320
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:19.000
Um, let's see.

02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:24.200
Bonds double 06 says my brother-in-law came over today to help me upgrade my iMac.

02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:26.520
And he also asked why I don't have an Xbox one.

02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:29.960
And my reply was I won't buy it at the current price.

02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:34.360
Akuma JP says Xbox is dead to me though.

02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:35.720
Yeah, but you live in Japan.

02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:37.240
Xbox was always dead over there.

02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:39.080
Like, did they ever sell a lot of 360s?

02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:41.000
I mean, you think the Wii U sells bad here?

02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:43.480
Check the 360 sales in Japan.

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:43.980
Okay.

02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.720
And then, um, you know, the ones not even out there yet.

02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:53.080
So, you know, I'd be curious though, if they are going to make a big push in Japan, that's

02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:53.800
what the rumors are.

02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.640
Xbox one is supposed to be making a big push in Japan when they launch in the holiday.

02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:03.720
So you would expect to see at E3, what is that big Japanese based game exclusive going

02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:06.360
to be that they have in their back pocket?

02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:07.480
Is it Shenmue 3?

02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:09.960
No, it's probably not.

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:14.680
Cause even though that's the game that most people want on Xbox, Sega is in bed with Nintendo

02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.960
right now is seems to be where, you know, which is so weird being the eighties gamer,

02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:21.560
but Sega and Nintendo are besties.

02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:24.360
So I would expect any exclusives like that would be on Wii U.

02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.880
So anything's possible.

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:27.000
Anything's possible, certainly.

02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:28.200
All right.

02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:32.360
Um, well, I guess, I guess that's it.

02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.720
I guess nobody else is going to call in.

02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:38.120
Well, it is a slow, it is a bit of a slower night just because, you know, it's, it's a

02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:40.840
holiday and stuff and people are doing their dinners and things like that.

02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:46.280
But if you are listening to the show after the fact, and you want to send us something

02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:48.840
to talk about on a future show, you can always send us an email.

02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.560
Participate at orange down orange, lounge, radio.com is our email address.

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:56.840
And that's another great way you can participate with the show, or you can send us a tweet

02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:57.720
or anything else like that.

02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.560
Anyhow, it's about time we get around to wrapping up the show and going around and closing out

02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.760
shop for the night.

02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:07.640
Flaco, thank you so much for being here tonight, especially on short notice.

02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:10.360
I guess I gave you the short notice.

02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:10.840
That's okay.

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.400
I got back home and like, Hey, I wonder, I, I haven't even finished last week.

02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:19.400
So LR, cause like I said, I've had the week off, haven't really been commuting or going

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:20.200
to work and listening.

02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.320
I've just been, you know, hanging out with the family and going to San Francisco, having

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:24.040
fun times there.

02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:28.440
So yeah, but I heard pretty much right where I got to, he's like, Oh, we don't have anybody

02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:28.840
next week.

02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:30.280
I'm like, I wonder if they ever found someone.

02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:31.880
So send you a message.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:32.760
No, I was totally planning.

02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:35.000
I'll just be Jamie and I will just do a quick hour long show.

02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:37.160
Three hour show.

02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:37.800
Let's go.

02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:42.760
That would be and me, not, and I object object.

02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:43.800
I don't even care.

02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:44.120
All right.

02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:45.640
You know what?

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:47.960
I don't butcher grammar as bad as MTV.

02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:48.280
All right.

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:51.080
Anyway, Flaco, thank you for being here.

02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:52.040
You are always welcome.

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:53.320
You didn't break the show tonight.

02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:53.800
I didn't.

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:56.360
Well, I did with the Rebecca black stuff.

02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:01.080
Apparently that was, that was all you and not chat at all or Jamie or anything.

02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:02.680
It's all me, all you 100%.

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:06.680
But you're always welcome here and you did a great job tonight.

02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:07.000
Cool.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:08.920
I loved being here and I like the new place.

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:09.880
It's awesome.

02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:10.520
Me too.

02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:10.920
Hello.

02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:16.200
I know it is still a little echoey in here, but we're working on it.

02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:16.680
All right.

02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:18.200
Your final thought tonight for us, please.

02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.160
Oh, my final thought?

02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:21.240
My beer is good.

02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:22.360
I've sweated it all out.

02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:22.840
I'm good to go.

02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:24.280
All right.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.760
I want to thank you guys for listening to the show.

02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:31.080
And remember, if you do like orange on radio, all we ask is tell a friend or two about the

02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:31.240
show.

02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:32.760
You know, word of mouth is all we have.

02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:36.760
Even if you can't think of anybody to tell right off the top of your head, please leave

02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:41.000
us a nice review on Stitcher or iTunes or any place that you may have found this show

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.160
because those kind reviews go a long way in helping for exposure.

02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:49.000
My final thought for tonight before, and then we'll go over to Jamie.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.200
My final thought tonight is I can't wait for the first time in my life.

02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.880
I can't wait to edit tonight's show because, you know, I try to edit the show, which I

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.480
don't, I don't really edit it.

02:48:57.480 --> 02:48:58.680
I don't edit it for content.

02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:03.400
I just crop it, clean it up and say, I can't wait to edit tonight's show on the new computer

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:08.680
because usually like saving the YouTube file alone because YouTube is encoded at a different

02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:09.000
quality.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.680
It's 96 44 for YouTube.

02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:13.880
That file alone will take me 10 minutes to save.

02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:17.320
And I'm thinking on the new computer, maybe only a couple.

02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:18.520
I'm so excited to try.

02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:19.880
I'm going to be a time saver.

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:22.600
Yeah, money well spent because my time is valuable.

02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:23.080
Damn it.

02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:24.200
That's my final thought tonight.

02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:25.080
My time is valuable.

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:25.480
Damn it.

02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:27.000
Dark Sakura.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.160
Once again, happy birthday.

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:29.640
Thank you.

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:30.600
Thank you for the game.

02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:31.320
You're welcome.

02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:31.880
Enjoy it.

02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:32.760
Play it this week.

02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.120
I want a full report next week.

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:34.680
Okay.

02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:35.240
All right.

02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:37.400
And your final thoughts tonight are talker.

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:39.480
I'm, I'm actually hungry.

02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.920
And if Adilberto's is open, I'm getting a burrito and then tomorrow back on track.

02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:52.280
And I'm going to actually be visible with what I'm doing at the gym and do a regular report.

02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:54.600
So I'm actually making my own N seven challenge.

02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:55.960
Are you going to do gym selfies?

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.840
No, I'm not doing gym selfies.

02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:06.040
I'm going to actually, unless they're me sweating and red and sore after having dead lifted 110

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:06.680
pounds.

02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:09.160
I have a friend on Facebook that does gym selfies.

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.640
And that's the way he says, if you don't see me take a gym selfie today,

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:12.360
that means I didn't go.

02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:13.320
So I need to get yelled at.

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:15.800
So that's like his whole little, like he needs Facebook to police him.

02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:21.480
Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, um, everybody, I have a tumblr called dieting can bite me.

02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:24.040
My picture is King hippo.

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:30.040
And you're going to, well, yeah.

02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.520
And you're going to see, you're going to see activity on there.

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:37.640
And I made them making it public on the show because I, I need to play.

02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:41.320
I need to put things where people are going to see it for the purpose of accountability.

02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:44.680
But it's dieting can bite me dot tumblr.com.

02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:49.880
And I will, I'm going to make this a thing.

02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:50.440
All right.

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:57.720
And I'm going to try to, maybe I will be playing bravely default as my reward for gym time.

02:50:58.520 --> 02:50:59.320
There you go.

02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:00.280
You can play at the gym.

02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:02.920
No, I can't because I don't do hamster wheel stuff.

02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.440
Oh, I lift.

02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:05.400
I lift heavy weights.

02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:05.720
Fine.

02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:07.880
I like hamster wheel stuff.

02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:08.760
Yeah.

02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:11.960
But all that does is build up your endurance is it doesn't actually make you stronger.

02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:16.600
If I can lose fat doing it, it's something I need to be doing.

02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:17.800
Weights are better for that.

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:18.200
We'll see.

02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:18.600
We'll see.

02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:18.920
All right.

02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:20.520
That's it, everybody.

02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:23.640
Thank you very much for tuning into the show and we'll see you again next week.

02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:24.040
Next week.

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:26.280
I guess, I guess kind of a big number next week.

02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:26.680
I don't know.

02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:31.560
Like you hit your 10th episode, your 50th episode, your 100th episode, your 500th episode.

02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:32.920
And then it's like, well, what else?

02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:35.400
I guess there's always episode 1000.

02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:40.680
But can you believe we'll be in our fifties when we hit episode 1000.

02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:44.120
But tomorrow is episode or tomorrow.

02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:47.880
What the hell is wrong with you?

02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:52.440
Rob Roberts, next week, we will be hitting episode 550.

02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:54.280
So that's me.

02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:56.600
That's an episode of, or that's a multiple of 50.

02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:01.240
We need to actually celebrate episode 555 because we're just a little bit less than evil.

02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:04.440
I think, you know, what's funny is I think we joked like way back in the day.

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:05.800
We were like at episode 200.

02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.960
We're like, we're going to hit episode 666 in like 2016.

02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:11.800
And we always joked, Oh, we'll never get that far.

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.600
And now I'm like, we might actually get to episode 666 at this rate we're going.

02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:17.240
So we'll see.

02:52:17.880 --> 02:52:19.400
I think that we should never stop.

02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:21.480
That's the hope.

02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:26.520
I mean, it has to end someday, but no, I never, I don't.

02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:31.480
We're going to be dead and our voices will be digitized and we'll have, we'll be glad

02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:31.960
us.

02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:32.520
Hello.

02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:33.720
My name is Rob Roberts.

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.800
Welcome to another episode.

02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:37.720
There'll just be Marissa impersonating me.

02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:42.680
You know everybody, I'm Rob Roberts and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:46.760
You have reached a new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:50.360
Before we release the deadly neurotoxin.

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:53.640
All right, that's it.

02:52:53.640 --> 02:52:55.080
No, we're really closing up shop.

02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:55.640
We're done.

02:52:55.640 --> 02:52:56.360
We're out of here.

02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:57.640
Have a great night, everybody.

02:52:57.640 --> 02:52:59.640
