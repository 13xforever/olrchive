0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	April Fools is always a hoot now that we are Google Map Pokemon Masters and own our own flux capacitors
18000	20000	But the top joke this week was Amazon taking over our TV
20000	23000	Music, movies, and TV shows aren't new but they said it would play games too
23000	28000	Tell us your favorite joke on the show where every gamer has a voice
28000	32000	Wait, what? That wasn't on April 1st?
32000	34000	I guess I'm the fool
34000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
38000	40000	Yes, Jason, that actually happened
40000	42000	That is an actual, actual thing we'll get into later
42000	44000	Hi everybody, hi internet
44000	46000	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
46000	56000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this April the 6th of 2014 with episode number 547 of our show
56000	60000	Here with you guys at vognetwork.com
60000	64000	That's vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
64000	70000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
70000	72000	I'm here with you, I'm Rob Roberts
72000	76000	And joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
76000	78000	Hi
78000	80000	Hi, how are you?
80000	82000	Less frustrated, very happy
82000	84000	I just noticed, I'm like, yay, DarkSakura was able to get in the chatroom after all
84000	88000	Yeah, just still got a little bit of a headache from my movie adventures today
88000	90000	Yes, what did you go see today?
90000	94000	I went to see Captain America, Winter Soldier
94000	96000	It seems like everybody in the nation went and saw you
96000	100000	Well, it was just really freaking loud and the 3D hurt my eyes
100000	108000	It was just sort of too much of everything at once, so I figured that next time I go to a movie, I'm just going to start bringing earplugs and sunglasses
108000	110000	But was it good?
110000	116000	It was really good, but make sure that you stay not just for the after the special part of the credits, but after the all of the credits
116000	120000	Because trust me, it's a Marvel movie, it's safe for everything
120000	122000	Exactly, absolutely right
122000	128000	There it is, alright, well also joining us as he does every week, here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki
128000	132000	Hey, Loki, and you're not doing so well from what I understand, right?
132000	136000	Yeah, starting to get a little sick?
136000	140000	I hear you, you're your stay-at-home dad right now, right?
140000	146000	Just for a few weeks with the whole, they let you have leave when you have a new kid and all that stuff, right?
146000	148000	How's it going?
148000	152000	Oh, is your, are we not hearing Loki?
152000	154000	Sorry guys
154000	160000	Oops, Loki was muted, sorry about that Loki, try again, that's the joys of live radio everybody
160000	162000	Try again, Loki, how are you doing?
162000	164000	Congested
164000	166000	Congested in your home with the baby
166000	168000	Yes, I'm home with the baby
168000	172000	Let's see, so yeah, he just doesn't want to take a bottle
172000	180000	So I have to try to feed him and that usually takes about, I don't know, maybe an hour to get him to take an ounce
180000	184000	So it's like, come on, take the damn bottle
184000	190000	You need to get one of those fake boobies that dads get to be able to feed
190000	194000	There's no amount of niggling that's going to get that baby to take anything
194000	198000	I've had to do syringes just to get him to take something
198000	202000	I don't know, it's just because he's breastfed
202000	208000	We were doing both, we were feeding him a bottle at night and that kind of stuff
208000	212000	And then we kind of backed off on that and so he's just confused
212000	222000	That's fine, my son Josh wakes up at like 5.45 every day
222000	226000	Even though he doesn't have to wake up for school until like 6.45
226000	229000	But I get up every day at 5.45 now
229000	236000	But there's a nice three hour break in between when he gets up and when the baby gets up
236000	241000	My son usually gets up at 8.30 so I work on my computer and stuff
241000	249000	Either doing programming in Unity or just playing games or something
249000	254000	Until my son comes up and says, what are you doing? I want to watch that, do this
254000	258000	I was watching a game video the other day and he was telling me how to play the game
258000	262000	He's like, go up, go up! I'm like, it's a video, I can't do anything
263000	265000	So yeah, that's what it's been
265000	274000	And then I usually take him to Nellie for lunch and then he sleeps when they get back for an hour, hour, two hours
274000	280000	So is Josh at that age yet where he's actually, because you say he's standing up behind you while you're watching game videos
280000	282000	Is he at that age where he's actually able to play games?
282000	283000	No
283000	284000	No, he's not quite there yet?
284000	286000	He doesn't know how to do anything
286000	291000	I mean the best he can do is, I got him to play Forza Horizon a while back a little bit
291000	296000	Just because I have the whole racing setup where he could steer and need the pedals and everything
296000	300000	But he doesn't have the dexterity to do it on his own
300000	303000	And it's kind of hard to teach him because he's left handed
303000	308000	So I don't know how he would feel
308000	312000	But he's interested in pictures and stuff
312000	317000	I had him watch a Mega Man video today, like I put that on while I went and did something
317000	321000	You need to get him to start like the rest of us started on Atari 2600
321000	326000	I don't really remember playing games, probably about four years old at this release I remember, four or five for sure
326000	329000	Five was when we got the Commodore 64, so I remember that
329000	337000	He likes Bubble Bubble on the arcade, Kevin, he just doesn't understand how to move the joystick and push the buttons at the same time
337000	340000	That was the thing about Atari 2600 games, they were easy
340000	350000	There's one thing to them, combat, pinball, boxing, very one note, easy to do
350000	360000	If you are listening to us live, hello and welcome, you can join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
360000	366000	Again that's live.vognetwork.com, I know we're up against some big TV stuff going on tonight
366000	369000	So if you are here live, I appreciate you being here
369000	372000	If you are listening to us on the podcast, you know what, that's okay too
372000	376000	If you decided to watch your wrestling and you're listening to us on Monday morning
376000	378000	Well that's okay too, we appreciate your support either way
378000	381000	And yeah, this is a show where every gamer has a voice
381000	384000	If you can't be here live with us, be sure you send us an email
384000	387000	Which you can do at participate at orangeonsready.com
387000	389000	Or you can send us a tweet at OLR
389000	392000	And we like to get your voices all on the show as well
392000	396000	Going to our chat room, I see some folks talking about the old school games
396000	402000	Dungeon Buster says Yars' Revenge, that was a little more complicated of a 2600 game
402000	405000	After they got all the simple stuff done, then it started getting a little weirder
405000	409000	If you look at Yars' Revenge and you have no idea what to do
409000	413000	It is kind of difficult to figure out what the hell that game is
413000	416000	I don't know if you've ever seen Yars' Revenge, but Google it
416000	420000	Make sure you're looking at the Atari 2600 version, not that weirdo remake they did a few years ago
420000	422000	Which was nothing like the original
422000	425000	But you have that storm cloud that comes down the middle of the screen
425000	427000	Which is actually like a safe zone I believe
427000	430000	And then you have a wall around the gun
430000	432000	And you try to shoot through the wall
432000	434000	And then you have to touch the gun
434000	437000	And once you touch the gun, which is randomly shooting so you gotta be careful
437000	439000	You get a bullet on the left side of the screen
439000	442000	You hit the fire button one more time and you blow up the gun
442000	445000	See that one's complicated, some of them get really complicated
445000	447000	Because they did all the simple stuff
447000	451000	But Yars' Revenge was one of the greatest Atari 2600 games they ever did
451000	453000	And then try to explain a game like E.T.
453000	456000	Well, don't bother
456000	460000	Although I seem to remember a couple years ago somebody had hacked the E.T. ROM to make it playable
460000	465000	They changed collision detection and some other stuff to make E.T. playable
465000	467000	Which is kind of funny
467000	469000	Love that idea
469000	472000	Speaking of hacks and joking and fooling around
472000	475000	For the kickoff topic tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about April Fools' Day
475000	477000	Because April Fools' Day was this past week
477000	481000	Some years we've done things here at OLR or VOG Network where our show is heard
481000	483000	This year we sat out
483000	486000	Just because our show was nowhere close to April Fools' Day this year
486000	491000	And we were actually working on a new feature for the site at vognetwork.com
491000	494000	Like a real thing that actually launched on April 2nd
494000	496000	Because we want people to believe it's real
496000	498000	It's our new TV section
498000	501000	Presented by the fantastic folks over at Critical Myth
501000	504000	Which you can hear on VOG Network Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern
505000	509000	They have a brand new TV review section over at VOG Network
509000	511000	And you can access that at tv.vognetwork.com
511000	516000	What's really cool about it, it's got all the same gamification elements that the rest of the site has
516000	521000	Meaning you can leave your response reviews right underneath the reviews of the shows that are there
521000	524000	You can comment and thumbs up, thumbs down, all that stuff
524000	526000	So you can really participate with those reviews
526000	528000	And it's TV so it's
528000	530000	A lot of people watch these shows and trust me
530000	533000	The guys over at Critical Myth, they have a pretty big staff
533000	536000	And so they review something like 40 shows
536000	540000	Now they used to run their own website, criticalmyth.com
540000	543000	But due to some, and I have no better way to word this
543000	545000	Than due to some fuckery
545000	548000	Which is completely out of their hands and not their fault
548000	551000	But due to some fuckery, they don't have Crystal Myth
551000	553000	Or did I say crystalmyth.com?
553000	555000	Criticalmyth.com
555000	557000	Criticalmyth.com
557000	559000	Or you know, Critical Myth, CrystalMyth.com
559000	561000	It's even more popular
561000	563000	I think somebody hacked their domain to sell it for meth
563000	564000	I think that's what happened
564000	568000	But anyway, criticalmyth.com is not there in the same way
568000	570000	I think he kind of has it to do some podcast hosting
570000	572000	But they unfortunately lost a bunch of reviews
572000	574000	But they're starting anew over at VOG Network
574000	576000	And they review a lot of shows
576000	580000	This isn't like Marvel Agents of SHIELD and one other show
580000	583000	You go over there, there's a ton of shows they're reviewing right now
583000	585000	So probably one of your geeky favorites is up over there
585000	586000	So check that out
586000	588000	Once again, tv.vognetwork.com
588000	589000	Plug plug
589000	590000	So where was I? April Fools
590000	591000	April Fools
591000	594000	Lots of April Fools jokes always happen around the game industry
594000	596000	We've had some real classic stuff in the past
596000	598000	But what did you guys think of this year's offerings?
598000	600000	We had a few things this year
600000	603000	What did you think of this year's April Fools offerings?
603000	605000	Loki, is there any that...
605000	607000	I mean there was a few that kind of stood out
607000	609000	But a lot of them were just kind of eh
609000	612000	I mean, I like the
612000	615000	Spent new Smash Brothers character reveal which was Nester
615000	617000	But see that's the thing though
617000	619000	It's like, it kind of falls into two categories
619000	621000	There's April Fools jokes that are kind of like
621000	623000	Okay haha that's funny
623000	625000	And then there's those April Fools jokes where it's like
625000	627000	Oh man that's really cool
627000	629000	Why is this just an April Fools joke?
629000	631000	Why can't we have this actually be a real thing?
633000	635000	And so in that category there was
635000	637000	The Nester reveal and then also
637000	639000	The Optimus Prime
639000	641000	DLC for Titanfall
641000	643000	Where you'd have Optimus Prime
643000	645000	Which I gotta admit though he did kind of look a little derpy in that
645000	647000	But whatever
647000	649000	I guess it was generation one but it looked
649000	651000	It looked like derpy generation one
653000	655000	So that was kind of neat
655000	657000	Wait let me cut in because I don't want you to name everything
657000	659000	I want to give Jamie a chance
659000	661000	I don't know if she was really following all the April Fools stuff
661000	663000	But was there any gags that caught your eye this year Jamie
663000	665000	That you thought were funny? Or anything you thought was lame?
665000	667000	After being reminded by Bobby I did the NPR stunt
667000	669000	That was really smart
669000	671000	Do people actually pay attention?
671000	673000	That wasn't gaming per se
673000	675000	But a great commentary on social media
675000	677000	And the social game we play every day on Facebook
677000	679000	That's a great commentary on my Facebook
679000	681000	On everybody's Facebook
681000	683000	I mean seriously
683000	685000	That's actually a great commentary on my mother
685000	687000	And every conversation I ever have with her
687000	689000	And just to recap
689000	691000	I know a lot of people probably listen to Bobby's show
691000	693000	But just for those that are listening to our show first
693000	695000	For whatever reason on Monday
695000	697000	They posted an article
697000	699000	That said something like
699000	701000	Americans don't read as much as they used to
701000	703000	Or something like that
703000	705000	But you click in the article
705000	707000	And it says this is our April Fools joke
707000	709000	Hey you should like the post
709000	711000	But don't comment on it
711000	713000	To prove that you read it
713000	715000	And all these people commenting on the post
715000	717000	Saying what kind of travesty is this?
717000	719000	What are you talking about NPR?
719000	721000	NPR you guys are full of crap
721000	723000	People who just made an impression
723000	725000	Based off the headline
725000	727000	Didn't bother to read the story
727000	729000	Hilarious
729000	731000	It sort of goes back to
731000	733000	Something I've been pointing to before
733000	735000	Through a couple of different shows
735000	737000	Just how society itself
737000	739000	Has become
739000	741000	Can't be bothered to do anything
741000	743000	And this
743000	745000	Would never be true in the gaming industry
745000	747000	Right Dark Sakura?
747000	749000	The gaming fans never judge things based on headlines alone
749000	751000	Do we?
751000	753000	You know what?
753000	755000	It's a human thing
755000	757000	The path of least resistance
757000	759000	We would never have
759000	761000	Like a click baiting website
761000	763000	That would just try to get attention grabbing headlines
763000	765000	For people to share on Facebook
765000	767000	We would never have anything like that
767000	769000	Right?
769000	771000	Website
771000	773000	April Fools
773000	775000	Yeah and who's the fool this time?
775000	777000	Who is the fool?
777000	779000	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
779000	781000	Dungeon Buster agrees
781000	783000	The Optimus DLC was very funny
783000	785000	The pagan Jew with one
785000	787000	I can't believe Dark Sakura forgot about this
787000	789000	I just wanted this to be real
789000	791000	The pagan Jew says the BioWare store stuff
791000	793000	The Garris body pillow
793000	795000	That was a big joke anyway
795000	797000	There were reviews up of it
797000	799000	Besides that
799000	801000	I don't want a Garris body pillow
801000	803000	Unless it's like a full size plushie
803000	805000	I could deal with that
805000	807000	But Dan would be completely freaked out
807000	809000	Raginator
809000	811000	Going to keep it at old school and saying
811000	813000	The best April Fools gag ever
813000	815000	Was the EGM Shang Long joke
815000	817000	That is always interesting
817000	819000	Back when you didn't really have the internet
819000	821000	The way you have it now
821000	823000	And gaming magazines were very prolific
823000	825000	And in the April issue
825000	827000	There would always be some type of
827000	829000	Joke
829000	831000	And it was always really funny to me
831000	833000	When that stuff would cross over into actual
833000	835000	Cannon
835000	837000	The one that pops into my head is when they said
837000	839000	Ermac was in Mortal Kombat
839000	841000	The red ninja Ermac was available
841000	843000	You did all this crazy stuff
843000	845000	And you could unlock it
845000	847000	What did the developers of Mortal Kombat do?
847000	849000	They put a character called Ermac in one of the later games
849000	851000	We always knew it would happen
851000	853000	They started trolling people by putting
853000	855000	Random text in the bios
855000	857000	Or whatever
857000	859000	Any jokes that you guys
859000	861000	Have ever come across on April Fools day
861000	863000	In the gaming world or maybe in the tech world
863000	865000	That just weren't funny
865000	867000	Because sometimes
867000	869000	What's the old adage?
869000	871000	I can only think of the RuPaul version
871000	873000	Bear with me here
873000	875000	The RuPaul version is
875000	877000	Throwing shade takes creativity
877000	879000	Being a bitch takes none
879000	881000	And what I mean by that is that
881000	883000	Some April Fools jokes are funny
883000	885000	Because they're thought out
885000	887000	They're well executed and so forth
887000	889000	But there's so much sloppy shit that happens
889000	891000	On April Fools day that's just mean spirited
891000	893000	And dumb
893000	895000	So what do you guys think has happened in the game industry
895000	897000	And I pose this to our chat room as well
897000	899000	That was on that side of
899000	901000	Bitchy that was just dumb
901000	903000	There was the Firefly one
903000	905000	Oh Netflix is reviving Firefly
905000	907000	I was like fuck all of you
907000	909000	That was kind of being a bitch
909000	911000	If it wasn't that you were doing the Jessica Jones
911000	913000	And Luke Cage series I would just say fuck you
913000	915000	Forever for the rest of the year
915000	917000	Until you redeemed yourselves if that was at all possible
919000	921000	Hitstun says that Nester
921000	923000	Won this year was lame
923000	925000	Disagrees with Loki
925000	927000	There was the
927000	929000	Enter the dominatrix
929000	931000	April Fools joke
931000	933000	Oh what would that tell us more about that
933000	935000	That's for Saints Row
935000	937000	They were teasing it as an
937000	939000	April Fools joke originally
939000	941000	That became a thing
941000	943000	Then it was going to become an expansion
943000	945000	Saints Row 4
945000	947000	God having played the DLC
947000	949000	It would have been fucking terrible
949000	951000	Even more terrible than Saints Row 4 was
951000	953000	I do have to say that
953000	955000	The only getting into
955000	957000	April Fools that I did
957000	959000	Was playing Animal Crossing
959000	961000	And having to tell who was the right one
961000	963000	And I'm very sad that I did not guess the correct
963000	965000	Margie
965000	967000	Because it made her sad and she better not move
967000	969000	I forgot that April Fools was a thing
969000	971000	In Animal Crossing
971000	973000	Blanca shows up
973000	975000	And she impersonates another townsperson
975000	977000	And so sometimes they'll give a clue by their
977000	979000	Birthday or whatever
979000	981000	But it's stupid
981000	983000	It's one of those like how much have you been paying attention
983000	985000	And Margie's my favorite and I got her wrong
985000	987000	For a second there I thought you had a really epic
987000	989000	Capcom crossover there
989000	991000	Like oh Blanca shows up that's awesome
991000	993000	No she's the one that had the face
993000	995000	That you drew her face in before
995000	997000	Blanca shows up and starts electrocuting your villagers
997000	999000	Oh
999000	1001000	I support this
1001000	1003000	He just
1003000	1005000	He spotted Ed and then launched himself
1005000	1007000	In the one of those
1007000	1009000	Blanca balls at Ed's face
1009000	1011000	And murdered him from Jamie's village
1011000	1013000	Yeah I did
1013000	1015000	Let's see I got
1015000	1017000	I got Groucho right
1017000	1019000	I like Groucho so I have his picture
1019000	1021000	And I got D.Va
1021000	1023000	Which I just like her because her name is D.Va
1023000	1025000	But she's a fucking frog
1025000	1027000	So her eyes are sitting on top of her head and it's fucking weird
1027000	1029000	You know I thought the meanest April Fools joke
1029000	1031000	Where somebody was being a total bitch that was played
1031000	1033000	Was when Notch
1033000	1035000	Wrote that blog post
1035000	1037000	About how he wasn't gonna make Minecraft for the Oculus Rift
1037000	1039000	Because Facebook bought them
1039000	1041000	And then Yeti turned around and now they're gonna do
1041000	1043000	You know, pocket Minecraft on the Amazon Fire
1043000	1045000	I thought that was a really bitchy April Fools joke
1045000	1047000	But
1047000	1049000	That's because the Amazon Fire
1049000	1051000	They already have controller support for Minecraft Pocket
1051000	1053000	You're just putting it on another damn console
1053000	1055000	Oh wait wait you're saying that wasn't an April Fools joke?
1055000	1057000	That wasn't an April Fools joke
1057000	1059000	It's not technically in 3
1059000	1061000	What a bitch
1061000	1063000	It's kind of stupid to call it Minecraft
1063000	1065000	Pocket on a fucking TV
1065000	1067000	I can't fit that TV in my pocket
1067000	1069000	Alright how big do you think my pocket is?
1069000	1071000	Alright
1071000	1073000	I can't afford big fucking pockets
1073000	1075000	Because I'm going to reach into your pocket
1075000	1077000	And take out $7.99
1077000	1079000	It's for the people with the deep pockets
1079000	1081000	Yes it's for people with deep pockets
1081000	1083000	Alright
1083000	1085000	You gotta have a pouch of holding for that shit
1085000	1087000	Alright all bitchiness aside
1087000	1089000	We'll get to the Amazon Fire stuff
1089000	1091000	I know it's on everybody's mind
1091000	1093000	We'll get to that in the news in a little bit
1093000	1095000	But let's establish our frame of reference for the week
1095000	1097000	In a segment we call
1097000	1099000	How is your gaming week?
1099000	1101000	So DarkSakura what type of games have you been playing this week?
1101000	1103000	Animal Crossing
1103000	1105000	I played some Final Fantasy 14
1107000	1109000	I did some Mass Effect
1109000	1111000	But I really need to start over on my game again
1111000	1113000	And for some reason
1113000	1115000	My mods aren't working again
1115000	1117000	So whatever the fuck
1117000	1119000	I was playing something else
1119000	1121000	Oh yeah um
1121000	1123000	I think I mentioned it last week I might have
1123000	1125000	That I started the Shiva
1125000	1127000	Which um
1127000	1129000	It's actually
1129000	1131000	It's done in those old sprite
1131000	1133000	You know point and click adventure games
1133000	1135000	But it's really
1135000	1137000	It's very Jewish
1137000	1139000	I mean the Shiva
1139000	1141000	What a Shiva is
1141000	1143000	Is if you don't know it's like a week long
1143000	1145000	Period of mourning when someone dies
1145000	1147000	Where the family in mourning
1147000	1149000	Sits on the floor everyone brings them food
1149000	1151000	You know you're supposed to
1151000	1153000	You don't have to do much to take care of yourself
1153000	1155000	You're supposed to get your grief out of your system
1155000	1157000	And you know after you've buried the dead
1157000	1159000	And so in this case
1159000	1161000	It's a rabbi who
1161000	1163000	Has a dwindling congregation about to lose
1163000	1165000	His synagogue and then
1165000	1167000	Somebody that
1167000	1169000	He had actually
1169000	1171000	Kicked out of his congregation
1171000	1173000	Left him a whole bunch of money
1173000	1175000	But the guy was murdered
1175000	1177000	So it's
1177000	1179000	This whole murder mystery
1179000	1181000	Around
1181000	1183000	Just around trying to get
1183000	1185000	To the bottom of it
1185000	1187000	Why would this guy who he kicked out
1187000	1189000	Leave him money
1189000	1191000	Who's behind it
1191000	1193000	It's pretty
1193000	1195000	It's really actually more of an insight into
1195000	1197000	I think into modern Jewish culture
1197000	1199000	I've really been enjoying it
1199000	1201000	And on top of that
1201000	1203000	It's an old school point and click adventure game
1203000	1205000	Yeah it's called the shiva
1205000	1207000	The pagan Jewish
1207000	1209000	That's a real game I need to look this up
1209000	1211000	Yeah it's really
1211000	1213000	Good and it's actually not super expensive
1213000	1215000	But I've been really getting into the story behind it
1215000	1217000	Nice
1217000	1219000	I played a little bit more
1219000	1221000	Dominique Pablos
1221000	1223000	But the problem I have with it
1223000	1225000	Is that I
1225000	1227000	Have problems with hearing anything off pitch
1227000	1229000	And
1229000	1231000	Not all of the singing is on pitch
1231000	1233000	It's a very intentional
1233000	1235000	Sort of sing songy
1235000	1237000	That's
1237000	1239000	I had this problem in band
1239000	1241000	You know what perfect pitch is right
1241000	1243000	When you can hear pitch
1243000	1245000	I saw pitch perfect
1245000	1247000	I loved Fat Amy she was my favorite
1247000	1249000	Well I have perfect pitch for listening
1249000	1251000	And so I can hear when anything
1251000	1253000	Is off it starts to sound like
1253000	1255000	Instead of a constant sound
1255000	1257000	You hear all the sound waves between it
1257000	1259000	And so for me it's just like
1259000	1261000	A cringe I can't even listen to myself sing
1261000	1263000	When I'm off pitch
1263000	1265000	So that's why I don't do karaoke
1265000	1267000	Turn the volume down turn subtitles on
1267000	1269000	Probably what I'm going to end up doing
1269000	1271000	Except the songs are cute the music is cute
1271000	1273000	So I've been enjoying what I'm playing of it
1273000	1275000	And that's not anything having to do with the game
1275000	1277000	That's having to do with me
1277000	1279000	So I take it in bursts I'm having a good time
1279000	1281000	It is such a little art film
1281000	1283000	It is I love it it's so cute
1283000	1285000	I just sort of want my own
1285000	1287000	Dominique doll
1287000	1289000	We know people you can call
1289000	1291000	To maybe arrange that
1291000	1293000	I might make one
1293000	1295000	And thank you Dungeon Buster for doing a link to the
1295000	1297000	Shiva in there because I would really like
1297000	1299000	To see more games like this
1299000	1301000	I would love to see more people
1301000	1303000	Explore this game and learn more
1303000	1305000	About you know the culture behind it
1305000	1307000	Well and in a way you just brought up
1307000	1309000	Dominique Pamplemousse too which is a very
1309000	1311000	Similar sort of thing being able to explore
1311000	1313000	The mind of somebody
1313000	1315000	You might not otherwise
1315000	1317000	Have thought about relating to before
1317000	1319000	And I love the main character
1319000	1321000	I really do like Dominique
1321000	1323000	But that being said
1323000	1325000	I have to take it in doses
1325000	1327000	And I'm actually kind of
1327000	1329000	Considered getting Titanfall
1329000	1331000	Except I would throw up so quickly
1331000	1333000	This doesn't sound like you at all
1333000	1335000	I mean don't get me wrong Titanfall is pretty cool
1335000	1337000	But what's your attraction
1337000	1339000	To Titanfall? I want to see the story behind it
1339000	1341000	Because I actually it was funny because we were
1341000	1343000	Alright we were watching
1343000	1345000	At Captain America today we were watching
1345000	1347000	The little commercials
1347000	1349000	They do in front of it they had a really
1349000	1351000	Good one for Titanfall and I was like oh that's kind of
1351000	1353000	Interesting and then you see the pilots bouncing
1353000	1355000	From wall to wall I was like oh my god
1355000	1357000	It's like Attack on Titanfall
1357000	1359000	I was like I'm kind of
1359000	1361000	Interested now because it says it's got a story
1361000	1363000	And it's multiplayer and I was like well
1363000	1365000	There will be people on the same learning curve as me I'm sure
1365000	1367000	The story is very short because
1367000	1369000	The game is only multiplayer and so there's
1369000	1371000	Like multiplayer
1371000	1373000	multiplayer match oh something story related
1373000	1375000	multiplayer match and then that's it
1375000	1377000	And then later on oh something else
1377000	1379000	Story related oh whatever
1379000	1381000	Oh and now you have to play the other side
1381000	1383000	Maybe I'll just stick with drunken robot
1383000	1385000	Pornography then
1385000	1387000	You can watch the story on YouTube
1387000	1389000	Seriously I think it's short enough to where you could do that
1389000	1391000	Well I don't know I've actually
1391000	1393000	When I gave up playing through
1393000	1395000	Half Life 2
1395000	1397000	I just watched the rest of the story online
1397000	1399000	Well how do you think sites like Twitch TV
1399000	1401000	Are a thing people like to watch
1401000	1403000	People play through stories but I do want
1403000	1405000	To have a mass effect multiplayer
1405000	1407000	Night where we stream again
1407000	1409000	I wonder if my game is up to date
1409000	1411000	I don't even know because then I need to drink a lot
1411000	1413000	That'd be fun and play because drunken
1413000	1415000	Mass effect multiplayer on bronze
1415000	1417000	Is the funniest thing ever and for the record
1417000	1419000	Ragenator I did get goat simulator
1419000	1421000	Or as you said goat stimulator
1421000	1423000	And it's fucked up
1423000	1425000	Also
1425000	1427000	Another comment in our chat room you may
1427000	1429000	Not be alone in some of your music
1429000	1431000	Things dark soccer
1431000	1433000	says when I hear death metal
1433000	1435000	I lose my balance and I get dizzy right away
1435000	1437000	I have the problem actually
1437000	1439000	With certain ones like okay I'm fine
1439000	1441000	With speed metal but anything
1441000	1443000	That's the super bass heavy and
1443000	1445000	Screechy oh like through the fire and the flames
1445000	1447000	Yeah I'm fine with speed metal because
1447000	1449000	It actually is sort of melodic it has
1449000	1451000	A pattern and I mean if anyone
1451000	1453000	Wants to okay the stuff that I listen
1453000	1455000	To to calm me down when I'm about you know at
1455000	1457000	Meltdown phase is I listen to Philip Glass
1457000	1459000	And believe it or not I've actually
1459000	1461000	Found a little bit of correlation with
1461000	1463000	Some of the patterns that come up in Philip Glass's music
1463000	1465000	And certain types
1465000	1467000	Of speed metal just the melodic
1467000	1469000	And repetitive how it
1469000	1471000	Builds and builds and builds on something so
1471000	1473000	It's actually very calming to me but
1473000	1475000	Death metal no I get sick actually get nauseous
1475000	1477000	If it's I've listened to too much
1477000	1479000	So yeah
1479000	1481000	Alright
1481000	1483000	Well let's move on back to I don't know
1483000	1485000	How we got into talking about death metal from video games
1485000	1487000	We did Loki how was
1487000	1489000	Your gaming week I've actually been listening to lots of music
1489000	1491000	Not death metal but I've been trying
1491000	1493000	To find because the thing is
1493000	1495000	I've been trying to find music that's of a
1495000	1497000	Certain genre but I don't know what genre it is
1497000	1499000	It's you know like pendulum
1499000	1501000	Where it's a cross between like heavy metal
1501000	1503000	Drum and bass and electronica
1503000	1505000	I guess but how do you say
1505000	1507000	I want
1507000	1509000	Heavy metal drum and bass
1509000	1511000	Electronica music half pandora
1511000	1513000	Or check like last.fm
1513000	1515000	Well the problem is I'm looking for
1515000	1517000	Indie music that's of that same genre
1517000	1519000	And I've found a few things but it's just like
1519000	1521000	They have so many tags on it
1521000	1523000	There's no fucking way I'm gonna go find this
1523000	1525000	Anyways the actual games I played
1525000	1527000	Or I should say game
1527000	1529000	I really only played goat simulator this week
1529000	1531000	Because I haven't really played much at all
1531000	1533000	As far as games go I did
1533000	1535000	Load up South Park for like
1535000	1537000	Literally two minutes just to show my friend
1537000	1539000	And that was that
1539000	1541000	He proceeded to use all my
1541000	1543000	Single day
1543000	1545000	Summons so I had to
1545000	1547000	Not save and you know
1547000	1549000	Go back and actually
1549000	1551000	Play that section again
1551000	1553000	But yeah goat simulator is fun
1553000	1555000	I liked how they changed some of the things
1555000	1557000	Probably for copyright issues
1557000	1559000	The Yoshi goat is now Italian dinosaur goat
1559000	1561000	Which is funny
1561000	1563000	They added a dragon
1563000	1565000	Shout goat which I haven't actually used yet
1565000	1567000	But there's a lot more
1567000	1569000	Mods on there now
1569000	1571000	Some new maps
1571000	1573000	So fun stuff
1573000	1575000	Just got the achievement for doing all the flips
1575000	1577000	The trick is to go into the low
1577000	1579000	Gravity area and you can flip forever
1579000	1581000	In there
1581000	1583000	Yeah so
1583000	1585000	That's all I played this week hopefully
1585000	1587000	Gonna get in some Call of Duty
1587000	1589000	Modern Warfare 2 later this week
1589000	1591000	Got a ton of friends now
1591000	1593000	That are playing that so it'll be fun
1593000	1595000	Alright
1595000	1597000	My gaming week I actually kept myself pretty busy
1597000	1599000	I've played a few games this week
1599000	1601000	Sadly none of it is really new things for me to talk about
1601000	1603000	I've been continuing to play Final Fantasy 10
1603000	1605000	The HD remake
1605000	1607000	I played that a little bit towards the beginning of the week
1607000	1609000	I got a copy of South Park
1609000	1611000	On Playstation 3
1611000	1613000	So I finally got a chance to play the South Park game
1613000	1615000	I'm not super far into it
1615000	1617000	I'm just like at the beginning still where you're going around town
1617000	1619000	With Butters trying to recruit the people for your
1619000	1621000	You know
1621000	1623000	For your army or whatever
1623000	1625000	And I'm like isn't this the same plot from the show
1625000	1627000	But that's alright
1627000	1629000	It's really funny of course the game is hilarious
1629000	1631000	Because it's written by
1631000	1633000	The guys who do the actual show
1633000	1635000	Matt Park or Trey Stone
1635000	1637000	And I thought it was interesting how there's all these little side quests
1637000	1639000	The way the game plays
1639000	1641000	Obviously it has the RPG elements
1641000	1643000	But it reminds me of
1643000	1645000	A 90's
1645000	1647000	Click adventure game from the PC
1647000	1649000	Like King's Quest or Loom or some shit
1649000	1651000	I don't know why
1652000	1654000	Maybe it's because you keep going from static scene to static scene
1654000	1656000	And you interact with things in the scene
1656000	1658000	Be it with your slingshot
1658000	1660000	Or you're looking at things that are yellow
1660000	1662000	Or things you can open up or whatever
1662000	1664000	So I just kind of
1664000	1666000	I don't know I thought that was kind of neat
1666000	1668000	It kind of was a throwback to those games
1668000	1670000	But yeah the game is funny
1670000	1672000	And definitely worth a look at if you're a South Park fan
1672000	1674000	Other games I've been playing this week
1674000	1676000	Diablo 3
1676000	1678000	Having an experience boost weekend
1678000	1680000	So I'm still trying to beat Act 5
1681000	1683000	Because I'm level 69 now
1683000	1685000	So there's only one more level for me to gain
1685000	1687000	So I've got to be close to the end
1687000	1689000	But yeah I wanted to play that during the experience boost weekend
1689000	1691000	So I've been playing a little bit of that
1691000	1693000	Also this weekend Final Fantasy 14 is doing its
1693000	1695000	Second beta on Playstation 4
1695000	1697000	And this is the beta where you can use
1697000	1699000	Your characters from the PC
1699000	1701000	Or the Playstation 3
1701000	1703000	If you still haven't checked out the Final Fantasy 14
1703000	1705000	Beta on Playstation 4
1705000	1707000	I hate to say it I think you missed your chance
1707000	1709000	I mean you can start the download now
1709000	1711000	And depending on your connection you might be able to get
1711000	1713000	A couple hours in to at least get a feel for it
1713000	1715000	But at this point if you haven't played it
1716000	1718000	Now is your chance to try out the game for free
1718000	1720000	Yeah it comes out in like a week
1720000	1722000	Yeah it's out the pre-order
1722000	1724000	Starts on the 11th and those people can play
1724000	1727000	And I believe Playstation 3 users
1727000	1729000	Who are converting their licenses
1729000	1731000	Also get to start playing that day
1731000	1733000	And then the 14th is when the game comes out
1733000	1735000	SSJ 100 Matt by the way says
1735000	1737000	You need to play South Park in front of your mom
1738000	1740000	I will I'll invite her over she loves South Park
1740000	1742000	I have not seen your mom
1742000	1744000	In ages and she's wonderful
1744000	1746000	Yeah I should invite her on the show sometime
1746000	1747000	Maybe for Mother's Day or something
1747000	1749000	We'll have her on the show in the new studio
1749000	1750000	It'll be fun
1750000	1751000	Huh
1751000	1752000	That's a good idea
1752000	1753000	That's a good idea
1753000	1754000	And by the way
1754000	1755000	What?
1755000	1757000	Next week I will be doing another Blue Roses giveaway in Animal Crossing
1757000	1759000	You gonna work on farming those blue roses?
1759000	1761000	Oh I've got like a whole flower bed full now
1761000	1762000	Alright stay tuned
1762000	1764000	Blue roses the Animal Crossing equivalent of
1764000	1765000	Crystal meth
1765000	1767000	Apparently, apparently
1767000	1769000	Uh see I've been playing the Final Fantasy 14 beta
1769000	1770000	On Playstation 4
1770000	1772000	I am impressed with the technology in that little box
1772000	1773000	I gotta say
1773000	1775000	Because the game runs great
1775000	1777000	It runs better than it does on my 5 year old PC
1777000	1779000	Because my PC is 5 years old
1779000	1780000	But the frame rate is fantastic
1780000	1782000	The game looks great
1782000	1784000	And I can broadcast to Twitch
1784000	1785000	Using the whole built in thing
1785000	1787000	And my network thing doesn't suffer
1787000	1788000	The graphics look good
1788000	1790000	You know I actually played through
1790000	1792000	The 2.2 patch content last night
1792000	1793000	I streamed it
1793000	1795000	I really wish Twitch archived
1795000	1796000	The Playstation 4 stuff
1796000	1797000	It doesn't
1797000	1798000	I'm kinda bummed out
1798000	1800000	Because I did the Leviathan fight for the first time
1800000	1802000	Last night on the feed with Shane
1802000	1803000	And uh
1803000	1805000	I actually thought of a pretty clever way
1805000	1807000	Cause you know when I do my live streams
1807000	1809000	I almost always have somebody on Skype
1809000	1811000	That I can kinda banter with
1811000	1813000	So it's not just watching my little head in the box
1813000	1814000	Or listening to rock music
1814000	1815000	Like I just
1815000	1816000	I have to be different
1816000	1817000	So I always like to banter with somebody on Skype
1817000	1818000	So you know
1818000	1820000	Usually Shane is almost always there
1820000	1821000	Or Extifer
1821000	1822000	Or Grandpa from Hoardouse
1822000	1823000	Or somebody's
1823000	1824000	Usually they're bantering with me
1824000	1825000	Well
1825000	1826000	On the Playstation 4 it's a little more difficult right
1826000	1828000	Cause you can't plug in a mixing board or anything right
1828000	1830000	But what I figured out you can do
1830000	1831000	I get my iPhone
1831000	1834000	And I call Shane on the Skype app on my iPhone
1834000	1836000	And I set the iPhone right next to the camera
1836000	1838000	So he can hear me when I'm talking
1838000	1840000	And then the listeners hear him
1840000	1843000	Or the viewers hear him through the camera mic
1843000	1844000	And it works
1844000	1846000	So then the viewers are actually listeners too?
1846000	1847000	Yes, both
1847000	1848000	Unless they're deaf
1848000	1850000	Then they're just viewers
1850000	1851000	And they don't care about the banter
1851000	1852000	Between Shane and I
1852000	1853000	Cause there's no subtitles
1853000	1857000	We should find a way to subtitle the show by the way
1857000	1858000	Yeah I don't know
1858000	1860000	It'd be a lot of work
1860000	1861000	So
1861000	1863000	You could use one of those automated things
1863000	1865000	That are kinda hit and miss
1865000	1866000	But yeah
1866000	1868000	Final Fantasy XIV on Playstation 4 is great
1868000	1871000	And I'm probably gonna switch to playing on Playstation 4
1871000	1873000	When it comes out
1873000	1875000	Since I got it on Playstation 3
1875000	1876000	And here's
1876000	1878000	If you're interested in the game
1878000	1879000	I would really urge you to
1879000	1881000	Try to find a cheap copy on Playstation 3 right now
1881000	1883000	And then just convert your license to Playstation 4
1883000	1885000	That's the cheapest way to do it
1885000	1887000	And get 30 days free with the game
1887000	1889000	You can probably find a copy for 15-20 bucks right now
1889000	1890000	Out there
1890000	1891000	Just make sure it's not used
1891000	1892000	Cause you need to have a code
1892000	1893000	But
1893000	1894000	There you go
1894000	1896000	That was pretty much my gaming week honestly
1896000	1898000	Lots of other stuff I need to try
1898000	1900000	I've got an EverQuest Landmark beta code
1900000	1901000	That I'm waiting to use
1901000	1903000	I gotta get in there and play that
1903000	1904000	And
1904000	1905000	Let's see
1905000	1906000	I'll describe it
1906000	1907000	And
1907000	1908000	Let's see
1908000	1910000	Elder Scrolls Online came out
1910000	1912000	But I lost my chance at that
1912000	1913000	I didn't really play that
1913000	1914000	And
1914000	1916000	Wild Stars in beta too
1916000	1917000	And I'm the one to test that out
1917000	1919000	And I really want to try Wild Stars
1919000	1920000	I really want
1920000	1922000	And I doubt anybody from Blizzard
1922000	1923000	Listens to this show
1923000	1924000	But if you do
1924000	1926000	If I happen to have a fan out there
1926000	1927000	That I did not know about
1927000	1928000	That's got the hookup at Blizzard
1928000	1930000	Please flag my account
1930000	1932000	For the Heroes of the Storm alpha
1932000	1933000	Thank you, thank you
1933000	1934000	Kiss kiss hug hug
1934000	1935000	I really wanna
1936000	1937000	I can't
1937000	1938000	I'm losing my resistance Rob
1938000	1939000	What?
1939000	1940000	Cause the space goats
1940000	1941000	Oh you wanna go back to WoW?
1941000	1942000	I kinda do
1942000	1944000	When the expansion comes out
1944000	1945000	Uh oh
1945000	1946000	That was the other one
1946000	1947000	That was really awesome
1947000	1949000	I don't remember if it was League of Legends
1949000	1951000	Or I think it was League of Legends
1951000	1952000	But they had
1952000	1954000	And I'm assuming it's a joke
1954000	1955000	But they had
1956000	1957000	The
1957000	1958000	Goat simulator goat in there
1958000	1959000	As a playable character
1959000	1960000	And it was
1960000	1962000	I think it was one of those like
1962000	1963000	You know
1963000	1964000	Dota type games or something
1964000	1965000	But
1965000	1967000	I wanna say it was League of Legends
1967000	1968000	Maybe it wasn't League of Legends
1968000	1969000	But
1969000	1971000	There's a lot of people doing a lot of goat simulator things
1971000	1972000	And that right there
1972000	1974000	That's the April Fools game right there
1974000	1975000	That just keeps on giving
1975000	1976000	Because it's a legit game
1976000	1979000	You know MMOs do some of the best April Fools gags
1979000	1980000	They do some of the worst
1980000	1981000	Oh my god
1981000	1982000	What was it?
1982000	1983000	Guild Wars 2
1983000	1984000	Had the whole retro level last year
1984000	1985000	That was amazing
1985000	1986000	Oh you know
1986000	1988000	There's something else that I did
1988000	1989000	It wasn't video game related
1989000	1990000	But it wasn't anime
1990000	1991000	I started Kill la Kill
1991000	1993000	Is that the one that Rama told you to watch?
1993000	1994000	No
1994000	1995000	Oh
1995000	1996000	Several many other people have told me to watch it
1996000	1998000	And so finally I just broke down and started watching it
1998000	1999000	Oh my god
1999000	2000000	That's all I have to say
2000000	2001000	Going to our chat
2001000	2002000	Going to our chat room at
2002000	2003000	Live.vognetwork.com
2003000	2004000	Dark Tetsuya says
2004000	2007000	Well doesn't YouTube kind of have closed captioning?
2007000	2008000	Not sure it's 100% accurate
2008000	2009000	But anyway
2009000	2011000	Yes it does
2011000	2015000	I don't know if our videos that Jason puts on the Orange Launch Radio channel at YouTube
2015000	2016000	Has that like
2016000	2018000	That you can use that
2018000	2020000	But I bet it's hilariously bad
2020000	2022000	Because there's some really bad YouTube captioning out there
2022000	2023000	Maybe we should check out
2023000	2024000	I'm gonna check it out
2024000	2025000	You should check out a prior episode
2025000	2026000	See if that's there
2026000	2028000	Also going to more chat
2028000	2030000	Let's see
2030000	2031000	Hitstun says
2031000	2035000	Wildstar and Elder Scrolls Online were really big at PAX East last year
2035000	2036000	But they're still not out yet
2036000	2038000	Elder Scrolls Online actually launched on Friday
2038000	2039000	So that is now out
2039000	2041000	Wildstar I believe is June
2041000	2043000	Is when that's coming out
2043000	2046000	S2100Matt says
2046000	2047000	We need to use our
2047000	2048000	Tell a friend about the show duty
2048000	2050000	And find a friend that is also a stenographer
2050000	2052000	And get them hooked to OLR
2052000	2054000	That would be great
2054000	2055000	I'd love that
2055000	2056000	Alright
2056000	2057000	Anyhow
2057000	2058000	So that is it
2058000	2059000	I believe for our gaming weeks
2059000	2060000	That's everybody
2060000	2061000	Quick housekeeping
2061000	2063000	And then we will get to the show
2063000	2065000	With the news and everything
2065000	2066000	Add us on Twitter
2066000	2068000	Twitter.com slash OLR
2068000	2070000	You can also add us on Facebook
2070000	2072000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
2072000	2074000	And Google Plus
2074000	2077000	Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio
2077000	2078000	A couple shout outs
2078000	2079000	I want to give here
2079000	2080000	At the top of the show
2080000	2082000	I want to shout out the website
2082000	2085000	Outcasts with a Z
2085000	2087000	Outcasts.com
2087000	2089000	Really awesome
2089000	2091000	This has not happened to me before
2091000	2093000	But they actually ran a feature on me
2093000	2094000	On their site
2094000	2095000	And it talked about
2095000	2097000	It talked about the history of Orange Lounge Radio
2097000	2100000	Talking about a little bit of my broadcast background
2100000	2101000	With Understation Live and everything
2101000	2106000	Outcasts.com is like a GLBT nerd gaming culture site
2106000	2108000	And Jamie got a name drop even
2109000	2111000	I mentioned you in the interview
2111000	2113000	I am sorry you did not make the story
2113000	2114000	I knew that was going to get called out
2114000	2115000	What happened? What was with me?
2115000	2116000	Because your name is in the interview
2116000	2118000	Because it talks about how OLR started
2118000	2120000	So it talks about Rob and Jamie started OLR
2120000	2121000	Da da da da da
2121000	2122000	But the problem is
2122000	2123000	I said in another part
2123000	2125000	I talked about how Loki is with it now
2125000	2127000	But they didn't use that part of it
2127000	2128000	Because technically
2128000	2130000	Loki didn't start the show with us
2130000	2131000	But it's like
2131000	2132000	He just kept showing up
2132000	2133000	Yeah but it's one of those things
2133000	2134000	Now how could we ever have the show without him
2134000	2135000	So I am very sorry Loki
2135000	2138000	But that was the interviewer's person
2138000	2140000	I know Travis and Jessica got shout outs too
2140000	2141000	For the Understation Live stuff
2141000	2143000	Loki none for Loki bye
2143000	2145000	The captioning is hilarious
2145000	2146000	Is it?
2146000	2147000	It's just like it's terrible
2147000	2148000	I mean it's got some
2148000	2150000	Okay so Orange Lounge Radio
2150000	2152000	You know the little intro part
2152000	2153000	The way they translate
2153000	2155000	Way but sprawled hollow
2158000	2159000	Let's see here
2160000	2161000	Let's see here
2161000	2162000	Let's see here
2165000	2166000	There was an
2166000	2167000	Oh
2170000	2172000	I don't even know what part this is
2172000	2173000	Doing next

2175000	2177000	And intriguing publishing Google recently
2180000	2182000	I'm gonna kill the Bens y'all

2183000	2185000	Oh man that's hilarious
2185000	2187000	Yeah just watch it with the subtitles on it's hilarious
2187000	2188000	That's great
2188000	2189000	That's great

2190000	2191000	There's actually a series of things
2191000	2193000	They do like that for Mass Effect 2 as well
2193000	2194000	Oh yeah
2194000	2195000	The bad closed captioning
2195000	2196000	Oh yeah
2196000	2197000	Good stuff
2197000	2198000	Yeah
2198000	2199000	I'm sure there's a lot of that out there
2199000	2200000	So anyway
2200000	2201000	Shout out for our YouTube channel
2201000	2202000	Check out the bad closed captioning
2202000	2203000	At Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube
2203000	2204000	Oh okay

2211000	2212000	That's what it
2212000	2213000	It's Jason's little
2213000	2214000	Yeah yeah
2214000	2215000	His little intro
2215000	2216000	The Sky this week gonna kill the Bens
2216000	2217000	Gonna kill the Bens
2217000	2218000	Alright
2218000	2219000	Where was I?
2219000	2220000	Where was I?
2220000	2221000	Stop interrupting me
2221000	2222000	Outkast
2222000	2224000	Loki's just mad because he somehow was missing from the article
2224000	2226000	Outkast.com and a big thanks to them
2226000	2227000	I really appreciate that
2227000	2229000	Give them all your clicks
2229000	2232000	Also another website to give all your clicks to
2232000	2235000	A fantastic little show called Troll in the Dungeon
2235000	2237000	Which is a World of Warcraft focused podcast
2237000	2239000	Had me on their show this past Saturday
2239000	2241000	I don't think the episode is posted on the feed yet
2241000	2243000	But it will be in the coming days
2243000	2244000	So check them out
2244000	2246000	That's Troll in the Dungeon over on iTunes and Stitcher and all that good stuff
2247000	2249000	And that was the episode from just this past
2249000	2251000	What was April 6th
2251000	2252000	Or no today is April 6th
2252000	2254000	April 5th would be the show I was on
2254000	2255000	Oh my god Rob
2255000	2256000	What?
2256000	2258000	Not next weekend but the weekend after
2258000	2259000	Gonna be older
2259000	2261000	Your birthday
2261000	2262000	What's your birthday plans? Anything?
2262000	2264000	Hopefully going to Sakura, Matsuri
2264000	2266000	I need to make sure it's that weekend
2266000	2268000	But I wanna hang out in San Francisco
2268000	2271000	And eat all the food I don't normally eat
2271000	2272000	Except the problem
2272000	2274000	It's also Passover
2274000	2275000	Oh
2276000	2278000	I was gonna say you should go to Dave and Busters
2278000	2280000	And do your get drunk as hell thing
2280000	2282000	That means I'm just gonna have to eat nothing but mochi
2282000	2284000	I'm voting that we change the name of our show
2284000	2287000	According to what it thinks our name of the show is
2287000	2289000	It's Orange Allow Injure Radio
2291000	2293000	Alright put that thing away
2293000	2295000	That's because of how you pronounce lounge Rob
2295000	2297000	You say lounge like
2297000	2299000	Lounge
2299000	2304000	Cause you extra enunciate when you do the intro
2304000	2306000	That's not my voice in the intro
2306000	2311000	Well I mean but when you do another episode of Orange Lounger Radio
2311000	2312000	You say lounger
2312000	2313000	Oh
2313000	2314000	Which is powerful
2314000	2316000	You sound almost like you're an evil dictator
2316000	2319000	This is Orange Allow Injure Radio
2319000	2322000	Orange Lounger Radio
2322000	2323000	I'll take it
2323000	2324000	Dark soccer
2324000	2325000	Dark soccer
2328000	2329000	Close it
2329000	2332000	Well you know I do have an affinity for kicking balls
2333000	2335000	There's her little clip in the next intro
2335000	2337000	Alright let's get into gaming news
2337000	2339000	Loki's gonna put away the closed captioning
2339000	2342000	And talk to us about what is going on in the gaming world
2342000	2344000	Here at Orange Allow Injure Radio
2345000	2350000	So the ever rumored Amazon set top box type thing
2350000	2354000	Was finally announced during a press event
2354000	2356000	They had it live blogged and everything
2356000	2358000	And it's the Amazon Fire TV
2358000	2360000	And it's actually a device that you know
2360000	2362000	Like most of those set top boxes out there
2362000	2364000	That you can stream you know Netflix
2364000	2367000	And of course you know the Amazon Video stuff
2367000	2368000	Hulu
2368000	2370000	All that sort of things
2370000	2374000	It runs Android so you can run different apps on it and stuff
2374000	2377000	Remotes and all that fun stuff
2377000	2379000	But the other cool thing about it though
2379000	2380000	Is it also
2380000	2382000	Is a device that you can game on
2382000	2387000	So they actually have a controller that you can buy for 40 bucks
2387000	2390000	That looks like you know a console controller
2390000	2393000	And you can play games
2393000	2396000	Of course you know they have the whole Amazon Game Studios
2396000	2398000	So there's that
2399000	2400000	It's kind of cool
2400000	2402000	The device is only $99
2402000	2406000	So there's your final nail in the coffin Uya
2406000	2408000	You're irrelevant now
2409000	2411000	Sounds like a big splat
2411000	2413000	Some of the games of course
2413000	2416000	Well hold up to be fair the Uya is $99 with a controller
2416000	2419000	If you want to play games on the Amazon Fire
2419000	2421000	You're telling me it's really $139
2421000	2424000	Spec wise though it's way more powerful than Uya
2424000	2427000	And it's got one thing that the Uya doesn't have
2427000	2430000	Which is Minecraft Pocket Edition
2430000	2434000	Well here's the $139 question though
2434000	2435000	Are you going to buy one?
2435000	2437000	Am I going to buy one?
2437000	2439000	I don't know if the wife would let me buy another set top box
2439000	2441000	I wanted to
2441000	2443000	Because we have the Boxee right now
2443000	2445000	But it's kind of crap
2446000	2450000	Yeah if my Boxee were to die somehow
2450000	2452000	Some unforeseen accident
2452000	2454000	Then yes I would totally pick one up
2454000	2455000	I'm going to be honest why?
2455000	2457000	I can't see the need to get
2457000	2460000	I mean I get why this Amazon Fire exists
2460000	2463000	It's a great appealing thing for my mom and my dad
2463000	2466000	Who are never going to buy a game console but want to have Netflix
2466000	2468000	Like the people that buy Roku's and things like that
2468000	2469000	That's great for them
2469000	2470000	That's exactly why I'd buy it
2470000	2471000	I wouldn't buy it to play games on it
2471000	2472000	Maybe Minecraft
2472000	2473000	I wouldn't even play Minecraft
2473000	2474000	Why would you even play Minecraft?
2474000	2476000	I would buy it for games
2476000	2478000	Well not games but maybe
2478000	2479000	I don't know
2479000	2482000	It would be kind of cool to publish something to that
2482000	2484000	Well let's not forget
2484000	2486000	Amazon bought a developer recently
2486000	2487000	Yeah
2487000	2489000	So they're going to have something exclusive
2489000	2490000	Well they do
2490000	2492000	It's a game called Sev Zero
2492000	2495000	It's a first person shooter type thing
2495000	2497000	So they've got that
2497000	2498000	Some of the things they're showing
2498000	2500000	Asphalt 8 and Minecraft
2500000	2503000	And the other thing though is it does work with other Bluetooth controllers
2503000	2509000	So maybe it would work with a DualShock controller
2509000	2510000	If you have one already
2510000	2515000	Andrew's pretty friendly with anything Bluetooth
2515000	2517000	I don't know it's not a huge deal
2517000	2519000	And also I think if you buy the controller
2519000	2520000	You get like some
2520000	2523000	I don't know how it works but it's like Amazon coins or something like that
2523000	2525000	It's like a thousand of that
2525000	2527000	Buy books or something
2527000	2529000	Buy things with that
2529000	2531000	I don't know the ratio of coins to money
2532000	2533000	So they've got that
2533000	2535000	And I don't know I'm kind of interested
2535000	2538000	Like I said I would mainly use it for
2538000	2540000	Just like TV stuff
2540000	2544000	It would be cool though because I didn't really get to see a lot of the interface thing
2544000	2546000	Because I had friends over at the time
2546000	2548000	But if it's
2548000	2551000	Like I think it is where I think it might combine
2551000	2552000	Like all the different
2552000	2554000	Like you're not going into dedicated apps for different things
2554000	2555000	I think it's just like
2555000	2557000	Okay I want to watch like
2557000	2559000	Game of Thrones or something
2559000	2561000	Maybe Game of Thrones is a bad example
2561000	2562000	I want to watch
2562000	2564000	The Office or something
2564000	2566000	And it will bring up all the different
2566000	2567000	Providers that have The Office
2567000	2569000	And where you can watch that
2569000	2571000	Or different movies and things
2571000	2573000	So it kind of aggregates it all together
2573000	2574000	Instead of like
2574000	2576000	Oh crap was that show on Netflix
2576000	2577000	Or was it on Hulu
2577000	2579000	I don't know I have to go browse Netflix
2579000	2580000	Oh it's not here okay
2580000	2581000	Browse Hulu
2581000	2582000	Amazon has it
2582000	2583000	That's smart
2583000	2585000	It's like a modern day TV guide
2585000	2587000	Yeah it's just instead of having
2587000	2588000	The Boxy tried doing that
2588000	2589000	It does it terribly
2589000	2591000	But they tried to do that
2591000	2594000	With a lot of the website streaming services and stuff
2594000	2596000	And then of course
2596000	2598000	Yeah so it does work
2598000	2600000	With their Bluetooth controllers and stuff
2600000	2602000	Let me read some chat comments real quick
2602000	2603000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
2603000	2604000	Tiger Claw says
2604000	2606000	What the Amazon Fire TV lacks
2606000	2608000	Is the ability to shop and buy stuff
2608000	2609000	In the Amazon store
2609000	2611000	That does seem like a pretty
2611000	2612000	Obviously missing thing right
2612000	2613000	Well I mean you could
2613000	2615000	Well I think
2616000	2618000	Well I think even with Amazon
2618000	2621000	Like when you're using the Amazon movies
2621000	2622000	Or TV
2622000	2625000	Like I know when you use the app on the Xbox 360
2625000	2627000	You're more than welcome to buy those things
2627000	2629000	Right there in the app and watch them
2629000	2631000	I think you can buy stuff
2631000	2632000	Yeah
2632000	2634000	You're talking about like buying like off of amazon.com
2634000	2635000	Yeah I think that's
2635000	2636000	They have mobile apps for them
2636000	2638000	And I'm pretty sure that's probably one of the apps
2638000	2640000	That's in the Amazon marketplace
2640000	2641000	Yeah
2641000	2643000	Which is not something they probably featured
2643000	2644000	Well yeah I mean they're not gonna show
2644000	2646000	Every single app that's available for you
2646000	2648000	Here's a way you can give us more money
2648000	2649000	Let's see
2649000	2652000	Kaijuto with some strong opinions on Pocket Minecraft
2652000	2653000	Pocket Minecraft blows
2653000	2654000	It's still in alpha
2654000	2656000	Waste of money
2656000	2658000	Yeah I have no interest in Pocket Edition
2658000	2659000	I do agree with you
2659000	2660000	I think it is kind of cheap
2660000	2661000	And it's just
2661000	2662000	You're saying that
2662000	2663000	Ooh it runs Minecraft
2663000	2664000	It's Android it runs Minecraft
2664000	2666000	I mean come on it's you know
2666000	2668000	All Android devices are a hell
2668000	2671000	You know all iOS devices run Minecraft
2671000	2672000	So
2673000	2674000	It's not a big deal
2674000	2677000	And because this device is based on one of those mobile platforms
2678000	2681000	I'm very interested to see what the PlayStation 4 version brings to the table
2681000	2683000	Now granted you know PC
2683000	2687000	But I know the console games have started to kind of go their direction
2687000	2689000	And the PC kind of has its direction or whatever
2689000	2693000	So I'm very curious what the extra oomph of the PlayStation 4 brings to Minecraft
2693000	2695000	And I'm not like I know people are going
2695000	2696000	But the graphics are never gonna get any better
2696000	2697000	I get that
2697000	2698000	I think they could actually
2698000	2699000	They could
2699000	2703000	And the space in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions is limited
2703000	2705000	Which you know it's a huge space
2705000	2707000	It would be cool if you did like the Sonic ether you know
2707000	2710000	Shaders or if you could select what type of shaders you want
2710000	2712000	Cause the Sonic ether stuff looks fucking awesome
2712000	2715000	Maybe they'll be able to have some of that stuff where you put your own skins
2715000	2716000	And things like that in there too
2716000	2717000	Like cause you see a little
2717000	2718000	They'll sell you skins
2718000	2719000	Yeah that's true
2719000	2721000	You see a little bit of that in the 360 version
2721000	2723000	With the mass effect and the Skyrim
2723000	2724000	They have like the PS3 one now too
2724000	2725000	Oh yeah
2725000	2727000	Yeah they don't have like you know dedicated packs
2727000	2728000	Where you get like levels and stuff
2728000	2732000	But they had one like they had like a city texture pack and stuff
2732000	2734000	And they have some character packs but
2734000	2735000	Could be interesting
2735000	2736000	I mean I don't know it's
2736000	2738000	Put it this way like for ninety nine bucks
2738000	2741000	That's about the price that you're gonna be paying for a lot of these set top boxes
2741000	2743000	They range around seventy nine to ninety nine anyways
2743000	2748000	And the fact that this one is about three times more powerful than those
2748000	2750000	It has a dedicated GPU in it
2750000	2754000	You might as well get this one even if you don't want a game on it
2754000	2756000	Cause maybe there's something down the road you know
2756000	2759000	There'll be like some free apps on it or something that you want to try out
2759000	2761000	Or who knows what people are gonna develop for
2761000	2762000	If it's popular enough
2762000	2764000	Which I think at that price point it's pretty
2764000	2767000	It's almost an impulse buy for like you know tech stuff
2767000	2772000	Well and come Black Friday they're gonna slice it down to seventy nine dollars
2772000	2773000	Or something even cheaper
2773000	2774000	Yeah I mean
2774000	2775000	For prime people I'm sure
2775000	2777000	It's definitely like if I didn't have the boxy
2777000	2779000	I would definitely consider picking that up
2779000	2781000	Now will a drone fly it to my house?
2781000	2782000	That's what I wanna know
2782000	2783000	Oh I don't think that
2783000	2785000	I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon but
2786000	2787000	It would be
2787000	2788000	I mean might as well
2788000	2789000	I mean cause it's more powerful
2789000	2792000	It's gonna be able to run even just video apps and stuff
2793000	2795000	Better than some of these other systems
2795000	2797000	Cause I gotta be honest like
2797000	2799000	My set top box is pretty old
2799000	2802000	And it shows it's really laggy
2802000	2803000	And just
2804000	2805000	I mean it does video okay
2805000	2808000	But you know the interfaces are just not very snappy
2808000	2811000	So it would be cool to check this out
2811000	2812000	That being said though
2812000	2814000	I'm kinda curious to see then
2814000	2819000	If this is really popular how Apple kinda combats it with like a new Apple TV or something
2819000	2821000	So I mean cause
2821000	2822000	It's only a moment
2822000	2824000	It's only a matter of time before there's like
2824000	2826000	Apple's overdue for a press conference I think
2826000	2828000	You know you'd be at an iPad update or
2828000	2829000	Not the iPhones
2829000	2831000	iPhones would be later in the year but
2831000	2833000	We know there's gonna be like some Apple TV thing at some point
2833000	2834000	Yeah absolutely
2835000	2836000	Alright well
2836000	2837000	There you go
2837000	2839000	Well one game that will not be on the Amazon Fire
2839000	2841000	Because you know what it just
2841000	2842000	It just needs
2842000	2843000	It needs more oomph behind it
2843000	2845000	It needs the kind of oomph that the Wii U can deliver
2845000	2848000	And that is Mario Kart 8 is on the horizon
2848000	2851000	There was quite the information dump on Mario Kart 8 this week
2851000	2853000	Because we're only what
2853000	2855000	We're about a month and a half out
2855000	2856000	I guess maybe two months
2856000	2858000	But May 30th is the big day for Mario Kart 8
2858000	2860000	And there's new information coming out on the game
2860000	2861000	Through some trailers this week
2861000	2862000	And it looks great
2862000	2864000	A lot of people very pumped for it
2864000	2865000	Which is really good news for Wii U
2865000	2867000	Cause there's nothing to get excited about
2867000	2868000	It does like it is
2868000	2869000	On the horizon
2869000	2870000	I gotta be honest so like
2870000	2871000	You know before
2871000	2872000	I was just like well
2872000	2873000	You know it's just Mario Kart
2873000	2875000	It doesn't look that much better
2875000	2876000	The new trailer is actually
2876000	2878000	It does look a lot better
2878000	2879000	I mean game play wise
2879000	2880000	I'm not really sure
2880000	2881000	But the tracks look pretty
2881000	2883000	And the engine looks nice
2883000	2884000	So
2884000	2886000	Quickly some of the things that are new
2886000	2888000	That were from this trailer
2888000	2889000	There's now a spin boost
2889000	2891000	So when you're racing upside down
2891000	2892000	Or on walls
2892000	2893000	Cause remember this is kind of the new thing
2893000	2894000	For Mario Kart
2894000	2896000	Is that it's getting all F-Zero
2896000	2898000	And you can be upside down on walls
2898000	2900000	You can bump into other racers
2900000	2901000	And certain obstacles
2901000	2902000	To get a speed boost
2902000	2904000	And there's a spin boost
2904000	2905000	That will basically
2905000	2906000	They say is gonna change
2906000	2908000	The way players boost
2908000	2909000	And everything
2909000	2910000	So that could be very interesting
2910000	2911000	Some new characters announced
2911000	2913000	That are returning from prior games
2913000	2915000	Metal Mario
2915000	2916000	Lakitu
2916000	2917000	And Shy Guy
2917000	2918000	All coming back
2918000	2919000	Which is great
2919000	2920000	I loved Shy Guy
2920000	2921000	He was a great racer
2921000	2922000	So I'm looking forward to that
2922000	2923000	This is joining the cast
2923000	2924000	With the Kooplings
2924000	2926000	And I'm sure a bunch of the other standards
2926000	2927000	There as well
2927000	2928000	Some new items
2928000	2929000	In the game
2929000	2930000	The Piranha Plant
2930000	2932000	Which will attach to the front of the car
2932000	2934000	And then it chomps at other characters
2934000	2936000	Or banana peels on the track
2936000	2937000	And even shells
2937000	2938000	No word if that
2938000	2940000	Mother fucker blue shell
2940000	2941000	Will get eaten by the Piranha Plant
2941000	2942000	And you know the blue shell
2942000	2944000	Is gonna be invincible
2944000	2945000	And everybody's bane
2945000	2946000	Well like I was reading some comments
2946000	2948000	On people talking about it
2948000	2950000	They said that if they had the blue shell
2950000	2953000	Like they had it in Mario Kart 64
2953000	2955000	Where it was pretty rare to get it
2955000	2956000	Not just like
2956000	2957000	Oh you're in last place
2957000	2958000	You're gonna get it every single time
2958000	2959000	Yeah yeah yeah
2959000	2961000	That would have been a lot better
2961000	2964000	Also a new item called the Boomerang Flower
2964000	2965000	Which you know
2965000	2966000	The Boomerang Hammer Brothers and stuff
2966000	2969000	You've seen this item in the Mario games before
2969000	2970000	The Boomerang Flower
2970000	2972000	Will let you throw a Boomerang at opponents
2972000	2973000	And it will stun them
2973000	2976000	And the arc that the Boomerang takes
2976000	2977000	Will allow you to hit multiple players
2977000	2980000	You can throw it forward or backward three times
2980000	2982000	That sounds pretty powerful
2982000	2985000	They also showed off some remixed courses
2985000	2986000	Such as Moo Moo Meadows
2986000	2987000	From Mario Kart Wii
2987000	2989000	Toad's Turnpike from 64
2989000	2990000	Yes
2990000	2991000	That's really sweet
2991000	2992000	That's the best track
2992000	2993000	Yes
2993000	2995000	Donut Plains from Super Mario Kart redesigned
2995000	2998000	And instead of going with the retro looking graphics
2998000	3000000	They actually took that old course
3000000	3001000	And made it with the new graphics
3001000	3005000	I mean it definitely has that retro block look to it
3005000	3007000	But you'll see it when you see the video
3007000	3010000	Live recorded music
3010000	3011000	Which I think is kind of neat
3011000	3014000	And yeah various control schemes
3014000	3015000	The Wii U gamepad
3015000	3016000	The Wii U Pro Controller
3016000	3017000	And the wheel
3017000	3019000	Rainbow Road 64
3019000	3020000	Yes
3020000	3021000	Looks great
3021000	3022000	Fantastic
3022000	3023000	Now by the way
3023000	3026000	You know one of the kind of most people agree
3026000	3028000	This is the weakest game that ever came out in the series
3028000	3030000	Maybe not everybody agrees
3030000	3033000	But you know not a lot of love for Mario Kart Double Dash
3033000	3034000	Over the years
3034000	3035000	Which was the GameCube version
3035000	3037000	Where two people were racing at a time
3037000	3039000	And a very interesting interview with IGN
3039000	3041000	Where Hideki Kono said
3041000	3045000	Talking about possibly implementing this in the future titles
3045000	3046000	Quote
3046000	3047000	It wasn't just a simple case of
3047000	3048000	Hey we're not going to do that again
3048000	3050000	We really think the two racers together
3050000	3052000	In one kart of Double Dash was really unique
3052000	3054000	And we thought it worked really well
3054000	3055000	We've got that in our pocket
3055000	3057000	So if we come up with any new cool ideas
3057000	3059000	That utilize having two players racing together
3059000	3060000	We'll grab that
3060000	3062000	And possibly bring it back out
3062000	3064000	Having two players racing together
3064000	3066000	It does have a pretty high cost in terms of processing power
3066000	3067000	So that's an obstacle
3067000	3068000	That being said
3068000	3071000	If we could come up with some ways around that processing cost
3071000	3072000	We may have two players
3072000	3075000	Maybe even three players racing together
3075000	3077000	So they're not done with that idea yet
3077000	3078000	Maybe I don't know
3078000	3084000	I wouldn't exert too much development staff time on that
3084000	3089000	So I'm pretty sure that we're not going to see this in Mario Kart 8
3089000	3091000	That just might be something in the future
3091000	3094000	One other quick thing I want to drop in Nintendo News
3094000	3096000	Because they did do the info dump on Mario Kart 8
3096000	3099000	And I mentioned it's really the only game on the horizon
3099000	3100000	That we have to look forward to
3100000	3102000	Certainly there's a lot of stuff down the road
3102000	3104000	You know like the Bayonetta 2
3104000	3107000	And we know there's this stuff way down the road
3107000	3108000	Way way down there
3108000	3111000	But one of the other games that's inching closer and closer
3111000	3113000	Is the new Super Smash Brothers
3113000	3116000	They're having a big direct next week
3116000	3117000	I believe on Tuesday
3117000	3120000	It is a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Smash Brothers
3120000	3122000	Some people thinking we're going to get the release date
3122000	3124000	I'm thinking you might
3124000	3126000	You might get the month
3126000	3128000	Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday
3128000	3131000	Which we're finally going to know if it's holiday this year or next year
3131000	3133000	I think you're going to get the name
3133000	3135000	The real name will finally be out there
3135000	3137000	So I think that's the big thing that they're going to tell you
3137000	3139000	Super Smash Brothers U
3139000	3141000	Well it's on 3DS as well
3141000	3143000	So I don't know if that's the way they can go with it
3143000	3145000	Super Smash Brothers U and 3DS
3145000	3147000	3DU? Who knows? Who knows?
3147000	3148000	Alright let's move on
3148000	3150000	Dark Sakura
3150000	3156000	Well you know I have to say that kids are very resourceful
3156000	3158000	And sometimes find ways to make things happen
3158000	3164000	And in this case a 5 year old found a security hole in the Xbox One account login
3164000	3166000	A little kid named Christopher
3166000	3170000	Tried to log into his dad's Xbox One
3170000	3172000	And he didn't know the password
3172000	3174000	So all he did was keep entering spaces
3174000	3176000	After every time it failed
3176000	3178000	And it let him in
3178000	3180000	So basically this was reported
3180000	3183000	And Microsoft thanked him for finding the security hole
3183000	3185000	Which is actually funny
3185000	3187000	It said his dad is a security researcher
3187000	3191000	But basically after they found it and recorded it
3191000	3195000	Microsoft sent them some gifts as a thank you
3195000	3197000	After of course they patched this out
3197000	3201000	So they gave the kid and his dad
3201000	3205000	They acknowledged them as Microsoft security researchers for March 2014
3205000	3211000	Gave them $50 for Xbox One games and a year of Xbox Live Gold
3211000	3216000	So I guess if a kid's gonna try to sneak into daddy's account
3216000	3219000	I guess there are worse things that could happen for it
3219000	3221000	But I don't know I think
3221000	3224000	It shouldn't have been that easy
3224000	3228000	But at least it's something that was when it was discovered
3228000	3230000	It was reported and not used maliciously
3230000	3232000	Of course then again the dad's also a security researcher
3232000	3234000	So that makes sense
3234000	3236000	I don't know did you hear about that?
3236000	3239000	I heard about it but I mean if there's an exploit
3239000	3241000	That a 5 year old can accidentally find
3241000	3243000	That's pretty bad
3243000	3245000	I mean I don't know
3245000	3250000	Why is anyone able to log into someone's account
3250000	3252000	By just hitting the space bar
3252000	3255000	Or not the space bar but hitting space a bunch of times
3255000	3258000	That's just I don't know
3258000	3261000	It seems really lazy
3261000	3264000	Well maybe it's just that they didn't figure that
3265000	3270000	I mean it could possibly be something that was put in for system testing at the time
3270000	3273000	And then they figured it out after the fact
3273000	3275000	I don't know
3275000	3277000	It just
3277000	3279000	So
3279000	3281000	Anyways
3281000	3283000	So the Xbox One
3283000	3287000	Oh one last thing Kajudo also said that kid broke into his dad's cell phone
3287000	3290000	That kid's gonna grow up to be a hacker
3290000	3292000	Well he's just a little brat now isn't he
3293000	3295000	So the Xbox One
3295000	3298000	One of the things that it kind of lacked
3298000	3300000	Compared to some of it's competition
3300000	3303000	Is the ability to upgrade it's internal storage
3303000	3308000	Well now they're gonna be adding some external storage options
3308000	3310000	Coming soon
3310000	3313000	Apparently Major Nelson confirmed that
3313000	3315000	They will be adding external data support
3315000	3317000	And apparently
3317000	3319000	At a later time
3319000	3321000	Hopefully that means actual hard drives
3321000	3323000	You know a lot of these Xbox One games
3323000	3325000	Do require installations
3325000	3329000	And hell if you wanted to even go the whole digital route
3329000	3332000	If you're in my opinion dumb enough to do it
3332000	3335000	That takes up a lot of space
3335000	3339000	And you can only store so much in there in the first place
3339000	3342000	And hell they just I think added
3342000	3346000	The ability to see what you have on there as far as storage space goes
3346000	3349000	Because before it was pretty convoluted
3349000	3351000	What they had on there
3351000	3353000	I just don't understand how
3353000	3355000	Something like that
3355000	3358000	A core piece of functionality is just
3358000	3360000	Eh we'll just get to it later on
3360000	3363000	You know we don't really need to have the ability to
3363000	3366000	You know install your games on an external device or anything
3366000	3368000	In case you run out of space
3368000	3371000	Eh screw that we'll just
3371000	3374000	We'll just leave you to fend with the 500 gigabyte hard drive
3374000	3377000	Which you know 500 gigabytes is not that bad
3377000	3379000	Like the Xbox 360 or something
3379000	3381000	But when the file sizes of these games
3381000	3384000	Can be up to 10 times the size of an Xbox 360 game
3384000	3387000	That adds up pretty fast
3390000	3392000	Are you, you don't even
3392000	3395000	Is Xbox One even on your radar to get low key so you can
3395000	3396000	Oh fuck no
3396000	3397000	Eh still not
3397000	3398000	Not really ours either
3398000	3399000	Unless they announced
3399000	3401000	Even like let me put it this way
3401000	3403000	Even if they announced that Grand Theft Auto 5
3403000	3405000	Was coming next gen
3406000	3408000	I would not buy an Xbox One
3408000	3409000	That's a pretty strong statement
3409000	3411000	I'll get an Xbox One eventually
3411000	3413000	But it's just gonna take probably the next Halo
3413000	3414000	And Quantum Break
3414000	3416000	Which I'm anticipating would be this holiday
3416000	3418000	I don't see why they won't
3418000	3420000	Or at least
3420000	3422000	Even if Halo is not this holiday
3422000	3423000	I wonder if they'll do like
3423000	3425000	Halo 2 Anniversary Edition or something
3425000	3426000	But to be fair though
3426000	3427000	Like even the PlayStation 4
3427000	3429000	There's not really much that wants me
3429000	3431000	You know infamous Second Son looks pretty awesome
3431000	3433000	I've heard a lot of good things about that one
3433000	3435000	You know what might sell me on an Xbox One
3435000	3437000	Is if the new Crackdown game was really awesome
3437000	3439000	Like that might
3439000	3441000	You know the Crackdown is pretty awesome
3441000	3443000	I kinda like that game but
3443000	3446000	Right now there's just not anything upcoming
3446000	3448000	Especially the multiplatform stuff
3448000	3451000	Nothing really says oh I need to get this on next gen
3451000	3453000	What if they cut the price for the holiday
3453000	3455000	It would have to be by a lot
3455000	3456000	Like a lot a lot
3456000	3458000	Like we're talking down to $2.99 or something
3458000	3460000	I would not
3460000	3462000	Like even like that's the thing I was looking at
3462000	3464000	We use oh maybe I want Mario Kart 8
3464000	3466000	You know maybe
3466000	3468000	Maybe I do want one of those systems
3468000	3470000	But
3470000	3472000	It's just not cheap enough for me
3472000	3473000	Like I don't
3473000	3475000	I'm not gonna really buy a system for one game
3475000	3477000	And
3477000	3480000	You know spending like $200 even
3480000	3482000	Yeah $200 or more on it
3482000	3484000	Just doesn't seem worth it to me
3486000	3488000	To register participation for this week's episode
3488000	3490000	Of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com
3491000	3493000	Going to our chatroom over at
3493000	3495000	Live.vognetwork.com
3495000	3497000	VXChaseNXV says who the hell wants to plug in
3497000	3499000	Mass storage into their game console
3499000	3501000	I don't even like to do that with my computer
3501000	3503000	I only do it begrudgingly
3503000	3505000	There's probably not a lot of reason for it right now
3505000	3507000	With so many limited games although the games are huge
3507000	3509000	But I do know like people like to download
3509000	3511000	Especially when you're downloading like entire TV series
3511000	3513000	Which you can do on Playstation 3
3513000	3515000	And some people have done it
3515000	3517000	And Xbox as well
3517000	3519000	You need a place to put those files
3520000	3522000	The reason why they have it that you can't
3522000	3524000	Fucking upgrade your drive in the Xbox
3524000	3526000	One or Xbox 360
3526000	3528000	Without buying one that's officially
3528000	3530000	From Microsoft is because they have their
3530000	3532000	Fucking stupid file system in there that's
3532000	3534000	What is it? FATX or XFAT
3534000	3535000	Or something like that
3535000	3537000	It's just some really stupid
3537000	3539000	File system that they have that
3539000	3541000	Is exclusive to those stupid consoles
3543000	3544000	I mean they have
3544000	3546000	XFAT's not exclusive to a console
3546000	3548000	Well they have ways to like you know format them
3548000	3550000	With like you know homemade programs
3550000	3552000	And stuff like that but
3552000	3554000	It's not like it's running
3554000	3556000	You know FAT32
3556000	3558000	Like the Playstation 3 was
3560000	3562000	They don't have just a standardized
3562000	3563000	File system in there
3563000	3565000	So you can't just pop in the hard drive
3565000	3567000	They want you to buy the 10 times more expensive
3567000	3569000	Hard drive that's going to be exclusive
3569000	3571000	For that console
3572000	3574000	Alright well moving on to more Xbox news
3574000	3576000	This news came out early in the week
3576000	3578000	That is certainly huge as
3578000	3580000	To the direction of Microsoft
3580000	3582000	Phil Spencer who was formerly
3582000	3584000	The corporate vice president of
3584000	3586000	Microsoft Studios is now the head of
3586000	3588000	Xbox over at Microsoft
3588000	3590000	And there was an interview that he did with
3590000	3592000	Major Nelson or Larry Erb
3592000	3594000	The day that you know or the day after
3594000	3596000	It was announced there
3596000	3598000	They're talking a little bit about E3 already
3598000	3600000	And you know some of the things hyping up there
3600000	3602000	Some people warming up to Phil Spencer because
3602000	3604000	It does seem like one of the first things
3604000	3606000	He's doing is he's making the conversation about the games
3606000	3608000	And he also essentially said
3608000	3610000	I mean I'm going to
3610000	3612000	Well I do have a quote here I'll say this
3612000	3614000	I know a lot of times people give nods to the different forums
3614000	3616000	Out there the different communities of people
3616000	3618000	I will honestly say I learn a ton
3618000	3620000	From listening to the feedback
3620000	3622000	Reading the forum ideas
3622000	3624000	I saw just when I was announced in the position
3624000	3626000	The first things that Phil Spencer should do as head of Xbox
3626000	3628000	There were a lot of great ideas there
3628000	3630000	Oh yeah I saw that too
3630000	3632000	He better bring back Shenmue 3
3632000	3634000	Which I think he said was like the number one most requested game
3634000	3636000	For Xbox
3636000	3638000	It's crazy which I don't even know how they would do that
3638000	3640000	Without a massive Sega partnership
3640000	3642000	Well then Sega let the trademark right now
3642000	3644000	They would just go up to Sega
3644000	3646000	And Sega would be like
3646000	3648000	Oh hey what the hell
3648000	3650000	What's all this money being thrown at me
3650000	3652000	Hey you want to play a game of Lucky Hit?
3652000	3654000	Anyway
3654000	3656000	So yeah you know
3656000	3658000	You notice that Phil Spencer
3658000	3660000	Does seem to be in tune with
3660000	3662000	The internet critics for better or for worse
3662000	3664000	I don't know if that's always necessarily a good thing
3664000	3666000	But he does definitely want to take the conversation
3666000	3668000	To games and he's talking about E3
3668000	3670000	And how they're already you know
3670000	3672000	They don't want to have a bunch of suits up there
3672000	3674000	They want the game makers out on stage
3674000	3676000	Talking about the games and you betcha
3676000	3678000	They're already planning E3
3678000	3680000	I mean they're already talking about you know
3680000	3682000	How many minutes are we going to give
3682000	3684000	What game and how's that all going to go
3684000	3686000	You bet all that stuff is being finalized right now
3686000	3688000	So
3688000	3690000	I'm excited to see where Phil Spencer takes the company
3690000	3692000	He certainly qualified for the job
3692000	3694000	So let's see what happens
3694000	3696000	Hopefully
3696000	3698000	We'll appease the people that were not happy
3698000	3700000	With the movies movies movies
3700000	3702000	Sports sports sports direction of the Xbox
3702000	3704000	But you know what I
3704000	3706000	I still think that
3706000	3708000	You know if Xbox really does
3708000	3710000	Make this full fleshed
3710000	3712000	Entertainment channel I think that's a huge
3712000	3714000	Asset
3714000	3716000	I don't think that's really been done
3716000	3718000	Like as far as the whole TV integration
3718000	3720000	Aside from being able to plug
3720000	3722000	I'm not even talking about that I'm talking about original content
3722000	3724000	Like the Halo thing with Spielberg and some of that stuff
3724000	3726000	I don't know
3726000	3728000	That's almost like the same stuff that we see on Netflix
3728000	3730000	And Amazon where they have their own original shows
3730000	3732000	I mean that's cool
3732000	3734000	But Netflix has Emmy award winning
3734000	3736000	Shows like Orange is the New Black
3736000	3738000	And House of Cards I don't believe Halo is going to be
3738000	3740000	Getting any sort of fucking Emmys
3740000	3742000	Well but could they get nerd cred
3742000	3744000	Equivalent
3744000	3746000	I don't know I saw their
3746000	3748000	Halo live action movie that they just
3748000	3750000	Did or whatever someone did
3750000	3752000	They licensed to
3752000	3754000	But I just
3754000	3756000	Think though the whole point though is they were
3756000	3758000	Focusing like oh it's going to be
3758000	3760000	This really integrated experience and stuff like that
3760000	3762000	And it kind of reminded me a whole bunch when they were
3762000	3764000	Talking about the whole
3764000	3766000	Second screen experience that you would get
3766000	3768000	With the
3768000	3770000	Xbox 360 even
3770000	3772000	And even kind of bringing it back to the Xbox One
3772000	3774000	Where it's like oh you can watch Game of Thrones
3774000	3776000	And there's all this interactive material on there
3776000	3778000	And where is that?
3778000	3780000	You know is that going to be happening
3780000	3782000	You know today I mean
3782000	3784000	Where is that stuff because
3784000	3786000	They talk a big game but
3786000	3788000	In the end it seemed like this is just
3788000	3790000	It's just like ooh
3790000	3792000	I can plug in my cable boxes to the back of
3792000	3794000	You know my game system like I could
3794000	3796000	A VCR
3796000	3798000	Well it's going to be a very
3798000	3800000	Interesting E3 to say the least
3800000	3802000	So we will be staying tuned
3802000	3804000	And the news is going to
3804000	3806000	Start to dry up as we get a little closer to
3806000	3808000	E3 and then once we hit like mid-May
3808000	3810000	Then all that news starts kind of leaking out so it's
3810000	3812000	Going to be a very interesting ramp up
3812000	3814000	Here to the June E3 show
3814000	3816000	Anyway more news DarkSakura
3816000	3818000	Well everyone knows I'm a big Treasure fan right?
3818000	3820000	Well this is something that's pretty happy
3820000	3822000	So basically
3822000	3824000	Treasure is actually working with Capcom to make
3824000	3826000	A sequel to
3826000	3828000	The game that they did on 3DS
3828000	3830000	Called Geist Crusher
3830000	3832000	And they're actually doing a version called
3832000	3834000	Geist Crusher God
3834000	3836000	That is basically
3836000	3838000	You go around and
3838000	3840000	Hunt boss creatures and kill them
3840000	3842000	That's the game but it's Treasure
3842000	3844000	So you know it's always got a twist to it
3844000	3846000	Really neat game but I thought that this one
3846000	3848000	Given that Treasure has done
3848000	3850000	Nothing but awesome games
3850000	3852000	Would definitely be something a lot of people would want to keep on their radar
3852000	3854000	The
3854000	3856000	The uh
3856000	3858000	Just the voice acting though in the trailer
3858000	3860000	Is pretty hilarious
3860000	3862000	This is Geist Crusher God
3862000	3864000	You know so it's like
3864000	3866000	It sounds like they're really gonna
3866000	3868000	Push for that level
3868000	3870000	So yeah just a little something
3870000	3872000	Alright well I'm sure that makes you happy
3872000	3874000	To hear about what's going on there
3874000	3876000	I love Treasure
3876000	3878000	Well let's talk about games that will be coming out a little bit
3878000	3880000	Sooner as we travel around the world and look at
3880000	3882000	The release dates
3882000	3884000	Loki why don't you start off with the US
3884000	3886000	Loki you're dead quiet again
3886000	3888000	I think you turned the mic on
3888000	3890000	Ok so anyways as I was saying
3890000	3892000	The Xbox 360 version
3892000	3894000	Of Titanfall was finally released
3894000	3896000	That is coming out
3896000	3898000	And from what I hear
3898000	3900000	It's actually pretty good
3900000	3902000	Except it runs at 30 frames per second
3902000	3904000	There's that I guess
3904000	3906000	Also this week Lego The Hobbit
3906000	3908000	Which is coming out on Playstation 3
3908000	3910000	Xbox 360, Playstation 4
3910000	3912000	Xbox One
3912000	3914000	3DS and Vita
3914000	3916000	And PC
3916000	3918000	The Wii U version
3918000	3920000	Though not coming out yet
3920000	3922000	Which is kind of surprising
3922000	3924000	And then um
3924000	3926000	Also later this week we've got
3926000	3928000	A game called Putty Squad
3928000	3930000	On Vita and Playstation 3
3930000	3932000	Lego Friends on the DS
3932000	3934000	And
3934000	3936000	Hopefully still coming out this week
3936000	3938000	Not delayed again but Hello Kitty Cruisers
3938000	3940000	On the Wii U
3940000	3942000	I guess that was released digitally already
3942000	3944000	But the physical version is just
3944000	3946000	Not out yet
3946000	3948000	And also
3948000	3950000	The one game I think that so far
3950000	3952000	Is actually going to be utilizing the Kinect
3952000	3954000	In a non-danced way
3954000	3956000	Kinect Sports Rivals coming to
3956000	3958000	Xbox One this week
3958000	3960000	Might be worth picking up
3960000	3962000	If you have that
3962000	3964000	And Jamie
3964000	3966000	This is something that you might want to pick up
3966000	3968000	Disney Magical World
3968000	3970000	For 3DS coming out on Friday
3970000	3972000	That's that game that crosses
3972000	3974000	Kind of like Animal Crossing with Disney characters
3974000	3976000	I need this in my life
3976000	3978000	So there's that
3978000	3980000	Alright well traveling to Japan
3980000	3982000	Yay I'm traveling to Japan
3982000	3984000	Looking at the releases there
3984000	3986000	Hey there's a Playstation 4 game out in Japan this week
3986000	3988000	It is Final Fantasy XIV Online
3988000	3990000	Just like we're getting here in the US
3990000	3992000	So that is a worldwide release
3992000	3994000	Coming out of Japan as well on April the 14th
3994000	3996000	On the Playstation 3
3996000	3998000	Excuse me
3998000	4000000	Sorry about that
4000000	4002000	On the Playstation 3 this week on the 10th
4002000	4004000	You can check out Dream Club Go Go
4004000	4006000	Is out on the Playstation 3
4006000	4008000	As well as Mato Kiranai
4008000	4010000	Yuge Kitai
4010000	4012000	Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters
4012000	4014000	Comes out from Arc System Works on April the 10th
4014000	4016000	Also
4016000	4018000	Oretache ni Subasa wa Nai
4018000	4020000	Under the Innocent Sky
4020000	4022000	So
4022000	4024000	A few games there on the Playstation 3
4024000	4026000	On the Xbox 360 this week just Titanfall
4026000	4028000	Titanfall gets its Japanese release as well
4028000	4030000	On the 360 this week
4030000	4032000	On the Playstation Vita
4032000	4034000	Some similar games there
4034000	4036000	The Oretache ni Subasa wa Nai
4036000	4038000	Under the Innocent Sky is out there
4038000	4040000	As is the Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters game
4040000	4042000	Those are both out on the Vita this week
4042000	4044000	On April the 10th
4044000	4046000	And on the Wii U this week
4046000	4048000	Nothing, they don't have anything until a Monster Hunter
4048000	4050000	That comes out on April 23rd
4050000	4052000	But the 3DS does have
4052000	4054000	Crayon Shin-chan
4054000	4056000	Crayon Shin-chan still
4056000	4058000	Arashi wo Yobu
4058000	4060000	Kasukabe Iga Stars
4060000	4062000	From Bandai Namco
4062000	4064000	That's a series that won't die
4064000	4066000	That is out on the 3DS this week
4066000	4068000	And that is a series that won't die
4068000	4070000	But you can make your own mini movies
4070000	4072000	And stuff it looks like
4072000	4074000	And look, there's Booty
4074000	4076000	In this little cartoon Booty
4076000	4078000	In the game
4078000	4080000	Doesn't he usually have his pants down or something like that?
4080000	4082000	I think that's the joke
4082000	4084000	There you go, that's the releases for Japan
4084000	4086000	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
4086000	4088000	Well on the 8th we have
4088000	4090000	Looks like
4090000	4092000	It's not actually in the name, I think it's 0
4092000	4094000	On PS4 and Xbox One
4094000	4096000	And then Max The Curse of the Brotherhood
4096000	4098000	On April 9th
4098000	4100000	On the 10th is Family Guy The Quest
4100000	4102000	For Stuff
4102000	4104000	On iOS and Android
4104000	4106000	Warlock II The Exiled
4106000	4108000	And another one on PC
4108000	4110000	That they're not giving me the name of
4110000	4112000	Which I'm going to see if I can find out what it is
4112000	4114000	Oh Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online
4114000	4116000	And then on the 11th
4116000	4118000	We have Football Manager Classic 2014
4118000	4120000	Kinect Sports Rivals
4120000	4122000	Lego The Hobbit
4122000	4124000	A bunch of Lego The Hobbit
4124000	4126000	And a bunch more Lego The Hobbit
4126000	4128000	So yeah, that's it
4128000	4130000	Well good news for Lego The Hobbit fans
4130000	4132000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys
4132000	4134000	This is the classic game of the week
4134000	4136000	And it's a good one tonight
4136000	4138000	Alright, so this is kind of disappointing
4138000	4140000	But apparently the Resistance
4140000	4142000	Games, they are going offline
4142000	4144000	Starting April 8th
4144000	4146000	And that is of course the online
4146000	4148000	Multiplayer portion of the game
4148000	4150000	You will not be able to play that anymore
4150000	4152000	Come April 8th
4152000	4154000	I don't know, I had a lot of fun
4154000	4156000	Playing Resistance, the first one at least
4156000	4158000	Split screen multiplayer
4158000	4160000	That was kind of fun to be able to do that
4160000	4162000	Didn't really get too much into
4162000	4164000	Two or three of those
4164000	4166000	Still disappointing to see that
4166000	4168000	They are taking that down
4168000	4170000	Not a lot of people are playing it anymore
4172000	4174000	Alright, well one more thing going offline
4174000	4176000	Not just Resistance going offline
4176000	4178000	But this one is having a huge impact
4178000	4180000	The GameSpy network is going offline
4180000	4182000	This is going offline
4182000	4184000	On May 31st
4184000	4186000	We sort of saw the hint of this coming
4186000	4188000	When Nintendo suddenly decided they were going to
4188000	4190000	Pull the Wii online stuff
4190000	4192000	And it was theorized that
4192000	4194000	There is probably something larger going on with GameSpy
4194000	4196000	And that they are increasing fees
4196000	4198000	And Nintendo didn't want to pay them
4198000	4200000	Sure enough, the whole damn plug is getting pulled
4200000	4202000	On all of GameSpy
4202000	4204000	GameSpy technologies
4204000	4206000	Closing the matchmaking service on May 31st
4206000	4208000	This is really the end of an era
4208000	4210000	Because I remember using GameSpy to find a game of
4210000	4212000	Quake to play online
4212000	4214000	Correct me if I'm wrong though
4214000	4216000	Aren't some modern games actually using GameSpy
4216000	4218000	Borderlands does
4218000	4220000	Yes, Borderlands does use GameSpy
4220000	4222000	So there are some games that
4222000	4224000	We are out there
4224000	4226000	That are no longer going to work anymore
4226000	4228000	Now I don't think
4228000	4230000	Anybody has used GameSpy since
4230000	4232000	2010
4232000	4234000	Which is when Borderlands 1
4234000	4236000	But Borderlands 2 uses it as well
4236000	4238000	No it doesn't, Borderlands 2 doesn't use GameSpy
4238000	4240000	Are you sure about that?
4240000	4242000	I think it uses Steamworks
4242000	4244000	Chatter can correct me if I'm wrong
4245000	4247000	So yeah, if the company doesn't have the funding
4247000	4249000	Or the reason to go back and
4249000	4251000	Make another network work with the game
4251000	4253000	It's going to not work anymore
4253000	4255000	So this shouldn't be a huge surprise
4255000	4257000	GameSpy stopped making editorial content
4257000	4259000	In 2013
4259000	4261000	Glue Mobile, the mobile games publisher
4261000	4263000	Actually bought this in 2012
4263000	4265000	They kind of just ran it into the ground
4265000	4267000	Literally
4267000	4269000	And Bobby Blackwolf confirmed that
4269000	4271000	Borderlands 2 used GameSpy
4271000	4273000	And what's funny is that Bobby said
4273000	4275000	When he interviewed them, I even asked them that
4275000	4277000	And they were like, no, fuck GameSpy
4277000	4279000	So I guess they're not too happy
4279000	4281000	About the first time around, who knows
4281000	4283000	So, yeah, again, the end of an era
4283000	4285000	GameSpy was originally launched actually
4285000	4287000	As a Quake server search program
4287000	4289000	I used to use that to play Quake games
4289000	4291000	Man, I miss those days
4291000	4293000	So
4293000	4295000	Alright, well
4295000	4297000	Let's see what we got here
4297000	4299000	So we've got
4299000	4301000	Alright, well
4301000	4303000	You know, here on this show we like to
4303000	4305000	Look back at an era long gone
4305000	4307000	With a segment we call the classic game of the week
4309000	4311000	DarkSakura's going to dive into the gaming vault
4311000	4313000	And find a game that she thinks, hey
4313000	4315000	You should play this game right now
4315000	4317000	If you can find it
4317000	4319000	DarkSakura, in the original form
4319000	4321000	Good luck
4321000	4323000	DarkSakura, what is the classic
4323000	4325000	Game of the week?
4325000	4327000	The classic game of the week
4327000	4329000	The classic game of the week is
4329000	4331000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
4331000	4333000	What?
4333000	4335000	Sorry, I was trying to get your attention offline
4335000	4337000	You okay over there?
4337000	4339000	No, my mic got caught under the cord
4339000	4341000	Oh no
4341000	4343000	The joys of live radio, there we go
4343000	4345000	Alright, so
4345000	4347000	As we were saying, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
4347000	4349000	Yep
4349000	4351000	And of course the one with enough music
4351000	4353000	To actually play is the
4353000	4355000	1990 version
4355000	4357000	I am specifically referring to the original
4357000	4359000	That came out in 1985
4359000	4361000	When I was nine years old
4361000	4363000	I would play the crap
4363000	4365000	Out of this game
4365000	4367000	And it was
4367000	4369000	Released
4369000	4371000	Like I said in 1985
4371000	4373000	And distributed by the World
4373000	4375000	Ominak and Books of Facts
4375000	4377000	That was published by Feros Books
4377000	4379000	It was
4379000	4381000	Included with some versions
4381000	4383000	Of the Amiga 500
4383000	4385000	And there was also like I said
4385000	4387000	An enhanced version that came out in 1990
4387000	4389000	That did not have the
4389000	4391000	Ominak copy protection
4391000	4393000	But it had disc based copy protection
4393000	4395000	And there was a further deluxe
4395000	4397000	Expanded version that came out in 1992
4397000	4399000	So basically
4399000	4401000	You have to use your knowledge
4401000	4403000	Of geography and clues
4403000	4405000	To chase down Carmen's henchmen
4405000	4407000	Or henchwomen
4407000	4409000	Because there were henchwomen
4409000	4411000	Then eventually arrest Carmen herself
4411000	4413000	So you'd have to go to the country
4413000	4415000	That the crime happened
4415000	4417000	And then use hints about where to go next
4417000	4419000	And you basically chase all over the world
4419000	4421000	And some of the, there were some fun
4421000	4423000	Jokes, you know there were definitely some puns
4423000	4425000	Going about
4425000	4427000	And some inaccuracies
4427000	4429000	For some of the pictures
4429000	4431000	Like for example
4431000	4433000	When you go to Peru instead of
4433000	4435000	Showing you a picture of Lima when you're there
4435000	4437000	It actually shows you Machu Picchu
4437000	4439000	But at any rate
4439000	4441000	If you go to the incorrect location
4441000	4443000	You get fake clues
4443000	4445000	And you have to backtrack
4445000	4447000	Until you can find which way
4447000	4449000	The vile henchmen went to
4449000	4451000	It's V-I-L-E
4451000	4453000	And then your case will run
4453000	4455000	Out of time
4455000	4457000	And your culprit will escape
4457000	4459000	And basically you're reporting to Interpol
4459000	4461000	And everything
4461000	4463000	So eventually though if you do keep going
4463000	4465000	Along the case you can basically
4465000	4467000	Exclude all but one of the suspects
4467000	4469000	And then you can
4469000	4471000	Issue an arrest warrant which is actually really
4471000	4473000	Inaccurate because
4473000	4475000	I love some of the cheesy animations that were in the game
4475000	4477000	Like you have a little burglar dancing across the screen right now
4477000	4479000	It's V-I-L-E henchmen
4479000	4481000	The arrest warrant thing
4481000	4483000	Was actually super inaccurate because
4483000	4485000	Interpol actually uses what's called red notices
4485000	4487000	Which means that you have
4487000	4489000	The right to ask the local government
4489000	4491000	To arrest somebody instead of you
4491000	4493000	Actually having an arrest warrant
4493000	4495000	You have to go through the local governments
4495000	4497000	Anyway, going back to the game world
4497000	4499000	You can be promoted
4499000	4501000	If you answer different geography questions
4501000	4503000	Right
4503000	4505000	And you use the reference book that came with the program
4505000	4507000	So it's really
4507000	4509000	Edutainment
4509000	4511000	As far as some of the different locations
4511000	4513000	That are in the game
4513000	4515000	You had Buenos Aires
4515000	4517000	You had Sydney
4517000	4519000	You had
4519000	4521000	Bamako in Mali
4521000	4523000	You had Tokyo
4523000	4525000	You had
4525000	4527000	Moscow
4527000	4529000	All kinds of places all over the world
4529000	4531000	And there's something else
4531000	4533000	That really came along with this
4533000	4535000	There's been certain things
4535000	4537000	Kept canon
4537000	4539000	Through different versions of the game
4539000	4541000	I think
4541000	4543000	It's been established that there are different universes
4543000	4545000	For the Carmen Sandiego franchise
4545000	4547000	But there's one thing that's always
4547000	4549000	Remained constant
4549000	4551000	Is Carmen herself
4551000	4553000	Her outfits have changed
4553000	4555000	And they've changed her hair color like once
4555000	4557000	But she's always been
4557000	4559000	Latina
4559000	4561000	And always
4561000	4563000	Really strong and in control of the company
4563000	4565000	And her vile group
4565000	4567000	But the whole point of it was that
4567000	4569000	She was doing it for the challenge
4569000	4571000	And not necessarily for any kind of
4571000	4573000	Really overly malicious
4573000	4575000	Purpose
4575000	4577000	And the fact that she can keep all these people
4577000	4579000	Under control
4579000	4581000	Is a really tightly run, I'd say, organization
4581000	4583000	It's actually made her
4583000	4585000	Kind of a role model
4585000	4587000	For young girls
4587000	4589000	Even if, yeah, she's breaking the law
4589000	4591000	But still
4591000	4593000	There were, of course, many other games
4593000	4595000	In the series
4595000	4597000	We've had
4597000	4599000	Multiple versions of
4599000	4601000	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
4601000	4603000	We've had the Treasures of Knowledge version
4603000	4605000	That came out in 2001
4605000	4607000	And then
4607000	4609000	There were also
4609000	4611000	Where in Time
4611000	4613000	Is Carmen Sandiego
4613000	4615000	There were also various
4615000	4617000	Other, there was Where in the USA
4617000	4619000	Where in Space
4619000	4621000	Junior Detective Where in America
4621000	4623000	Has Passed
4623000	4625000	Where in North Dakota, which was a prototype
4625000	4627000	Where in Time is probably one of my favorites
4627000	4629000	Because I was really good at it
4629000	4631000	There was Where in Europe
4631000	4633000	Where in the USA
4633000	4635000	Think Quick Challenge
4635000	4637000	Great Chase Through Time World Detective
4637000	4639000	Math Detective Treasures of Knowledge
4639000	4641000	Secret of the Stolen Drums
4641000	4643000	Uh, Mystéral Baud de Monde
4643000	4645000	Wow, I didn't even know all these other ones
4645000	4647000	Actually, you talking about the other versions
4647000	4649000	I'm gonna use this opportunity to switch over
4649000	4651000	To some footage from the original
4651000	4653000	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
4653000	4655000	Yeah
4655000	4657000	Uh, there was also
4657000	4659000	Um, the TV
4659000	4661000	Show, which was Where in the World
4661000	4663000	Where in Time, Where on Earth was an animation
4663000	4665000	And Where in the Universe was a planetarium
4665000	4667000	Show. There were also albums
4667000	4669000	That was Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
4669000	4671000	And Out of This World
4671000	4673000	So, uh, we've had
4673000	4675000	Tons of, uh, different
4675000	4677000	You know, pretty reputable, uh, publishers
4677000	4679000	And distributors. We had PBS
4679000	4681000	Uh, okay, I will
4681000	4683000	Take anything with Fox
4683000	4685000	With a grain of salt, but it was Fox Family Channel
4685000	4687000	And Fox Kids
4687000	4689000	But we've had, uh, BAM Entertainment
4689000	4691000	Mindscape, uh, The Learning Company
4691000	4693000	Broderbund, which was the original publisher
4693000	4695000	Or developer, I should say
4695000	4697000	Uh, just all kinds of, you know, really
4697000	4699000	Good, I think, has come
4699000	4701000	Out of, uh,
4701000	4703000	You know, the franchise
4703000	4705000	And, of course, you also worked for the
4705000	4707000	ACME Detective Agency
4707000	4709000	That worked worldwide
4709000	4711000	So
4711000	4713000	But I'm trying to see
4713000	4715000	Okay, ACME VILE
4715000	4717000	Was, um, let's see if I can find what VILE
4717000	4719000	Stood for, because that was the one
4719000	4721000	Thing that's eluding me
4721000	4723000	Um
4723000	4725000	Okay, VILE was not an acronym
4725000	4727000	It was just V-I-L-E
4727000	4729000	But it didn't really
4729000	4731000	It didn't really mean anything
4731000	4733000	So that's probably why I didn't know what it meant
4733000	4735000	So, there you go
4735000	4737000	And, of course, the leader of ACME is the chief
4737000	4739000	Who was a sassy black lady
4739000	4741000	That didn't need no man
4741000	4743000	She was awesome
4743000	4745000	In the TV show, yes, which everybody in chat
4745000	4747000	Talking about the TV show, dying for me to play the theme
4747000	4749000	But, well, you have to stay tuned
4749000	4751000	To the very end of the show
4751000	4753000	That's right, you just sit down and shut up and wait
4753000	4755000	Maybe the same person who picks the classic game
4755000	4757000	Also picks the fortune cookie
4757000	4759000	So
4759000	4761000	But, yeah, that's
4761000	4763000	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
4763000	4765000	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
4765000	4767000	Maybe in China, according to this player right now
4767000	4769000	Who knows, so there it is, your classic game of the week
4769000	4771000	Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
4771000	4773000	Great series
4773000	4775000	One of the all-time best
4775000	4777000	Vegetainment games from my youth
4777000	4779000	You've got Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
4779000	4781000	Number Munchers
4781000	4783000	And
4783000	4785000	Oregon Trail, that's about it
4785000	4787000	Those are the huge ones from Oregon
4787000	4789000	Oregon Trail
4789000	4791000	Dungeon Buster says
4795000	4797000	Do you think they retconned that in?
4797000	4799000	Through the Meaning has consistently been maintained
4799000	4801000	Since 1985
4801000	4803000	Well, see, I didn't realize that
4803000	4805000	It wasn't in any of my stuff
4805000	4807000	So
4807000	4809000	You learned something from our chat room today
4809000	4811000	Well, I forgot anyway
4811000	4813000	I haven't touched the game in like
4813000	4815000	Probably since I was 11
4815000	4817000	You know, Jamie, it's okay
4817000	4819000	It's okay to make mistakes
4819000	4821000	You know what, I'm making the big W off
4821000	4823000	The line because it's the whatevs
4823000	4825000	Whatever
4825000	4827000	Alright
4827000	4829000	That is it for this

4863000	4865000	I don't know, if
4865000	4867000	Game of Swords or whatever's done
4867000	4869000	And Rasslin' is done and all that stuff
4869000	4871000	Is it Chair of Swords?
4871000	4873000	By the way, Honest Game Trailer
4873000	4875000	Or Honest Trailers, whatever
4875000	4877000	Finally did a
4877000	4879000	Chair of Swords one
4879000	4881000	I like the compilation of
4881000	4883000	All the death scenes
4883000	4885000	Featuring the most uncomfortable chair ever
4885000	4887000	But anyway, all that stuff
4887000	4889000	All that is hopefully wrapping up
4889000	4891000	By now so some of you guys might be joining us
4891000	4893000	Just after that
4893000	4895000	Well you missed some chatter in the first

4919000	4921000	We really appreciate it
4921000	4923000	Oh Jason's telling me in chat, wrestling is not over
4923000	4925000	Oh well
4925000	4927000	I thought it was because people started showing up all of a sudden
4927000	4929000	So I was like, oh maybe it's finished
4929000	4931000	Fine, maybe it'll be done by the time phone calls start
4931000	4933000	Alright
4933000	4935000	In the meantime, let's get some rapid fire
4935000	4937000	News
4937000	4939000	Let's start with Loki
4939000	4941000	Alright so this was a game I actually played
4941000	4943000	At least the second one in the series
4943000	4945000	Metro
4945000	4947000	You may remember
4947000	4949000	Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light
4949000	4951000	Well there was something that leaked
4951000	4953000	Out that was apparently
4953000	4955000	An internal document from Deep Silver
4955000	4957000	And it was showing
4957000	4959000	A title called Metro Redux
4959000	4961000	Which is basically
4961000	4963000	A redo
4963000	4965000	Or
4965000	4967000	An HDerfied
4967000	4969000	New version of those two games
4969000	4971000	For consoles for Playstation 4 and
4971000	4973000	Xbox One
4973000	4975000	It was later confirmed
4975000	4977000	Actually by 4A Games
4977000	4979000	And Deep Silver
4979000	4981000	That it is a title that's in development
4981000	4983000	And they're going to be sharing more
4983000	4985000	They say this side of E3
4985000	4987000	Sometime before E3
4987000	4989000	You'll find out more about it
4989000	4991000	And
4991000	4993000	I don't know, I'd be excited about that
4993000	4995000	Cause those games are pretty good
4995000	4997000	Had really good storylines
4997000	4999000	The Grand Theft Auto 5
4999000	5001000	iFruit app
5001000	5003000	Is now available on Vita
5003000	5005000	That was something that was released originally
5005000	5007000	On Windows Phone, iOS
5007000	5009000	And Android
5009000	5011000	That was basically like a little fake
5011000	5013000	The iFruit is their
5013000	5015000	Apple clone in the game
5015000	5017000	And it had a bunch of different apps
5017000	5019000	On there for customizing your cars
5019000	5021000	Customizing your license plates
5021000	5023000	And they even had a little Tamagotchi game
5023000	5025000	For Chop where you can kind of train
5025000	5027000	And raise them
5027000	5029000	Now you can do that if you have a Vita
5029000	5031000	That's kind of cool
5031000	5033000	And it is free to download
5033000	5035000	It works with the Playstation 3 version of the game of course
5035000	5037000	And last but not least
5037000	5039000	The Call of Duty
5039000	5041000	Ghost Devastation
5041000	5043000	DLC
5043000	5045000	Is seriously Jump the Shark
5045000	5047000	I gotta be honest
5047000	5049000	I don't know what the fuck
5049000	5051000	Other than having fun with the series
5051000	5053000	Cool, that's awesome
5053000	5055000	But like
5055000	5057000	The stuff that they've done for Call of Duty
5057000	5059000	Hasn't really made a lot of sense for ghosts
5059000	5061000	They have
5061000	5063000	Basically the ability
5063000	5065000	To play as the predator in one of the maps
5065000	5067000	And what they've done
5067000	5069000	Kind of with
5069000	5071000	Call of Duty Ghost is each map has its own
5071000	5073000	Kind of like
5073000	5075000	Basically it's like a killstreak that you get
5075000	5077000	That's exclusive to that map
5077000	5079000	And one of them in this case is actually
5079000	5081000	Playing as the predator
5081000	5083000	And I think one of the other maps
5083000	5085000	I think it was Ghost
5085000	5087000	I don't think it was Black Ops 2
5087000	5089000	But Ghost had it
5089000	5091000	I want to say where there was a map where you could play as Michael Myers
5091000	5093000	From Halloween
5093000	5095000	What do you mean William Shatner?
5095000	5097000	So
5097000	5099000	It's just
5099000	5101000	I don't know, cool
5101000	5103000	They're having fun with it
5103000	5105000	People enjoy that kind of thing, that's cool
5105000	5107000	That actually launched last week
5107000	5109000	On Xbox One
5109000	5111000	Xbox 360
5111000	5113000	The
5113000	5115000	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 versions
5115000	5117000	I'm assuming are coming later on
5117000	5119000	Oh and PC later on as well
5119000	5121000	Xbox gets that exclusive window
5121000	5123000	Alright well
5123000	5125000	Moving on to a short
5125000	5127000	Window of time for you to get tickets
5127000	5129000	For the Dota 2
5129000	5131000	International 2014
5131000	5133000	The Dota 2 International
5133000	5135000	Championship for 2014
5135000	5137000	Is taking place at the Key Arena in Seattle
5137000	5139000	It will be taking place from
5139000	5141000	July 18th to July 21st
5141000	5143000	And if you wanted to go
5143000	5145000	Well guess what, you're already out of luck
5145000	5147000	Because the tickets sold out in an hour
5147000	5149000	So you had one hour window to catch that
5149000	5151000	10,000 tickets sold within an hour
5151000	5153000	So Dota 2
5153000	5155000	It's kind of popular there
5155000	5157000	So you can check that out in Seattle
5157000	5159000	Huh? A bit
5159000	5161000	Yeah you can check that out in Seattle at the Key Arena
5161000	5163000	You can get your tickets on eBay
5163000	5165000	To go see that
5165000	5167000	The Key Arena, that's where the
5167000	5169000	Supersonics used to play
5169000	5171000	But sadly Seattle doesn't have a team anymore
5171000	5173000	And they were unsuccessful in taking ours
5173000	5175000	So Key Arena, at least still able to have
5175000	5177000	These big events such as the Dota 2 International
5177000	5179000	You can try to find the tickets on eBay
5179000	5181000	If you really want to go
5181000	5183000	But I'm sure they'll sell the whole viewing passes
5183000	5185000	Online and all that good stuff
5185000	5187000	Blizzard
5187000	5189000	Taking Hearthstone
5189000	5191000	Finally to the iPad
5191000	5193000	They've been talking about doing this for a little bit
5193000	5195000	When they first announced the game
5195000	5197000	And now that the game is live
5197000	5199000	It's time to start the 18 month beta process
5199000	5201000	That Blizzard will go through
5201000	5203000	I'm exaggerating here
5203000	5205000	But with Hearthstone on the iPad
5205000	5207000	But here's the catch, you can only download this
5207000	5209000	In Australia, Canada, and New Zealand
5209000	5211000	Those are the only places where Hearthstone
5211000	5213000	Is actually available on the store
5213000	5215000	But some of you crafty people have figured out
5215000	5217000	How you make an account in another country
5217000	5219000	You can download the game to your device anyway
5219000	5221000	There's quite a few people that are doing that
5221000	5223000	So there's all these walkthroughs out there
5223000	5225000	It doesn't involve anything about having iTunes cards
5225000	5227000	For those countries, does it?
5227000	5229000	I don't think so
5229000	5231000	I know that's the way that they do it for music
5231000	5233000	But don't quote me
5233000	5235000	I don't care enough about Hearthstone
5235000	5237000	To go to the Canadian store and make a fake account
5237000	5239000	And download it
5239000	5241000	Neither do I, but
5241000	5243000	But with like a review, a review would be nice
5243000	5245000	Well I reviewed it on the PC
5246000	5248000	I mean hearing more from our listeners
5248000	5250000	In those countries, we would like reviews from them
5250000	5252000	Oh sure, of course, of course
5252000	5254000	I'd like to hear if you thought it was as mediocre as I did
5254000	5256000	There you go
5256000	5258000	Hearthstone on the iPad
5258000	5260000	I know there's some fans out there
5260000	5262000	That are gonna be angry at me for saying that
5262000	5264000	But you know, I got my opinion
5264000	5266000	You got yours, email us if you want
5266000	5268000	Participate at orangeslawnsradio.com
5268000	5270000	Lastly, this was news
5270000	5272000	This is actually old news
5272000	5274000	But it slipped under our radar
5274000	5276000	So I need to bring this up
5276000	5278000	Because this news came out the week that we had the short show
5278000	5280000	Because I was moving
5280000	5282000	So this completely was not on our radar
5282000	5284000	But it was brought to my attention this week
5284000	5287000	That there is a Gauntlet reboot happening
5287000	5291000	And there's a trailer out there now
5291000	5293000	And you can actually check this out
5293000	5295000	Maybe I'll play a little bit of this here in studio
5295000	5297000	I don't remember
5297000	5299000	If there's narration or what have you
5299000	5301000	But just for Dark Soccer's sake
5301000	5303000	You can see there it's coming from WB Games
5304000	5306000	It better have the music
5306000	5308000	I don't think it does have the original music
5310000	5311000	Crying
5311000	5315000	But you can see there it's very Diablo-esque in how it looks
5315000	5317000	So it looks like it's taking elements of Gauntlet
5317000	5319000	And mixing it with Diablo
5322000	5323000	Okay
5323000	5325000	So that's what the new Gauntlet looks like
5325000	5327000	And luckily they still call them
5327000	5329000	Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf
5329000	5331000	They try to give them names and all this stuff
5331000	5333000	This is Bob the Elf
5334000	5336000	We have Gertrude the Valkyrie
5337000	5340000	They're saying it is a completely modernized action RPG
5340000	5342000	It's going to be direct to digital
5342000	5344000	WB Games vault
5344000	5346000	Which means you're pretty much only going to be able to get it
5346000	5348000	On the Steam
5348000	5350000	And those types of places
5350000	5351000	What is interesting about this though
5351000	5353000	It's being made by Arrowhead as I mentioned
5353000	5355000	You may not know their other game
5355000	5356000	But it's Magica
5356000	5357000	Magica was cute
5357000	5359000	Yeah Magica was a huge game
5359000	5360000	And it was pretty cool
5360000	5361000	And the Tron Robes
5361000	5362000	Yeah the Tron Robes and all that stuff
5362000	5363000	So those are the people we can Gauntlet
5363000	5365000	So that's pretty exciting there
5366000	5367000	So there you go
5367000	5369000	Gauntlet is being remade
5369000	5371000	And supposedly out this summer
5371000	5372000	On digital platforms
5372000	5374000	Which means the price should be right as well
5374000	5375000	We'll see
5375000	5376000	Dark Soccer what do you have for us?
5376000	5379000	Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney
5379000	5380000	Okay
5380000	5381000	So yeah
5381000	5383000	As Loki said during the last part
5383000	5385000	Disney's Magical World 3DS
5385000	5387000	Is supposed to be coming out
5387000	5389000	But there is a
5390000	5392000	It's supposed to be an exclusive
5392000	5395000	The 3DS XL that goes with it
5395000	5397000	Is an exclusive for Walmart
5397000	5401000	And I don't care enough to go to Walmart to get it
5401000	5404000	But there will also be coming out
5404000	5406000	There's the Mickey 3DS XL
5406000	5409000	There's also a Peach Pink Nintendo 2DS
5409000	5411000	That's an exclusive for GameStop
5411000	5413000	That will be coming out to celebrate
5413000	5415000	Disney's Magical World launch
5415000	5417000	The game will be out on April 11th
5417000	5419000	And you know my birthday is this month
5419000	5421000	Just saying people
5421000	5427000	Also there are Australian ratings out for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow
5427000	5432000	F-Zero GP Legend
5432000	5434000	I'm starting to get tongue tied
5434000	5440000	And those are listed for the Wii U's Gameboy Advance store
5440000	5444000	So we should be seeing those probably before too long
5445000	5448000	And then last but not least
5448000	5452000	There is a statement from the Sonic Lost World producer
5452000	5456000	Who wants to do more Nintendo DLC
5456000	5458000	That's Iizuka Takashi
5458000	5461000	Who created Sonic Lost World
5461000	5464000	Basically wants to do more levels
5464000	5466000	Working with Nintendo
5466000	5469000	But that could be for Zelda or Yoshi levels
5469000	5471000	It could use other Nintendo IPs
5471000	5475000	But it is just different things that they want to do
5475000	5477000	Going out for Sonic Lost World
5477000	5479000	And that's it
5479000	5481000	Alright
5481000	5483000	That Sonic Lost World DLC sure looked interesting
5483000	5485000	I didn't believe
5485000	5487000	I thought it was like an April Fools Joker
5487000	5489000	I didn't believe it was a thing until I actually was
5489000	5491000	Seeing the screenshots and the videos in motion
5491000	5493000	I was like wow
5493000	5495000	I didn't think they were going to go that far with it
5495000	5497000	But that's kind of neat
5497000	5499000	Alright
5499000	5501000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week
5509000	5511000	Every week we ask a question on our Facebook
5511000	5513000	And our Google Plus communities
5513000	5515000	You slam those words together and you get
5515000	5517000	Foogle
5517000	5519000	Let's get to the question
5519000	5521000	Which has to do with that new fangled Amazon fire
5521000	5523000	We were talking about earlier
5523000	5525000	When we posted to our communities
5525000	5527000	A new challenger approaches
5527000	5529000	The long rumors
5529000	5531000	Of Amazon jumping into the
5531000	5533000	Gaming arena proved true this week
5533000	5535000	With the announcement of the Amazon fire
5535000	5537000	What did you think of the announcement?
5537000	5539000	Do you think the Amazon fire will impact gaming?
5539000	5541000	And more importantly, are you getting one?
5541000	5543000	Let's get to some of the answers
5543000	5545000	Our buddy Shane answered
5545000	5547000	Shane Alinko answered
5547000	5549000	And said is this not the Ouya 2.0
5549000	5551000	But maybe done better?
5551000	5553000	I have faith that Amazon will support it
5553000	5555000	But I don't think it's going to be huge competition
5555000	5557000	Let's get to the main three
5557000	5559000	No desire to get one because of that
5559000	5561000	Critical Myth
5561000	5563000	The man behind tv.vognetwork.com
5563000	5565000	With his crew over at the Critical Myth show
5565000	5567000	Says it's a bit closer
5567000	5569000	To what the Ouya claimed it would be
5569000	5571000	But I still don't see a need for it
5571000	5573000	Those already using the Amazon
5573000	5575000	Fire services might feel differently
5575000	5577000	Brett the Hayes says
5577000	5579000	I like the idea that someone like Amazon
5579000	5581000	Is trying this out despite their efforts
5581000	5583000	With the not so warm reception of the Fire tablets
5583000	5585000	Since they have somewhat of an ecosystem
5585000	5587000	In place already
5587000	5589000	I don't think they'll do anything for hardcore gaming
5589000	5591000	Except maybe push Sony to bring Vita TV
5591000	5593000	To the US
5593000	5595000	It is interesting that one Amazon
5595000	5597000	Exec was making a distinction that this device
5597000	5599000	Is not a gaming device
5599000	5601000	And probably shows their fear of ending up like
5601000	5603000	Ouya and probably why they're marketing
5603000	5605000	The Fire TV as a set-top box
5605000	5607000	First
5607000	5609000	Blood Drunk says
5609000	5611000	Never really had any interest in those TV boxes
5611000	5613000	The announcement of Fire TV doesn't really change that
5613000	5615000	I still think that having a laptop
5615000	5617000	And desktop plugged in with wireless keyboard and mouse
5617000	5619000	Is the way to go
5619000	5621000	More power and diversity
5621000	5623000	Burr replied and said
5623000	5625000	I think it has the best chance of making an Android
5625000	5627000	A credible console platform
5627000	5629000	But in the end it's stuck in a hard place
5629000	5631000	Where anything with wide enough appeal would probably play just as well
5631000	5633000	On a tablet or smartphone
5633000	5635000	And anything that would get the hardcore gamer's attention
5635000	5637000	Would have to compete with more established platforms
5637000	5639000	Felipe A. replied
5639000	5641000	I hope I said your name right
5641000	5643000	Fire TV will be a great boost
5643000	5645000	To the local economies it is marketed in
5645000	5647000	The amount of jobs created to dispose of them
5647000	5649000	Will open up new positions in the waste management sector
5649000	5651000	Not since the plastic guitars from Guitar Hero
5651000	5653000	Or the Ouya
5653000	5655000	Has a sizable increase in landfill size
5655000	5657000	Been needed
5657000	5659000	Anyone here owning a Zune or a Gizmondo
5659000	5661000	Knows
5661000	5663000	Well where things like this end up
5663000	5665000	Welcome to your new home Fire TV
5665000	5667000	That was a sassy answer
5667000	5669000	I don't think it's gonna go anywhere
5669000	5671000	He's saying it's going to the dump
5671000	5673000	Going with your game.com
5673000	5675000	What the hell were those tacos
5675000	5677000	Hey for the record we gave our game comms away
5677000	5679000	What were the taco phones called
5679000	5681000	The Nokia
5681000	5683000	The Engage
5683000	5685000	We gave those away too and I think we sold one
5685000	5687000	It's because they didn't have Patrick Stewart as a pitchman
5687000	5689000	For that you know that's why that didn't end up working out
5689000	5691000	Engage
5691000	5693000	Alright
5693000	5695000	Nemesis 47 replies and said
5695000	5697000	Though this has potential it's not going to be enough
5697000	5699000	To beat the big three as far as gaming
5699000	5701000	And will be the next Ouya
5701000	5703000	I don't got any intention of buying the system
5703000	5705000	I'll stick to my PlayStation 3
5705000	5707000	Tech 2030 says
5707000	5709000	I think this will have a better chance of being a third
5709000	5711000	Console than something like Ouya or GameStick
5711000	5713000	Considering it has great
5713000	5715000	Video streaming functionality
5715000	5717000	Our pal Tiara replies
5717000	5719000	And she says this will be the Philips
5719000	5721000	CDI of a new generation
5721000	5723000	Ouch
5723000	5725000	And Tigerclaw says
5725000	5727000	It could do better than the Ouya
5727000	5729000	If the processing power is better
5729000	5731000	Which we know it's going to be so
5731000	5733000	We'll see
5733000	5735000	Going over to Google Plus I don't want to ignore our
5735000	5737000	Pals over there on Google Plus
5737000	5739000	Again you can follow us on Google Plus
5739000	5741000	If you just go to
5741000	5743000	Google.com
5743000	5745000	Slash plus orange lounge radio
5745000	5747000	And
5747000	5749000	We didn't get a single answer on Google Plus
5749000	5751000	Hey Rob
5751000	5753000	Confirmed you guys
5753000	5755000	No one's using Google Plus
5755000	5757000	I was just thinking if we're calling it Fugal
5757000	5759000	Would the opposite be Goobook
5759000	5761000	We could call it Goobook I don't know
5761000	5763000	Is that, it's a little
5763000	5765000	That's a little bit more even between Google and
5765000	5767000	Facebook
5767000	5769000	But yeah not a single answer on our Google
5769000	5771000	Where's actdeft and Flaco Jones
5771000	5773000	Redertainment the guys that usually answer over there
5773000	5775000	They're eating a pizza
5775000	5777000	You're all watching Wrestlemania
5777000	5779000	Everyone's talking about trying to compete with
5779000	5781000	Home consoles it's not
5781000	5783000	It's trying to be a set top box
5783000	5785000	It's trying to push Amazon shit
5785000	5787000	That they have on Android
5787000	5789000	And their services like their video streaming services
5789000	5791000	That's all it is
5791000	5793000	That being said though
5793000	5795000	It's going to be way fucking better than the Ouya
5795000	5797000	And I think they've already said
5797000	5799000	That they're probably going to get the
5799000	5801000	Was it the
5801000	5803000	Ouya the run on it anyway
5803000	5805000	So
5805000	5807000	You know
5807000	5809000	What's interesting and I think very telling
5809000	5811000	About those answers I don't think a single person in there
5811000	5813000	Said they're getting one
5813000	5815000	Not a single one I mean granted
5815000	5817000	Us gamers were not the target audience
5817000	5819000	I suppose but I don't know
5819000	5821000	Well like I wouldn't get it for any of the games that they have
5821000	5823000	On there cause like you know
5823000	5825000	Had it come out like several years ago
5825000	5827000	Before Minecraft
5827000	5829000	Was on consoles then that would have been like
5829000	5831000	Oh yeah I can play Minecraft on my
5831000	5833000	TV now but now it's just like
5833000	5835000	Eh whatever
5835000	5837000	Alright
5837000	5839000	Well let's move on with some more news
5839000	5841000	Low key
5841000	5843000	So there's a survey sent out
5843000	5845000	About the Playstation 4 and mainly
5845000	5847000	The Playstation network services and stuff
5847000	5849000	And there's some stuff that they were asking about
5849000	5851000	That
5851000	5853000	Kind of leads people to believe that
5853000	5855000	They're going to be doing a reputation system
5855000	5857000	Kind of like what they have on the Xbox One
5857000	5859000	Which I think is a great idea
5859000	5861000	Basically saying the system would assign
5861000	5863000	Users reputation ratings
5863000	5865000	Based on feedback from fellow players
5865000	5867000	And mentions
5867000	5869000	I guess an improved matchmaking system
5869000	5871000	Also they were saying that
5871000	5873000	It was going to take reputation into
5873000	5875000	Considerational appearance so basically
5875000	5877000	What I want to see is
5877000	5879000	I want to see
5879000	5881000	Amazon style reviews
5881000	5883000	For players like on your profile
5883000	5885000	This player
5885000	5887000	Sucks one star
5887000	5889000	No that sounds like it would be horrible
5889000	5891000	I can't even imagine
5891000	5893000	Oh my gosh
5893000	5895000	You'd have the people that found it helpful
5895000	5897000	People that didn't find it helpful
5897000	5899000	You know
5899000	5901000	A metacritic score maybe
5901000	5903000	Can you imagine what your profile would say
5903000	5905000	This guy is so angry and he kicked my ass
5905000	5907000	At grand theft auto 5
5907000	5909000	I don't talk on my headset really
5909000	5911000	No because I'm in the room with
5911000	5913000	Yes if my co-workers
5913000	5915000	Were playing with me
5915000	5917000	They would probably fill me out
5917000	5919000	And say quite negative things about me
5919000	5921000	They always say I'm hacking
5921000	5923000	Even though
5923000	5925000	I can play any
5925000	5927000	We've switched consoles so many times now
5927000	5929000	It's like oh he's hacking
5929000	5931000	Fine I'll beat you on your console
5931000	5933000	I'll play on yours you play on mine
5933000	5935000	Oh he's just hacking that one now too
5935000	5937000	People
5937000	5939000	Alright
5939000	5941000	Let's go to
5941000	5943000	Some more news
5943000	5945000	This is kind of interesting
5945000	5947000	Where have your favorite franchises ended up?
5947000	5949000	Going to
5949000	5951000	Pachinko machines
5951000	5953000	And the newest characters that will be coming
5953000	5955000	To Pachinko machines
5955000	5957000	Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown
5957000	5959000	What?
5959000	5961000	These are Pachi's slot machines
5961000	5963000	That are headed for Japan
5963000	5965000	Yeah SNK Playmore is using
5965000	5967000	The Fatal Fury and Samurai's Showdown names
5967000	5969000	To make these Japanese
5969000	5971000	Slot machines which are I guess
5971000	5973000	I've never played these but I guess it's kind of like Pachinko
5973000	5975000	They don't license anything
5975000	5977000	I mean seriously remember when they were licensing
5977000	5979000	What was that I think
5979000	5981000	I don't know if it was Samurai's Showdown
5981000	5983000	Or King of Fighters or something
5983000	5985000	It was that Shmup game
5985000	5987000	I think it was the King of Fighters Shmup game
5987000	5989000	Well these series haven't had
5989000	5991000	Games in a very very very long time
5991000	5993000	So Fatal Fury Premium
5993000	5995000	Is one of the games
5995000	5997000	And Samurai Spirits
5997000	5999000	Because that's what it was always called overseas
6000000	6002000	There's actually trailers
6002000	6004000	For these I have not watched this yet
6004000	6006000	I think I should what do you guys think should I watch this
6006000	6008000	Trailer here? Alright let's take a look
6008000	6010000	Let's do it where no one else can see it
6010000	6012000	Well if you're watching OLR on YouTube
6012000	6014000	You can see the trailer here

6022000	6024000	Did Mickey Rooney die?
6024000	6026000	I thought
6026000	6028000	Didn't he die a long time ago?
6028000	6029000	No?
6029000	6030000	Oh
6030000	6031000	Hold on
6031000	6033000	Okay play it I'm gonna look this up
6033000	6035000	You stopped that trailer just to say
6035000	6037000	That a celebrity had passed away?
6037000	6038000	Dude it's fucking Mickey Rooney
6038000	6040000	Yeah I know but I kind of thought he was already dead
6040000	6041000	No offense I mean
6041000	6042000	You also thought Shirley Temple was dead
6042000	6044000	I did think she was dead
6044000	6045000	Girl
6045000	6047000	There's a lot of people I think are dead
6048000	6050000	Speaking of dead let's go back to the franchise
6050000	6052000	For these uh
6052000	6054000	For these series
6054000	6056000	Let's go back to the trailer for these franchises that are super dead
6056000	6059000	Uh oh yeah TMZ reporting that Mickey Rooney died
6059000	6061000	That's what everybody's saying in the chat
6061000	6062000	Well
6062000	6063000	Sad
6063000	6065000	When was the last time Mickey Rooney was out in public?
6065000	6067000	Well he was in a night at the museum and
6067000	6069000	Alright anyhow here it is
6069000	6071000	Uh going to back to the trailer
6077000	6079000	Oh man this is so rude because when you see this
6079000	6081000	You're like oh man it's gonna be a new game
6081000	6083000	But you see all the characters
6083000	6085000	It's got the rock music and all this stuff
6085000	6087000	You're like oh my god
6088000	6089000	Geese Howard
6089000	6091000	So like yeah you're like thinking new game
6091000	6093000	And then it's
6096000	6099000	I just love the little power ballad playing in the back

6108000	6110000	I'm so fucking excited and then it's like
6110000	6112000	Oh wait but he's in a casino
6112000	6114000	What's he doing in a casino
6114000	6116000	I wanna see how long into this trailer it takes
6116000	6118000	Before it's given away that it's a slot machine
6118000	6120000	Oh not until the end I'm guessing
6120000	6122000	Oh that's so rude
6122000	6124000	Boom
6124000	6126000	Yeah we're already like three quarters of the way through the trailer
6126000	6130000	I will be willing but yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer
6130000	6132000	Do we get to see some balls?
6132000	6134000	Cause you know Pachinko
6134000	6136000	Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer
6136000	6138000	Yeah it's not until like the very end of the trailer
6138000	6140000	Do we get to see some balls?
6140000	6142000	Cause you know Pachinko
6142000	6144000	Cause you know Pachinko

6150000	6152000	They show one little machine
6152000	6154000	What a troll
6154000	6156000	Jerks
6156000	6158000	Alright Dark Sakura
6158000	6160000	Do you have some better news for us?
6160000	6162000	John Panette died too
6162000	6164000	He's funny
6164000	6166000	Is everybody dying today? What's going on with that?
6166000	6168000	Well you know Game of Thrones was on
6168000	6172000	It's become self aware
6172000	6174000	It's killing people outside of the show now
6174000	6176000	Bye
6176000	6178000	Bye everybody
6180000	6182000	What do you have for us?
6182000	6184000	I have growling
6184000	6188000	Well speaking of things that I guess
6188000	6190000	I'm not even gonna go there
6190000	6192000	I'm not gonna say things that are dead
6192000	6194000	Things that are gonna be dug up years from now?
6198000	6200000	I...
6200000	6202000	Come on you were thinking it
6202000	6204000	Literally cannot even
6204000	6206000	Oh what was the joke?
6206000	6208000	Things in the ground? Was that the joke?
6210000	6212000	Things that should stay dead
6212000	6214000	Listen
6214000	6216000	That's not fair
6216000	6218000	They're not buried yet
6218000	6220000	I'm sorry
6220000	6222000	Are you guys done?
6222000	6224000	I'm waiting to hear about these cartridges
6224000	6226000	That's all I'm talking about
6226000	6228000	These were cartridges
6228000	6230000	You just spoiled the story Mr. Spoilerbutt
6230000	6232000	I didn't say none
6232000	6234000	Mr. I'm gonna spoil the Hunger Games for Jamie
6234000	6236000	Earlier even though I asked you to
6236000	6238000	Whatever
6238000	6240000	It's true
6240000	6242000	Good to know that my powers of deduction
6242000	6244000	Are accurate
6244000	6246000	Anyway, so remember that group that was trying to dig up ET?
6250000	6252000	Okay sorry
6252000	6254000	Oh my god they're digging up Elizabeth Taylor?
6254000	6256000	Elizabeth Taylor?
6256000	6258000	God she just died
6258000	6260000	She didn't just die
6260000	6262000	That's so rude
6262000	6264000	Oh you mean the game ET
6264000	6266000	The Atari 2600 version of ET
6266000	6268000	There was a group that was gonna film
6268000	6270000	A documentary about trying to
6270000	6272000	Dig it up out of the dump in New Mexico
6272000	6274000	And they got
6274000	6276000	The
6276000	6278000	OKs from the NMEB
6278000	6280000	Environmental Protection Division of Solid Waste Bureau
6280000	6282000	They approved
6282000	6284000	A waste evacuation
6284000	6286000	And it was submitted by
6286000	6288000	Xbox Entertainment Studios
6288000	6290000	Who is going to apparently
6290000	6292000	I guess be publishing this documentary
6292000	6294000	And filming it
6294000	6296000	So we have efforts from Lightbox Entertainment
6296000	6298000	And Xbox Entertainment
6298000	6300000	To let the dig happen
6300000	6302000	This is gonna be about as
6302000	6304000	You know as
6304000	6306000	Okay did anyone remember
6306000	6308000	Anybody remember
6308000	6310000	When Geraldo
6310000	6312000	Tried to go into Al Capone's
6312000	6314000	Vault or whatever the fuck it was
6314000	6316000	This is gonna end up just like that you know what's gonna be in there
6316000	6318000	Nothing
6318000	6320000	They're gonna find shit
6320000	6322000	And
6322000	6324000	They will actually find shit
6324000	6326000	Now it would be funny though if they actually find like
6326000	6328000	Neat relics from the 80s
6328000	6330000	That are broken
6330000	6332000	No it's gonna be nothing
6332000	6334000	They might find like some like decomposed
6334000	6336000	Cabbage patch kids and like maybe a speaking
6336000	6338000	Spell that still works in there somewhere
6338000	6340000	I suppose Cabbage Patch Kid be
6340000	6342000	A garbage pail kid at that point
6344000	6346000	Might possibly be
6346000	6348000	For the record
6348000	6350000	Bobby I'm not watching the movies
6350000	6352000	Yet I'm reading the books
6352000	6354000	But when you do watch the movies
6354000	6356000	Bobby will be quick to point out that the second one
6356000	6358000	Catching Fire the Capitol
6358000	6360000	Is one of the Dragon Con hotels
6360000	6362000	And it really is
6362000	6364000	It's pretty awesome to be in there and be like
6364000	6366000	Oh I'm at the Capitol
6366000	6368000	At any rate I'm reading the books first
6368000	6370000	Alright fair enough fair enough
6370000	6372000	So you could be let down by the movies
6372000	6374000	No I'm just kidding the movies are great
6374000	6376000	Loki what politically incorrect thing do you have for us next
6376000	6378000	Well let's see
6378000	6380000	I've got basically
6380000	6382000	Just
6382000	6384000	Wolfenstein
6384000	6386000	You know they have that Doom beta planned
6386000	6388000	For just PlayStation 4, Xbox One
6388000	6390000	And PC and I remember
6390000	6392000	Correctly and I wanted to say I looked it up
6392000	6394000	But then I saw something shiny and I
6394000	6396000	Forgot to look it up but I want to say that
6396000	6398000	That whole Doom beta thing is actually
6398000	6400000	On all the box art for
6400000	6402000	All the games
6402000	6404000	So that's kind of a little misleading if you think about it
6404000	6406000	That they're only doing the beta for
6406000	6408000	You know select versions of the game
6408000	6410000	But
6410000	6412000	They're going to feature it on the box
6412000	6414000	Yep there it is Xbox 360 preorder
6414000	6416000	For Doom beta access
6416000	6418000	Asterix
6418000	6420000	These certain systems here
6420000	6422000	I guess it could be very far out
6422000	6424000	You'd expect that you're going to have a
6424000	6426000	Brand new console
6426000	6428000	I'm willing to bet that the next Doom game
6428000	6430000	Is only going to be
6430000	6432000	For the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC
6432000	6434000	Which is probably why the beta is not on the current gen
6434000	6436000	I don't see why it wouldn't be
6436000	6438000	I think the current gen
6438000	6440000	Stuff is starting to sunset a little bit
6440000	6442000	I'm sorry last gen at this point
6442000	6444000	Well yeah
6444000	6446000	We're kind of in between now so yeah
6446000	6448000	I think the 360 PlayStation 3 era
6448000	6450000	You're starting to see the sunset on it
6450000	6452000	I think we still have some big games this year
6452000	6454000	I mean we still know that the Kingdom Hearts 2
6454000	6456000	Remake is happening at some point
6456000	6458000	That was announced before
6458000	6460000	There's some other little things here and there
6460000	6462000	That will probably take us into 2015
6462000	6464000	I think especially by next holiday
6464000	6466000	Will be like the last
6466000	6468000	Stuff you see on those consoles
6468000	6470000	And even this holiday it's going to start
6470000	6472000	To thin out because they want you to buy the new stuff
6472000	6474000	So that's where all the games are
6476000	6478000	And I'm sure the Doom game is only on those consoles
6478000	6480000	So yeah I think that's why they have it
6480000	6482000	They figure between now and whenever
6482000	6484000	That beta comes out
6484000	6486000	Because that could either be the end of this year or next year
6486000	6488000	Who knows
6488000	6490000	A lot of people will have
6490000	6492000	Another console by then
6494000	6496000	Alright well speaking of
6496000	6498000	Betas and things that ended up launching
6498000	6500000	On the current
6500000	6502000	No actually it's on your current PCs
6502000	6504000	And it will be on the next gen hardware
6504000	6506000	Soon enough
6506000	6508000	Scrolls Online was released
6508000	6510000	On the PC this week
6510000	6512000	And they had some hiccups going into
6512000	6514000	The launch but the game is now out
6514000	6516000	And kind of the
6516000	6518000	Resounding
6518000	6520000	There's some people that are really into it
6520000	6522000	That are really enjoying it
6522000	6524000	But I'm hearing a lot of resounding feedback
6524000	6526000	And this has been true on Horde House leading up to the show too
6526000	6528000	That
6528000	6530000	Why are we paying for this?
6530000	6532000	That it's not
6532000	6534000	Able to compete with some of the other pay MMOs right now
6534000	6536000	Now I don't know
6536000	6538000	I kind of think that's the way
6538000	6540000	All these games tend to be when they announce a pay subscription
6540000	6542000	You know Final Fantasy 14
6542000	6544000	Has a subscription right now
6544000	6546000	World of Warcraft still has a subscription right now
6546000	6548000	That's how these games kind of go
6548000	6550000	I think Elder Scrolls will be able to ride it out for a little bit
6550000	6552000	But it's all about can they
6552000	6554000	Bring the players in
6554000	6556000	And can they catch that buzz wave
6556000	6558000	Right now there's been a lot of people that have tried it
6558000	6560000	That have been like meh
6560000	6562000	I'd rather just play Skyrim
6562000	6564000	When they first announced
6564000	6566000	I was like oh yeah Skyrim
6566000	6568000	But it's going to be online and stuff
6568000	6570000	That's going to be awesome
6570000	6572000	And then it was just kind of from there
6572000	6574000	Just kind of a downward slope
6574000	6576000	The more and more I saw about the game
6576000	6578000	The less and less interested I was in the game
6578000	6580000	And then I played the beta and I was like nope
6580000	6582000	And why was that?
6582000	6584000	Why were you turned off?
6584000	6586000	It just wasn't engaging
6586000	6588000	It was very
6588000	6590000	I don't know it just didn't feel like Elder Scrolls to me
6590000	6592000	I was just trying to shoehorn Elder Scrolls into an MMO
6592000	6594000	And
6594000	6596000	I just didn't like it
6596000	6598000	Also another big pet peeve
6598000	6600000	It didn't support controllers
6600000	6602000	Well I think it's going to have to if they put it out on Playstation 4
6602000	6604000	Well yeah
6604000	6606000	But it just wasn't very interesting
6606000	6608000	Once again I
6608000	6610000	Don't want to pay for an MMO
6610000	6612000	Because I just don't
6612000	6614000	The amount of time I get to play that kind of stuff
6614000	6616000	Is just very mixed
6616000	6618000	So I just can't dedicate $15
6618000	6620000	A month to something that I probably
6620000	6622000	You know I may not play that month
6622000	6624000	Dungeonbuster in our chat room
6624000	6626000	Over at live.vognetwork.com says
6626000	6628000	Elder Scrolls Online should have spent a bit more time
6628000	6630000	In beta from what I've read
6630000	6632000	Some bugs and broken quests I've seen in the beta
6632000	6634000	Were still issues
6634000	6636000	Uh oh, that's not good
6636000	6638000	So there it is Elder Scrolls
6638000	6640000	Is out, you know if you feel
6640000	6642000	Differently if you're really enjoying the game let us know
6642000	6644000	You know I gotta be honest I haven't really played it
6644000	6646000	But I don't really
6646000	6648000	There's no demo right now or there's no way to like
6648000	6650000	Download it and play free to level 10
6650000	6652000	Or anything like that because it's new
6652000	6654000	I assume that'll happen in the coming months or there'll be the Playstation 4 beta
6654000	6656000	So I'll check it out at that point
6656000	6658000	But for now I just don't see the reason
6658000	6660000	I'm juggling Final Fantasy 14
6660000	6662000	I know I'm going to get sucked back into World of Warcraft
6662000	6664000	When Warlords of Draenor comes out
6664000	6666000	There's still Diablo 3
6666000	6668000	In the interim which technically isn't an MMO
6668000	6670000	But close enough
6670000	6672000	I just don't got time for it
6672000	6674000	And nobody got time for that Elder Scrolls
6674000	6676000	I think people want the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
6676000	6678000	But with
6678000	6680000	Some way to play co-op or something
6680000	6682000	I think people want Elder Scrolls 6
6682000	6684000	Is what they really want
6684000	6686000	If the next Elder Scrolls game comes out
6686000	6688000	If Elder Scrolls 6 comes out and it has
6688000	6690000	Like 4 player co-op or even 2 player co-op
6690000	6692000	I think that people are just not going to care
6692000	6694000	Well Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be announced for a while
6694000	6696000	You're still going to have Fallout 4
6696000	6698000	Yeah Fallout's next
6698000	6700000	Or Doom I guess
6700000	6702000	Alright well let's go
6702000	6704000	Go to the mailbag
6704000	6706000	Every week you guys send us emails
6706000	6708000	Sometimes we have wrong opinions on things
6708000	6710000	And you want to set us on the right path
6710000	6712000	So you can do that
6712000	6714000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com
6714000	6716000	Is the place where you can participate with the show
6716000	6718000	Again our email address participate at orangelaungeradio.com
6718000	6720000	Darsakra dives into the mailbag head first
6720000	6722000	And pulls out
6722000	6724000	She finds Carmen Sandiego in there
6724000	6726000	Yeah she's hiding right there
6726000	6728000	But I'm busy talking about food with Ikuma-san
6728000	6730000	Well you're going to have to take a break
6730000	6732000	And we're going to be sharing our emails with our listeners
6732000	6734000	Over at live.vognetwork.com right now
6734000	6736000	Alright well first email
6736000	6738000	Comes from
6738000	6740000	I'm going to say Jonathan
6740000	6742000	Because that's all I get
6742000	6744000	Hey OLR crew
6744000	6746000	My only problem with Oculus Rift
6746000	6748000	Is that Kickstarter is for
6748000	6750000	Indies that can't get a company to fund them
6750000	6752000	Let be real
6752000	6754000	Oculus Rift could
6754000	6756000	Have been funded from the start
6756000	6758000	I think the typing on here
6758000	6760000	Why are the little Kickstarter
6760000	6762000	Pledgers money not worth any returns
6762000	6764000	In the end it's the backers fault though
6764000	6766000	Thanks Jonathan
6766000	6768000	I kind of think Oculus did try to get
6768000	6770000	The other type of funding in the start
6770000	6772000	But people laughed at it because we all laughed at the
6772000	6774000	Virtual reality stuff in the 90's
6774000	6776000	You know the lawn mower man
6776000	6778000	Came and went
6778000	6780000	Kickstarter was how this thing got funded
6780000	6782000	And I think it did
6782000	6784000	I mean if you look at Facebook
6784000	6786000	Buying them for 2 billion dollars
6786000	6788000	This investment was successful
6788000	6790000	The only problem is it's Kickstarter
6790000	6792000	You don't own any equity in it
6792000	6794000	If you don't like that don't
6794000	6796000	Kickstart companies
6796000	6798000	They got a return
6798000	6800000	They got a dev kit win
6800000	6802000	That's true
6802000	6804000	You get whatever prize you pledge for
6804000	6806000	Or perk
6806000	6808000	So this one comes from Robert M
6808000	6810000	I was going to ask this in chat last week
6810000	6812000	But was out late so are you worried
6812000	6814000	That the negative reaction to the Facebook
6814000	6816000	Acquisition of Oculus may be a
6816000	6818000	Self-fulfilling prophecy
6818000	6820000	When Zynga bought the developer of Draw Something
6820000	6822000	Those hating the publisher for valid
6822000	6824000	Reasons and those joining the outcry
6824000	6826000	Stopped supporting the game
6826000	6828000	Seeing less for the profit than forecast
6828000	6830000	Zynga closed down OMG Pop
6830000	6832000	Detractors told you so
6832000	6834000	This view may be over simplistic
6834000	6836000	And perhaps come across as apologetic
6836000	6838000	But could a similar relatively unwarranted
6838000	6840000	Exodus endanger the rift
6840000	6842000	Sorry if Bobby Black Wolf has already covered this
6842000	6844000	This is from Robert M
6846000	6848000	What was the question in there?
6848000	6850000	Okay if
6850000	6852000	If Facebook purchasing
6852000	6854000	Oculus
6854000	6856000	And people saying well I'm not going to support
6856000	6858000	This and stop adding their support to it
6858000	6860000	Is going to make it fail
6860000	6862000	The way that when Zynga
6862000	6864000	Acquired Draw Something
6864000	6866000	Ah sort of
6866000	6868000	Like is the
6868000	6870000	Internet damming it without
6870000	6872000	Necessarily giving it a chance
6872000	6874000	Exactly I have a feeling
6874000	6876000	And here's something to keep in mind
6876000	6878000	Facebook
6878000	6880000	Wants to target non-gamers
6880000	6882000	As well
6882000	6884000	And that's a huge wild card
6884000	6886000	But when you look at
6886000	6888000	What Zuckerberg said about the Oculus Rift
6888000	6890000	And the big plan for it
6890000	6892000	I mean games are in there too don't get me wrong
6892000	6894000	But he
6894000	6896000	I don't want to put words in his mouth
6896000	6898000	But I get the sense that they don't need
6898000	6900000	To be successful
6900000	6902000	Not really
6902000	6904000	There's plenty of other applications for the technology
6904000	6906000	But um
6906000	6908000	I think also the proof is in the pudding
6908000	6910000	I would bet
6910000	6912000	I would bet money
6912000	6914000	Because this is the internet and this is gaming culture
6914000	6916000	I would bet a large sum of money
6916000	6918000	That at least 75%
6918000	6920000	If not more
6920000	6922000	Of the people bitching about Oculus Rift
6922000	6924000	And how they're never going to play one
6924000	6926000	Never have
6926000	6928000	Or never intended to anyway
6928000	6930000	Or never intended to anyway
6930000	6932000	Or there's also this let's go back to NPR's
6932000	6934000	Little prank never bothered to read
6934000	6936000	Anything about the acquisition either
6936000	6938000	Or still will buy it when it comes out
6938000	6940000	So I think
6940000	6942000	There I mean
6942000	6944000	The comparison to draw
6944000	6946000	Something and Zynga is interesting
6946000	6948000	But I think we have to remember
6948000	6950000	That iPhone games especially
6950000	6952000	Tend to be very flash in the pan
6952000	6954000	And you know it's popular
6954000	6956000	One week you're in, one week you're out
6956000	6958000	You know
6958000	6960000	One week you're
6960000	6962000	Threes
6962000	6964000	Then your 2048
6964000	6966000	Goes out for free
6966000	6968000	And kind of bites into those sales
6968000	6970000	I mean that's the nature of the iPhone
6970000	6972000	Gaming the very volatile free
6972000	6974000	And 99 cent market
6974000	6976000	Well I would like to read what Bobby said in chat
6976000	6978000	Please
6978000	6980000	Zuckerberg said Oculus will do the game stuff first
6980000	6982000	And then he'd use the Facebook power to do
6982000	6984000	The non-game stuff
6984000	6986000	It basically lets the Oculus concentrate on gaming
6986000	6988000	And further said most of the Reddit
6988000	6990000	Most of the Reddit bitching
6990000	6992000	Were from people who never posted on the
6992000	6994000	Oculus subreddit before
6994000	6996000	They all left and it's back to normal now
6996000	6998000	But I mean it goes back to the people
6998000	7000000	Just wanting something to bitch about and not actually
7000000	7002000	Doing any research on it
7002000	7004000	Basically like a conversation with my mom
7004000	7006000	Well that's interesting though
7006000	7008000	That they are still going to focus on gaming first
7008000	7010000	Okay so I'm corrected a little bit there
7010000	7012000	But I still think the point stands that they are
7012000	7014000	Looking at doing more than
7014000	7016000	Just gaming
7016000	7018000	And you know what? At the end of the day
7018000	7020000	If gaming doesn't end up making
7020000	7022000	Them money
7022000	7024000	But premium events
7024000	7026000	Using the Oculus Rift to be able to attend
7026000	7028000	Premium events live and selling it as an
7028000	7030000	Entertainment device if that works for them
7030000	7032000	Then guess where they're going to end up focusing
7032000	7034000	When I was a teenager
7034000	7036000	A young teenager
7036000	7038000	We used to pay for pay per views
7038000	7040000	So that we could watch new kids on the block concerts
7040000	7042000	You know I think there's a lot of people
7042000	7044000	Out there who bought a pay per view this evening
7044000	7046000	Yes they did
7048000	7050000	I wonder
7050000	7052000	How many people would be interested in watching an event
7052000	7054000	Like Wrestlemania on the Oculus Rift
7056000	7058000	Good for thought
7058000	7060000	At any rate
7060000	7062000	The next email actually has something to do with
7062000	7064000	The wrestling
7064000	7066000	It says Oculus idea
7066000	7068000	Dearest peoples
7068000	7070000	As you were talking about the possible future of
7070000	7072000	Facebook infused Oculus Rift
7072000	7074000	I had an idea as to what the future could be
7074000	7076000	It's not video games, it's a different experience entirely
7076000	7078000	As you read this
7078000	7080000	Wrestlemania
7080000	7082000	30 is streaming live
7082000	7084000	On the WWE network
7084000	7086000	WWE's exclusive online platform
7086000	7088000	Is not the only place where live events
7088000	7090000	Are streamed
7090000	7092000	I watched Nine Inch Nails perform live at Lollapalooza
7092000	7094000	Via YouTube
7094000	7096000	WWE has streamed their pre-shows on Facebook
7096000	7098000	For over a year now and you can watch UFC PPV
7098000	7100000	Events live on Ustream
7100000	7102000	What is the next experience?
7102000	7104000	Imagine if you could be in a crowd during a concert
7104000	7106000	And by this I don't mean the broadcast slash concert
7106000	7108000	Film experience you get now
7108000	7110000	I mean actually being in the crowd for a concert
7110000	7112000	Or a sporting event
7112000	7114000	This is what I think could be done with the
7114000	7116000	Facebook infused Oculus Rift
7116000	7118000	Selling concert tickets for people
7118000	7120000	To be able to see live events
7120000	7122000	From the comfort of their own home
7122000	7124000	If you could see something live
7124000	7126000	And where I say the Rolling Stones last tour
7126000	7128000	Or the upcoming Monty Python performances
7128000	7130000	Or a concert from a performer
7130000	7132000	Who thinks your city is too small to perform in
7132000	7134000	I'm looking at you Kanye
7134000	7136000	You could bet people
7136000	7138000	Would buy tickets to see that event
7138000	7140000	Also you could sell different tickets
7140000	7142000	In different parts of the arena enabling the corporation
7142000	7144000	Providing the event to make more money
7144000	7146000	Off the live stream than the one size fits all
7146000	7148000	Approach they get now
7148000	7150000	That makes the experience appealing for consumers
7150000	7152000	And way profitable for corporations
7152000	7154000	Yay!
7154000	7156000	Stay black entertainment
7156000	7158000	This message has been brought to you by Tacos
7158000	7160000	You know one idea
7160000	7162000	That pops in my mind too
7162000	7164000	Is that sometimes you have those one night
7164000	7166000	Only shows somewhere in the world
7166000	7168000	That maybe doesn't necessarily
7168000	7170000	Tour or anything like that
7170000	7172000	Right now maybe get a Blu Ray
7172000	7174000	Or a movie out of it
7174000	7176000	But imagine being able to be there live for the experience
7176000	7178000	One thing that pops into my mind
7178000	7180000	When he passed away he was prepping to do those shows
7180000	7182000	At the London O2 arena or whatever
7182000	7184000	He was going to do a bunch of shows
7184000	7186000	And then this is it right
7186000	7188000	I'm done no more
7188000	7190000	He's going to retire just like Cher
7190000	7192000	But that was supposed to be it
7192000	7194000	If I could turn back time
7194000	7196000	There would have been a lot of people
7196000	7198000	That would have paid to see that
7198000	7200000	There's a problem
7200000	7202000	With this
7202000	7204000	There's a big problem with this one
7204000	7206000	Is that to make it work
7206000	7208000	In that type of area
7208000	7210000	You would have to have multiple rendering cameras
7210000	7212000	Open at all times
7212000	7214000	That would be unobstructed by
7214000	7216000	The other concert goers
7216000	7218000	You could do it
7218000	7220000	The issue being
7220000	7222000	Is that they would all have to still
7222000	7224000	Re-render that data
7224000	7226000	Into the oculus
7226000	7228000	Including the ground, including the ceiling
7228000	7230000	The various sides
7230000	7232000	And make it look seamless and also
7232000	7234000	Not cause someone to have a seizure
7234000	7236000	He's not there yet but I bet it will be Sunday
7236000	7238000	Well they had even back on PlayStation
7238000	7240000	I want to say it's PlayStation 2
7240000	7242000	They had something with Britney Spears
7242000	7244000	Where it was an interactive video
7244000	7246000	That you could change the view on it
7246000	7248000	You could actually rotate the camera around
7248000	7250000	Was that Britney's dance beat?
7250000	7252000	No it was actually a video
7252000	7254000	I think it was Britney Spears
7254000	7256000	It may have been some other group
7256000	7258000	But there was somebody
7258000	7260000	Those are filled with a special type of panoramic camera
7260000	7262000	I'm sure they could come out with something
7262000	7264000	Get two panoramic cameras
7264000	7266000	That's ten years ago at this point
7266000	7268000	What's going to be ten years from now?
7268000	7270000	I don't care what it's called, I'm not getting one
7270000	7272000	And I was
7272000	7274000	Reading emails
7274000	7276000	So whatever
7276000	7278000	Everyone else is calling
7278000	7280000	Bobby's huffy because he didn't get
7280000	7282000	Any emails about the oculus
7282000	7284000	And I'm not the one calling it anything
7284000	7286000	Oculus is the company
7286000	7288000	I know that
7288000	7290000	Don't mansplain shit to me
7290000	7292000	Do we have more emails on
7292000	7294000	Yes we got one more
7294000	7296000	On the Oculus Rift, hopefully
7296000	7298000	I don't know, I really don't care if it is
7298000	7300000	Hi guys and gal, thank you
7300000	7302000	Thank you for being
7302000	7304000	Equal opportunity in your greeting
7304000	7306000	Greetings from your other Mexican
7306000	7308000	Listener, Dr. Noir
7308000	7310000	From Quito
7310000	7312000	Is it Quito? Is that how it's pronounced?
7312000	7314000	In Ecuador
7314000	7316000	I just want to recommend a delightful platformer
7316000	7318000	Called Sortigo
7318000	7320000	I have hours on my android phone
7320000	7322000	All for the price of free
7322000	7324000	And there's a link to it at the Google store
7324000	7326000	It reminds me of classic Mega Man and Metroid
7326000	7328000	Because of the platforming and ability acquisition
7328000	7330000	With a nod to Zelda and the gameplay and currency
7330000	7332000	Gems that spawn from mowed plants
7332000	7334000	It is exactly the kind of game
7334000	7336000	I want to see more of even though I can't
7336000	7338000	For the love of all understand
7338000	7340000	For the love of all understand how they're making money
7340000	7342000	Hope you like it, adios amigos
7342000	7344000	Well sadly I am
7344000	7346000	Not an android phone user
7346000	7348000	So I can't check out this game myself
7348000	7350000	Did they pay you to send this email?
7350000	7352000	No, I'm okay with it
7352000	7354000	Because this guy's emailed us plenty of times
7354000	7356000	Before I know he's a good guy so I trust his recommendation
7356000	7358000	But I kind of laughed
7358000	7360000	Because I was like, is this a paid email?
7360000	7362000	So what was the name of the game again?
7362000	7364000	Sortigo
7364000	7366000	Sortigo, Dr. Noir approved
7366000	7368000	Yes
7368000	7372000	Oh Bobby okay I forgive you for not trying to mansplain
7372000	7374000	Alright
7374000	7376000	Alright
7376000	7378000	Is that it for the emails?
7378000	7380000	Do you know I had to actually tell somebody what mansplaining was?
7380000	7382000	Well I don't think that's what Bobby was doing at all
7382000	7384000	Well no I know that's not what Bobby was doing
7384000	7386000	I was poking back
7386000	7388000	I wasn't over
7388000	7390000	Good lord can I not tell a remote teasing
7390000	7392000	Giving someone shit when I get shit in return?
7392000	7394000	I suppose
7394000	7396000	I'm allowed to give shit
7396000	7398000	I'm human
7398000	7400000	And humans shit
7400000	7402000	Can I make another joke about Makeruini dying?
7402000	7404000	This is your house
7404000	7406000	So I can't kick you out
7408000	7412000	No I actually had to explain to somebody what mansplaining was
7412000	7414000	It was very sad
7414000	7416000	Well what if a listener doesn't know
7416000	7418000	You might as well explain it
7418000	7420000	It's when a man's trying to explain something to a woman
7420000	7422000	And talks down to her as if it's something she shouldn't know anything about
7422000	7424000	Oh I got you
7424000	7426000	So that would be like me going like
7426000	7428000	You see that is an Xbox
7428000	7430000	Behind you and that's what we use
7430000	7432000	To play video games
7432000	7434000	Sit and spin
7434000	7436000	Now would you like me to show you how to access the food network
7436000	7438000	On that?
7438000	7440000	Would you like for me to shove this so far
7440000	7442000	Up your ass
7442000	7444000	That you start tasting fingernails
7444000	7446000	And I was indicating with my middle finger
7446000	7448000	Thank you
7448000	7450000	Alright
7450000	7452000	Oh hi bones you missed some
7452000	7454000	Stuff
7454000	7456000	Raginator says
7456000	7458000	If there's mansplaining there's probably
7458000	7460000	Womansplaining too right?
7460000	7462000	Yes I would argue yes
7462000	7464000	I'm gonna tell you
7464000	7466000	There is womansplaining yes there is
7466000	7468000	You tell me what you believe womansplaining is
7468000	7470000	I'm gonna tell you what I believe it is
7470000	7472000	That's when the guy is completely
7472000	7474000	Acting uninterested in what you're saying
7474000	7476000	And you're trying to explain something
7476000	7478000	As thoroughly as possible and he's completely
7478000	7480000	Overlooking everything that you're saying
7480000	7482000	And you come off being a nag
7482000	7484000	Okay I believe that womansplaining
7484000	7486000	Is when you know you are
7486000	7488000	Hovering too much and you're being annoying
7488000	7490000	And you're around a woman so a woman
7490000	7492000	Just starts talking about her period
7492000	7494000	So that you'll go away
7494000	7496000	That's womansplaining
7496000	7498000	No that's called defense mechanism
7498000	7500000	It's called
7500000	7502000	You know what I'm really sick of hearing you talk about football
7502000	7504000	So how about I tell you about
7504000	7506000	How once a month I you know
7506000	7508000	My vagina does this
7508000	7510000	And cramps are the
7510000	7512000	Worst
7512000	7514000	Not on the show
7514000	7516000	What have they done to you?
7516000	7518000	What have they done to you?
7518000	7520000	We need the subscribers
7520000	7522000	We need more women
7522000	7524000	You know when I first looked at chat
7524000	7526000	I thought it said manscaping
7526000	7528000	And I was like well that's a whole other episode
7528000	7530000	That's after the womansplaining
7530000	7532000	Moving on to the FUs
7532000	7534000	Of the week
7534000	7536000	How appropriate it would be this time
7536000	7538000	To get to the FUs of the week
7544000	7546000	Here is justice
7546000	7548000	Here is punishment
7548000	7550000	Here is
7550000	7552000	This is fucked up
7554000	7556000	FU to the movie theater
7556000	7558000	For being so fucking loud
7558000	7560000	And this is sad
7560000	7562000	I actually do like going to 3D movies
7562000	7564000	But it's like the way that
7564000	7566000	The Winter Soldier was filmed for its 3D
7566000	7568000	Was just completely
7568000	7570000	My eyes ended up hurting and the theater was
7570000	7572000	So loud that I actually
7572000	7574000	My neck stiffened up
7574000	7576000	And I had like a killer
7576000	7578000	Headache you know before I came in
7578000	7580000	So um
7582000	7584000	It was just that and then of course
7584000	7586000	You know getting bitched at because it put me in a bad mood
7586000	7588000	And therefore I was
7588000	7590000	You know saying hey my neck hurts
7590000	7592000	Would you mind rubbing my neck?
7592000	7594000	Complaining
7594000	7596000	Fine
7596000	7598000	Soon
7600000	7602000	Yeah
7602000	7604000	Happy in the cold
7604000	7606000	And finally getting four hours of sleep
7606000	7608000	You're so quiet this week I bet your
7608000	7610000	Listers can probably barely hear you because you're just
7610000	7612000	It's taking all the energy out of you
7612000	7614000	Compared to previous weeks
7614000	7616000	I'm sorry I feel better
7616000	7618000	Hey I made the death jokes so you know
7618000	7620000	I've got the energy for that
7620000	7622000	Uh I don't know
7622000	7624000	My FU of the week goes to
7624000	7626000	Oh the fact that
7626000	7628000	Our washer and dryer
7628000	7630000	That came with the house as is
7630000	7632000	That the landlord took great
7632000	7634000	Care to mention that the washer and dryer
7634000	7636000	Would be as is
7636000	7638000	We knew kind of in the back of our mind
7638000	7640000	Oh yeah this means they're not going to last very long
7640000	7642000	Well very long ended up being
7642000	7644000	Three weeks and the dryer broke
7644000	7646000	So FU did the fact that I just dropped
7646000	7648000	$100
7648000	7650000	Plus on
7650000	7652000	A new washer and dryer
7653000	7655000	It's pretty disgusting isn't it
7655000	7657000	It costs a lot of money to keep your clothes
7657000	7659000	Smelling spring fresh
7659000	7661000	I'll tell you I'm going to pass on
7661000	7663000	A little bit of advice to everybody
7663000	7665000	That when you go to buy
7665000	7667000	A new washer and dryer or fridge
7667000	7669000	Or another appliance look at the returns
7669000	7671000	Because typically returns are for
7671000	7673000	Cosmetic damage and it's
7673000	7675000	Like for a fridge if the side of it is dented
7675000	7677000	Who's going to look at the fucking side of the fridge
7677000	7679000	It's usually shoved in an alcove or
7679000	7681000	In between something
7681000	7683000	Our washer and dryer had a big dent in it
7683000	7685000	Now our washer and dryer
7685000	7687000	Were $500 and $600 each
7687000	7689000	We got $300 knocked down off the price of each of them
7689000	7691000	Nice
7691000	7693000	I'll say it at Best Buy
7693000	7695000	But because we had damaged returns
7695000	7697000	We went there first
7697000	7699000	And I'll say it
7699000	7701000	And nobody was around to help
7701000	7703000	So we went somewhere else where we ended up dropping
7703000	7705000	A large sum of money
7705000	7707000	You know what? Write them
7707000	7709000	Give them feedback
7709000	7711000	Oh really?
7711000	7713000	I'm all for coupons
7713000	7715000	Oh we're sorry we lost your business
7715000	7717000	Thanks for letting us know
7717000	7719000	By the way
7719000	7721000	Now the FUs of the week are done
7721000	7723000	I have to read this hilarious comment from AkumaJP
7723000	7725000	Although DarkSaga's not going to like it
7725000	7727000	But I love AkumaJP's idea of woman-splaining
7727000	7729000	Did you get that?
7729000	7731000	Did you hear me? Are you listening?
7731000	7733000	That's my mother
7733000	7735000	I countered with
7735000	7737000	I don't woman-splain, I bitch
7737000	7739000	Bitch please
7739000	7741000	I give disapproving looks
7741000	7743000	Including the ADS
7743000	7745000	The absolute death stare
7745000	7747000	Which thankfully
7747000	7749000	You've never received the absolute death stare
7749000	7751000	My husband has lots though
7751000	7753000	Alright
7753000	7755000	Just a few more stories for you guys
7755000	7757000	And then we're going to open up the skype line
7757000	7759000	If you want a man-splain
7759000	7761000	Or a woman-splain
7761000	7763000	Or they-splain
7763000	7765000	Whatever you are-splain
7765000	7767000	Tell us what you're thinking
7767000	7769000	In gaming culture this week
7769000	7771000	But first, a story from Loki
7771000	7773000	Sadly
7773000	7775000	We don't have great news
7775000	7777000	But apparently the producer
7777000	7779000	Or music producer of Rhythm Heaven
7779000	7781000	He has cancer
7781000	7783000	Unfortunately
7783000	7785000	It was
7785000	7787000	Was it
7787000	7789000	Sunku I guess
7789000	7791000	Is that guy's name?
7791000	7793000	He has been diagnosed with
7793000	7795000	Laryngeal
7795000	7797000	cancer
7797000	7799000	So throat cancer
7799000	7801000	And of course
7801000	7803000	Being a singer
7803000	7805000	That's not great news either
7805000	7807000	It's like hey you have cancer
7807000	7809000	Oh hey you can't sing anymore
7811000	7813000	So hopefully
7813000	7815000	Hopefully he's able to beat that
7815000	7817000	Because that sucks
7817000	7819000	Yeah
7819000	7821000	Our thoughts go out definitely
7821000	7823000	Play some Rhythm Heaven this week
7823000	7825000	Well I mean he's still
7825000	7827000	He's just diagnosed he hasn't passed away or anything
7827000	7829000	So he's still fighting it but
7829000	7831000	Our thoughts definitely go out to him
7831000	7833000	And we'll play some Rhythm Heaven this week
7833000	7835000	Alright going over to one story
7835000	7837000	That is sad
7837000	7839000	And I know I was
7839000	7841000	Cracking some jokes about Mickey Rooney earlier
7841000	7843000	But look Mickey Rooney was in his 90's
7843000	7845000	It's very tragic to report on
7845000	7847000	Somebody who died in their 40's
7847000	7849000	And that's unfortunately what happened this week
7849000	7851000	Masuda passed away at the age of 48
7851000	7853000	Now you may not
7853000	7855000	Recognize that name but Masuda
7855000	7857000	Actually designed the game
7857000	7859000	Pro Wrestling by himself
7859000	7861000	This ties into WrestleMania tonight folks
7861000	7863000	Pro Wrestling by himself with another
7863000	7865000	Developer doing the game's graphics
7865000	7867000	This was all released for the Famicom
7867000	7869000	In 1986
7869000	7871000	Which ended up being released for the NES
7871000	7873000	You remember the old school Pro Wrestling
7873000	7875000	Like before WrestleMania and the licensed stuff
7875000	7877000	There was the original Pro Wrestling game
7877000	7879000	That was by this guy Masato Masuda
7879000	7881000	He also created the series
7881000	7883000	Fire Pro Wrestling
7883000	7885000	So yeah very sad to hear about this
7885000	7887000	But then you hear he's 48
7887000	7889000	Now do the math you guys
7889000	7891000	This Pro Wrestling
7891000	7893000	The original came out in 1986
7893000	7895000	That means when he made this game
7895000	7897000	He was like 19 or 20
7897000	7899000	And it just makes you go
7899000	7901000	Wow what was I doing at 19 or 20
7901000	7903000	Moving to California
7903000	7905000	Right or just you know
7905000	7907000	Like I wasn't doing this kind of stuff
7907000	7909000	But then you know this guy went and made
7909000	7911000	You know a real classic video game
7911000	7913000	Was making video games at least he accomplished a lot
7913000	7915000	So rest in peace
7915000	7917000	Masato Masuda
7917000	7919000	So sorry to hear about that
7919000	7921000	48 is young
7921000	7923000	Very very very young
7923000	7925000	Alright one 877
7925000	7927000	Game OLR or a username on Skype

7949000	7951000	It was kind of a slower news week
7951000	7953000	That's the thing about April Fools day
7953000	7955000	It really cuts into like the actual news

7963000	7965000	Hora Ranma
7965000	7967000	Hey Ranma how you doing
7967000	7969000	I'm a little tired, my feet hurt
7969000	7971000	My back hurts but other than that I'm doing good
7971000	7973000	Yeah but let me think though
7973000	7975000	Were you here for the entire show
7975000	7977000	Or were you cheating on us with some pro wrestlers
7977000	7979000	Umm
7979000	7981000	Better things to spend my money on
7981000	7983000	If I'm cheating on OLR
7983000	7985000	I'm cheating on OLR with a bunch of hot cosplayers
7985000	7987000	I mean come on
7987000	7989000	Give me some kind of credit
7989000	7991000	Alright fair enough Ranma fair enough
7991000	7993000	So what's on your mind tonight buddy
7993000	7995000	I want to talk about where in the world
7995000	7997000	Is Carmen Sandiego
7997000	7999000	F yes the classic game of the week
7999000	8001000	The dark soccer pick this week
8001000	8003000	What do you want to talk about with it
8003000	8005000	When I was in junior high after school
8005000	8007000	There was about 10 of us we actually had
8007000	8009000	The Acme Detective Agency club
8009000	8011000	Okay we would sit there
8011000	8013000	On our Apple IIe's and just
8013000	8015000	Play the game and we would just
8015000	8017000	Go through it and they would put our names
8017000	8019000	On the board and like
8019000	8021000	Who can do the most
8021000	8023000	Umm cases and rank
8023000	8025000	Up and so forth
8025000	8027000	And that was pretty fun
8027000	8029000	And it's like we're looking at
8029000	8031000	Each other trying to figure out where one person
8031000	8033000	Is where one person's at and
8033000	8035000	Back then
8035000	8037000	There was maybe
8037000	8039000	Two copies of the game
8039000	8041000	And the disc was
8041000	8043000	Copied several times but only two
8043000	8045000	Almanacs so pretty much
8045000	8047000	At the end of the school that you had to run
8047000	8049000	To the computer lab be the first one to
8049000	8051000	Grab the disc and the almanac
8051000	8053000	Rama don't copy that floppy
8053000	8055000	Psssh
8055000	8057000	No I know I think
8057000	8059000	A lot of people did back in the day that's why they had
8059000	8061000	The copy protection
8061000	8063000	Yeah but that's why also Manning
8063000	8065000	Created tape
8065000	8067000	What
8067000	8069000	Don't forget
8069000	8071000	Well for the
8071000	8073000	Disc copy protection to get around it you just cover
8073000	8075000	The red notch with a piece of tape
8075000	8077000	Oh yeah that whole thing I do remember that
8077000	8079000	Oh my god that's right or yeah
8079000	8081000	You can flip the little thing on the three and a half
8081000	8083000	Floppy or yeah you get covered with the tape
8083000	8085000	Oh my god that's old school
8085000	8087000	Definitely yeah sorry it took me
8087000	8089000	A minute to like remember that and then I just suddenly had
8089000	8091000	The image of my childhood of like get the masking tape
8091000	8093000	It's
8093000	8095000	Quite alright and then you used to have
8095000	8097000	The thing that you could actually a little hole punch that you could
8097000	8099000	Actually punch the discs to put that notch in it
8099000	8101000	It's crazy
8101000	8103000	Anyway
8103000	8105000	So any other
8105000	8107000	Copy floppy stories from your childhood
8107000	8109000	You want to share with us?
8109000	8111000	That's the only one and by the way
8111000	8113000	For thinking
8113000	8115000	For the fact you thought these celebrities were already dead Rob
8115000	8117000	That was bad and you should feel bad
8117000	8119000	It was funny as hell
8119000	8121000	And you know it
8121000	8123000	Yeah I know especially what Loki said I was like
8123000	8125000	I was ready to walk out of my house
8125000	8127000	Right there
8127000	8129000	That was just terrible
8129000	8131000	I'm going to go under where Loki sits just for next time
8131000	8133000	He needs to drop the mic and walk away
8133000	8135000	Are you going to use that Mario pillow?
8135000	8137000	I might
8137000	8139000	That's a good use for it
8139000	8141000	I use that pillow for my back a lot actually
8141000	8143000	So Rob's butt is closer to it
8143000	8145000	That's right Mario can smell my butt
8145000	8147000	Are you pretty much telling Mario to kiss your ass?
8147000	8149000	I guess so
8149000	8151000	Because
8151000	8153000	I'm a Luigi fan Rama
8153000	8155000	I'm a Luigi fan
8155000	8157000	And you know my favorite
8157000	8159000	My favorite is black Luigi
8159000	8161000	By the way
8161000	8163000	Ronchon
8163000	8165000	You know I'm going to be back in the cosplay circuit
8165000	8167000	Come July
8167000	8169000	Are you doing Ugyo?
8169000	8171000	No
8171000	8173000	You're going to be so sad
8173000	8175000	So very very sad
8175000	8177000	Sailor Venus?
8177000	8179000	No
8179000	8181000	I'm doing two homestuck cosplays
8181000	8183000	I've learned to
8183000	8185000	Love and tolerate the homestuck fandom
8185000	8187000	As Marco said in My Little Pony
8187000	8189000	I will learn to love and tolerate
8189000	8191000	Respect and understanding
8191000	8193000	The gaming community needs more of it
8193000	8195000	I have given My Little Pony a chance
8195000	8197000	And I found some of it amusing
8197000	8199000	That's good
8199000	8201000	Even though Applejack's accent is horrible
8201000	8203000	But I have developed
8203000	8205000	A love of Rainbow Dash
8205000	8207000	Because
8207000	8209000	20% cooler
8209000	8211000	Yes
8211000	8213000	And don't forget
8213000	8215000	They had the figures at McDonald's this week
8215000	8217000	I'm not that into it
8217000	8219000	No thank you
8219000	8221000	Alright
8221000	8223000	Well Rama I'm going to let you go
8223000	8225000	So we can get some more calls
8225000	8227000	But listen to Anime Jam Session or You Suck
8227000	8229000	Right?
8229000	8231000	We'll be talking about Castle Point this week
8231000	8233000	A convention we hit up today
8233000	8235000	And after that we're getting ready for PAX East
8235000	8237000	Oh boy, big weekend coming up
8237000	8239000	You're telling me
8239000	8241000	I'm just glad I got the time off for it
8241000	8243000	Have fun at PAX East
8243000	8245000	Bye my friend
8245000	8247000	1877 Game OLR
8247000	8249000	Or a username on Skype
8249000	8251000	Orange Lounge Radio if you would like to give the show a call
8251000	8253000	The phone lines are once again open
8253000	8255000	Again that's 1877 Game OLR
8255000	8257000	Or a username on Skype
8257000	8259000	Orange Lounge Radio
8259000	8261000	I'm trying to go to the Twitters
8261000	8263000	To see what's going on here on Twitter
8263000	8265000	Tigerclaw sending us a tweet
8265000	8267000	The Wreck-It Ralph sequel is officially in the works
8267000	8269000	According to the composer
8270000	8272000	We haven't had any official confirmation
8272000	8274000	But Wreck-It Ralph of course the Disney movie
8274000	8276000	From last year that was great with all its throwbacks
8276000	8278000	To classic gaming
8278000	8280000	Very happy to hear about the sequel
8280000	8282000	I just hope it's not direct to video
8282000	8284000	That would be very sad
8284000	8286000	But yeah I'm excited to hear about it
8286000	8288000	I hope we get maybe a new Wreck-It Ralph game
8288000	8290000	That isn't exclusive to the Nintendo
8290000	8292000	Platforms
8292000	8294000	I'd like to see it out there in more places
8294000	8296000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
8296000	8298000	It's Shane
8298000	8299000	How are you doing?
8299000	8300000	I'm good
8300000	8301000	Hi Shane
8301000	8303000	Wow you're making the rounds on every podcast that I co-host this week
8303000	8305000	Right? I have no life
8305000	8307000	You even guessed it on Reading is Fundamental
8307000	8309000	And now you're here what's up?
8309000	8311000	I just want to do my
8311000	8313000	Due diligence as a
8313000	8315000	DJ Max fan and put out the PSA
8315000	8317000	That on the iOS
8317000	8319000	Platform we now have
8319000	8321000	The Technica game finally
8321000	8323000	In America
8323000	8325000	And it's expensive
8325000	8327000	So don't buy it
8327000	8329000	Wait a minute so you're doing your due diligence to tell us
8329000	8331000	That it's out there but then you're saying don't buy it
8331000	8333000	Yes
8333000	8335000	Why not?
8335000	8337000	Because you get the base game for free
8337000	8339000	And it comes with like six songs
8339000	8341000	I think seven maybe
8341000	8343000	And a couple of them
8343000	8345000	Are pretty decent songs
8345000	8347000	And then you have to buy
8347000	8349000	The rest of them you can earn
8349000	8351000	The credit stuff
8351000	8353000	To buy the songs by playing the games
8353000	8355000	But you don't really earn a whole lot
8355000	8357000	Each song is like 20 of these credits
8357000	8359000	So they want you to pay real money
8359000	8361000	If you want every single
8361000	8363000	Song that they have there
8363000	8365000	And they're sold in packs
8365000	8367000	You can also buy them individually but that's not as good
8367000	8369000	You have to pay 96 bucks
8371000	8373000	For a phone game
8373000	8375000	But does it have flea?
8375000	8377000	It does not
8377000	8379000	Fuck it then
8379000	8381000	It has one of the exclusives from the
8381000	8383000	What's it called?
8383000	8385000	DJ Max Ray on the iPhone
8385000	8387000	And it's not bad
8387000	8389000	But they are really asking
8389000	8391000	For a lot of money for songs
8391000	8393000	That don't translate as well to
8393000	8395000	The iPhone and probably iPad
8395000	8397000	As they do like in the arcade
8397000	8399000	But there will be some people that buy it
8399000	8401000	Right Shane?
8401000	8403000	Yep there will be
8403000	8405000	Not me though I did not buy any
8405000	8407000	Wow
8407000	8409000	So I don't have the money for it
8409000	8411000	Or else I'll buy it
8411000	8413000	But yeah
8413000	8415000	Everybody has to know
8415000	8417000	So they can download it and get the free version
8417000	8419000	And then eventually
8419000	8421000	If you are drunk
8421000	8423000	Or just
8423000	8425000	Dumb
8425000	8427000	You buy the other songs
8427000	8429000	Well if you have some more disposable income
8429000	8431000	Out there and you want to drop the money on this
8431000	8433000	And some of the songs
8433000	8435000	Let us know how it is
8435000	8437000	There are some good songs
8437000	8439000	I earned enough to buy
8439000	8441000	One of my own songs
8441000	8443000	Without paying money
8443000	8445000	And
8445000	8447000	I don't know
8447000	8449000	It has a two line mode and a three line mode
8449000	8451000	And it's okay
8451000	8453000	I bet this is much better on an iPad
8453000	8455000	Than a little dinky iPhone
8455000	8457000	But you know
8457000	8459000	If you need a DJ Max fix
8459000	8461000	Go play portable on PSP
8461000	8463000	And not this
8463000	8465000	Any other game reviews
8465000	8467000	You want to share with us tonight?
8467000	8469000	I have already professed my love for Infamous
8469000	8471000	Because it's amazing
8471000	8473000	Did you hear that Loki?
8473000	8475000	Loki said he wasn't sure on
8475000	8477000	Infamous Second Sign
8477000	8479000	No I said that was the only one that looked interesting
8479000	8481000	It is really interesting
8481000	8483000	It's got a decent story
8483000	8485000	I don't think the other ones supposedly have that great of stories
8485000	8487000	I really got invested
8487000	8489000	Into this one
8489000	8491000	And I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14
8491000	8493000	Because of Leviathan
8493000	8495000	And his mid 90's alternative
8495000	8497000	Rock song
8497000	8499000	It's the best
8499000	8501000	Playing that fight over and over
8501000	8503000	Jamie if you get that far don't play it
8503000	8505000	You might get motion sick
8505000	8507000	It does a lot of bobbing up and down
8507000	8509000	I'll probably wait for you guys to do it anyway
8509000	8511000	You fight Leviathan on a barge
8511000	8513000	And during the fight
8513000	8515000	Leviathan will fly up in the air
8515000	8517000	And land on the barge
8517000	8519000	Which causes the barge to tilt
8519000	8521000	And you all fly down the barge
8521000	8523000	Whatever way
8523000	8525000	It's really fun
8525000	8527000	Actually it's a rad mechanic
8527000	8529000	I'll just wait until I have you guys to do it with me
8529000	8531000	There you go
8531000	8533000	You can pretty much sleep through it once you get there
8533000	8535000	It's really not hard whatsoever
8535000	8537000	If you can get past Titan hard mode
8537000	8539000	Then shit anything is easy after that
8539000	8541000	The only reason I got past Titan at all
8541000	8543000	Was because of you guys while I slept in the fire
8543000	8545000	That was just regular mode
8545000	8547000	Wait until you see hard mode
8547000	8549000	It'll make you cry
8549000	8551000	You have no idea how angry I was that night
8551000	8553000	I was angry enough that I was in tears
8553000	8555000	And I got up and left my computer
8555000	8557000	I was that angry
8557000	8559000	Remember when I said
8559000	8561000	Fuck it, just finish it
8561000	8563000	After that I got up and left
8563000	8565000	No video games worth getting that
8565000	8567000	I was already in a really bad mood
8567000	8569000	I did that
8569000	8571000	I was already in a really bad mood that night
8571000	8573000	But just having all that happen
8573000	8575000	After I had put off doing
8575000	8577000	The fight for three games until there were people
8577000	8579000	To do it with me
8579000	8581000	I was just so frustrated
8581000	8583000	I'm going to warn you
8583000	8585000	It gets worse
8585000	8587000	The hard mode is extremely unforgiving
8587000	8589000	I would love to try it again
8589000	8591000	If I can
8591000	8593000	But I was so mad
8593000	8595000	Sure
8595000	8597000	Well Shane I'm going to let you go
8597000	8599000	See if we get any other callers
8599000	8601000	Thanks for the call
8601000	8603000	I'm going to play more Leviathan
8603000	8605000	Leviathan
8605000	8607000	That's not even the good part
8607000	8609000	Bye
8637000	8639000	This is a tweet from SSJ100Matt
8639000	8641000	Sometimes you guys want to bring stories
8641000	8643000	That might have slipped off of our radar
8643000	8645000	You want to bring that to our attention
8645000	8647000	Let's see
8647000	8649000	Washington State University researchers
8649000	8651000	Programmed a computer to teach another how to play
8651000	8653000	Ms. Pac-Man
8653000	8655000	Let's see
8655000	8657000	Right now robots are quote very dumb
8657000	8659000	Saying Matthew E. Taylor at WSU
8659000	8661000	Who is a professor of artificial intelligence
8661000	8663000	And so as robots become
8663000	8665000	More common it will be easier if they're capable
8665000	8667000	Of learning how to perform tasks from
8667000	8669000	Other robots
8669000	8671000	We don't want this information to be lost
8671000	8673000	Once your home robot knows how you like your bath
8673000	8675000	How you like your house cleaned
8675000	8677000	You don't want to lose that information
8677000	8679000	So huh that's interesting
8679000	8681000	And there's a whole little YouTube that goes with it
8681000	8683000	I'm not going to play it right now
8683000	8685000	But that's really neat
8685000	8687000	So they use Ms. Pac-Man as a way
8687000	8689000	Now can you teach me how to play?
8689000	8691000	Because I get killed in that game really easy
8691000	8693000	Alright
8693000	8695000	Akuma JP in our chatroom
8695000	8697000	At live.vognetware.com talking about
8697000	8699000	Final Fantasy 14 saying
8699000	8701000	The reason I left Final Fantasy 14 is because I got
8701000	8703000	Kicked from the server while in a fight with
8703000	8705000	Odin
8705000	8707000	That Odin fight will kill servers
8707000	8709000	Like there's so many people that show up for those fights
8709000	8711000	It kind of can't handle it
8711000	8713000	Which is not okay
8713000	8715000	They need to fix that somehow
8715000	8717000	So no MMO
8717000	8719000	Is perfect and that's where Square Enix is struggling
8719000	8721000	Is with some of those server issues
8721000	8723000	And they encourage every single player
8723000	8725000	On the damn server to show up in one zone
8725000	8727000	All at the same time
8727000	8729000	So I will put out one more call
8729000	8731000	For phone calls at 1877 game OLR
8731000	8733000	Or username on Skype orange lounge radio
8733000	8735000	I'm trying to look back
8735000	8737000	Sometimes I miss tweets that were sent early in the week
8737000	8739000	If I don't scroll back
8739000	8741000	So I'm going to do that right now
8741000	8743000	But unfortunately
8743000	8745000	There's no last minute stories to help
8745000	8747000	Give me time here
8747000	8749000	And stuff is
8749000	8751000	Let's see code man had sent us that same story
8751000	8753000	About the five year old and the security flaw
8753000	8755000	With Xbox one
8755000	8757000	But you know that story is like making the rounds
8757000	8759000	It's everywhere because I'm sure the associated press
8759000	8761000	Picked it up and it's a hilarious story to put
8761000	8763000	On the front of
8765000	8767000	Your local newspaper and things like that
8767000	8769000	Five year old that hacks Xbox
8769000	8771000	Oh Pete Caruno had sent some tweets
8771000	8773000	At the beginning of the week when he was listening to the show
8773000	8775000	Saying I believe it's illegal to
8775000	8777000	Rent games in Japan
8777000	8779000	That's why there's a thriving second hand market
8779000	8781000	To replace it
8781000	8783000	Renting CDs is legal
8783000	8785000	We were talking about that a little bit on the show last week
8785000	8787000	I think we were talking about red box and all that stuff
8787000	8789000	And Pete Caruno said
8789000	8791000	I successfully used the money in my Xbox account
8791000	8793000	To buy DJ Hero DLC yesterday
8793000	8795000	Even managing to partly pay with points
8795000	8797000	And credit card
8797000	8799000	Well you're doing better
8799000	8801000	Did you do that though through the website?
8801000	8803000	He didn't say
8803000	8805000	It was a tweet
8805000	8807000	Through the website
8807000	8809000	No
8809000	8811000	I do need to figure out
8811000	8813000	What I'm going to spend the rest of that on
8813000	8815000	I was hoping the DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5
8815000	8817000	Would come out but nope
8817000	8819000	Not yet
8819000	8821000	Alright
8821000	8823000	That's it I guess we're going to close up the Skype line
8823000	8825000	No other calls are coming in
8825000	8827000	Alas
8827000	8829000	And AkumaJP by the way is verifying
8829000	8831000	Yes it's illegal to rent games
8831000	8833000	They tried to do that here
8833000	8835000	It happened Nintendo was not a fan of that
8835000	8837000	But no this is Murica
8837000	8839000	So anyway
8839000	8841000	If you want to participate with the show

8863000	8865000	Thank you as always for your support
8865000	8867000	If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lawn Tradio
8867000	8869000	Don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show
8869000	8871000	We don't ask for your money
8871000	8873000	Although I will say just a heads up you guys
8873000	8875000	We are going to be looking at ways here in the coming
8875000	8877000	Weeks and months and so forth
8877000	8879000	And these are things you guys have been asking for
8879000	8881000	Can I get a shirt
8881000	8883000	Can I get Orange Lawn Tradio merchandise
8883000	8885000	Will you sign something and send it to us
8885000	8887000	We are looking at ways to do that
8887000	8889000	But again totally optional

8891000	8893000	And support the show that is fucking awesome
8893000	8895000	And you rule for it but you know we are not going to be like
8895000	8897000	We are not going to record our show
8897000	8899000	For a month if you don't do it
8899000	8901000	I am still planning on doing VOG the book
8901000	8903000	Which I do need to speak with some of our people
8903000	8905000	That would be very hilarious
8905000	8907000	Kickstart the most expensive episode of Orange Lawn Tradio ever
8909000	8911000	To one episode
8911000	8913000	And then we donate the money to charity
8915000	8917000	Namely the Jamie needs art supplies
8917000	8919000	And candy
8919000	8921000	Actually the donate to charity is against the rules
8921000	8923000	So you can't do that
8923000	8925000	Can you do it on InigoGo
8925000	8927000	At any rate
8927000	8929000	Bobby also makes a point that Cosmos
8929000	8931000	Was on
8931000	8933000	And Cosmos is fucking amazing
8933000	8935000	Well there you go
8935000	8937000	Well that's going to do it
8937000	8939000	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show
8939000	8941000	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show
8941000	8943000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight
8943000	8945000	I'll start
8945000	8947000	Because you know Loki when you bring Carl's Jr.
8947000	8949000	To the studio you make me crave Chris cut fries
8949000	8951000	You're a jerk
8951000	8953000	And I didn't even get the Chris cut fries
8953000	8955000	I ate their natural cut fries
8955000	8957000	You know what Rob we could get pinkberry
8957000	8959000	I gotta go get Allen
8959000	8961000	I was going to have pinkberry today
8961000	8963000	But my son had to fucking have an accident
8963000	8965000	After he was sitting there
8965000	8967000	Bouncing up down like you have to go to the bathroom
8967000	8969000	Let's go to the bathroom, no I don't have to go to the bathroom
8969000	8971000	Two seconds later
8971000	8973000	Oh I have to go to the bathroom
8973000	8975000	Get him in the, okay let's go to the pinkberry
8975000	8977000	Get him in the car, hey wait a second
8977000	8979000	Pants are wet
8979000	8981000	Thanks
8981000	8983000	Womp womp
8983000	8985000	Dark soccer your final thought tonight
8985000	8987000	I'm glad I only have to deal with my cat
8989000	8991000	And last but not least
8991000	8993000	Loki your final thought tonight
8993000	8995000	I hope I can get some more programming done this week
8995000	8997000	My brain has been mushed the last few days
8997000	8999000	That's what I get for staying up
8999000	9001000	Well feel better dammit
9001000	9003000	It's actually, I can only code with Red Bull
9003000	9005000	I have to drink lots of Red Bull
9005000	9007000	And then that actually works out
9007000	9009000	The problem is though I'm getting to the point though
9009000	9011000	Where it's like okay what do I work on next
9011000	9013000	What part do I work on next
9013000	9015000	It's just deciding what the best thing to work on
9017000	9019000	I don't know
9019000	9021000	I'm trying to like set myself goals and stuff
9021000	9023000	But it's just like a lot of stuff
