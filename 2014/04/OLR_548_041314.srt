Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
PAX East has wrapped up and the gaming news we've been yearning for has arrived.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Kicking off this week was a special Nintendo Direct.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
PAX brought us information on updates to Titanfall, the new Borderlands, and a new title from Harmonix.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Too much to cover in a mere 8 seconds, so stay tuned for the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio here on April the 13th, 2014 with episode 548 of our show.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you, DarkSakura?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My stomach's a little upset because I ate really rich broth.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really rich broth.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Maybe it was like really upset at something that happened over the weekend or who knows.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Actually, I gotta say this and I hope you do feel better because DarkSakura, y'all, was a real rock star for me yesterday.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We went to IKEA because I needed some furniture and you know that every time you go to IKEA, it's IRL Tetris.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Like it's IRL Tetris trying to load those boxes in your compact car.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right? I'm gonna blast that on speakers driving through the parking lot of IKEA.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But we did it. We got that crap in my car. It was the first time I ever had to fold down the backseat ever.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Which, you know, it wasn't that hard, but it's just like one of those, wow, I did something new today.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's the first time I squatted a shelf.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right? And you lifted like a 54-pound shelf. I'm like, let me help, let me help. You're like, no, I am woman, hear me roar.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And you picked up that.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What was it, like 57 pounds or something like that?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, it was 57 pounds. That's the new little shelf cart thing we have in the living room.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It really wasn't that bad though, because I've gotten, where I squat, what's my squats now, at 80?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, it wasn't that bad, but I realized that when I could lift 60, 70 over my head, that I was not squatting enough.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, I would not have been able to do that by myself, so I appreciate the company yesterday.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And of course, go into our chat room over at live.vogganetwork.com

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because we do tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vogganetwork.com.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, we do.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And in our chat room, we have Brad from Pod Culture saying, IKEA meatballs tasty.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That is their slogan.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Fine.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can't get through a conversation about IKEA, especially when it comes to food, without hearing from Tech Master Loki. How have you been?

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been okay.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When was the last time you had some IKEA food?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've never had any IKEA food.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've never been to IKEA.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What? I called the wrong person yesterday. No offense, Dark Soccer, but if he's never been.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I needed those shelves.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's true.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I needed those drawers and my soap dispenser that I got.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, Loki, as I'm filling up this house with things that my apartment was not big enough for, I'm sure there will be something else.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So next time I need to go to IKEA, I'm going to call you so you can have some meatballs and check out the store.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Which, why aren't they paying us? I'm just totally pimping the shit out of that store right now.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For the record, I was singing the song as we went through the roundabout, as most of the chat room is right now.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I noticed, yeah, having 978 is singing the Jonathan Coulton IKEA song in chat right now.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, the Meatballs Tasty line is also from that song.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ah, there you go. There you go.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alright, Loki, what's new with you quickly?

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I got a second week of watching the baby.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah?

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good times?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Tiring.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Tiring?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you able to get the baby to drink now, okay, and feeding?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I had to syringe feed him.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's annoying.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yikes.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's lazy.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Aw, poor guy.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hopefully in a couple months.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You should get one of those boob attachment things.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's what I told him last week, to wear the fake boobs.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It doesn't matter what you do. You could do all sorts of tricks with this baby.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's just not going to matter.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's because he's smarter than the average baby.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's smarter. Yeah, he's a smart baby.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Alright, well, we are going to shift gears a little bit here.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We are going to go right into some gaming news here, and right at the top of the show,

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I know PAX East is on a lot of people's minds because, you know, it happened this weekend.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I bet a lot of you guys might be tuning into the show tonight live.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We're probably there, or if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you probably missed the live show because, you know, you were there at PAX East.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But us being all the way here on the West Coast, who didn't get to make it out to PAX East,

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
we wanted to hear about how the show went this year.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So for our kickoff topic tonight, I want to bring on to the show tonight.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Live, joining us via the Skype line from Anime Jam Session, the one and only DJ Rama S is here.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey, what's going on, Rob?

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey, not much. How you doing, Rama?

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good, good. But what is this about PAX East?

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're coming back from IkeaCon.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's a crap load of furniture in the back, and I'm holding a table with one hand.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If I'm not careful, it's going to take my head off.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't forget the 50 packs of Allen wrenches.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you really go by Ikea on your way back? That's a lie.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Twice.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you by yourself, or you sound like you're in a car full of people?

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I am in a car full of people.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mako John here is driving the mobile studio, and behind me is Zaku.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey, guys. Well, hi to the whole crew in the car. How you guys doing?

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hi, hi.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hello, hello.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So PAX East, you guys are on your way back. In one word, Rama, how is PAX East?

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Fucking phenomenal.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's two words. You cheated.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's hyphenated. I say it passes.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Walk us through your weekend at the con a little bit. How did things go?

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You got there, and how did Friday go, and so forth. Walk us through your weekend.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Rama, you still there?

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, we're here.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It might have been a dead zone as we're on 95 going back.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's okay. Live radio, folks, and we are doing this from a car all the way to our little studio in Sacramento.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So I don't know if you heard the question, Rama, but Rama, I just wanted you to kind of walk us through your weekend a little bit.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay. It was really fun. The expo hall was a lot more packed.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It was a little bit harder to get swag this year. Not as much cosplay, but very popular with Mario Brothers and Bioshock for obvious reasons.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Right.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The parties were just freaking phenomenal. Seeing the Crystal Method perform live was just worth it for me.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, I had no idea they were headlining the con. They were the big music guests there?

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, for the after party.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, okay. So there was something else going on in Boston at the same time.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, nowadays, now what they're doing is, Friday nights and Saturday nights, they're having the Nvidia after party or the IGN after party,

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or Enter Game Company here, World Bar Crawl 2014, get in when you fit in, you know.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Got it. So they don't do the official concerts anymore. It's more like go to all these cool after parties and get out of parties.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They still do it, but yeah.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm having a hard time hearing Zaku. I don't know what he's saying.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I said, it was, got it? I think the court's in short.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Live from the mobile studio, folks.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Alright, can you hear me now?

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, barely.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Alright. I actually went to that Nvidia party, but I guess the whole crux of it is that compared to last year,

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
there's been a slight uptick in the number of after parties surrounding the con.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Some of which you have to travel outside of the convention center area, you know, to actually reach.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Some of which you have to like have it out. But yeah, I actually went to the Nvidia after party on Friday.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Aside from playing a bit of Titanfall, we were getting like, we only got up to like two free drinks,

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and then they threw in an extra one when they moved the party up to the venue above the party.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, I think the best part about any convention or the after party is, I mean, that even extends to E3,

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
which technically isn't a convention. It's a trade show. But y'all have heard about the legendary parties at E3.

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And heck, I think I was just talking on the Bobby Blackwell show before we were live.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was talking about Gamer X and how some of the parties at that were the highlight of the show.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, I mean, I'm not surprised at all to hear that the after parties in some ways stole the convention in a way.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah. I mean, that's still typical, but you also have like, you know, a lot of people, from what I've been hearing,

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a lot of people were saying that Bethesda's Wolfenstein party was pretty much the hit just on the terms of swag

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and the fact that it was a 1960s theme that plays into the new version of Wolfenstein that they're releasing, the new order.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So people were encouraged to actually dress up in 1960s attire, even though that wasn't a requirement.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But from what I was gauging on social media and all other sources, people were pretty much saying that that was the best party of the weekend.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Not to throw cold water on the ACES PC Gamer party, but in terms of what you got for just showing up,

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
those folks were able to get a lot more swag than the PC Gamer ones, unfortunately.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Swag has been pretty much relegated to these after parties. If you actually got in and managed to get the swag, then...

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's really no different from E3.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Otherwise, the call center...

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The whole swag thing is really no different from E3 or some of the other conventions that are out there,

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
because I know you got to go to the after parties if that's stuff you're looking for.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They give away these big bags, but there's nothing to fill them with, which I don't know if you want to blame the economy or cost saving or what have you.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And I noticed in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, SSGO and under Matt, who I know is also at PAX East,

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
agrees that swag was tough to acquire, at least for me. So, you know, it is what it is.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But tell us about some of the things on the convention floor over at PAX East that you guys were able to get...

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, I mean, for my Nvidia swag bag, I managed to get at least three USB drives.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, well, that's... Alright, hey, that's pretty awesome.

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Where's mine? No, I'm just kidding. Alright, hey.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Rob. What? Hello?

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Rob, I'll say this. This is what you should call... We're right here, bro.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
PAX East should have been called this. PAX East 2014. The return of the indie motherfucker.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The most hilarious thing about that is that Rama got cut off as he was saying that,

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
but I imagine there's a huge delay thanks to the fact that we're beaming onto highway 95 somewhere from space.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So this is the year of the indie? The return of the indie?

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The return of the indie motherfuckers. It was 85-90% indie development all over the place.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, you did have Microsoft with the Xbox One sitting out there.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ubisoft was there. 2K was there. Bethesda was there.

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But there was a lot more independent publishers and developers,

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and pretty much the biggest indie developer there I would say would have to be Riot Games with League of Legends.

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And believe you me, you kind of want to keep your distance from that booth.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
League of Legends fans are crazy.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because it was getting to where they were fighting for swag, and I ain't fighting for swag.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, I bet. I bet. And Blizzard, well Blizzard's not really indie,

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
but I know Blizzard had a big weight for a lot of things they were giving away.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They were giving away beta tests for Warlords of Draenor, which a ton of people that are huge into Warcraft,

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and when you're super into one game like that, as a lot of League players are,

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and as a lot of Warcraft players are, I mean you will cut a bitch for swag.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I remember when we were super into DDR, I got yelled at by some girl,

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
because I caught a t-shirt that she wanted, and she got nasty with me,

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and no, I didn't give her the shirt, I kept it for myself.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you're going to act like that, hmm. Yeah, I got your shirt. Anyway.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, no, no. You got your shirt.

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's right. My shirt. Anyway. I still wear that shirt, by the way.

184
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Beatmania, yo, with my Beatmania shirt. Anyway, okay.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Rama, what were some of the games you actually got your hands on, like some things you actually got to play?

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, before I get into that, the funny thing that you mentioned is DDR.

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't remember the full title of the game, it was called The Order of Something.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Order of the Necromancer.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think you're talking about the Crypt of the Necromancer.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The Crypt of the Necromancer.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Keyboard, hmm? You played with controller, keyboard, and dance pads.

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That sounds like fun. What is the game? Is it just a music game, or is it an adventure, or what?

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's an adventure, top-down, gauntlet-style crawler.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That sounds kind of awesome, actually. Did you enjoy it?

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah. I think the line was a little bit too long for me to enjoy it.

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But, they had this one game there that's coming out, Steam, at PlayStation 4, which I may have to purchase.

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is a, I think it's called Gravenger Z. I have the pin somewhere in my bag.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But, I know Jamie will enjoy this, because it is an old-school anime-style shooter.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
With the 70s-style animation, the original old-school, late 80s arcade bootloader.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a Galaxie.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The eye-catches says we'll be right back between every game level and so forth.

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That sounds kind of awesome, actually. That sounds amazing.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, it was. There were a lot of mobile games. We were busy playing.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Me and Mark were busy playing this game called Fairway Solitaire Golf, because we were trying to win $1,000 on Xbox One.

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, they were having a tournament. The top three players every day of the convention.

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
First player got $1,000, second player got an Xbox One, and third player got an iPad.

207
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, everybody was playing that just to try and get the prizes.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That probably would be $2,000.

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Showing up.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Pay for my trip.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
$1,000.

213
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
$1,000 cash.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wow.

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, I'm assuming you didn't win, or you'd be talking to us from an airplane right now.

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, you were here, and I'm on a boat by the Lonely Island. Yeah, we decided to take a yacht back to the studio.

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
All right. Rama, before we let you go, what was the highlight of the whole damn thing for you guys?

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh.

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm going to let the others talk, because I've got to think about that one.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
All right. I mean, I guess if you ... Well, I guess mostly the highlights were just like whatever they announced.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's see. NVIDIA basically announced Portal for the Shield, meaning that Valve for the first time is targeting Android.

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right.

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That came out of left field essentially during the panel.

225
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The head of one of the folks, execs from NVIDIA, was hosting it.

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He had developers play Portal on the Shield, and the thing is the PC wasn't even streaming it.

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Wasn't that on the show last week?

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, they announced it last week.

229
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
They did announce it, but maybe this is the first time that you really see them embracing it in public.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, they were actually showcasing it, though.

231
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay, yeah. That's cool.

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So far it looks pretty good for an Android Portal.

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
All right.

234
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's almost like the original one. The second one is like harmonics.

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It actually woke up pretty early just to get to the first panel of the day, which was theirs.

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They announced Record Run, which is the first tablet game being released by them right now.

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's kind of like audio surf, but not really in the same artistic style, but in the actual mechanics,

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
where your actual iPads or iOS's library essentially drives the actual notes.

239
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's essentially a free-to-play game, where you basically have a certain number of songs you can add into your collection in the slots.

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And the more you play it, the more you get what's called backstage passes, which is essentially the currency that you use within the game to spend it on more music slots to add more tracks from your library.

241
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And from what they were telling me, they were this close during the keynote to announcing another title,

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but at the last minute they couldn't get clearance from one of the legal hurdles that was in the way.

243
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So they had a hold off on that, and they might announce something later on, hopefully by E3.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, I know we'll have more information on the harmonics game coming up a little later in the show and some of these other big announcements that I know came out of PAX East.

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But yeah, getting to be there for some brand new information I'm sure is a highlight.

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's always kind of cool to be there in the room when a big bombshell is dropped, like going to a big press conference or something like that. That's awesome.

247
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Rama, Mako-chan, what about you guys? What was the highlight?

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Alright, here you go Mako.

249
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was actually playing two different games on the floor and absolutely loved them.

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
One of them, they were there last year, it's called Cupcakes and Critters.

251
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I saw that.

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And this year they had, the game itself was more developed and they were really trying to pimp it out.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And basically you're trying to save a cupcake from a bunch of roaches, but it's mind-numbing and you just sit there and kill all of these bugs.

254
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But when you hit the cupcake, it actually smiles and laughs, so I thought that was hilarious.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The other game is going to be out shortly for 3DS, PS4, and what was the other one?

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Vita.

257
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Vita.

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Vita.

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's called Blast'em Bunnies.

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's actually a shooter where you're killing really cute bunnies with carrots and pumpkins.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Onions.

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Onions.

263
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Turnips.

264
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Everything is like motion control, so with the controller you have to actually turn the controller left and right to aim or up and down.

265
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So it was actually really, really fun.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Huh, that sounds neat.

267
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Alright, Rob, I guess we're to you.

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Last but not least, what's your big highlight?

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I got three.

270
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Number one, number three.

271
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:38,000
As you know, I'm a hardware guy, so I went over to the Cooler Master booth and they had a contest for the typing of the dead on their mechanical keyboards.

272
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It was fun.

273
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I've come to the determination that I need a mechanical keyboard.

274
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Me too, I came to that determination some time ago.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Absolutely.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Number two.

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh crap, I can't believe I forgot that.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Anyway, if I remember I'll come back to it.

279
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But this was my highlight.

280
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, no, now I remember number two.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Number two was playing Skullgirls through Steam on a Windows Surface tablet.

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Huh.

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That blew my mind because I didn't think a tablet like that was that powerful.

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sitting there, playing it, they had the hub connected to it, two controllers, and I'm playing through the game.

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No lag, no slow down, no nothing.

286
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was greatly impressed.

287
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I mean, I won't go out and get a Surface tablet, but I am impressed at the power behind this little device.

288
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay.

289
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And my number one.

290
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Uh huh.

291
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is the one thing I actually got online for.

292
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Took me about 30, 35 minutes to get into it.

293
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I got in, I got strapped down into an Oculus Rift.

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, Bobby's smiling somewhere.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Tell us about your Oculus Rift experience.

296
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I want one.

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Even though Zuckerberg owns it now?

298
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean, it's okay.

299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Granted that the front of the device is blue and has a giant Facebook logo on it, you'll get used to it.

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You'll learn to like them anyway, I'm sure.

301
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What was the Oculus experience like for you?

302
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What did you get to play?

303
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It was a game called Couch Night, where it was two stick video type nights and you were just fighting each other on a table.

304
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But let me tell you, they sat me down in the chair and they put the headset on and they told me to look around to calibrate it.

305
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I look around, I'm having a mini heart attack.

306
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
For a split second this was actual reality.

307
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm like, this is what I'm looking at.

308
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sitting in a chair, not on a couch.

309
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You plugged into the Matrix.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes. And the fact of the matter is that the goggles fits on top of my glasses.

311
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And it works even better for me.

312
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Nice. So now you're sold on the Oculus Rift after that, huh?

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yes.

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Good times. Good times.

315
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, Rama, Meika Chan, and Zaku, thank you guys for talking to us from the car on the way home.

316
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Really appreciate it.

317
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I gotta let you guys go so we can get on with the show.

318
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But everybody listen to Anime Jam Session on Tuesday because I know at least Rama and Meika Chan will be there.

319
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Probably, you gotta talk about PAX East, even though it's not anime.

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We will. It's a PAX East show.

321
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You gotta. You gotta talk a little more about some of that cosplay and some of the other sights and sounds.

322
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Any quick last words before, any parting shots before we go?

323
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Um. Sucks to be EA. Sucks to be Sony. They should have been there. They missed out.

324
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But you know what? Let it be. I want more PAX. I want more indie gamers. I want more fun with that.

325
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There you go. You can still have fun with nothing but indies. You're 85% indies. That's absolutely true.

326
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Alright, buddy. Have a safe drive back. Don't do anything crazy.

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Alright.

328
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We won't.

329
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Alright, bye.

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Bye.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Alright, live interview from a moving vehicle.

332
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
How is that for the future, you guys? Internet radio.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you guys for putting up with some of those little tech hiccups there.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But, you know, such is the beauty of live radio.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Anyhow, so yes, again, Rama and Meika Chan will be on Anime Jam Session, which you can hear at the voicegeeksnetwork of voggenetwork.com, Tuesday nights at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Alright, we're going to get on with our own show here. We have some news, including some of the other things that were announced at PAX East, amongst other gaming news that happened in the industry this week.

337
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But before we get there, we always like to start off with, how was your gaming week?

338
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
To establish a little bit of a frame of reference for where our heads are at with the gaming industry this week, especially since we weren't at PAX East.

339
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We usually start with DarkSakura, but she stepped away for just a moment, so we're going to go ahead and start with Loki tonight. Loki, how was your gaming week?

340
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I didn't play very much. I only played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and just, you know, our multiplayer games.

341
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And I'm awesome.

342
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So, still really enjoying that.

343
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know. I played a little bit of a Unity game that someone had made called Garbage Day.

344
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's just kind of a silly, you know, not really a grand theft auto, it's like a sandbox game where you just, there's really no point to it yet, you just murder people.

345
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But it sounds like a point to me!

346
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
No, here's the thing though. It's like, the game is so basic right now, there's hardly anything to it, but...

347
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But there is murder!

348
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But the music that they have in the background is hilarious. It's just very, like, happy...

349
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What game is this again?

350
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's called Garbage Day.

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Garbage Day.

352
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like something some guy is making on, like, the Unity Reddit forum thing, so I got to check that out. That was kind of funny.

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
No Goat Simulator stories for this week?

354
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't think I played that this week, actually.

355
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What?

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I haven't had a lot of time to play games, because a certain baby isn't taking naps when he's supposed to be.

357
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, right, you gotta be a dad and all that, geez.

358
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I know, he's totally cutting into my game time. I mean, seriously.

359
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You need baby mamas, that way mama will fix it.

360
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But, yeah, I'm hoping to play some more stuff. I do want to get back into South Park and finish that.

361
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I know it's not a very long game, so I want to do that.

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I also have Bridge Constructor, which I got from the last Humble Bundle, and the physics in that game are absolutely fucking terrible, so that I want to play.

363
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You like terrible physics, though.

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I love it, it's hilarious. It's hilarious to see that kind of stuff happen.

365
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Who needs the theory of gravity?

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, it's just, like, it just doesn't work quite right. There's something off, is what's the best part about it.

367
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I played a few video games like that. Something's just not right with the physics.

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's about it. I was hoping to pick up Titanfall in 360 this week, but I'm kind of glad I didn't, because I wouldn't have had any chance to play it.

369
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Maybe later on, but looking forward to Wolfenstein and Watch Dogs, because they'll be the next two I want to try.

370
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Alright, sounds good. Dark Soccer is back. She's got coffee. She's ready to go. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

371
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It was minimal.

372
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Minimal?

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah. I played Animal Crossing and that's about it. Although, I did pick up a game today that I will be discussing later in the show on iOS.

374
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I really think all I played was Animal Crossing this week. It's just been really kind of a busy week for me at work and weirdness.

375
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's pretty neat, though, that a game like Animal Crossing can hold your attention after all this time.

376
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm surprised you didn't pick up the Disney game that everybody's talking about this week.

377
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The, ah, I can't remember the name of it. It's like Disney's version of Animal Crossing.

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What the hell is it, Loki? You know what I'm talking about.

379
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's like, uh, like Magical Kingdom or something like that.

380
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Something like that. Yeah, yeah.

381
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No point. I've got other games I'd rather be playing.

382
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Alright.

383
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But, I don't know. It was kind of nice taking a little bit of a break and just going home and I was a little sick earlier this week.

384
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But, um, so mostly it was just going home and going to bed.

385
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then being, ah, going out to Pinkberry with somebody who shall remain named Rob.

386
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Delicious.

387
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It was.

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Alright.

389
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It was a busy week.

390
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Alright, fair enough.

391
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Um, my gaming week, sadly, I did play a lot this week, but it was a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about on this show for weeks.

392
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So, sadly, I don't have really anything new to review for you guys, but I will say Final Fantasy XIV is out on the Playstation 4 officially now.

393
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Thumbs up.

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The Fat Chocobo mount for the collector's edition of the game, which you also get if you had a collector's edition for PC or Playstation 3, is amazing.

395
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's the Fat Chocobo, which I think started in Final Fantasy IV, but you, hmm.

396
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I didn't know about this and I have to redeem mine then.

397
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's waiting for you in the in-game mail when you sign in.

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, they all went out this morning.

399
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Logging in.

400
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So when you log in, yeah, and the mount, it's so adorable.

401
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's like this Fat Chocobo that you ride on the back and you have on a fishing pole a little, it's a Gishaw greens, but it looks like a cabbage.

402
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So it's like a cabbage that hangs out in front of the Fat Chocobo's mouth, so that's what makes him run.

403
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And then when you stop, your character, like, pulls the thing up so the Chocobo can't see it.

404
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Like, the attention to detail is great.

405
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then when you jump, it's fat little legs go like this.

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Fat little legs fly.

407
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's so cute.

408
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll probably be writing that instead of my quarrel. Although I like my quarrel.

409
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So I've been playing that a little bit on PlayStation 4, a little bit on PC.

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm finding that the mouse sensitivity on PlayStation 4 and just the sensation of playing on my larger TV as opposed to my not-so-large monitor is really throwing me.

411
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like, it's really throwing me for a loop.

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I have a hard time sometimes on the PlayStation, but it's gorgeous and the frames, I mean, it's just so smooth compared to my PC because I have kind of an older PC.

413
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But that's one of the things I'm hoping to upgrade this week because some things, we got some good news.

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Alan and I got some good news in the past week, so I'm hoping that I'm going to finally be able to get that new computer I've been wanting for like two years.

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So that'll be good.

416
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I was doing some live streaming as well on the PlayStation 4.

417
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I really wish that Twitch and Sony was archiving those streams on PS4 right now.

418
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I understand that's coming in an enhancement soon. I know we reported on that a couple weeks ago.

419
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But unfortunately, you can't go see the archives of me playing PlayStation 4 because we have fun with that.

420
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So, yeah. Otherwise, more Diablo 3. I think I'm up to Paragon level like 35 now.

421
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I love the new adventure mode. It's so fun to just go and you can just, excuse me, you can just go into a game with randoms.

422
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And I usually go on like a lower difficulty. I don't get as much experience, but it's so fast.

423
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You just go through and you get all the rift coins and then I just kind of go explore those on my own.

424
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And yeah, I'm having a great time with Diablo 3.

425
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And that's pretty much been the two big games I've been playing this week.

426
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I still touched a little bit of Final Fantasy X. I think I fired that up once.

427
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
South Park I still need to go back and beat, but you know, just a lot going on with me too.

428
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So that does it for my gaming week and therefore all of our gaming weeks.

429
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So let's quickly go over some housekeeping. Next week is Easter Sunday, right?

430
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's right.

431
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So Loki will not be here next week because you have some family obligations, I know.

432
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But Dark Soccer and I will still be here next week to put on a show for you guys.

433
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Maybe a special guest if I can find one here locally in the next week to bring to the show.

434
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So that'll all be something you guys can look forward to next week on the show.

435
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We will still be here live. We will not take next week off.

436
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Otherwise, I don't know any shows that we do have off.

437
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Probably the next time we're going to have a show off is whenever Gamer X is.

438
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because we won't do a show that weekend because Jamie and I will be hungover.

439
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So there you go.

440
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Maybe.

441
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Maybe. Alright.

442
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Let's see. I think that does it for housekeeping so let's get into some gaming news.

443
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Lots and lots of news this week actually coming out of PAX East and other events as well.

444
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So Loki, take us away.

445
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So there's talk about like kind of a changing opinion with the change of, I guess, the lead, you know, person at Xbox.

446
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You know, remember with Don Mattrick, originally he said, you know, it was quoted, you know,

447
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
if you're backwards compatible, you're really backwards and everybody.

448
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's kind of like that whole we're all pissed at Microsoft because they're saying really dumb things, you know, part of that.

449
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So now, you know, now that there's a new regime sort of thing, they're kind of looking at it like Phil Spencer is saying,

450
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
well, you know, we're looking at it right now.

451
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
There's not really a way we can do it, but it's something we'd love to see on the system.

452
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know, because like we've said, you know, it's hard to emulate that stuff right now.

453
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Although I got to say it is probably somewhat possible because, I mean, homebrew wise, someone's already made an emulator for the Xbox 360.

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It just doesn't work very well. But there is one out there somewhere.

455
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So, yeah, it's something that they're looking at.

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So if they can, you know, definitely support that, then, yeah, that support will be coming if it's feasible.

457
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I feel like there, correct me if I'm wrong, Loki, based on some detail I might have missed, but I really feel like this is a whole bunch of smoke up our ass.

458
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't think there is any intention of doing backwards compatibility whatsoever.

459
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I think it's all wordsmithing to try and quell people down.

460
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But I really don't see like if there was going to be backwards compatibility that would have been implemented or that would have been under like that would have started a long time ago to say,

461
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
boy, gee, golly, maybe that's something we should look at, you know, and we'll do that real soon.

462
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't think that's the case. I don't think it's just, I mean, granted, it's, you know, better than saying, well, we're not looking at it at all.

463
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But at the same time, I think that they would want to look at something like that because it gives them an opportunity to sell the back catalog again on Xbox One,

464
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
just like they're doing like, you know, the PlayStation Network right now selling PlayStation 2 games and PlayStation 1 games.

465
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It does give it does give a leg up as well for what it's worth on PlayStation 4 as well, because, you know, the library is not instantly backwards compatible.

466
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And that's something a lot of people kind of miss.

467
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I highly doubt that if it is ever backwards compatible, that it's not going to be backwards compatible with disks.

468
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't think that they'll have you put your disk in the system and have it read off that.

469
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But it's still going to be a very long ways off. I don't even know if they're going to be able to do it.

470
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
One would think, too, if they get 360 compatibility working, then by nature they'll have original Xbox working as well,

471
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
because they sold original Xbox games on 360. At least the chunk that they had working.

472
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I mean, you would literally be emulator to emulator. I mean, you'd be emulating twice.

473
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But assuming they get 360 at full speed, it shouldn't matter.

474
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But I know they sold original Xbox games on 360 and a big chunk, like, what, three quarters of the library of Xbox games worked on Xbox 360.

475
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Like, you know, the Halo games. Just not the DDR games. I know games that were always missing.

476
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I just don't know. I don't think it's going to happen. But it's something that they're looking at.

477
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't know. I just don't think that they'll be able to do it unless they come up with some completely new way to emulate that stuff.

478
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Not actually just raw emulating everything. They'd have to come up with a new way to play all that architecture and stuff.

479
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Right. I don't know. I still can't help but feel like, just don't get your hopes up, you guys.

480
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because I think by the time they were to implement something like this, they'll have stopped making 360 games.

481
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yes. They're not in a big hurry to do this anyways, because they want you to buy a 360 still.

482
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I mean, if you want to play 360 games, buy a 360. If you want to play Xbox One games, you buy an Xbox One.

483
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They don't want you to just buy one system. But at some point, you know, they're not going to be making the Xbox 360 anymore.

484
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They're going to stop making the Xbox 360 games. And maybe I can see them supporting Xbox 360 games for whatever the next console is.

485
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You know, when the processors are that much more powerful.

486
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I do see the point, though, about being able to get a 360 emulator working just so they can resell you a copy of Halo 3.

487
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Or, you know, some of the big 360 titles. I do see that perspective. And maybe that'll be a ways down the line.

488
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And everybody else does it. Nintendo's done it with Virtual Console. You've bought several games several times on your 3DS and your Wii and your Wii U.

489
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And they do that with Virtual Console.

490
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
How many times have they sold you a Game Boy?

491
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Right? Well, to be fair, the hardware at least goes through upgrades. Games don't change.

492
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But anyway, and then PlayStation, you know, they get you to buy PS1 games you probably already owned.

493
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like, I bought Umjama Lamy so I could play it on my PlayStation 3 even though I had it on PlayStation 1 at one point.

494
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You know, so. And, granted, if I could find the damn disc, I could just put that in my PlayStation 3.

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But, eh, whatever. It was five bucks or something, right?

496
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So, I'm sure Microsoft wants a piece of that type of pie, too. So that's the only reason I could see them doing it.

497
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But I don't think it's, yeah, I don't know if that necessarily means you're going to put your 360 disc in and off it goes.

498
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You know? We'll see.

499
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

500
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Dungeonbuster says, sounds like he's being diplomatic about it. He's not saying no, but at the same time gives reasons why it might not even happen.

501
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
ActDeft in chat says retro compatibility equals HD remakes, maybe?

502
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, I mean, I know we have news on at least one more of those and that seems to be the popular thing to do right now is remaking games from the last gen like we saw with Tomb Raider.

503
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Well, yeah, that's something I see happening a lot more than just this.

504
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Nintendo sure does it, too.

505
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They don't actually do it a whole ton anymore. I mean, Virtual Console, maybe.

506
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, yeah, but I'm thinking like Wind Waker HD and some of the Wii control games.

507
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah, new play controlling. Well, that wasn't even an upgrade. That was just straight porting.

508
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But like, you know, I think they had some Square Enix or even Sony had a way to port like some of their games like PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3 very easily.

509
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So if they come up with something like that to port 360 games to, you know, Xbox One or something, it might be worth it if they can improve the visuals and make it worthwhile.

510
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Right. All right.

511
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, we'll see if they actually put their foot forward with this. Maybe something you'd see at E3? I don't know. That might be a little soon.

512
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
We're not going to see anything for backwards compatibility, I think ever on this, at least on the Xbox One. It's not going to happen.

513
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
One more thought here from our chat room and then I'm going to go to another story.

514
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But VX Jason XV in our chat says they wouldn't build 360 compatibility to let you play an old Halo.

515
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
They'd port the old Halo or introduce Halo 3 mode to Halo 5 or something like that.

516
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Like Halo 3 campaign in future Halos and Act F follows that up with Halo 3 DLC.

517
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, I could see that. I could see that. Why not, instead of giving somebody that value, you know, why not convince somebody to just buy it again?

518
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, that's a few years off.

519
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It works. People do it.

520
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Halo 2 anniversary later this year.

521
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah. Well, there's no official word on that.

522
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's official.

523
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's either official or it's not official.

524
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's official to the point where it's leaked out so many times it's official.

525
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah, they have an officially setting.

526
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's officially a poorly kept secret.

527
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I want to actually say this.

528
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, noobs I thought was official in Mortal Kombat 2.

529
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But it did end up being official at some point.

530
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, later because of people not shutting off, whatever.

531
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Alright, let's move on. Hey, you know what? You know what is official?

532
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I could not be more excited.

533
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
A new civilization game. Yay!

534
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You civ whore.

535
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yay!

536
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Okay, here's the thing. It's not Civilization 6.

537
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Frown.

538
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But that's okay because Civ 5 is still awesome and I'm getting some mileage out of that.

539
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's like Civ X-Com.

540
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Or it's Civilization Alpha Centauri, essentially, is what it is.

541
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But here's the thing.

542
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They don't own the Fire Access in 2K.

543
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
They don't own the rights to the Alpha Centauri name.

544
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
EA does.

545
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So what they've announced instead is they've announced a game called Civilization Beyond Earth.

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And that is the game.

547
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They've put out a big trailer that just talks about, you know, we've built the Earth as much as we can.

548
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What is next?

549
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And it's essentially space.

550
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And the vibe I'm getting from the game is that it's not like humans and aliens.

551
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's still like Americans, Egyptians.

552
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't know if it's going to be modern.

553
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I don't know if they would include historical.

554
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Like, would the Egyptians be in it?

555
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Well, I don't know. We'll see.

556
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I guess Egypt is still a country.

557
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Who knows? I don't know what they're going to do.

558
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But they'll still have human civilizations in the game.

559
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So like Americans and Russian and Chinese.

560
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know, probably all the United Nations powers and all that will probably be civilizations you can play in the game.

561
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Colonizing a new world.

562
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We don't have more details on that at this time.

563
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
My impression I'm getting from this and what I'm hearing about the game is it's this spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

564
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But imagine now that a lot of things we got from Civ V, such as the hexagon grid, are now going to be in a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri.

565
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
That sounds like where civilization beyond Earth is going.

566
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And Black Wolf in our chatroom says,

567
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Egyptians no longer exist is a quote I said.

568
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's not what I said.

569
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But when I think about the Egyptians and civilization, I think about as they're led by ancient Egypt commanders.

570
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And that's not going to be the case anymore.

571
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So I think you're going to see more contemporary civilizations.

572
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So we're not going to see Space Gandhi or anything?

573
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You know what? Anything is possible in the future.

574
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Who knows? Who knows?

575
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But anyway.

576
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, so it's going to be in space.

577
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The cool thing is that, and again hearing some of the talk coming out of the panel and the convention, is that there's no established roadmap that they have to follow.

578
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So if you think about it, in a game like Civilization where you have the tech tree, you know that civilizations eventually will discover the wheel, which leads to advanced cars at some point, the steam engine.

579
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Everything kind of leads to newer technology.

580
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But the thing about when you're talking about the future, we don't know what that technology looks like.

581
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So they can kind of make it up.

582
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So that's going to be kind of cool.

583
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And they talk about how the tech tree in Civilization Beyond Earth will be a web, not a tree.

584
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So that's going to be very interesting.

585
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So there you go.

586
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You will assemble your culture identity and craft your colony before exploring the new world.

587
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There's also going to be a quest system.

588
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And that's not something you ever saw in civilization games before.

589
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That's going to be pretty neat.

590
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm very excited to it, especially if it has Sid Meier's name on it.

591
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm hoping that he is a part of the development of the game.

592
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That would be great.

593
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But yeah, they are saying it's going to happen this fall.

594
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So more to come on this at E3.

595
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Please let me get to go to E3 and see a demo of this behind closed doors, please.

596
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm very excited about this.

597
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So there you go.

598
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Civilization Beyond Earth.

599
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Darkstalker, what do you have for us?

600
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Well, news out of BioWare regarding Dragon Age Inquisition.

601
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That they are not going to be doing any DLC as far as characters are concerned.

602
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Because of what you have to do to be able to enable new characters to be provided as DLC is that you have to put part of the content on the disc.

603
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And because of people fussing about paying for something they already own, then they just said we're not doing DLC characters at all.

604
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What we're giving you is what you get.

605
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So you get nine characters.

606
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The ones confirmed are Cassandra, who we saw in Dragon Age 2, definitely.

607
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Iron Bull, Sera, Solas, Varric, I love Varric, and Vivienne.

608
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So that's confirmed.

609
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I would imagine that a decision like this could impact another series that you and I love dearly and that would be Mass Effect.

610
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Because I think about the DLC characters for those games were largely on the disc, right?

611
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Like Javok in Mass Effect 3 had to be on the disc.

612
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Because you think about all the dialogue that goes with that and characters interacting with Javok, it's got to be on the disc.

613
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Just put it on the disc, but put a significant portion of it that you download.

614
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That way people don't bitch because they feel like they're getting a significant portion and not just a key to unlock it.

615
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Well, about mine digitally anyway.

616
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Well, in Mass Effect, the characters usually came with missions as well.

617
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I don't confess to be as up to speed on Dragon Age, but did they do a similar thing where the characters at least kind of...

618
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You got missions and quests with it as well?

619
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I played the first Dragon Age without any DLC.

620
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So I'm actually playing through Dragon Age 2 again now with plenty of DLC and face hacks and all kinds of stuff.

621
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Good times.

622
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Because Fenris.

623
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Of course.

624
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There's a ship that I ship almost as hard as the Garris ship. It is the Fenris ship.

625
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So you must be looking forward very much to this new Dragon Age game.

626
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It better have Fenris in it.

627
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Alright.

628
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I sail the ship of the USS Broody Elf.

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
There you go.

630
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Along with my larger boat, the USS Spiky Alien.

631
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The pagan Jew in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminds us Mass Effect 2 also had Kasumi and Zaid.

632
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
They had no interaction with anybody practically.

633
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I think most of that was on the disc too.

634
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or they crafted it in such a way where they didn't really interact with the others.

635
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Kasumi you definitely use in one part of the suicide mission if you have her.

636
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
She's the best person to go through that tunnel to hit all the...

637
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I always have Tali do that.

638
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Okay.

639
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I guess there are a couple characters you can use, but I always had Kasumi do that.

640
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I always have Kasumi escort the crew back.

641
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Gotcha.

642
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And shoot.

643
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Also I just love Kasumi actually. That was some great DLC.

644
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah she's a fun character.

645
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It really was.

646
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Especially with the Citadel stuff later on.

647
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No she's literally one of my favorite characters in the whole series.

648
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh yeah, same here.

649
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
She's great.

650
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That and her strange addiction to going through people's panty drawer.

651
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I was so happy to see her in 3. But anyway.

652
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah.

653
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We could do a Mass Effect Wang podcast.

654
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
She's such a sassy bitch.

655
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
She's great.

656
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well I remember her. But see. The DLC wasn't just the character.

657
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But you had that whole quest where you went into the mansion.

658
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That was a fun one.

659
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah.

660
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So they didn't just come with the character.

661
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Donovan Hawk with the weird accent.

662
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And I finally figured out what his accent was supposed to be.

663
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Certain region of South Africa.

664
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Ooh.

665
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Since we brought up Mass Effect Wank, you and I.

666
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And we can never get enough of it here on the show.

667
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Squirt squirt squirt.

668
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Sorry Loki, deal with it.

669
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But I hear at PAX East this weekend.

670
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
They did like the voice actors and face actors doing the cosplay live.

671
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And they had like an assemblence of like what.

672
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
They had Ashley's voice actors was there.

673
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah.

674
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Kaden's.

675
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Luciano Costa.

676
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah Luciano Costa. The face model was there.

677
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Twerking on stage.

678
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Drool.

679
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
In.

680
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Drool.

681
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Outfit.

682
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Drool.

683
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hold on. Dab dab dab dab.

684
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Let's see. Who else was there? Samara.

685
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
She's everywhere. She goes to all the conventions.

686
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Rana. What's her name?

687
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah.

688
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And then they had the. I did not know they got the voice actor for Thane.

689
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah.

690
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Oh. Many people that ship The Shepherd Thane were very happy to see that.

691
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I didn't think the mask was all that great. But it was pretty cool to see.

692
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
To see him there.

693
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And then.

694
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
McNamar I think is her last name.

695
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Mm hmm.

696
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Rana. Anyway. She's cool.

697
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I actually. Because you know I have Mass Effecting.

698
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I reposted some of her video tutorials for doing a sorry cosplay.

699
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Nice.

700
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But I've been. I've been following.

701
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The.

702
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Delightful Mr. Costa since he created his Tumblr.

703
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Mm hmm.

704
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And.

705
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
He was putting up lots of.

706
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Progress pictures about making the body dummy.

707
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And working on the pieces of the armor and everything.

708
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It was pretty cool.

709
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah. That guy like. He didn't.

710
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't think that guy really realized the Mass Effect fandom.

711
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Until probably after the Mass Effect 3 stuff died down a little bit.

712
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
All that controversy.

713
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And then he was like.

714
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Wait a minute. There's all these people that like.

715
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
He reposted Caden porn week.

716
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh yeah.

717
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
There's all these people that worship Caden out there.

718
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And I could make money off of this.

719
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Well and then he also went in.

720
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I could get a free trip to Boston.

721
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Well he also went in and.

722
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
There was a.

723
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Posted a.

724
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Kind of a mini photo shoot meeting with the voice actor.

725
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Who's a.

726
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Raphael Sparge who's also on Once Upon a Time.

727
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Mm hmm.

728
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He's chimney cricket.

729
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yep.

730
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I actually really like him.

731
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
But.

732
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
All right.

733
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The.

734
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That was pretty.

735
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The too much Mass Effect wank alarm is going off here in studio and seven.

736
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So we need to move on with some news.

737
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Loki.

738
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
All right.

739
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,800
So it was inevitable that there is going to be another Disney infinity game coming at

740
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,400
some point.

741
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,160
And with that they kind of tease their first bit of information on that.

742
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,480
Including these that Marvel Studios is going to be adding characters to the game.

743
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,120
And so one of the characters that of course they show in there is Captain America.

744
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:37,380
And so Marvel characters will be coming into Disney Infinity 2.0 which I'm guessing is

745
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,360
coming out later this year.

746
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,040
So I don't know.

747
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,600
I guess that's just inevitable.

748
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,680
And I'm sure we'll see some stuff for like Star Wars stuff soon in fact actually kind

749
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
of a little Easter egg.

750
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,240
If you did happen to be crazy enough to buy every single character for Disney infinity

751
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,400
one of the items that unlocks at the very end is a light saber.

752
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,600
Oh geez.

753
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,880
They're just they're just teasing you now.

754
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,480
So well you would think though if they win does episode seven come out is that next year.

755
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:19,880
That's 2015 I think or set was it 15 this thing is 2015 but it's holiday right.

756
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Yeah.

757
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
Because they had to bump back the Warcraft movie.

758
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
It's holiday.

759
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,400
So I think I think Disney Infinity 3.0 will bring in the Star Wars characters because

760
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,120
that's still a big thing.

761
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,600
But I wouldn't be surprised if you see a little bit of teasing just to you know because the

762
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
hype machine is going to start rolling in later this year.

763
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,080
The first trailer think about it the trailer for episode seven you're going to see this

764
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:48,100
Christmas think about it and it'll just be like 30 seconds of just a look just a little

765
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,760
bit of wonder if it's going to be like you know was episode one where people would actually

766
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,320
walk and just they'd go buy a ticket to the movie just to watch the trailer.

767
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,640
What was it like the beach or something had the preview for her who does that actually

768
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,080
nowadays because now they have the Internet I guess yeah and they have the Internet when

769
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,920
that's the one we had the Internet but you didn't have really high speed and high speed

770
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,220
and it was still colleges and things like that.

771
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:15,240
So to see it on the big screen you know so there's no YouTube I'm excited about not Disney

772
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,880
Infinity though because I already I already went down that path and not for me I'm not

773
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm too old.

774
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,280
Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com is referencing actually

775
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,540
some of our coverage from E3 2013 over at vognetwork.com because remember we had the

776
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,000
whole thing where you could submit your questions and Bobby would ask them on the show floor

777
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,880
at E3 which we're really hoping comes back this year.

778
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,800
But anyhow one of the questions that got asked over Disney Interactive when Bobby was there

779
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,500
got this response.

780
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,480
As for other properties the game was designed specifically to be able to include properties

781
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,060
that haven't been thought of yet.

782
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,940
So Marvel and Star Wars are definite future possibilities.

783
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,240
Now I think that was to tease us a little bit about the last game but I think we all

784
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,040
knew they'd have to do something to make you want to buy 2.0 because they can't exactly

785
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
do swap force.

786
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
Oh no.

787
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,140
Well they've run out of everything.

788
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,120
Everything is on disk as far as all the assets and stuff are on disk because you have to

789
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
buy the actual characters.

790
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Right.

791
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,220
There's no DLC with that.

792
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,800
So they've run out of stuff.

793
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,320
I knew that they were going to be announcing a new game soon because the last characters

794
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,880
came out at the beginning of this month or at the end of this month.

795
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,720
The last characters came out this month so yeah.

796
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Well we'll see.

797
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,280
It's going to be, it'll print them more money especially if they throw Marvel characters

798
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,280
in there.

799
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,760
Dark Sakura is the allure of Marvel enough to get you to get on board with Disney Infinity?

800
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
No.

801
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,760
Why not?

802
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,240
I'm saving up for MacBook Pro.

803
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,320
So in other words you don't need cheap little plastic figures.

804
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,200
You'd rather have a good computer that you can look up pictures of cheap little plastic

805
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
figures.

806
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,640
To be honest I hardly have time to play the games that I have now.

807
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,960
And I have no interest in, if I'm going to play a Disney game I'd like for it to actually

808
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,920
be a good game and not just a marketing ploy for more money.

809
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,080
Okay.

810
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,640
Shots fired a little bit.

811
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,520
I have heard mixed things on Infinity.

812
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,960
I've heard some mixed things on it but some people seem to really enjoy it.

813
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,560
They're welcome to enjoy it all they want to.

814
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,640
Alright well another game that I'm sure many people will be enjoying and they're going

815
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,040
to enjoy it a little sooner I think than we originally thought.

816
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,920
Smash Brothers.

817
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,640
The Nintendo Direct came out for Smash Brothers.

818
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,040
They still did not reveal the name did they?

819
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,440
They did not say what the actual name is.

820
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,900
We've had Melee.

821
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,940
We've had, what was the other?

822
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,380
Well just Smash Brothers was the original.

823
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,460
So maybe this one's going to be Punch in the Face.

824
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,460
I don't know.

825
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,260
Smash Brothers Punch to the Face.

826
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,340
Smash Brothers Boot to the Head.

827
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:02,460
There is Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U that are both coming this year.

828
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,620
The 2015 delays thankfully proved to be false.

829
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:10,400
And get this, Smash Brothers 3DS will arrive in the summer.

830
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,880
It's going to be coming out this summer.

831
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,320
Because they want you to buy both versions.

832
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,840
Exactly and the minute I heard that I said, oh that is so fucking smart.

833
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,360
Because if they release the Wii U one first and then the 3DS one later, I bet a bunch

834
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,880
of people would buy it on Wii U but I'm not sure as many people would buy it on 3DS.

835
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,200
But now that they're doing it this way, you're going to have tons of people getting on the

836
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,240
hype with the 3DS version and then they'll also buy that Wii U version that they can

837
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,840
play in tournaments and stuff later on in the winter.

838
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,800
So that was one of the big pieces of news right there.

839
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,320
Those two games will not come out the same day.

840
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,440
They're going to be spaced out a little bit there so interesting.

841
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,600
Also some new characters were announced for Smash Brothers.

842
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,900
Yoshi was confirmed but I mean, you know, come on.

843
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,360
No actual new characters is all returning stuff.

844
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,360
Well, no.

845
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,720
There is one new one because there was Charizard.

846
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,160
Which Charizard was part of the Pokemon trainer last time but he was not his own character.

847
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,280
I don't think he is his own character.

848
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,960
I thought they were just talking about Pokemon.

849
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
Nope.

850
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,960
He is his own character.

851
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,080
Charizard is his own character as is Greninja is now his own character which is a new.

852
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,120
It's the Pokemon X and Y representative.

853
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,220
It's Froakie's fully evolved form.

854
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,320
So Greninja which caught a lot of people by surprise.

855
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,560
Some people are thinking because of Greninja's appearance this means you're not going to

856
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,960
be seeing any Lucario or maybe some of the other Pokemon.

857
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,480
Some people are thinking Jigglypuff has been cut at this point because you have these other

858
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,240
playable Pokemon.

859
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:45,000
What's interesting about who is showing up is who is not showing up.

860
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,580
Because there are still some characters we don't have confirmed.

861
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,320
We do not have Ness confirmed.

862
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,000
We do not have Captain Falcon confirmed.

863
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,160
Game & Watch not confirmed.

864
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Falcon is going to be there.

865
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
I mean, come on.

866
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
It's like a staple.

867
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,480
But when was the last time there was an F-Zero game?

868
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,480
It doesn't matter.

869
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,600
It's kind of synonymous with, you know.

870
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,480
Well and hopefully Virtual Console.

871
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,960
You know it's also pushing Virtual Console.

872
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,080
Did they confirm Pit?

873
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,640
I don't know if they did confirm him either.

874
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,840
So I don't remember.

875
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,520
I'm sure chatters will correct me in a heartbeat if I'm wrong.

876
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,120
I thought that they showed Pit.

877
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
Maybe.

878
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,120
I don't know.

879
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
I just know I was a fan.

880
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
But yeah.

881
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,080
I'm curious to see what that final roster looks like because it seems like there's a

882
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,680
lot of characters they haven't confirmed.

883
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,000
And I kind of think there's still one more third party character to come.

884
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:37,400
Because we've heard the rumblings that Namco Bandai has been assisting with this, you know,

885
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
the games.

886
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
Oh good.

887
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Great Pac-Man.

888
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
How could Pac-Man not be another character?

889
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,600
If Namco is truly involved, Pac-Man as a character seems like such a given.

890
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,400
Like it has to be a thing.

891
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,720
I don't know how that would work.

892
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,920
I've never thought of Pac-Man as much of a fighter like that.

893
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,480
They'll have him as a stupid like Pac-Man in the Ghostly Adventures character.

894
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Yeah like the cartoon.

895
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,480
The cartoon or whatever.

896
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,160
Well, Pac-Man also shows up in the driving as well.

897
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,960
And you might see Inky, Binky, Pinky and Clyde making an appearance.

898
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,960
It would be cool if they had other characters like Dig Dug or something like that.

899
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Oh!

900
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,440
Actually Dig Dug is a really good possibility.

901
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,560
That would be hilarious to get to pump the characters up and watch them go boom.

902
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,240
You know what I think they should do?

903
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,240
Ridge Racer car.

904
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,120
I know it's so out there but you know.

905
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,080
Ridge Racer has not been on Wii U so that would be perfect.

906
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,600
Ok Darktits Studio confirms that Pit is back after all.

907
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,440
My bad, my bad.

908
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
So there you go.

909
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,200
And I did like how they said that they were going to not have like some of the costume

910
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,840
changes or whatever for characters or that they were going to be there.

911
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,840
Yeah!

912
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,760
The Metroid Prime or Samus Zero suit will be, which is actually Metroid Zero Mission,

913
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
sorry.

914
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,280
It will be it's own character which is basically like they're not putting Bayonetta in the

915
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,320
game but they're putting that in the game.

916
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,720
And then they are doing Sheik.

917
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,480
I don't know if you say controversial but a lot of people were not expecting Sheik and

918
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,120
Zelda to be separated into two separate characters and that is something that's happening as

919
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,120
well.

920
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,720
Alright so I'm getting linked to the official roster of characters that is in the game.

921
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,560
And I guess Lucario was confirmed.

922
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:24,120
I swear Shane, I swear Shane told me that he was not in the game.

923
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,280
He lied to me.

924
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,120
Totally lied to me.

925
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,440
But some of the other characters of course have been confirmed for the game.

926
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,300
The Animal Crossing villager, the Wii Fit trainers, Rosalina, Megaman, Little Mac.

927
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,640
So there are some really cool new characters that have been confirmed for the game.

928
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,240
So and I guess Pit has been confirmed.

929
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,740
I want the Excitebike dude.

930
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,740
That would be it.

931
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,740
That would be it.

932
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,960
He fights with his motorcycle.

933
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,640
Or the Unir- Yeah Rob, it's Lucario.

934
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:59,820
They need to totally add the Uniracer unicycle, that'd be awesome.

935
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,700
Or like the Stunt Race FX character.

936
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,700
So many things.

937
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,380
Yeah they're saying it's Lucario.

938
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,940
Excuse, sorry, sorry Pokemon character I really don't give two shits about and don't play

939
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,940
in the game ever so.

940
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,540
Well I know they have like lots of Pokeballs now and they have the Master Pokeballs that

941
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,860
are in there and I just don't care.

942
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,740
Well and also there's kind of too many Pokemon at this point.

943
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,860
Like if you're going to make that many Pokemon playable character just have a freaking Pokemon

944
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,860
fighting game.

945
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,500
They tried to do that remember?

946
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Well that's right.

947
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,980
I still have a copy of Stadium.

948
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:39,480
Alright well there was another Nintendo Direct this week and not just one dedicated to Smash

949
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,340
Brothers but Tomodachi Life also got a Nintendo Direct this week.

950
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,940
Now this is a series that's been out in Japan for a little while but Nintendo has said they're

951
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,460
going to bring more titles kind of you know globally than they have in the past and so

952
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:59,060
we're going to get Tomodachi Life in the US and Europe on June 6th.

953
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:03,880
This game was that Life Simulator game there's a little controversy about it about a year

954
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,780
ago or so when you were able to I guess through some type of exploit in the game have a gay

955
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,020
relationship because you get married in the game and you have a gay relationship in the

956
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:19,260
game and Nintendo ended up patching it out or I don't know they basically said that wasn't

957
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,020
supposed to happen and it kind of made them look a little bit like they didn't you know

958
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,020
but I think a lot was lost in translation with that I don't think necessarily Nintendo

959
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,140
is trying to be like anti whatever whatever but I think they were just like no no like

960
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,580
this was not you know something that was supposed to be happening in the game.

961
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:42,340
They could pull a DC and say no one can get married and while they're at it no completely

962
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,700
bash their female characters and writers.

963
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,140
I don't think Nintendo wants to do that I don't think you want a lot of points you know

964
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:57,660
what Tomodachi means hmm means friend oh that's nice that looked fucking weird yeah the whole

965
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:05,220
direct was a little bit insane wasn't it a little bit that's cool going to our chat room

966
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:10,060
over at live.vognetwork.com Akuma JP is in our chat room and he of course is from Japan

967
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,660
and he says Tomodachi life was big a while but guess we got sick.

968
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,420
So it sounds like it was something that we're finally getting something that was big in

969
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,500
Japan like a few years ago but they're already over it but now we're getting their sloppy

970
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,380
seconds so enjoy that happened seeming happened with the wind on and then they whitewashed

971
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:36,780
it and Para Para you really want to think about it all right let's move on Dark Sakura.

972
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:42,140
Well you know we discussed about the game spy going down this was be shutting down

973
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:48,100
with player services on May 31st so there's lots of games that are going to have no multiplayer

974
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:53,520
and there are 800 different developers and publishers that were using it including Capcom

975
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:59,540
Nintendo EA Epic Ubisoft and Konami.

976
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:06,600
So I actually a question was asked of EA if they were going to be doing anything different

977
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,480
for their Battlefield franchises and something came out on Twitter saying we're working on

978
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,280
transitioning those games after the shutdown so you'll still be able to play them and later

979
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,060
on put out a statement says we're working on finding a transition but we still have

980
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,320
technical hurdles to overcome we will make an announcement when there is news to share

981
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,520
so they're trying to work on a work around and redirect for servers so that they can

982
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,800
get their games working.

983
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,560
So I guess that's something good EA has done.

984
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:38,440
Yeah that's hopefully some good news to come from that that they're able to get those games

985
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,600
working although you know I don't know I don't know how popular but I guess if it's like

986
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,540
we're talking battlefield and stuff those games are still pretty popular but I would

987
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,840
think they'd want to shift most people to the new one but if they can get their hooks

988
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,660
in and get them on origin then you know they can push all those ads for the new games so

989
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:01,440
I guess that's that's incentive enough to do it try to sell people on the upgrades right.

990
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,680
Well I'm just glad that at least they're addressing it you know.

991
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,160
All right well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates let's see

992
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,200
what games are coming out that they might pull online support for in a year.

993
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Loki what about here in the US?

994
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,520
Well I hope it's not pulled in a year but Trials Fusion they have a disc version of

995
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:23,600
the game coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and you may be wondering why should I

996
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
buy it on disc?

997
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,880
Well it includes a season pass with it so it's 40 bucks.

998
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,720
2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

999
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,600
Conception 2 Children of the Seven Stars on 3DS and Vita and that is it.

1000
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
That's it.

1001
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,320
Slow week.

1002
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,320
All right let's go over to Japan and we're gonna check out some of the releases over

1003
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,960
there it doesn't look like there's anything really on PlayStation 4 Xbox One this week

1004
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,360
because I know Final Fantasy 14 was the big release on PlayStation 4 but that just happened.

1005
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,840
So that takes us over to the PlayStation 3 and actually it doesn't look like they have

1006
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,280
anything this week on the PlayStation 3 there's no releases until the 24th when we get games

1007
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,040
like Muv Luv Photon Flowers.

1008
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,040
Muv Luv's back.

1009
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,040
There's a new Muv Luv game coming out next week so we'll talk a little more in depth

1010
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,600
about that next week because that's on the 24th.

1011
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,160
But at least some of the other systems Wii U doesn't have anything this week either.

1012
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,800
They don't have anything till next week.

1013
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
How about the 3DS?

1014
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,400
Okay the 3DS has some things.

1015
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,200
Gaikuten, Saiban, 123, Naruhodou Selection.

1016
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,920
You know that is right?

1017
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
No I don't.

1018
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,400
That's a Capcom.

1019
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,800
That's um, um, um.

1020
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
Oh it's Ace Attorney.

1021
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
It's all your game.

1022
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Yeah.

1023
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,760
It's Ace Attorney.

1024
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,360
So there's a new one of those coming out?

1025
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,320
I thought they were done with that series.

1026
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Apparently not.

1027
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
Hmm.

1028
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,880
Oh no it says selection so maybe it could be a best of or something I wonder if it's

1029
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,480
like a compilation or something like that.

1030
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,800
Well that is out in regular and limited edition on the 17th of April.

1031
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,520
Also Meitante Conan Phantom Rhapsody is out this week.

1032
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:15,800
Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode Yokubari Sengen Tokimiki Up comes out this week and that is

1033
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,520
from Nintendo themselves.

1034
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,600
I've got to know what Wagamama Fashion is here.

1035
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,360
I guess it's, oh god, look at the box art for this game.

1036
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,640
It's very pink and it's this girl and she's holding a purse.

1037
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:38,180
That looks like the cover of every shoujo manga compilation that comes out ever.

1038
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,940
And it looks like it is just like a fashion design game.

1039
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:45,000
It's like Nintendogs but for fashion people.

1040
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,440
And instead of dogs and cats you dress people.

1041
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,000
Oh it even has loli style.

1042
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So that's kind of cool.

1043
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Okay I want it.

1044
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,840
I have a birthday next weekend.

1045
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,840
You don't want the Disney Animal Crossing game but you won't want the mama fashion.

1046
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
No I want Tomodachi Life.

1047
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Alright.

1048
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,640
That's not until June though.

1049
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,640
Okay fine get me Disney.

1050
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,640
Alright.

1051
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,160
Actually I still want Bravely You to Fall but hey.

1052
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,120
Oh I forgot that you didn't have that.

1053
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,840
That's okay I don't have time to play anything anyway.

1054
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Make time.

1055
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,840
Just kidding.

1056
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,640
Alright that really does it for releases over in Japan this week so let's go to the UK.

1057
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,560
We have some stuff.

1058
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,460
On the 14th is Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn for PS4.

1059
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,960
On the 15th Mac's The Curse of Brotherhood.

1060
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,600
Pure Chess for PlayStation 4 and War of the Vikings on PC.

1061
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,840
On the 16th we have Sly trilogy.

1062
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,680
The 17th we have Hitman Go for iOS.

1063
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:48,240
We have a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil for Xbox 360 and PS3.

1064
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,880
And The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 for PC.

1065
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,820
That is it.

1066
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,280
Some folks in chat by the way telling us some more information about the Phoenix Wright

1067
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,980
game I talked about in Japan this week.

1068
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,560
It's Phoenix Wright 1, 2, 3.

1069
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:07,080
It's a re-release with slightly better graphics because it's on the 3DS now.

1070
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,960
Another remastering basically but this time a handheld game.

1071
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,600
There you go.

1072
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:17,760
I don't know if that is coming out over here in the states or not.

1073
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,560
I would hope so but not everything necessarily makes it over here.

1074
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,880
Alright just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1075
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,880
Loki?

1076
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:35,380
Alright well unfortunately Sega Europe has seen some layoffs and apparently they said

1077
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:43,260
a limited number of redundancies have been removed due to a restructuring of Sega America

1078
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,860
Sonic and Mobile divisions.

1079
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,340
And they're saying they're in the process of consolidating certain functions of both

1080
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:56,280
of those departments within Sega of America where the management and production for those

1081
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,780
areas business reside.

1082
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:03,300
And as part of the strategy a limited number of redundancies have taken effect in our European

1083
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:09,900
office based in London so that's too bad.

1084
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,340
That's never fun to hear about layoffs and you know when it's somebody cool like Sega

1085
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,100
it makes it even harder to hear that so didn't they just go through some layoffs not that

1086
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,100
long ago?

1087
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,900
Well yeah I think what they're doing is because what they're probably doing is just trying

1088
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,380
to cut the fat and so you know people have pretty much the same job position since they're

1089
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,120
consolidating stuff.

1090
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:36,560
They're just removing those I guess those workers because they don't need them.

1091
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,360
I mean they're not releasing as many games anymore so yeah less bodies are needed.

1092
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,480
You know but they need those bodies to who's going to make Shenmue 3?

1093
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,440
Well they need a lot of extra bodies too because who else is going to add all the extra leg

1094
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,720
for you know Sonic?

1095
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:57,760
Right alright let's see let's talk about the PlayStation Now beta because PlayStation

1096
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,580
Now that beta is still going on.

1097
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:05,180
I haven't got to see it myself yet but some people I know are in it and I hear it doesn't

1098
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:09,300
really work that great that you still get a lot of artifacting and there is a little

1099
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:15,860
bit of a delay but I suppose that depends on where you are but maybe there will be some

1100
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:21,780
improvements as we go to version 2.0 because version 2.0 is out and I think this is all

1101
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:25,940
still under NDA but with as many people as are in this beta it's all it's all getting

1102
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,260
out there and the news is getting out into the blogs and things like that so the update

1103
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:35,860
was 42 megs and there are 19 games playable now in this new PlayStation Now beta that

1104
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:42,300
includes things like Shadow of the Colossus, Dead Island, Payday the Heist, I think those

1105
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,540
are all in the original one.

1106
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:49,500
I don't remember seeing Disgaea 4 before though or Dead or Alive 5 or Mat Hazard or Earth

1107
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,180
Defense Force Insect Armageddon so that's.

1108
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,020
Who would play Mat Hazard?

1109
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,260
That game was terrible.

1110
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,420
That's when it was like oh it's a video game character and he's become like self-aware

1111
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:07,860
now and he's going back and fighting all of his old, you know, old villains from different

1112
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:11,460
games and stuff and it was supposed to be all cheesy and funny but it was dumb.

1113
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,420
Well now it's worth pointing out that some games were removed from the first beta so

1114
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:22,020
if you were trying to play more Ninja Gaiden 3 or Papo and Yo or Killzone 3 those games

1115
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,740
were removed so they're mixing it around a little bit with PlayStation Now but apparently

1116
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,540
you can still unlock trophies and things like that so that's cool.

1117
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,340
Well you can play Puzzle Quest Galactrix too.

1118
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,420
That's the one Puzzle Quest game that kind of flopped.

1119
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,620
It wasn't very good.

1120
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,180
Yeah they changed the whole formula from the match 3 and it didn't really work out the

1121
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,460
same way it was just a different game.

1122
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,780
Whatever happened to that series Puzzle Quest?

1123
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:49,620
There was one and two in Galactrix and then I mean they were out on every stinking platform

1124
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,620
but we haven't really seen anything in that forever.

1125
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,620
It's taking a nap.

1126
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,620
I guess so.

1127
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,260
Kind of sad.

1128
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:01,620
Alright well let's go back to the past a little bit and check out some classic games in a

1129
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,660
segment we call the Classic Game of the Week and yeah I used Plural tonight we're gonna

1130
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:12,020
check out some classic games in tonight's segment because Dark Sakura when she dives

1131
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:16,380
into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be playing this this week she

1132
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:20,660
does things her way and if she wants to do more than one game she's gonna fucking do

1133
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,660
it.

1134
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,020
Well I'm doing a trilogy they're all related to each other although the one I wanted to

1135
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,060
focus on is the last game in the series.

1136
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,980
Alright fair enough so Dark Sakura what is the classic games of the week?

1137
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:38,660
The classic games start with a particular game called Final Justice that came out in

1138
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,500
1985 for the MSX.

1139
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:47,620
It's done by Pako Fujishima who also designed the sequel game Gartic.

1140
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:53,020
The game after Gartic that rounds out the trilogy is Blaster Burn which after having

1141
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:59,500
played Blaster Burn it honestly is a really really really a superior game but I figured

1142
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,820
I'd just go through a little bit of basic gameplay with Final Justice it really isn't

1143
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:09,420
all that special to look at it's just kind of a fun generic little shooter but really

1144
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:15,940
the whole thing to bring up for that one is the fact that it did spawn Gartic which as

1145
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:22,260
we know Gartic spawned a favorite game of at least two thirds of us in the room.

1146
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,300
Oh wait let me let me switch to the Gartic foot that was all you're gonna say on Final

1147
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,020
Justice all right let me go to Gartic.

1148
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,420
Yeah cause Final Justice is kind of crappy.

1149
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,020
It was basic it was early 80s what you do okay yes Gartic.

1150
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:36,980
Now a lot of this music should sound familiar if I'm gonna turn it up just a little bit.

1151
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:41,980
Sound familiar?

1152
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
Yeah.

1153
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:48,620
Gartic is the one that spawned Gartic Gaiden which we got on the Nintendo as the guardian

1154
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:56,020
legend so Gartic is a weird little game Gartic is you you're sort of like in this series

1155
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:04,820
of mazes and you go and shoot enemies on the screen of all of a particular type and then

1156
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,860
you move on to the next room and you're just sort of navigating this maze where you stop

1157
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:17,060
and shoot things it really is just a weird little game through Gartic you also can buy

1158
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:22,940
your power-ups like extra speed you buy different weaponry and you choose these things before

1159
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:32,860
each stage so it's sort of a very non-traditional kind of shooting game and as you go through

1160
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:38,780
it you can sort of see where elements that it's it puts into practice were split into

1161
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:44,420
the guardian legend you know it's sort of like they combine the corridor theory with

1162
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:48,220
the shooter games and you know the guardian legend I think wasn't that like the first

1163
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:53,940
game I ever reviewed actually no it wasn't one of the first one but it was it was early

1164
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:58,860
on because it's a long-running joke quote-unquote on the show but it's not a joke it's truth

1165
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:04,420
that that was what we believe to be the finest NES game they ever made which in it was it

1166
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:09,340
and it was not really critically well reviewed when it came out so one of those things that

1167
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:15,300
kind of aged better than a lot of NES games did but the the thing with that is that I

1168
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,460
think that they might have realized that they were trying to pack in too much with this

1169
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,340
game I didn't realize the blue lander was in this game yeah it's in here I see it in

1170
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:29,780
a little video this is MSX graphics so it's not you know it's not the same but still but

1171
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:36,400
um but yeah you know this was a really interesting game like I said it spawned a guardian legend

1172
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:43,240
for us which you know for us that's a win-win now what's really what I think the best thing

1173
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:50,240
well I'm gonna say the second best thing to have come out of this trilogy is the game

1174
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:57,600
called a blaster burn blaster burn is a pretty traditional shooter where this game has good

1175
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:04,600
music for the record where basically it's a you just go through it's a standard shooting

1176
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:11,720
game you have your power-ups and you're actually playing this ship called the gardic 2 so it

1177
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:18,720
is a true I think sequel to the gardic series they're kind of you know it can it's not quite

1178
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:24,640
a bullet hell it's just a standard shooter but it's fun and offered some unique features

1179
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,040
and on top of that the music and it was really good your power-ups were fun and it just has

1180
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:36,040
a lot of the fun compile you know what was it was it that that feel of a compile shooter

1181
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,240
without falling back to some of the same old traditions that were in other compile shooting

1182
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,240
games and as you can see I mean we've got like pretty complex backgrounds for the MSX

1183
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:50,240
yeah the graphics are a big step up from even gardic considering they were both on MSX yeah

1184
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:57,840
but this one was the final one that came out in that trilogy now I'll rewind a little bit

1185
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,840
and go back to gardic because I mentioned with my what if I've been playing this week

1186
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,040
that I had another game that I've been playing and that actually is gardic I have that on

1187
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:16,040
iOS so they actually did release gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you made it

1188
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:22,240
gardic it's 99 cents and it's the MSX game you move around and you shoot stuff it's it

1189
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:29,240
controls okay you know about as good as anything on iOS does you know for a shooter but you

1190
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:36,280
know going through these games I really find it a shame that they didn't really see the

1191
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:43,280
light of day over here especially blaster burn because it's it's just a fun little shooter

1192
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:50,480
so I would say anyone if you have an MSX or have access to playing MSX games this is something

1193
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,040
that you should definitely definitely check out you know play through gardic get the roots

1194
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:05,040
for the guardian legend and if you don't own the guardian legend why but I think that everyone

1195
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:12,040
at least if you love a good shooting game you need to play through blaster burn all

1196
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:18,040
right so there you go oh I did have the years for those by the way sure go for it final

1197
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:25,040
justice came out in 1985 and gardic came out you know I'm actually missing the year for

1198
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:32,040
gardic but blaster burn came out in 1990 and that was the last installment in the series

1199
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:39,040
I want to say gardic was 87 because I think guardian legend was 88 or 89 so yeah but I

1200
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:46,040
mean these were compile games I mean they're really great so but and anyone who has you

1201
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:54,040
know an iOS device and has a dollar just go get good by gardic right now do it do it because

1202
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:01,040
I said so all right well there it is your classic game of the week dark sakura picked

1203
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:09,040
the final justice trilogy starting with final justice gardic and then blaster burn this

1204
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:16,040
is a cool name too isn't it blaster burn and look at those boss fights it's pretty fun

1205
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:21,040
all right I better close it up there because we're going to take a break and we're going

welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on april the 13th of 2014 episode 548

1215
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:12,040
of our show already in progress and in part a we talked a little bit about we got a live

1216
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:18,040
report from pax east in a moving vehicle going down 95 back home also from the fantastic

1217
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:23,040
rama over at anime jam session also we talked a little bit about some of the things announced

1218
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,040
at pax east including civilization beyond earth and we're gonna talk about some of the

1219
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,040
other things that were announced a few of them here in this segment we call rapid fire

1220
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:39,040
news right loki that's correct this is kind of cool there's a brand new borderlands game

1221
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:45,040
that was just announced now it's not borderlands 3 but it's borderlands the pre-sequel so that

1222
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,040
puts it in between one and two what's kind of different about this one is it's actually

1223
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,040
going to take place not on pandora but on one of the moons of pandora and so with that

1224
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:02,040
you know there's no oxygen and you actually have to collect oxygen as well as you've you

1225
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:07,040
have the ability to jump very far and you have jetpacks and stuff like that some of

1226
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:12,040
the characters are going to be in it are actually characters that have been in all

1227
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:19,040
the other borderlands games just kind of not necessarily cameos but they've got for example

1228
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,040
athena which is a gladiator type class and she has like some sort of like a shield type

1229
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:33,040
thing that she uses to bounce off damage and stuff and i want to say she was in one of

1230
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,040
the expansions there i just can't remember which one but uh so they have her uh oh she

1231
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:47,040
was uh she was in uh borderlands one and uh they have claptrap which got anybody that's

1232
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:54,040
played uh borderlands knows who claptrap is uh he's a playable character in it also wilhelm

1233
01:19:54,040 --> 01:20:02,040
from borderlands 2 and nisha um so it sounds like it's gonna be pretty interesting i think

1234
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:07,040
it's supposed to be coming out later this year she was nisha was i guess a sheriff of

1235
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:14,040
lynchwood in borderlands 2 uh athena was a former assassin and former crimson last lance

1236
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:21,040
um who was in borderlands 1 wilhelm was one of the bosses in borderlands 2 and claptrap

1237
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:29,040
well he's in everything so um i don't know looks very very cool uh you're supposed to

1238
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:35,040
have i guess um you're gonna be working for captain or not captain jack for handsome jack

1239
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,040
yes captain jack that's a whole different character he'll shag anyone i mean hi captain

1240
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:44,040
jack mission one don't copy that floppy i was thinking of captain jack harkness thank

1241
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:50,040
you mission two go left go right go pick up the circle okay like there's like three people

1242
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:55,040
listening we're gonna get that joke all right so um yeah handsome jack says who you're working

1243
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:03,040
for in that it's kind of his rise to power in this um this game here so uh interesting i very

1244
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:09,040
very excited to check this out whenever it comes out i'm guessing probably later this year uh then

1245
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:17,040
along with that atlas is funding a game they didn't quite get kick started it's called citizens

1246
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:22,040
of earth and what's kind of cool about citizens of earth is it plays very much like i guess

1247
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:30,040
earthbound and um sort of a game where you recruit a bunch of people and they have like uh

1248
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:40,040
you know it looked it almost reminded me of the wonderful 101 but i think it's it's not exactly

1249
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,040
gonna play out like that but they i guess they have maybe sort of like sui coden because they

1250
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:50,040
have 40 different people that you can recruit in the game um and they're saying they're even

1251
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:58,040
gonna create one uh the 41st one uh for the game i guess as a contest allowing fans to um design

1252
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:04,040
that character and it's uh supposed to be in development for playstation 4 vita 3ds wii u and

1253
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:12,040
pc and supposed to be out in september and then this is kind of a strange crossover but you

1254
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:18,040
remember that game dive kick well there's going to be a cameo from johnny gatt from the saints

1255
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:22,040
rose series he's going to be a playable character in that and i guess that's supposed to be coming

1256
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:28,040
i guess later on to the playstation 4 and xbox one versions more reason for people to dive and

1257
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:34,040
kick yes as well as i guess the playstation 3 vita and steam ones um and of course the playstation

1258
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:42,040
4 version and xbox one versions aren't out yet but i guess it was coming later on so pretty cool

1259
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:48,040
um man see see that that would be well it wouldn't be exactly like saints row with the whole

1260
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:54,040
um you know where you create your own characters and stuff but man playing a playable johnny gatt

1261
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,040
saints row game would be pretty awesome though even if you couldn't create your own character

1262
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:02,040
you never know they're they've got to announce something they've got to come ahead they're

1263
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:08,040
gonna have something at e3 they need to reboot that series we'll see we'll see we'll see oh

1264
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,040
all right well earlier in the show we talked about smash brothers so let's talk about the

1265
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:18,040
cheap knockoff version of smash brothers playstation all-stars battle royale sorry was that was that

1266
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,040
statement too truthful for some of you sorry well there is some news to report on playstation all

1267
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:28,040
stars battle royale even though it's boop boop i don't think it's even being sold anymore it's

1268
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,040
just right i don't know it's off shelves did they finally just give it away in playstation plus i

1269
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,040
don't think they ever did just give it away did they i don't know well whatever here's the thing

1270
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,040
if if you if you're a big fan of playstation all-stars battle royale first i'm really sorry

1271
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:45,040
for what i said but second you're going to get a new patch uh that's going to do a hundred percent

1272
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,040
balance tweaking lots and lots and lots of balance between that's pretty much all the patch does

1273
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:55,040
uh so uh the throw system in the game has been overhauled you can manually disengage a timed

1274
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:01,040
super move double jumps can no longer be changed so you can get a new patch you can get a new

1275
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:07,040
double jumps can no longer be chained off of certain types of attacks and certain recovery

1276
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:13,040
animations and so forth also alternate costumes for isaac and zeus which were the dlc expansion

1277
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:19,040
pack the graveyard pack uh it's currently on sale through april 24th for only a dollar 99

1278
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,040
if you missed out on these characters somehow if you you know haven't played the game in over

1279
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:27,040
nine months like most people i gotta be honest i'm surprised that they had an update for this at

1280
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,640
all because this game came out like two years ago i don't think there's really been an update

1281
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,400
in like a year on this um could it be one of those out of the blue things could it be that they're

1282
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:42,560
doing a new game but like maybe it wouldn't be you know a purchase game maybe free to play or

1283
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:48,320
something yeah are they gonna are would they go up against smash brothers with a free to play game

1284
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:52,480
that would be a pretty ballsy counter move especially considering the first game was kind of

1285
01:24:53,280 --> 01:25:00,720
well it was there i don't i don't think it was bad i don't i didn't play it but it looked fun

1286
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,520
well it looked fun but well some of these balance issues might actually help out quite a bit

1287
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:14,640
actually so i don't know hey you know what diablo 3 was saved with the patch like a year and a half

1288
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:19,200
after the game came out i don't know anything is possible maybe a bit a bit of like an elitist

1289
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,840
here but like with all like the talk of pokemon and stuff and all the new pokemon that they're

1290
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,920
adding to smash bros it just kind of made me like yeah i don't really care you know it's just

1291
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,680
i don't know there's a lot of nintendo stuff i just don't give a shit about yeah if we lost

1292
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:42,560
ness so we can get greninja not happy sorry about it if you disagree but not happy like there was

1293
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,560
enough damn pokemon in the game or you know char char has been in the game before come on

1294
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,560
the pokemon trainer last time around remember you get three different pokemon why couldn't they

1295
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:58,560
just bring the pokemon trainer back with three different pokemon oh it's just just not possible

1296
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,080
for whatever reason uh let's see however in the nintendo camp there's some other games to look

1297
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,440
forward to including nes remix 2 which looks like it's going to be all the things you loved about

1298
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,680
nes remix 1 but this time with actually good games that we remember from the past so no more

1299
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,840
golf an urban champion and all that crap but it looks like there's going to be some actually

1300
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:26,240
pretty awesome games and there's also going to be a new 1990 nintendo world championship mode

1301
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:32,000
which we talked about previously on the show but there are some more details there um super mario

1302
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
brothers is one of the three games in in the mode as it was in 1990 but now it will be mario brothers

1303
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,360
3 and dr mario will be the other games and what will happen is that you'll do three successive

1304
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:49,120
score based challenges to get a total score these scores can also go over to me verse and that's

1305
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:54,800
how you can you know show off your ep and all your friends and all that however you have to own the

1306
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,480
first nes remix game to get championship mode in nes remix 2 because uh super mario brothers was

1307
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:06,960
in the first game so so terrible that they can't get rad racer i know but it wasn't it wasn't an

1308
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:12,880
nes game or if it wasn't it wasn't a nintendo game it was a square game squaresoft back in the day

1309
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,880
before they did final fantasy hey you know what i'd be totally 100 fine with square bringing

1310
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,560
rad racer back i know it would be that would be kind of awesome that would be fucking awesome

1311
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,720
especially with the hyper realistic graphics they do in like final fantasy 13 15 and stuff uh let's

1312
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:37,120
see uh some of the games to look forward to an nes remix to kid icharis kirby's adventure metroid

1313
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:43,280
see the good stuff you remember from nes good times that'd be exciting too bad tetra tetra

1314
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:49,440
so i don't think nintendo can make tetris games anymore that would include the old stuff i don't

1315
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,200
know all right now uh some news has come out about a game that was cancelled at lucas arts

1316
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,680
when that company was shuttered and uh this is kind of surprising because it was a nintendo title

1317
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:05,840
for the wii u the nintendo 3ds and the original wii and that was a darth maul game it was going

1318
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,400
to be a game all about darth maul and kind of his backstory and so forth this game was actually

1319
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,400
i'm sorry it wasn't cancelled when lucas arts was shuttered it was cancelled in 2011

1320
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,120
so the game never did come out uh the main character was darth maul in the game

1321
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:25,040
and red fly was doing the development and uh it was going to be a multi-platform release at one

1322
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:31,840
point and um nintendo didn't want to make it a first party project i guess at one point uh but

1323
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,080
the game was supposed to explore the origin story of mal's transformation into a sith lord it was

1324
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:41,680
going to be a stealth action game george lucas had actually changed the direction of the game

1325
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:47,760
so sounds like did he yeah i know right that probably let's be honest that's probably what

1326
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,800
ended up ruining you know i'm glad that you made a game about darth maul but i think jar jar binks

1327
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,480
needs to be in this somewhere now now jar jar binks is in star tours and that's actually the

1328
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:05,280
best part so there like i said things can get patched years after the fact to make them better

1329
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,960
it happens once in a while all right dark sakura what do you have over there doesn't happen enough

1330
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,160
you should have you can't patch my childhood rob you should have flung your meatloaf at

1331
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,640
george lucas when you had the chance i should have well here's other things that can be flung

1332
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:26,800
how about the stuff in cat lateral damage which i still want to play game of the year contender

1333
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:33,440
right here well it actually did um win the people's choice in indie prototype awards

1334
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,600
for the 2014 mass digi game challenge and so right now it actually has been announced as part

1335
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:45,920
of the fire hose games accelerator slash incubation program so that means that it will get the much

1336
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:52,240
needed help it does to be out there and available for more people to play also um ea sports is

1337
01:29:52,240 --> 01:30:01,920
resurrecting the dead they've teased their mystery fighter is bruce lee and um i didn't realize bruce

1338
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:09,600
lee did ufc apparently not well they brought him back from the dead so we have zombie digital bruce

1339
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:16,960
lee kicking people in the face um however if you have pre-ordered i hate that word pre-order if you

1340
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:26,720
have ordered the game then you get him as a day one unlock and then last but not least um sony

1341
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:33,760
has confirmed of another remaster who last of us is getting a remaster treatment for ps4

1342
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:41,680
um they have a release window of summer 2014 and yeah let's say that's the list what list

1343
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:47,120
of games that are being remastered oh yeah for real well this one was rumored for a long time

1344
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:53,680
and then they finally came out and said it's happening and we're all like no shit you know

1345
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,440
this makes me really happy i skipped it on playstation 3 it was one of those games i

1346
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,400
always meant to get around and play and i never did but now i'm like oh

1347
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,560
well see i knew all along that would happen

1348
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:10,720
you know what i was gonna say uh you know kind of going back to the whole ea sports eoc thing

1349
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:16,000
the game looks really good as far as like you know the presentation the visual stuff on it

1350
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,000
i really wish that like they would just make like a good arcade style fighting game because they

1351
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
have an engine that can really pull it off but you know they use it for all the simulation

1352
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:36,080
boxing and ufc and i guess they tried it with def jam icon but yeah back to the ufc thing

1353
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,760
sure because we have some comments in our chat room at live i think it's tacky i think it's

1354
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,480
fucking tacky yeah i was like we're gonna put bruce lee in it so that we can get more money

1355
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:50,160
because everyone wants to be bruce lee no it's fucking tacky everybody doesn't want to be bruce

1356
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:55,280
lee i mean here's the comment in the chat at live.com tiger claw says bringing in bruce lee

1357
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,680
in the ufc is kind of an unfair fight he will beat everyone well this is true but it's still

1358
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:05,360
fucking tacky yeah you know it's like for example i put it along the same lines that they did the

1359
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:12,320
audrey hetburn commercials those were it was a really cool commercial the cg was very well done

1360
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:21,120
i still thought that it was kind of tacky you know using the image of a dead person to promote

1361
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:26,960
you know your chocolate or your whatever you know i think that

1362
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,280
he at least should have his own game well that's actually what dungeon buster says in our chat

1363
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,920
room at live.vognore.com dungeon buster says bruce lee still needs a good game maybe him and

1364
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,360
ufc might be as good as we can hope for at this point that bruce lee game for the xbox was just

1365
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:48,000
um and then nemesis 47 says the bruce lee game on the super nintendo was decent ish

1366
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,560
so i mean this isn't bruce lee's first time being adapted in a video game but i would like enter the

1367
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:59,360
dragon the game i just think now you know a game dedicated to bruce lee that that would be cool

1368
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,280
bringing back for ufc that's just tacky how about a game dedicated to brandon lee

1369
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:12,480
then again oh yeah that'd be awesome then again and see this is where you want to talk tacky

1370
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:18,960
let's talk about the fact they're remaking the crow excuse you no excuse all that no excuse for

1371
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,640
that as if the sequels weren't bad enough but okay and this has been brought to my attention

1372
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:30,160
to not in chat but earlier today like um dan has been talking all up and down about the

1373
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,920
wrestlemania 2k14 which granted looks really cool it recreates like some of the classic

1374
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:44,080
matches some of the people in the game they're dead however they were part of that genre they

1375
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:49,280
were wrestlers you have macho man in there now ultimate warriors dead but you know i did watch

1376
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,520
the commercial he did for the game it was pretty funny is andre the giant in there i loved him i

1377
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,840
think andre the giants in there even if you didn't like wrestling you loved andre the giant because

1378
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,640
you probably love the princess bride if you hate wrestling and the princess bride get out of my

1379
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,240
world you're just that person who doesn't have fun at anything you're probably you you probably

1380
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,280
don't like video games either so i doubt you're listening to this show to be honest

1381
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:17,200
what was what was it that pat and oswalt said you're gonna hate everything and die angry

1382
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:25,520
is that a song no it was it was one of his a stand-up comedy but i mean but bruce lee

1383
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:32,320
did never did ufc i don't even know if he would like the concept of ufc

1384
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:39,920
i mean it's different for i don't know i just i totally i think it's tacky that's me uh now

1385
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,480
some folks agree with you in chat about the enter the dragon game but tiger claw suggests game of

1386
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:49,360
death game of death would be awesome and dungeon buster says a lot of fans would love that or game

1387
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:56,720
of death uh and nemesis 47 confirming that andre is in wwe 2k14 you know you know what i need to

1388
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:05,120
get have a bruce lee movie night and just watch game of death and just game of death uh gamer girl

1389
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:10,720
says i don't really like wrestling but i love princess bride does that count no absolutely it

1390
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:15,760
counts no i said i said you you you even if you don't like wrestling you love andre the giant

1391
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,000
because of the princess bride well how's this for funny now that we're bringing up the princess

1392
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,560
bride what well you know how awesome julian is yes becky's son yeah he was born with an extra

1393
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:32,160
thumb yeah he had six fingers on his right hand i know that's great so we can just say you know

1394
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,840
good thing that that was taken care of or else he could go around murdering people with sword

1395
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,560
and aniga montoya might come from and he's too young to be murdering people not until he's 14

1396
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,600
and i know becky's listening so becky tell julian not to murder anyone until he's at least 14

1397
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,000
and then to do it with a really pretty sword but never the guy that made the sword because then his

1398
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,560
son will come after him and that'll be all kinds of a nightmare and i will have to just get in

1399
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,840
between that and go no well if becky is listening hey becky hey she was listening earlier we were

1400
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,240
talking about all the mass effect wank oh good and said she wants to be on a mass effect wank show

1401
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:09,760
good good because actually which is funny because when i brought up thane earlier in the show i

1402
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:17,200
thought of becky like it's that like it is like becky's thane wank is so strong i now associate

1403
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:28,720
the two so thane wank well anyway see she she sells the the uss uh green lizard what was what

1404
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,720
was i going to say i i got on a tangent about gamer girl's comment here oh yeah i don't really

1405
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,600
like wrestling but i love princess blight here's the thing i don't obsess with wrestling but i

1406
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:43,440
don't i don't even go so far to say i like wrestling but i don't hate it and i get why

1407
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:49,600
people like wrestling because it soaps for men it's it is it's a testosterone version of doubt

1408
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:56,160
and abby when you look at it how different are the two of them really except maggie smith doesn't

1409
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:01,520
exactly maggie smith is not dropping a pile driver on the rock but god it would be so fucking awesome

1410
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,560
if she did i love maggie smith how about a doubt and abby fighting game i want to see maggie smith

1411
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,240
in ufc 2015 she's gonna have the purse with the brick with a brick in it better yet ben de la crème

1412
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:20,000
as maggie smith let's see i want to i you know what sucks is it it's my birthday coming up and

1413
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,960
i want to get this game for dan just so i can do create a wrestler mode okay okay there's something

1414
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,960
i had to talk about this russell mania 2k14 that is the best feature of the game all right wrap it

1415
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,280
up and then we're going to the frugal question yes all right well you know how the shows have

1416
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:38,800
like their own storylines and everything and this rivalry with that person and and oh girl did you

1417
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,240
hear what the rock did you know oh girl gold dust was in the gym the other day and you wouldn't

1418
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:48,800
believe yeah it's that kind of stuff well you can make up your own is there a podcast where

1419
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,560
drag queens talk about wrestling oh my god this should be a thing this should be a thing

1420
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:01,760
knock down drag out wrestling oh my god and then i saw the undertaker come up and i was like oh

1421
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:11,360
girl no she better don't i could not even so anyway you can loki you even you would have to

1422
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,280
listen to this i think right you don't like wrestling or drag queens but i just thought

1423
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:21,520
i don't like drag queens i just in this way i don't want to watch wrestling and i i don't

1424
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,960
know if i'd really want to hear i mean if i had the if i had to have a choice between you know

1425
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,040
comment you know listening to commenting from the people that actually officiate you know the

1426
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,120
wrestling stuff or drag queens i'd probably pick drag queens that's that's that's that's a fair

1427
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:41,840
that's just like would you rather watch twilight breaking dawn part one or would you rather watch

1428
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:49,120
twilight breaking dawn part one with rift tracks exactly can i finish my point yes please anyway

1429
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:56,960
the wrestlemania 2k14 has a create your own storyline mode and yeah becky says that julian

1430
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,640
thinks we're very silly and she says hearts rob so back see even becky's interrupting me what the

1431
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:14,400
fuck becky hi i mean hi um anyway and julian never say that at school so anyway um you can create

1432
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,280
your own storylines you know with dialogue and everything you can have different events happen

1433
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:28,160
and someone redid the did one called vince russo takes over the wwe and vince russo was the guy

1434
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:38,080
who was responsible for degeneration x and all of the really just wanky era of you know early 2000s

1435
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:44,160
late 90s wrestling so it's actually the funniest thing i've ever seen is the vince russo takes

1436
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:49,840
over for a day because it parodies everything that's wrong with wrestling and that is the

1437
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:57,360
reason to have this game is just to download vince russo's day i can't stop thinking about

1438
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:05,600
drag queens commenting on wrestling i'm sorry you can actually make drag queens in wwe 2k14 yes

1439
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:11,680
you know what mr peanut they made mr peanut they actually had a wrestling challenge in an episode

1440
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:15,840
of rupaul's drag race now that i think about it i think it was a couple seasons ago anyway

1441
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:21,520
aha someone gets it john cena versus mr peanut yes i am not the only one who has seen this

1442
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:28,640
it is the funniest shit i have ever i was cracking up and normally i was like dan's watching another

1443
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:34,960
game you know youtube he's not playing it he just oh my god it's mr peanut uh pretty funny dark

1444
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,960
tetsuya in our chat says down abby wrestling hey there's our next dream game um yeah i would

1445
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,000
support that as well our dream game down abby wrestling yes you know i liked the undertaker

1446
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,320
better when he was in the whole biker thing now that he's gone back to the undead thing is just

1447
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:56,640
so unrealistic oh and i don't understand how did the undead just come up and wrestle

1448
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:05,920
but they're dead what about absolutely what about absolutely fabulous wrestling wrestling all right

1449
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:12,240
we need to move on rapid fire news taking over i'm just glad somebody else's has seen what i'm

1450
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:18,240
talking about are you officially done are you can you officially not even anymore unspent

1451
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,920
then let's get to the frugal question of the week

1452
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,720
take facebook and you take google and you slam those words together and you get frugal

1453
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:42,400
and we ask a question of our fan communities over at facebook.com orange launch radio and

1454
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:48,240
google.com plus orange launch radio we ask questions of our fan communities there every

1455
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,960
week and this week is all about the remastering of games that we were mentioning a minute ago

1456
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,720
after much speculation it was confirmed this week that the last of us is being remastered

1457
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:04,240
and re-released on the playstation 4 is there a game from the last era of consoles like 360

1458
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:09,520
playstation 3 we that you'd like to see remastered for the new era of consoles like the one the

1459
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:15,840
playstation 4 that we do or do you think these remasterings are cash grabs whose resources could

1460
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:24,560
be better spent somewhere else let's get to some of the answers tonight um actdef starting us off

1461
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:31,840
with a haiku our favorite form of answer i will always read a haiku actdef says hd remakes good

1462
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,960
but only if they offer new stuff in the game

1463
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:43,360
very good very good uh scott g on google plus says left for dead 2 please you know what though

1464
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,720
if you're gonna go for left for dead 2 why not why not hold out for a left for dead 3

1465
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,240
would you really want a left for dead 2 remake over a left for dead 3

1466
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,400
i mean i guess that could be said for a lot of these games though

1467
01:42:54,400 --> 01:43:00,560
uh let's see uh we go to redertainment who says no any re-release of a 360 ps3

1468
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,480
game is a blatant cash grab and would make me wonder loudly why they can't just make

1469
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:09,200
the new consoles backwards compatible besides i still have the previous generation of consoles

1470
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,200
in perfect working condition and can buy games for those consoles quite expediently

1471
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:17,520
that being said ask me this question again in a couple years my opinion might change

1472
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:25,040
um travis h says personally i don't know if the gaming devs have ran out of ideas too lazy or not

1473
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,280
enough funds to create new titles i think we've lived in the heyday of gaming as 30 and 40

1474
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,920
somethings that being said a game that came out less than a year ago is nothing more than a cash

1475
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:38,720
grab i'm playing through the last of us right now and have no means whatsoever to spend another 60

1476
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:44,880
40 or 20 to buy it again for my playstation 4 that's right even if it was 20 bucks they can

1477
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:51,840
keep it i think the playstation 3 version of the game is as beautiful as is you gotta wonder is

1478
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:59,440
this game really targeted for people who only missed or who didn't own playstation 3 and missed

1479
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:03,840
it completely yet they have a playstation 4 because ps4 is selling so well i don't know

1480
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:12,320
let's go to some of the answers over on facebook um renee uh answers and says remastered games i'd

1481
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:19,200
love to see uh bayonetta on playstation 3 no more heroes on the wii no more heroes 2 on the wii and

1482
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:25,360
samba de amigo on the wii yes silly i know but it was fun but that in turn if you think about

1483
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:30,320
it was a remastered game for the generation before so you would be making a copy of a copy

1484
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:36,160
at that point although samba de amigo is worth it samba de amigo is a good good time uh let's see

1485
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:42,160
andy r says valkyria chronicles yes that would be a great one actually uh ronnie b says i think it's

1486
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:48,880
silly to remaster a game instead why not make a sequel with more improvements awesome unicorn

1487
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:54,080
if a game is going to be remastered my main hope would be that it would give the game a chance that

1488
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:59,360
it didn't have the first time a game that seems like a prime candidate is xenoblade chronicles

1489
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,760
the game is a masterpiece that many people overlooked simply because they had already

1490
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,160
moved on from the wii or because they claimed that the graphics simply were not good enough

1491
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:12,960
to them that's a great candidate by the way i i actually really really agree with that answer

1492
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:20,720
good job um let's see uh rod l replied and said there needs to be enough of a gap in the tech

1493
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:26,800
to make the remake noticeable for example final fantasy 10 and 10 2 the last of us is too recent

1494
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,760
to make it a valuable purchase for anyone who picked it up already that said a skyrim remake

1495
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,800
might be awesome especially considering how broken that game was on playstation 3 and have a good

1496
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,400
show well thank you you know most people don't sign off saying have a good show or you know hope

1497
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,080
your day is super so thank you very much i appreciate that thought uh our buddy captain

1498
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:52,960
spike from the game buoy.org podcast we love those guys over game boy and let me take this

1499
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:59,280
opportunity to shout out game buoy on a happy two-year special because they hit two years

1500
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,760
and happy episode 50 because they they're on a two episode a month production schedule

1501
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,280
but happy episode 50 to uh captain spike and first mate slidekick yay

1502
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,480
now captain spike says i'd kill for playstation 4 remasters of infamous one

1503
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:22,720
two and festival of blood uh let's see our pal delvin from the show video game realness and

1504
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:27,280
that's a really fun show if uh you want to hear some sassy commentary on video games out of

1505
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:32,320
toronto video game realness is your show and delvin says remastering a game less than a year

1506
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:38,560
old i.e tomb raider and now the last of us an absolute cash grab it's ridiculous just release

1507
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,920
them all at the same time when it's so soon and i guess since i'm shouting out other podcasts i'll

1508
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,040
shout out koopa club and ian from that show answered as well and ian says i double dipped

1509
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:53,680
on tomb raider but i don't plan to on the last of us the story was great but the gameplay isn't

1510
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:59,200
worth it to me to go through again i like my powerful females better anyway i want to see

1511
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:05,600
final fantasy 12 get the hd treatment or for some reason skyward sword yes yes yes to final

1512
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,800
fantasy 12 that's like the one reason i want final fantasy 10 to sell really really well is i really

1513
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:17,040
want fantasy 12 to get another release and another chance because when final fantasy 12 came out like

1514
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:21,840
this like right around the same time the xbox 360 did it just yeah it was lost a little bit

1515
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:26,960
and that game is so good and the battle system is so good like oh my god i so agree i so agree

1516
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:32,160
all right lastly nemesis 47 says i may get this on the playstation 4 given this game will have

1517
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:37,840
all the ps3 dlc expansions included and it's updated for the power of the playstation 4

1518
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,240
since the last of us is a clever and epic game and in a way it's kind of the game of year edition

1519
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:46,080
as for what game i want to see updated from the last gen i'd love to see the guilty gear

1520
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:51,600
franchise or even blaze blue updated in hd on the playstation 4 as long as we get new content such

1521
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,640
as characters more story or even more content than the same game we played millions of times

1522
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:02,240
maybe even a batman arkham game would be awesome on the playstation 4 as well well there's gonna

01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:22,880
they're worth your time facebook.com orange lounge radio uh quickly you guys thoughts on games from

1527
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,800
the last gen that should be updated or should they stop this practice all together final

1528
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,760
fantasy 7 final fantasy 7 now you're going back a few generations but i suppose for final fantasy

1529
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:40,560
12 you're going back a few generations as well so we should accept that answer too because it's it's

1530
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:48,000
long since time i mean uh and if i'm gonna go to that same era then i'm gonna say new jumping

1531
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,040
flash as well bring back jumping flash why not because the closest thing i have to jumping flash

1532
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:58,640
is robot uh drunken robot pornography um i am gonna absolutely agree with the listener who

1533
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:03,520
said xenoblade chronicles i think that's a great choice as is uh you know what again because the

1534
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:10,160
game was horrifically underrated lost odyssey i want to see that redone although that will never

1535
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:14,960
happen how about a lost odyssey 2 throw me a freaking bone here i need to go back and finish

1536
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,360
that game it was first i need to find the disc for that game and then i need to go back and

1537
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,840
do you want to borrow mine i have mine somewhere but once again also i still have to finish final

1538
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:31,520
fantasy 13 the first one yeah and i kind of don't want to so but that's any that because i finish

1539
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:36,640
all my final fantasy games there's not this is the first 12 12 was a long one i didn't play 12

1540
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:42,640
oh shame shame what about a game for you that you would remaster um twist them all black

1541
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:49,200
um you were really into that simil was really terrible yeah i hear they just try to do too

1542
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:55,600
much weird stuff but like just take the older ones and make them really cool looking don't do

1543
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:02,640
anything fancy just you know new new levels new characters done don't don't try to add mechs or

1544
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:09,440
blimps or helicopters none of that shit made any sense just new characters new maps that's all you

1545
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:14,080
have to do why don't they just realize it's all you need to do new characters new maps done

1546
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,880
something just occurred to me i'd like to see the grandia series remade

1547
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:25,440
oh like make make it have all the good music and all the cool stuff that the saturn version had

1548
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,800
but bring everything up to date you know touch up the keep it sprite based even i don't care

1549
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:36,320
i just want to see you know better music you know the music remastered the levels you know touched

1550
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:42,560
up and be as expansive as it was on the saturn rather than the kind of crappy uh rendition the

1551
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:48,160
playstation got and then bring out grandia 2 or if we're just going to go to fan wank here i would

1552
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:53,680
love to see a version of legends of link to the past um done in the style of legends all the wind

1553
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:59,280
waker but i'm not talking about like a top down game i'm talking about full 3d zelda game where

1554
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:04,400
i can pan that camera around wherever i want the hint of it you get in oh that pissed me off like

1555
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,640
what the hell this could have been this and instead you're just like ah fucking flood

1556
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:16,000
the shit you know it's like i was like what the hell yeah exactly that's what i'd want to see

1557
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,360
spoiler for a years old game uh anyhow uh the other thing i was going to say uh raginator in

1558
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,320
chat brings up a really good point i do want to move on from this topic this is a really good

1559
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:28,400
point about a very important component we're missing in the equation and raginator in chat

1560
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:34,240
at live dot com says we already have final fantasy 7 and 8 on steam and i have both but

1561
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:39,280
now we need to get the rest of them we are leaving pc out of the equation when we talk about these

1562
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:43,760
remastering how does pc fit into all this because when you're talking about grandia my mind went to

1563
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:49,440
oh yeah i played the ease uh remakes that are on steam on pc and they're really good so yeah

1564
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:57,600
it was surprising we had you know the east got the remakes and not you know other games that

1565
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:01,680
i mean as in the east series they're all great don't get me wrong yeah but the fighting is so

1566
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:06,720
weird in that game now by today's standards like the fact is like bump bump jump i wish

1567
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:12,320
they would bring the uh was it the four remake um to steam you know the one that they did with

1568
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:17,360
all the extra dlc stuff that they had on we and stuff remember that i wish they would bring that

1569
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:23,440
back in also the remake yeah i don't know if i want the remake of six but i like six i think

1570
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:28,320
the original four remade the four remake on honestly on the psp was like the best one that's

1571
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:33,920
what i'm saying yeah like that this is great all right uh let's move on we're getting we're getting

1572
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,840
hung up a little bit on the remakes thing and we want to have time for your call so let's move on

1573
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:44,480
with some more news loki all right um so this is kind of neat there's an yet another game that

1574
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:52,000
harmonix is announcing and not the you know they like to do games with uh you know any sort of

1575
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,480
rhythm based elements in there and this new one is going to be um a game called record run

1576
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:04,320
it's i guess they said it's like a rhythm runner and it's coming to mobile platforms uh it sounds

1577
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:12,560
a lot like the uh bit trip games but um they're saying that it's going to use i guess um your

1578
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:19,680
music as a way to generate you know obstacles and stuff so kind of like bit trip meets like uh

1579
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:26,400
vib ribbon or something like that um i don't know so that sounds kind of cool

1580
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,440
uh this is the game that zaku was talking about a little bit in that phone call in the beginning

1581
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:37,520
of the show right i think so yeah sounds like uh it sounds like it uh it looks to be pretty cool

1582
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:42,080
and it's it's nice to see some of the other stuff harmonix is working on now now we have an idea

1583
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:47,920
what life is like after rock band and uh you know well although you know this this isn't in

1584
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,240
the show role per se but i do distinctly remember reading an article about a comment was made

1585
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:56,560
that rock band and dan central are not gone that they're just they're slumbering but they're they

1586
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:01,920
would like to see those games come back for the you know these new eras of consoles that we have

1587
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:06,800
i think we just have to figure out what to do different and how to add how do you add to that

1588
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,840
how to convince me to buy new peripherals all the freaking over again like if that you don't

1589
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,240
need new peripherals for run you know dance center well if they well that's essentially you don't and

1590
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:22,720
then for uh come to think of it yeah for um it was all usb on playstation 3 right so they could

1591
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:29,360
technically support all that which they were they should if they were smart although some of those

1592
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:36,720
were wireless so that would be kind of a no-no type thing um but if you had the wired ones i

1593
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:43,680
would hope that they'd still support that stuff right i don't know all right well uh i'm looking

1594
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:48,720
forward to checking that out when it comes out and uh it sounds like it's uh very affordable

1595
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:57,440
yeah so all right um some interesting changes at pax east and you know i forgot to ask rama

1596
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:02,640
about how that diversity lounge thing oh yeah is that the first time that they did that this year

1597
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:07,120
yeah i was curious about what that was what that all entailed because i haven't seen a lot of

1598
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:13,440
reports on that but i have heard about some of the other um uh things that are that were interesting

1599
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:20,880
uh happening at pax east for example um there were bag search stations so every entrance into

1600
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:25,040
the boston convention center you had to get your bag searched which is actually a standard security

1601
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:30,560
protocol they do it at e3 as well if i remember right they do it at e3 yeah yeah and also you

1602
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:36,320
know since it is in boston i mean not too long ago we have the whole boston you know bombing

1603
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:41,520
things so i'm sure that they're still on edge a little close to home yeah and you know most people

1604
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,400
are like you know they understand you know if you're going to go to a big place that there's

1605
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,600
a lot of people you understand they do it at disneyland they do it you know they do it anywhere

1606
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:53,280
there's going to be a whole lot of people uh there so there is that uh what is also interesting a

1607
01:55:53,280 --> 01:56:00,240
last minute request from the city was to change some of the bathrooms at the convention center

1608
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:04,320
because and this was a request of the city and this is important because you know unfortunately

1609
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:09,840
pax has not had the best reputation in the past with some of its you know the creators of penny

1610
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,560
arcade and some of their views on things so it's important to note that the city requested that

1611
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:21,040
because of the number of people in the building and the fact that it skews male 65 35 they had

1612
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:28,320
to convert some of the restrooms so some of the women's restrooms became men's restrooms so they

1613
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:35,440
changed that uh so that's what they did um and they wanted to what uh actually one of the creators

1614
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:40,000
of the con was a little confused because he was like did we have problems last year no

1615
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,240
and he actually asked if they could change six women's restrooms into gender neutral rooms that

1616
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:52,800
could be used by either gender and the city actually said no about that so uh very uh

1617
01:56:52,800 --> 01:57:01,360
interesting uh changes at pax east so that's kind of an auto request i mean i understand i guess i

1618
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:06,320
get it but some of the things i'm hearing is that because of the change some women were really

1619
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:10,640
inconvenienced because they couldn't use the bathrooms closest to them they had to go clear

1620
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:14,560
a clock across the floor to go to the one that wasn't converted and if i was the woman there at

1621
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:18,640
the show i'd be a little bit frustrated i think i think it would be hard for me to go oh well i

1622
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:24,720
understand in the moment that this convention is mostly men when i'm already feeling under yeah

1623
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,560
exactly they're not gonna think oh the city requested that they're just gonna think oh well

1624
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:33,360
they're just being dicks and they don't care about women so jamie you know i've got to ask

1625
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:37,760
you your thoughts on this being the woman on our panel here do you think it was fair of the city to

1626
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:47,040
ask pax east to change some of those restrooms when okay excuse mail i wasn't there i mean

1627
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:51,760
well we did go to pax a few years ago so you've been to something similar yeah i

1628
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:58,000
i wouldn't have changed him honestly because just in my experience we have to pee more often

1629
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,360
i mean seriously i'm not even making up anything there i have noticed that i typically have to

1630
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:10,960
pee more than my male co-workers do um so i think if they were already because the whatever the

1631
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:18,320
convention center is supposed to be is set for a particular standard for average use am i correct

1632
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:25,280
so then all of the restrooms should have stayed the way they were all the anime cons i've gone to

1633
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,880
have stayed the way they were when i've gone to classic gaming expo they've stayed the way

1634
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,640
they were when we went to pax i didn't see any bathrooms being converted there and i ran into

1635
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:41,680
more guys everywhere that i cared to see you know but i'm saying you know it's

1636
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:50,480
get over your male privilege um now going to other convention news real quick i wanted to

1637
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,760
throw this out there because this was some news that was kind of late breaking today

1638
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:58,480
but uh some tweets from the folks behind gamer x which is the convention that you know we've

1639
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:02,160
talked a lot about on this show because i went last year and i had a great time i'm dragging

1640
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:06,720
dark sakura with me this year if if loki didn't have the baby at home i'd probably make him go too

1641
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:11,920
but uh we're gonna go to gamer x this year uh well they've actually come out and said on twitter

1642
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:17,360
this is gonna be the last year of gamer x um which is yeah it's kind of it's it's sad i mean

1643
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:20,880
i understand it from a financial perspective if they're not making money on the convention

1644
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,240
then they're not going to continue to do the convention i get that but just from the standard

1645
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:30,640
of i really liked having this convention um i'm very disappointed to see it go and wish we could

1646
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:36,400
somehow stick around i think i think they're really challenged with getting the perception

1647
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,360
out there and it's really important to know so allow me to state this explicitly for folks

1648
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:49,200
gamer x is not a convention just for gay lesbian transgender you know the quilt bag the whole

1649
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:55,760
spectrum gamer x is not just a place for that gamer x is a place for everybody that you know

1650
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:02,000
brings light and attention to some of these you know issues and most importantly is a safe space

1651
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,840
and a common ground for gay gamers and i'm gonna tell you that was really important to me

1652
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:15,280
as a gay gamer because you know in the in the nerd community sometimes you know it's like oh

1653
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:19,760
you're gay i don't understand gay people gay but you know at least not i mean it's getting better

1654
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:25,600
it really i mean as opposed to when i first came out 15 years ago christ i'm dating myself but

1655
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,560
you know as opposed to when i first came out and now it is getting a lot better and you know you

1656
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:36,160
have the people that are our age and younger and a little bit older to thank for that there really

1657
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:43,280
is a generational shift in the way we think and tumblr don't forget tumblr i'm not i don't really

1658
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:49,440
want to thank tumblr for anything except for pornography um i i had to know the stab i will

1659
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:55,040
thank tumblr for this i will thank tumblr for this this is the greatest analogy that i have seen

1660
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:02,800
in answering the question well if you get a gamer x why don't we have a straighter x and the analogy

1661
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:08,240
on tumblr that i saw is it's the same reason that in mario kart you don't get a blue shell when

1662
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:16,720
you're in first place think about it yeah now as i was saying a minute ago another reason why i

1663
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:23,120
liked gamer x is because as a gay guy believe it or not you you also face some of that again little

1664
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:29,120
worse 15 years ago and it is now thanks to things like gamer x but as a gay guy it's like oh you

1665
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:35,920
don't like these certain things or you don't fit into these certain molds of what you know a gay

1666
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:40,720
gay person is you're a you're a nerd you can't be a nerd and gay like literally i have had eyes

1667
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:45,040
rolled at me yeah i have had dates in the past that have gone bad because it came out that i

1668
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,200
did a radio show about video games and it's like oh this guy's a bit too nerdy for me i want to

1669
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:56,480
talk about you know my eye rolling is at that behavior yeah i'm sorry people the bits that

1670
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:03,040
you do or do not enjoy has nothing to do with the things that you like you know what i mean

1671
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:11,040
you can you can like dick and mario right it's they're not mutually exclusive um at

1672
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:15,600
defton chat says i hope rob didn't read the joystick commenters because joystick ran an

1673
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:19,520
article on this earlier today and of course the comment section turned into a cesspool

1674
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,880
when usually joystick has one of the better commenting sites on the internet but you know

1675
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:26,880
that's just the the rule of the internet don't read the comments i made that mistake i read the

1676
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:35,680
comments you know here's the thing i how do you like it as a nerd how do you like it you know

1677
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,920
because if you're listening to if you downloaded a podcast about video games i'm going to speculate

1678
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:47,040
you're probably a bit of a nerd and you've probably had certain stereotypes thrown at you

1679
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:54,000
in your life like oh you grew up in your parents basement or oh you're fat you smell you have bad

1680
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,480
hygiene or you know you you don't know how to play sports you can't do any physical activity

1681
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:06,560
right i'm sure many nerds have had those things slung at them in their lives so when i and i i

1682
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:11,920
think a lot of those comments are ignorant you know it's like you don't i mean being a nerd is

1683
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:17,120
is empowering its culture it's part of what i what it's part of who i am and what i enjoy and

1684
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:22,400
the things the things that give me pleasure in life great stories great characters superheroes

1685
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:27,280
that save the day in a very mundane society all those things are great about being a nerd right

1686
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:33,520
so when i go to joystick and i read comments like well this convention was just set up so

1687
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:44,160
a gay a bunch of gay guys could get together and hook up really really i go that's as fucking

1688
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:50,000
ignorant as those comments i i i get as a nerd about living in my parents basement and fat etc

1689
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:58,000
etc that is just as ignorant because people don't hook up at straight conventions or do i have to

1690
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,440
get rama back on this show to talk about what goes on at anime conventions or how about on the fuck

1691
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:08,960
on how about you know not even so far as anime conventions but one of the big not really big

1692
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:17,440
stories but one of the troll trolling for hits stories from like last year or so about uh pax

1693
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:22,960
west or whatever was the whole craigslist post for you know trying to get together or swingers

1694
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:28,960
party or something from you know attendees so yeah that shit kind of happens or just the thing

1695
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:35,040
that you get when you cosplay when you're a girl cosplaying and you get the guys out there thinking

1696
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:41,280
that they can tell you how to pose touch you without your consent i don't let anybody touch

1697
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:46,720
me i punch somebody one year this is the year i did the bike in cosplay that dan didn't like because

1698
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:55,200
you too much boob and some guy tried to move my shoulder to pose me in a certain way and i just

1699
02:04:55,200 --> 02:05:05,360
did you know flicked out my hand and and punched him in the sternum and he left cursing quite a bit

1700
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:15,040
but he left and left me alone um but uh you know if if it wasn't for people you know trying to

1701
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:21,440
think everything is about a hookup we wouldn't need the cosplay does not equal consent movement

1702
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:27,120
we wouldn't need to have different conventions so that people can feel safe in other environments

1703
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:32,480
fucking should have nothing to do with having fun it can be fun for some people

1704
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:36,240
but it should not if you want a convention about fucking go to the fulsome street fair

1705
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:43,040
or better yet dory alley you'll see some things that will shock you or the back end

1706
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,400
eye blush at some of the things i've seen out of that or the back end of the castor street

1707
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,640
fair but then again the back end of the castor street fair is also drag queen territory and

1708
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:54,800
that is the best place anyway i just want to end with this thoughts here because black wolf says

1709
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:02,800
this uh the joystick comments quote e3 is for everybody herder here's the message that

1710
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:10,960
unfortunately is getting lost in this internet cesspool e3 is for everybody so is gamer x

1711
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:18,640
that's unfortunately the message that's being lost and e3 is not for everybody e3 is for

1712
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:25,120
that's true industry people oh you want to go e3 well now fuck off yeah okay then pax is for

1713
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:29,920
everybody that was able to click the button within 15 minutes you know or what have you and then but

1714
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:35,280
then you hear stories about well because the city said it's too much of an imbalance between men

1715
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:39,360
and women women have to walk further to get to the restroom you look at that and go is pax east

1716
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:44,720
really for everybody i mean granted that was out of their control i'm not harping on them for that

1717
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:49,840
but it's you know you can't look at a a thing like that and go is this really for everybody

1718
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:55,120
yeah but what what it what prompted the city to make that kind of decision was it because of all

1719
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:59,600
was it because of all the bad press that they had gotten before about this kind of thing or is it

1720
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:06,400
because of you know because i've never ever heard a convention their politicians loki they do weird

1721
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:10,800
shit i've what i've met this is the very first convention i've ever heard that had the convert

1722
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:15,760
bathrooms from women to men i mean this is the first you know if they're gonna do that

1723
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:21,280
then why don't they just go back and segregate them again if you wanted to solve this issue we

1724
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:25,280
could do like other countries do and have all bathrooms and unisex instead of a diversity

1725
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:29,280
lounge let's have a men's only smoking lounge that's what we should have right oh there's

1726
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:36,560
gentlemen's clubs they already have that to be fair though a lot of women i know have a great

1727
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:42,720
time at a gentleman's club when when i go out with my lady friends her gentleman's club is

1728
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:47,440
actually usually towards the top of the list of good ideas to be fair i would also like to respond

1729
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:52,560
to what nemesis 47 said there's nothing wrong in asking for pics it's not good or gentlemanly to

1730
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:59,280
touch girls in that way well it also goes the same way for a woman don't touch a man without asking

1731
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:04,800
absolutely his consent or a man to touch another man you know bumping into somebody you know

1732
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:09,760
nudging somebody being friendly you know wanting to shake someone's hand that's one thing that is

1733
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:18,240
you are inviting contact don't force the issue if it's not reciprocated and don't and the reason why

1734
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:23,120
i think that there's a little bit more focus on doing it towards women than towards men and men

1735
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:28,640
can be victimized as well that that goes without saying it happens it happens regularly and it

1736
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:34,000
doesn't get reported because you know there's also this sort of masculinity thing that you know men

1737
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:45,520
are expected to adhere to um as well but um going back to that i think that it's still a perception

1738
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,800
that because you really don't see it to happen that often with male cosplayers being harassed

1739
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:56,160
the way that female cosplayers are all right anyway if you have more thoughts on the subject

1740
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:59,360
just in the interest of keeping these rolling along because i went i went on that tangent way

1741
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:03,920
too long sorry guys sometimes when things hit a little close to home i get a little ranty

1742
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:09,280
participate at orange laundry.com if you want to participate in our mailbag segment with your

1743
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:13,680
further thoughts we're going to get to uh our mailbag uh from this week here very soon but

1744
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:19,200
we still have a few more stories to get to first dark sakura oh yeah i do have another one don't i

1745
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:25,360
um well you know we've been talking about the net neutrality thing off and on well there's a

1746
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:32,960
report that came out that comcast sent a campaign contributions to every member of the senate

1747
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:42,800
judiciary committee um so that means they're probably uh not going to uh get well it means

1748
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,040
they're probably going to have more than enough support for their merger with time warner cable

1749
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:54,160
um but that's also you know leading more and more towards a lot of

1750
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:01,760
what's the word i'm thinking of favoritism wank you know especially but see here is

1751
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:07,120
the big thing here is that basically there were so many of the people in the senate

1752
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:12,800
judiciary committee who um who were there for the congressional hearing on the comcast

1753
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:21,760
twc merger um but a lot of the big uh people who spoke out against it including al franken

1754
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:28,640
received money from comcast uh the comcast pac gave five thousand dollars to his recount fund

1755
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:37,920
in 2009 and he also um received 15 grand from comcast employees since 2009 so what we're looking

1756
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:46,320
at these are the ones um for democrat side we had uh chuck schumer uh patrick leary lee he um

1757
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:53,760
sheldon whitehouse chris coons dick durbin amy klow bacher diane feinstein richard blumenthal

1758
02:10:53,760 --> 02:11:02,080
mazy hirono and al franken and on the republican side uh oren hatch chuck grassley john corn

1759
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:10,480
cornin leslie gramm jeff sessions mike lee ted cruz ted cruz is an asshole anyway and jeff flake

1760
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:18,240
but i mean how can we take how can we expect any of these people who we have voted for

1761
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:25,680
in our government to be impartial parties when they're all on corporate bankroll

1762
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:32,560
it's one of those questions that goes a lot deeper than i think this show can even get into

1763
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:36,080
but just so just so we're clear because there might be people listening to this

1764
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:41,600
going well this isn't necessarily video game news why does a gamer want to care about this

1765
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:47,280
because first of all you know especially going back into the net neutrality stuff

1766
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:54,320
if you have say that you have someone who's a company that's not comcast say that comcast

1767
02:11:54,320 --> 02:12:00,400
and time warner do this big merger they also get control over you know the bandwidth they get like

1768
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:05,680
exclusive rights and you're left out of the loop well you know we're leaning more towards them

1769
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:10,000
trying to gain a higher market share and get closer and closer i mean i honestly see a lot

1770
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,280
of these mergers turning awfully close to almost being a monopoly you know but

1771
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:20,800
especially also with so many of our games requiring that you be online

1772
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:28,800
with them being able to yoke and control what you're saying while using their product yeah

1773
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:34,880
there's a big thing behind it you know there's way more than i would be able to discuss but it's

1774
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:44,480
still important the people know that the people that they voted for are and you as a gamer do

1775
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:50,000
have a voice and that voice is your vote you know yeah and i i realize we're a worldwide show so the

1776
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,120
circumstances may be different in your country but the you know in in most countries that listen to

1777
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,320
this show you know they run somewhat in a democratic process one way or another so you

1778
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:08,480
know you have a voice use it make your lawmakers understand why these things are bad because

1779
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:13,760
i'll tell you what the threaten of not being re-elected speaks a lot louder than some of

1780
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:19,760
these financial contributions i mean there was another thing that i was reading about too about

1781
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:27,440
uh yi leland yi was trying to also still propose um something about uh

1782
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:32,960
donation uh campaign donations not being able to be used or not being able to accept

1783
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:38,720
campation campaign donations in the form of trips gifts and you know basically what should

1784
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:43,920
be bribery anyway that people are passing off as donations yet he was doing all that and far more

1785
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,680
oh and there is more the the philippine government is actually calling for him

1786
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:55,600
to stand trial oh geez so yeah dude's in hot shit right now he is in boiling vats of oily shit

1787
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:03,920
ew yeah all right let's move on uh an issue that we just don't have enough time here on the show

1788
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:09,200
to discuss but uh you know now we've planted the seed in your head use your voices tiger

1789
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:15,120
claw did post a link to the consumerist listing them as uh that one of the worst companies in

1790
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:21,520
america for 2014 uh comcast oh yeah they won they won this year i don't i don't really talk

1791
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,840
i mean when ea won that poll for a couple years i was like who fucking cares it's some website on

1792
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:31,040
the internet you know and they're little they're little tin can award but so i don't think that's

1793
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:36,960
too much too big of a deal but i think it does show if nothing else i mean ea was not even i

1794
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,080
mean i think they were a contender but they didn't even make like they didn't even get past their

1795
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:45,680
first round this year you know people are really fed up with some of the ways i don't think that

1796
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:51,280
necessarily speaks to comcast as a company i mean it does but i think that speaks to a lot of how

1797
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:56,960
people feel that comcast needs to be better regulated well also in my job at locat i hear

1798
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:05,920
from a great many of our customers who use comcast as their isp and whenever i have to say well this

1799
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:10,960
is something going on with comcast like i don't want to call them i really don't want to call them

1800
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:16,080
and there's you know and i have friends that work for comcast and things like that and i know you

1801
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:20,480
know obviously there's a lot of good people but the problem with comcast is it's getting too big

1802
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:24,720
it really is i mean that's that goes for almost any big company when companies get too big the

1803
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:27,920
left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing and that's when you get sent to 500 different

1804
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:31,680
departments before you get your issue resolved and all that stuff and then they they talk about

1805
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:36,320
they want to get even bigger that's that's a concern huge one that's one of the reasons that

1806
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:43,040
i really super like locat which i can't really go into more detail about is that a lot of what

1807
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:49,200
they've been doing they're big but they focus more on keeping it to certain things you know

1808
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:56,000
it's there's a constant communication there's constant training there's constant making sure

1809
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,200
everyone knows what the other party is doing and i wish other companies focused on that same type

1810
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:06,240
of philosophy it sounds like from what you've told me about your organization as well as that

1811
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:12,400
there's very clearly defined roles there are yet you dabble your fingers in other pots as

1812
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:16,720
appropriate exactly that's a good way to do it my company kind of does that is a completely

1813
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:20,240
different industry but we do that a little bit too and i think it helps a lot yeah and i honestly

1814
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:25,920
think that ea has tried to do quite a number of things to clean up their reputation so they're

1815
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:35,520
doing better all right um let's move on loki all right um so let's see they've got some new dlc

1816
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:45,040
coming for uh titanfall and uh i should say the first of some dlc so it's a new map pack called

1817
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:51,840
expedition it's coming in may and it includes uh some new maps including runoff swamp lands and

1818
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:58,000
war games uh i know war games is supposed to take place in actually the training simulation

1819
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,880
program that you use in the beginning of the game uh also they're saying that they're going to be

1820
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:09,120
doing a free update which is going to include a new two uh two versus two last titan standing mode

1821
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:14,000
as well as some other uh updates as well and hey uh rob this is actually kind of cool i mean you

1822
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,080
remember one of my bitches about the game was that there was no private match mode well they

1823
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:22,800
actually added that in so about time yeah so weren't they saying that was supposed to be in

1824
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:28,320
like a week after release been a little while well it was technically in the week after release of

1825
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:36,160
the 360 version so um and of course the dlc pack is going to be 999 or if you opt to go the season

1826
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:42,000
pass they'll save you five bucks and it's 24.99 because they're going to be doing three different

1827
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:49,200
dlc packs so i don't know i still want to get it on 360 but i haven't got a chance to yet

1828
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:54,080
yeah i kind of want to pick up the game as well i think when i get that new computer i'll probably

1829
02:17:54,080 --> 02:18:00,160
end up getting titanfall on pc yeah pc looks really good yeah it i could get it on pc i guess

1830
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,880
well something i could play on pc in the interim or if i'm in certain countries i could play it on

1831
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:10,720
an ipad is hearthstone and some information coming out of packs east because blizzard was there

1832
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:15,680
involves a an expansion of sorts to hearthstone it's not really an expansion but it's called

1833
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:22,080
the curse of nox from us which uh was uh dungeon in that was one of my favorites yeah it was early

1834
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:27,120
world of warcraft and they revived it for wrath of the lich king so um it's a hearthstone adventure

1835
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:31,280
and what this is it's a single player mode because you know right now hearthstone i mean you do have

1836
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:34,480
single player where it can be you versus the computer but there's not a lot that expands on

1837
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:40,240
that so curse of nox from us a hearthstone adventure will have new cards a new game board

1838
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:44,800
bosses and class specific challenges um so yeah that's something that's going to be coming to

1839
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:49,920
hearthstone uh the adventure will not be available all at once and it will be over the course of five

1840
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:55,040
weeks where the wings will open one by one which sounds a lot like the raid whatever has different

1841
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:58,960
wings and so forth so that'll be kind of funny um in order to gain entry you're going to have

1842
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:05,440
to purchase it with in-game gold or real money because our stone is free to play after all

1843
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:10,640
so you gotta play a lot of in the games or you gotta use plunker down the 99 cents or 99 or

1844
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:16,160
whatever the first wing of course will be free um so there you go when you complete a wing you will

1845
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:21,440
get a new legendary card so you at least you have that to look forward to for actually completing

1846
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:26,640
things 30 new cards will be added with curse of nox from us they will not be dungeon locked so

1847
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:32,160
you can use them in decks when other game modes as well uh don't know when that's coming out

1848
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:37,040
but it should be coming out simultaneously with pc mac and ipad i would assume that means later

1849
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:43,840
this year once they get the ipad version of the game all hammered out we'll see so all right i

1850
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:50,000
think it's time to take a trip to our mailbag because every week you guys email us at mailbag

1860
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:45,680
oh god it's gonna be one of those emails you know who it is who can you guess

1861
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:53,440
i'm trying to think of jamie fans and i'm coming up blank i would write into horde house but as

1862
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:58,800
pax is going on right now by the time oh it's gamut it's getting it it would be too late i'm

1863
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:04,320
sure i'm curious what you all think about blizzard's choice to announce the azeroth choppers

1864
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:09,440
before the pax events have started do you think it's to pacify the player base yearning for some

1865
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:14,640
kind of blizzcon information or is it a great pr stunt to get people talking about blizzard

1866
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:20,160
games before the inevitable big thing that will come from a competitor either way it seems people

1867
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:25,840
will have calmed down about blizzcon and the blizzard world chatter has picked up curious

1868
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:30,080
about your thoughts love the show thanks for making my horrible commute so much better jamie

1869
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:37,920
rocks gamut i love you we need to be friends on facebook oh god i actually don't know much about

1870
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:43,280
this i've been seeing a little bit on twitter and i was just like even from like the little bits i

1871
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:54,560
was seeing it sounded dumb but here's the deal i guess it's that show um what is that american

1872
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:59,760
choppers or somewhere that's about motorbikes and they're actually having an alliance team and a

1873
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:06,960
horde team based on world of warcraft essentially um work on new chopper designs uh so they're

1874
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:13,840
going to infuse the essence of horde and alliance into each bike uh and then one chopper will reign

1875
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:18,880
supreme and uh that will be voted on by world of warcraft players around the globe so it's

1876
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:25,600
essentially going to be a horde versus alliance wankfest that involves motorcycles i don't this

1877
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:30,560
is really like nothing to me this has nothing to do with anything i think it's kind of lame i would

1878
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:35,040
rather it be like you can do bike races in game if you have the motorcycles yeah you do have the

1879
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:39,680
motorcycles already in game that's cool well the bikes that they create end up in game now that's

1880
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:46,400
kind of neat if that's the case but otherwise this is this is really a blip on the screen like

1881
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:52,080
i don't think this has anything to do with it's it's a weird promotion to try to keep warcraft

1882
02:22:52,080 --> 02:23:02,480
on the tips of people's tongues honestly that's it so anyway how about less dead space there are

1883
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:10,160
no more emails in the box no one loves us except gamut loves me well at least you got that you'll

1884
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:16,240
always have gamut you'll always have gamut well we need more emails in future weeks so please

1896
02:24:52,640 --> 02:25:02,400

1897
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:11,280
as including pinball as well um has died python angelo um he did the artwork for joust

and uh yes unfortunately he has passed away but uh i don't know pretty great artists i mean

1900
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:36,000
iconic that artwork is iconic dark sakura i mean you as a designer you got to know some of this

1901
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:42,000
guy's work between the pinbot and the joust i mean all those like old school 80s games is iconic

1902
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:49,280
yeah well we had a pinbot for a while i mean dan went on a rampage just listening to music from

1903
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:55,840
pinbot like the whole day and he's like man we should have kept our pinbot and the design was

1904
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:01,680
great i mean definitely had that you know kind of heavy metal magazine type of artwork to it too

1905
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:07,280
but it was really i mean especially if they were able to reuse the game design for jackpot

1906
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:18,400
so he was apparently fighting cancer so yeah you know what fuck cancer it's awful all right uh

1907
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:22,640
one more story's for you guys and then we're gonna get to the skype line at 1877 game olr

1910
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:42,480
bar i promise all right um we have a story about the pioneer laser active i'm thinking dark sakura

1911
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:47,600
must know this system i vaguely remember this system but not like super well but it was uh

1912
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,840
there was a this system that was the laser active and it was a laser disc

1913
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:58,080
machine basically that actually played some games um now here's the thing what they're trying to do

1914
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:03,200
on this uh particular forum it's a it's a mega ld dumping project basically where they're trying

1915
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,880
to actually get all of these games together so that they can preserve these games i don't know

1916
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:13,520
if it's to be used on emulators or or what the deal is but basically trying to preserve preserve

1917
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:18,400
these laser active games for the future now it should be noted that a lot of the laser active

1918
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:22,800
games in japan were pornographic they don't care they don't want to preserve those games they're

1919
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:27,200
saying don't bother oh what the heck that's not fair yeah the guy says i don't want him in my

1920
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,800
house and i don't want him around my kids is that you know what loki i think you need to start the

1921
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:36,800
effort to preserve the pornographic them yeah all right we need to get the porno games you know what

1922
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:42,320
somebody needs to love those games too there you go in fact they even say like which games they

1923
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:48,400
are virtual cameraman and angel mate dora dora paradise all right anyway but there are some

1924
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:54,400
big sega games that were on the system uh road blasters uh was there hyperion uh high roller

1925
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:59,440
battle you know there's there's some pretty neat stuff there so uh check that out this is all going

1926
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:05,520
on on a website uh spritesmind.net if you check out their forums there so that's it's a pretty

1927
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:11,920
neat preservation project and a system the dark sakura doesn't seem to have in the vault so

1928
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:19,680
well it's because i never wanted one we had we've had chances to get them just no until until uh

1929

mako was telling me that kotaku ran an article about hooking up hooking up at cons is what you're

1937
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:15,760
supposed to do no no no no it wasn't for it thankfully it wasn't an article from the evil

1938
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:21,360
k it wasn't that whole thing no it was uh some comments that we were seeing is that and we i

1939
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:26,640
was talking about gamer x and i said uh there's comments out there that somebody said gamer x

1940
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:32,320
the only reason it exists is because gay guys want to hook up and i said if you don't think

1941
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:37,600
hooking up at any convention happens then let me get rama on here to tell you about what goes down

1942
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:44,160
at anime conventions let me tell you something as many years i've gone to anime conventions

1943
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:50,480
and hooking up it's a i'm surprised no female cosplay walked up to me and said you're the daddy

1944
02:29:50,480 --> 02:30:04,800
please you know um bobby made a comment in chat earlier that was um that was something

1945
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:11,360
like if you can't get laid at dragon con you can't get laid at all that's right here and so

1946
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:16,800
you know hey and that's no different from what from one of the after parties i went to last night

1947
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:23,120
because here's my thing i understand that these add a lot of these after parties the male the

1948
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:31,200
female ratio is off the freaking chain because rob if you were single and you were there you'd

1949
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:39,520
have sworn god like i got you okay it was like that but i get that and i understand that but

1950
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:44,160
the thing that gets to me the most is have these guys that go there all they do is stand there in

1951
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:51,600
the corner they pick up their phone and they're like i'm at the party it is awesome geeks and

1952
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:58,960

1985
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:51,840
didn't realize until bobby mentioned on his last show that i was trying out on the dev kit too

1986
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:58,880
but no they had a good uh setup there though as ron as ron said about uh couch nights

1987
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:07,680
um yeah no i i uh definitely tried it a bunch of the indie games which rama also say you know

1988
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:15,840
there's that actually i think got a lot more uh attention than you know like some of the big

1989
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:22,480
big name boots which is good because you know so you know uh well rama was saying rama was

02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:27,280
sorry rama was saying when he was here that at like 85 of the show was indie stuff was that

1991
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:32,640
kind of your experience too um game wise yeah there was a lot there was a lot more playable

1992
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:39,520
games on the indie side than there were on you know the major you know developer side i mean a

1993
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:44,400
lot of the developer stuff like uh the borderlands people were there but they were showing like a

1994
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:50,000
video for the prequel so i didn't even i didn't bother lining up for that but there were like a

1995
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:55,760
there were a lot of good games i think i tweeted to you guys about krypton the necro dancer yeah

1996
02:34:55,760 --> 02:35:01,040
that was that was a lot of fun yeah i'm looking i want to try that i want to try that game out for

1997
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:07,600
myself too yeah no that got a that got a huge following around it people going after it uh

1998
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:16,880
there was another tiny there was another small game i tried that it's called um rollers of the

1999
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:27,280
realm which is actually a pinball game that's an rpg and puzzle game so basically you know it takes

2000
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:33,440
place in medieval times and you're fighting your way through uh through different levels and you

2001
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:37,760
have to solve puzzles you have to defeat guys or they'll destroy your flippers so you're unable to

2002
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:44,400
use it which is and it has like a nice little story to it but now i had a lot of fun with that

2003
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:49,840
there there were just a lot of good indie games that were there and it's good and it's nice that

2004
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:56,480
you know they got a lot of local developers there they get a lot of shit and they get a lot of uh

2005
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:02,640
different types of games a lot of tablet games stuff like that um but no i heard you talking

2006
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:10,480
about earlier about the diversity lounge yeah did you see it i did uh i did uh check it out um

2007
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:16,480
what was it now it's just really kind it was really just like a room that had a bunch of

2008
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:25,200
different groups that um were all about you know like diversity in the community um there was

2009
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:38,000
uh LGBT group that kind of publishes stories as publishes graphic novels

2010
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:46,480
there's a webcomic there was a there was a group similar to gamer x that you know it's for a con in

2011
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:52,560
toronto very similar type of atmosphere that they were that they were promoting there was a cop

2012
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:56,800
there was a college there kind of just talking with people brainstorming about

2013
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:04,400
how to better the community through gaming and try to kind of get you know equal uh

2014
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:11,520
and you know divert diversity and everything um then there was a group that i remember called

2015
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:21,440
like press xy which is about you know trans trans trans transgender group uh you know talking about

2016
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:27,440
you know the struggles of being transgender through a game kind of similar to cards against

2017
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:34,480
humanity which was really neat that's that's kind of neat that they were kind of showing that off

2018
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:39,600
through like a game like you know kind of i guess communicating with gamers on a level that they

2019
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:44,320
would absolutely understand that's that's pretty neat yeah and yeah i actually went to the actually

2020
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:48,080
went to their panel and you know it was like a very you know like a light fun atmosphere but

2021
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:53,680
also was very real because you know there were a lot of you know people within you know the

2022
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,560
industry they're also they're also transgender that you know they talk about their struggles

2023
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:02,400
and everything so it was like very real very you know light-hearted

2024
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:16,640
type of thing and there was also a group uh about you know uh handicap gamers oh okay oh the

2025
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:22,080
is that the able gamers yeah it's able gamers yeah they had a booth you know showing off you

2026
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:28,080
know some of the controllers and other things and also talk about how they basically just go to

2027
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:36,720
they work with other triple-a titles they work with a lot of developers on trying to make games

2028
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:43,200
more accessible for to sit for a disabled gamers there are big proponents of making sure that you

2029
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:48,560
know button mapping is available keyboard mapping is available in all games that there's not really

2030
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:54,320
a reason quote unquote that any of that should be locked down uh being cognizant of color blindness

2031
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:58,000
and you know things like that i've i've yeah i've definitely heard of those guys before so that's

2032
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,880
really cool that's that's yeah do you think that the message was heard from those groups do you

2033
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:10,960
think that enough people were hearing the message i feel that it was because of the way that it was

2034
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:16,320
initially executed the way that was initially explained kind of left a sour taste in everyone's

2035
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:25,360
mouth i think you know it had a lot of good i just don't think it was executed the right way

2036
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:32,480
initially i there was a lot of good in it right but i kind of feel that you know the room itself

2037
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:37,440
was kind of off kind of like the beaten path i don't feel it got as much attention as it should

2038
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:46,960
have but it's a start it's a start all right well um what was what was probably like your favorite

2039
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:51,200
game you got to play at the whole maybe already talked about it but what was your favorite game

2040
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:55,120
if not one you've already brought up well yeah well the favorite game was the

2041
02:39:55,120 --> 02:40:01,840
prob was probably krypton and necro dancer and and the and uh rollers of the realm right those

2042
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:06,640
were like the two indie games they got they got to play and also the the oculus rift was a lot of

2043
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:12,960
fun right to get my hands on it and everything so you're you're a believer in the oculus rift now

2044
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:19,840
i am i am if it's at the right price but you know can't be can't be choosy the price is right the

2061
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:52,720
lounge radio i do have a couple tweets to read here they aren't necessarily stories but some

2062
02:41:52,720 --> 02:42:01,040
comments um aj twist on twitter sent us a tweet you just saw a king commercial for candy crush

2063
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:11,360
saga on tv do you believe that sadly yeah i kind of do believe that um because you know they are a

2064
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:16,240
publicly traded company now and they've got to prove that they're not a one-hit wonder and in

2065
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:19,920
order to get there they're going to have to make that one hit of theirs last as long as they

2066
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:23,600
possibly can especially after especially how does that prove that they're not a one-hit wonder

2067
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:29,440
well after some bad press that one hit game they got to keep that going so they can fund those

2068
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:34,800
other games but it is a little weird i think i want to say i saw like a farmville commercial

2069
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:40,240
on tv once though it's is that's that's life all right let's go to the phones hi you're on

uh i did do uh an interesting thing this weekend i i saw indie game the movie oh right indie game

2074
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:13,280
the movie one of the movies is available on steam yeah i actually watched it through there uh uh

2075
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:19,680
first first of all i want to ask you if any of you uh if you had watched it i actually own it

2076
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:25,840
and have yet to watch it unfortunately i just you know i but to be fair i hardly ever watch like any

2077
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:31,520
movies um i get to the movies maybe like twice a year and then on on blu-ray i'll watch like maybe

2078
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:36,080
three things although um dark soccer is gonna let me frozen and i'm very excited to see that because

2079
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:40,160
i still haven't seen it because again see my comment about never getting out to the movies

2080
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:45,360
eventually yeah but uh so no i didn't see any movie the game but uh and i don't know if you

2081
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:50,240
guys did you see it lowkey no no yeah i don't think we did so you get you gotta tell us a

2082
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:55,280
little more about it here well it's a it's a pretty interesting movie it's a it's really

2083
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:03,520
entertaining to watch uh for the most part but yeah uh it definitely gave me another another

2084
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:11,520
view on on phil fish and jonathan blow because yeah if if you know me uh you know my my hatred

2085
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:17,600
or my despise for phil fish and i have seen you make some aggressive tweets in the past yeah

2086
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:26,480
definitely though though now watching this movie uh and i really understand now how phil fish uh

2087
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:31,920
feels or at least how why he acts that like that most of the time because yeah it's something

2088
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:39,520
something really really uh that you see in this movie that uh at least helps you understand a bit

2089
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:45,920
i still think he's a douche he's his son asshole and jonathan blow is still pretentious

2090
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:54,960
but at least i understand them now at least i know uh why they do and and and why they act that

2091
02:44:54,960 --> 02:45:03,280
way because yeah it's and and aside from that aside from that uh the team uh also teen meat

2092
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:11,200
it's uh it's a really interesting story how how they started and how how the uh the development

2093
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:17,920
for super meat boy uh progresses through through all of it and it's and it's really interesting you

2094
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:24,480
you even though you know how it finishes how it ends you still uh go like oh my god i want those

2095
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:32,160
guys to to get through and and be happy because yeah though uh i do recommend watching the movie

2096
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:38,240
it's on netflix it's set on everywhere and if you have if you have steam you can watch it through

2097
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:47,120
there i i watched it through steam scene since i got the uh the special edition dlc yeah and and

2098
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:52,000
also those uh those extras are really worth it are really interesting to watch too you get like

2099
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:57,600
achievements and trading cards and stuff too huh yeah uh i actually got all the achievements now

2100
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,240
that's funny uh yeah no it's it's uh definitely one of those things i gotta check out when i have

2101
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:06,320
more time available in the week and it's pretty cool that it kind of gives you that additional

2102
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:10,400
perspective on people that you may have kind of written off one way but it gave you that

2103
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:14,000
perspective it's interesting though because a lot of times when you hear that kind of talk it's

2104
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:18,000
usually like a negative thing like we hear a lot about like people that go on reality shows and

2105
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:21,840
figured thought they were edited in a negative context or even i think about um

2106
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,960
you know as far as video game documentaries go i think about the king of kong and how um you know

2107
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:30,400
billy mitchell i don't think necessarily agrees with some of the ways he was edited in that way

2108
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:34,640
and certainly there's a big negative perception about him because of that movie um and whether

2109
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:38,960
that's right or wrong i don't know because i don't know the man personally but um it is very

2110
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:46,880
interesting the power that a documentary or a a reality tv documentary or whatever can kind of

2111
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:54,240
have on people so and yes and and it's a really introspective view on how indie development works

2112
02:46:55,200 --> 02:47:02,320
at least as a general view because yeah it's a it's a lot of work for uh from so little people

2113
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:09,200
in a team and like that so yeah it's it's a it's a really interesting movie if you haven't if any of

2114
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:15,200
any of the listeners having watched it uh you should again it's on netflix it's

2115
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:20,000
pretty much everywhere so it's really easy to find if you want to get the esteem version it's

2116
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:27,600
the special version the special edition it's it's a really great auto and i'm sorry but yeah all

2117
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:33,760
right uh well act deaf anything else you want to share with us before we let you go well other

2118
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:39,760
than that super smash brothers i'm excited though i do want ness captain falcon and jigglypuff to

2119
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:45,120
return but i will see we'll see yeah those are those are three at the top of my list too but

2120
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:50,560
if they had some really really really awesome new characters then i guess i could forgive it but

2121
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:56,960
if it's more pokemon i'm gonna get a little irritated no offense to the pokemon fans but

2122
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:04,000
you have enough all right thanks thanks buddy you take care yeah you too all right bye well

2123
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:07,200
we'll leave that we'll leave the phones open for just a little bit longer to see if anybody else

2124
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:12,400
wants to sneak through for a quick call 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio

2125
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:16,960
there was actually really only one other tweet um that i wanted to address here and that was

2126
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:23,040
from dr noir who emailed us last week on the show and he was he was uh promoting a game that

2127
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:27,280
he really enjoyed on android and he said that he sent a tweet this week saying i just listened to

2128
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:33,920
last sunday's olr episode and for the record no i'm not affiliated with or paid by touch fu who's

2129
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:39,040
that company that made the game they just made a killer game no i i figured that really was the

2130
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:45,520
case it's just it's just fun to give you a hard time there so all right uh again trying to sneak

2131
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:51,520
in one more call if you are feeling so brave 1877 i promise we don't bite unless you ask if you want

2132
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:57,600
us to we'll bite a little bit 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio if you want

2133
02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:04,080
to give us a call otherwise there's there's no last minute stories and nothing else to talk about

2134
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:13,680
no i guess i guess got stuck on uh the david bowie animated gif subreddit is that a whole tumblr or

2135
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:19,680
something it's a subreddit just a few just on there but subreddit of course i should mention

2136
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:25,360
another tweet actually speaking of like time wasters um uh jamie's new bff gemit actually

2137
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:32,160
sent a tweet to me and uh horde house and the olr twitters that has a link to a game uh that was

2138
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:36,800
like i think it was like ie killer or something like that and like i just played it real quick

2139
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:41,840
like it has to it's a whole tongue-in-cheek thing about windows xp going away it was like this little

2140
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:46,320
shooter game it was a little silly but i had fun with it so all right we do have another call

2141
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:49,440
coming in so let's take it and then we'll probably wrap up so hi you're on orange house radio who's

2142
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:56,480
this hey guys this is nemesis 47 how you guys doing i am good hey nemesis 47 how you doing

2143
02:49:56,480 --> 02:50:03,680
i've been okay man uh just just uh been working on all that i did i hear you i hear you what's

2144
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:11,760
on your mind buddy uh nothing much um if there's one character they output in super smash brothers

2145
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:15,760
the new one they output like one character one character only the angry video game nerd that

2146
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:23,360
would be pretty funny to see i mean he would he probably probably attacked with a whole bunch of

2147
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:28,560
expletives and stuff like that but then nintendo probably automatically put an emory in reading in

2148
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:33,120
the game yeah see now i don't know if that would necessarily work because wasn't there a little

2149
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:39,280
bit of a legal squabble hence why the angry video game nerd has his name because that wasn't his

2150
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:46,960
original name so yeah yeah yeah when we first started he was the angry video the angry nintendo

2151
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:53,760
when we first started that's right that's right you know maybe he can't be a character nemesis

2152
02:50:53,760 --> 02:51:01,280
but what if he was the announcer that would actually be funnier see see we were working

2153
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:06,080
together here to create the killer video game here and that's you know i i can't think of a whole lot

2154
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:10,960
of announcing that goes on in smash brothers maybe this is what we need we need some announcer packs

2155
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:16,080
from some great uh video game commentators such as the angry video game nerd there you go

2156
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:20,080
and tiger claw wants to know in our chat room what would the angry video game nerds moves be

2157
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:23,920
he attacks you with bad video games see i think i think this this might be why he'd be a perfect

2158
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:29,920
commentator she has jason come out or bugs bunny do you ever watch any yeah oh yeah no i saw the

2159
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:35,520
one on friday the 13th and it made me sad because i like that one is great yeah oh it's great it's

2160
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:41,760
great good stuff uh he probably he probably he probably attacked you with swear words he probably

2161
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:47,040
probably had those uh you know the act symbol the hashtag symbol those other symbols he probably

2162
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:52,320
just smash you over the head with it maybe qbert qbert swearing that type of thing yeah that yeah

2163
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:57,760
there you go um i would uh yeah i i think that would be a special move it would be really funny

2164
02:51:57,760 --> 02:52:03,200
though is if whenever he said things like that he got censored but in that really bad like movie on

2165
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:09,600
broadcast television censoring type of way like what is what is it okay y'all know snakes on a

2166
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:14,000
plane right and samuel l jackson goes i am sick of all these motherfucking snakes on this

2167
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:20,160
motherfucking plane like didn't they dub it for tv and it's like i am sick of all these mother

2168
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:28,400
monkey loving snakes on this monday to friday plane or something really like so i think that's

2169
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:35,360
what they would do is they would have to change out the swear words for uh broadcast tv or show

2170
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:41,360
girls are dark sacrifice favorite movie on vh1 where they they draw on the bras and everything so

2171
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:47,680
all right well nemesis any other any of the thoughts or wishes for smash brothers

2172
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:55,920
oh and also and also jimmy i would i would also give give dan w2k14 but when you get it

2173
02:52:56,560 --> 02:53:02,000
try to get the uh season pass thing because not only because when you buy the season pass like

2174
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:09,360
20 bucks you'll get you get all the uh characters all the whole bunch of other stuff i mean a bunch

2175
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:14,160
of other dlc but it's pretty pretty worth getting and also not only is andre the giant in the game

2176
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:20,880
also king kong's bundies in the game oh cool oh wow so pretty much you got all the heavyweights

2177
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:25,040
of wrestling there you go so another wrestling fan here on the show do you like the princess

beg for it all right uh let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap up

2199
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:21,840
tonight's show i see jamie has her microphone up so i'll start with you dark sakura your final

2200
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:27,520
thought tonight um i was watching youtube and i found this thing called musical puns where it's

2201
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:31,200
basically like all kinds of different instruments but the thing that cracked me up was bassoon 5

2202
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:37,680
playing maroon 5 music nice it was just really funny everyone should watch musical puns i like

2203
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:42,800
hearing modern pop songs covered in other genres and things like that like the swing band that

2204
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:51,280
does all the good stuff there's also another bassoon quartet called um what's it called

2205
02:55:51,280 --> 02:56:00,480
breaking winds the breaking winds nice and they do um uh the someone i used to know they do a

2206
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:05,840
version of that that's really good so i've been really listening to a lot of bassoon music lately

2207
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:09,680
all right and then my final thoughts since dark sakura brought up youtube

2208
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:15,520
i have to say from my final thought tonight it's an orange it's an orange

2209
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:24,000
and last but not least loki your final thought tonight i don't listen to bassoon music because

2210
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:30,640
you're not cool i guess not all right i played in a bassoon quartet once but i didn't play the bassoon
