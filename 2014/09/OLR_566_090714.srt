Labor Day weekend is over and during the break, Nintendo revealed its brand new 3DS via Nintendo Direct. At least they didn't call it the 3DS You or Me. And that's just one headline from another BusyCon weekend. Stay tuned for more, including your comments, calls, and emails on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 566, September the 7th of 2014. My gosh, we're already in September. The year's gonna be done before we know it.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here comes the holiday season of gaming with the Destiny release this week and oh my gosh, it's gonna be a busy few months. Thanks for joining us for it to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours and in studio joining me as always are my incredible co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hi.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hi, welcome back.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You too. Welcome back to your house.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you. Yes. Well, I wasn't here last week. I was, I was in it. Where was I?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I wasn't here either.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Where was I? Because I, you know, I had that moment, you know, I don't know if you guys do this. Let me say, let me also just go ahead and introduce Techmaster Loki here tonight as well.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I can ask a question of all of you. I don't know if you do this because whenever I have a week that we don't have a show, I kind of find myself sitting somewhere going and then I notice I look at my clock or look at my watch and it's six o'clock or in the case of being at Dragon Con, it's nine o'clock Eastern.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I'm looking going, I should be setting up for, I should be on the call with Bobby right now and we should be doing OLR, but I'm not. Do you do that too? Or is that just me who's kind of like, I should be doing this, but I'm not.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I had a moment of wondering what to do with my time.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then Dan and I decided that it was the day before our anniversary, so we would watch Divergent, which the book was better, of course.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The movie wasn't bad. It was just very, you know, teen angsty. It felt teen angsty. You're watching it on the screen as opposed to reading the book.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I could have watched that on the flight, but they wanted six bucks. No, thank you. Was Divergent worth six bucks?

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It was worth six bucks.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh well.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I watched four hours of Shark Tank instead.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Dan got me a bottle of Hypnotic for our anniversary and I drank a lot of it.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Awesome. Yes, Loki?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was going to say, yeah, I wouldn't pay six dollars for that either.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, did you see Divergent?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What did you do with the week off?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think I watched the kids.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You've had two weeks off, actually, because I know you had family obligations a couple of weeks ago.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, and I watched the kids again.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's pretty much all we did.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you remember how to do a radio show?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What did you watch them do?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Of course I do.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's like sitting here going, Hannah, I hate this. This is so boring.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What did you watch them do? What do children do in the wild?

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, I remember Winston's actually scooting around now, so I'm watching him not, or at least trying not to get him to chew on, you know, computer cords and stuff like that.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I told you toddlers are cats.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He wants to put everything in his mouth, so he wants to put, like, if it's something on the floor, he's going to grab it and taste it, because that's what toddlers do.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They taste everything.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Same like with dogs. Dogs taste everything, too.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And cats.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I remember what I was doing a week ago at nine o'clock Eastern.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So we had just finished presenting at the Parsec Awards, which is, that was a great honor, we got to present.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And someone got to sit by Felicia Day, and I'm jealous.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It wasn't me. Is that that picture of Brad?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's from a few years ago. Sadly, Brad wasn't there this year.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I would have only wanted to be there to see Felicia Day.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't think she was there this year.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There was no reason for me to be there.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's not true, because there was a lot of things that Dark Soccer would have fun with.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't know, there were other Buffy celebrities there, like Emma Caulfield.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There was a cast of Mythbusters there.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The cast of Mythbusters was there, including some of the guys that are no longer on the cast of Mythbusters.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Anyway, so we just finished presenting at the Parsecs, which was awesome, because I got to literally brush elbows with Lord British.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who, if you don't know who he is, I didn't really get a chance to meet him.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I had a great admiration for him prior to the stupid Ready Player One contest.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I still, in spite of, everybody has their hit and misses.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look, we've had bad episodes of OLR, and people forgive us for that.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we can forgive him for a bad face.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, I can't.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I need to air my grievances with him, and then we'll be done.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's the creator of Ultima, for God's sake.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ultima's won through Ultima Online, which is like an epic, epic MMO.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Something I would have rather played instead of this fucking stupid garage sale collector game thing that I was forced to play.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If it was like, hey, let's play some Ultima Online, I'd be like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But no, it was garage sale, the game, I don't know.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Were you going to say it, Arsyra?

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was just reading what Bobby said in chat.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He said, I shook his hand because I made a joke about him and he liked it.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He actually wanted to shake my hand.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right, Lord British wanted to meet me.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That comment from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Although-

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Apparently he's a giant effing celeb.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've got to say, because I saw, I don't remember what it was, some documentary or something, his house is fucking awesome.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, so I went to the Lord British panel at Dragon Con where we got to hear, oh, this was awesome, the confirmation that yes, the evil spheres in Ultima 7 were based off the Electronic Arts logo at the time.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And EA knew that, which they were ECA back in the day.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you go back and look at your kind of computing history, they actually used to be like a cube and if you see their old logo.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So yes, EA knew that when they bought Origin and Lord British was basically talking about like, you know, I kind of had to sell Origin because we were getting bumped off the shelves for these other bigger distributors.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We had to merge with somebody else to get the shelf space basically.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But then he talked a lot about his house, which sounds amazing.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I didn't realize he was super into geocaching, but apparently he set up this geocache at his house that you have to actually like go through a forest and answer riddles to open doors.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like it's just like, what an egomaniac, but I love him for it.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But then you talked about when his house got broken into by some crazy guy and how he protected himself with the secret passageways in the house.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Like it's just like, this is crazy. I love listening to him talk. I wanted to stay longer.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He went longer than the hour that was allotted to him, but unfortunately he was right before the VOG Network presents panel over the podcasting track.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I had to leave to get to the other panel, but I want to invite him on OLR sometime.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know if he would ever come on a little piddly show like this, but I'll give him three hours to talk and it would be it would be amazing.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think we all could listen to Lord British for three hours. He's an amazing guy.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So anyway, quickly, let me also just kind of wrap up Dragon Con real quick.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's not a lot of gaming content at Dragon Con because it is more of a geek convention.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So since it is the voice of geeks network here, we kind of dabble in all that stuff.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know, Dragon Con is a great fit for us.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But as far as gaming content, like we didn't really get any game announcements or anything like that.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know, that's all happening at PAX, which we'll get into a little bit on in the show.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But, you know, did see some good gaming fandom and, you know, saw like the Darkmoon Faire party for World of Warcraft.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I saw an EverQuest landmark panel where we really didn't learn anything about the game.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But those that were into the game sure seemed to enjoy it. So, you know, props to them.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And there was a few things here and there. Like, you know, again, the Lord British panel was a personal favorite of mine.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I did want to say a big, big thank you to those that came out to see some of the things we did on the podcasting track.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Some of you guys actually got up early Monday morning to come see that participating not just listening panel, which was a lot of fun.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And I just want to thank you guys for, you know, coming up and introducing yourselves, saying hello, and being there. It was great.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I'm trying to work on Dark Soccer and Loki, guys, someday. But we might have to wait for Loki's kids to turn 18.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Someday. Someday we'll get you all to Dragon Con. Had a good time.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The one I'm really working on for next year is Grandpa from Hoard House and who also hosts the Starboard power coupling.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because I'm like, Grandpa, this year the Trek track hosted a dilithium crystal ball.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't want to go to the dilithium crystal ball, Grandpa. So I think I'm working on him for next year. We might be able to make that happen.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, yeah. So thanks to everybody that showed up at Dragon Con and I'll see you guys in 2015.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And big shout-outs to Travis, obviously, who I spent a big chunk of the weekend with.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And Brian from British Invaders, who I got to meet for the first time.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All the guys from Critical Myth met each other for the first time at Dragon Con.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So it was amazing, in person, meaning. So it was amazing to kind of get to witness that.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And just everybody, all the VOG and non-VOG and people on the podcast track.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Just thank you, thank you. I had an amazing convention and can't wait until next year.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was promised exclusive loot for registering my participation for listening to that panel.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I'm checking my account. I just don't have any.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think he's going to retcon it in. I think he was in a hurry to get that podcast up.

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just giving him crap.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I know, I know. It's always fun to give Bobby Black Wolf crap. It's even more fun to give it to him in person.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So there you go.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's see, look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Tigerclaw asks, did Lord British talk about the time he went to space?

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Actually, that didn't really come up. That topic did. I mean, he had talked about putting a geocache or what do they call them?

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The treasures or whatever. He did put one on the International Space Station.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it has been checked more times than the one he put at the bottom of the ocean.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like, I remember that that that whole topic had come up, but he didn't talk really explicitly about his travels.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A lot of it was focused on like the making of Ultima one and two and then kind of talking about the house.

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So, you know, there's there was a lot.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's what I did like during my two weeks that I was on the show is like I was watching a lot of these postmortem things that they have.

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like, like Gamasutra has like links to the GDC stuff, the postmortems where they talk about, you know,

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
its developers talking about the creations of the games and all the like thought processes and stuff and, you know, trouble and stuff that they did.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, putting these things out like Maniac Mansion and what other ones that I watch. I watched a bunch of them.

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Great shit. I love watching that stuff. It's very fascinating. That would have been I bet they've got one for Ultima on there somewhere, but good stuff.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah. Speaking of postmortems, something I did get to do at Dragon Con this year that I didn't do last year is I actually got to go to the very last podcasting panel where they have like the wrap up.

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Like, you know, in every track at Dragon Con has this, whether you're doing, you know, Tolkien track or, you know, video game track or whatever, they always do like a wrap up panel at the very end.

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I actually went to the one for podcasting and it was, it was really great, informal, got to meet a lot of other people that do podcasts of all shapes and sizes.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And I just got to say, I walked out of that very motivated, which is always a really good feeling. So don't be surprised if you see me taking on more projects.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just what I need to be doing more projects in podcasting. What? What? What? What?

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think you and I should do a new project.

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Now is a great time to pitch me new projects. I'm just saying.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I have ideas.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes. All right. Ideas, you has them. All right. We'll talk on air about that.

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I have evil ideas.

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Or off air about that.

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Evil ideas.

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, I have been playing a lot of Diablo, but we'll get into our gaming weeks in a minute.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One thing I wanted to talk about for a kickoff topic here, not just Dragon Con, but this week, you know, we're coming up on September 9th, which is nine nine, right?

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And already going to be a big day. We know Destiny's coming out that day.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Apple's going to announce inevitably a new iPhone, possibly a new watch is the rumors and what have you.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So we'll see. We'll see. So that's all possibly have a nine nine. But you know what?

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Screw both those things because nine nine twenty fourteen also marks the fifteenth birthday birthday of the Sega Dreamcast launching in the United States.

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's right. Nine nine ninety nine was the day for the Sega Dreamcast.

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I remember sitting on my butt reading a five dollar book I picked up at Barnes and Noble.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, perfect. I wanted to reminisce a little bit here.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
One thing, my friend Melissa, who is getting married in two months.

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, so you guys you guys camped out for the Dreamcast.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We did.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What did you get? What did you pick up at launch for Dreamcast?

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you remember?

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What didn't we get?

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, we we got, you know, all the crazy taxi and what else didn't come with Sonic Adventure, did it?

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't remember because I know we had it.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know. Well, did they not? I don't know if it came with games, did it?

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because they have like a base system then because I know the one I got didn't have any games.

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And we got like a couple other things. But keep in mind, we already had a Dreamcast and a bunch of games.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So we didn't really feel the need to buy more games, except we wanted to hear the English cast of Sonic Adventure.

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Right. So I was going through a little bit of a rough patch in ninety nine.

175
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So I was kind of I kind of wasn't gaming a lot.

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Probably the period between like ninety nine and about two thousand two thousand one right before our started and I got into DDR and all that.

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I kind of wasn't gaming as much. So I didn't pick up the Dreamcast when it first came out.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I bought the Dreamcast when it was on sale for forty dollars.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like I think Game Stops really were selling them for like forty dollars used or something.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I remember picking up a Dreamcast and I played the ever living crap at a fantasy star online, which probably leads into my addiction to various online games and other MMOs today.

181
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I mean, fantasy star online really set the stage for a lot of that.

182
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And so it's kind of ironic that Destiny comes out this week, which I compared to PSO in some ways, in some ways on a previous show.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it's kind of fun to see that come full circle.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But it should be stated, it is not the 15th birthday of the Dreamcast period because it was out in Japan for darn near a whole year before it was out here.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Right. Like they had it for a while.

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think it came out in, I want to say like January or February because I had one for my, we had one when I got DDR second mix for my birthday.

187
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was doing, that wasn't the system that they launched. No, that was the Saturn that they did that where it's like, it's out now, you know, that type of thing.

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah. I want to say I was doing research earlier when I did the Fugu question, which is about this topic as well tonight.

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it was November of 98, but that probably, you probably just took a couple months for you to get on board and get one.

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I won mine.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Huh?

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I won mine.

193
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You won yours. How'd you win your Dreamcast?

194
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter and won it in a raffle because I didn't even want one.

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't want to, you know, that system because I was like, I don't want it.

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then I got him like, sweet.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's awesome.

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm like, well, at least I'm not going to pay for it, but I'm going to buy games for this now.

199
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So what did you end up getting for?

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I got, I don't remember, see, I don't remember what year I got it because it wasn't 99.

201
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm pretty sure. I think it was like 2000, 2001.

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And it was, I got Power Stone.

203
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was going to say, you strike me as the type that would have played a shit ton of Power Stone.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We did because I played a shit ton of Power Stone in the arcade.

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So yes, I had to get Power Stone and I got Tony Hawk Pro Skater and I think I had Crazy Taxi.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I know I had Fancy Star Online and what else did I have?

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did you get Quake 3?

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No, no.

209
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Dancing was Quake 3 for the longest time and we were so pissed that we couldn't use our, we got the Ethernet adapter.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We couldn't play PSO on it.

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Very, very, very irritated me.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think I only played PSO online once because I only had the modem for it.

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So, I don't know, it was okay.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I didn't do a lot of online playing on that until the Xbox.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then, what other game did I get? I got something else too.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because I still have all the same games.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like that initial first batch of games I bought was it.

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then I never bought any more games for it.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I remember getting really excited when we picked up Grandia 2 because I had already been playing my friends Japanese version.

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And my save file worked.

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
From a Japanese game.

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And Power Stone was one of the other games that did that.

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Power Stone's awesome. I should have gotten Power Stone 2 but I never did.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Aw, it was fun.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I have it on my arcade cabinet.

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
My other favorite thing to do on the Dreamcast, even though I realize y'all this is of a questionable legality.

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I've supported the crap out of Virtual Console and the like ever since.

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But burning CDs full of emulators and ROMs.

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sorry, not sorry. That was a lot of fun.

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Remember the Para Para thing?

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh my god, that thing was horrible.

232
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The purple biscuits?

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Green biscuits.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's green because you know how I know it's green?

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because I fucking have it.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I have it. It's in my closet.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, it was another knockoff that had the purple ones.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Or maybe it was just the controller or something.

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me ask this question because I want to get to the new news, not just reminiscing.

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But let me ask one more question about the Dreamcast and I'll read some comments from chat.

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to know your guys' thoughts on this too over at live.vognetwork.com.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why do we remember the Dreamcast so fondly when it didn't really do so well?

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, it kind of failed as a system, I hate to say it, but it didn't.

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But why do we remember something so fondly that didn't really do so well?

245
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think for me it's a lot of it kind of brings it back to how the early consoles were

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and the early home video game consoles where they were basically

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
hey, we're going to take all these cool arcade games and port them to console.

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And so with the Dreamcast you had a lot of that.

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like with Power Stone and all the different Sega games that they had.

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A lot of the CPS2 games as well.

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah, those were all in there.

252
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And just a lot like Ikaruga, like all these big shmups and stuff.

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And plus, I think the other thing, the reason I think so fondly of it is it supported so long.

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There's still people making games out there for it right now.

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And it was maybe because it was so easy to pirate for,

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it allowed you to expose yourself to a lot of things that you might not have been able to play otherwise.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I think it's the pirating thing that might have led to the big factor in this downfall,

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
though I don't really think so much as marketing.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because our marketing in the US was really clever.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I would say I think the PlayStation 2 was able to really kind of kick it in the butt.

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
With the mere fact that the PlayStation 2 played, and I realize it was a couple years later,

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but the PlayStation 2 played DVDs.

264
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And that was a huge thing for people.

265
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You know, the fact that it could play DVDs.

266
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A lot of people made the decision, oh, I'll get one of these for the living room.

267
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So the Dreamcast really got a kick in the butt when that happened, I think.

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So I think that was a huge factor.

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But it still surprises me that it didn't somehow pull it out.

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I kind of wish that someday that Sega would go back to manufacturing consoles.

272
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Right?

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Because fuck, man, the games that they're putting out just alone, you know, just the Sonic games,

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
it's just kind of crap.

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I wish they would just go back and recapture the magic that they used to have.

276
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vogniteware.com says,

277
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It came at a weird time in gaming for me, though.

278
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
PC gaming was strong and the PlayStation was dominating the charts,

279
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but lots of love for the Sega-specific titles that came out for it.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Tigerclaw says,

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Dreamcast also had a built-in modem.

282
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When you dial into your ISP and you download some stuff from a game,

283
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I remember Sonic Adventure has some cosmetic stuff that you can download from it.

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, yeah, I remember that because I used to play the hell out of PSO.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Blackwool said,

286
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I had a friend who loved his Dreamcast and pulled out his spindle of burned games to show me how much he loved it

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and then sighed and said it's a shame it wasn't a financial success.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Blackwolf also points out PlayStation 2 also had EA exclusives.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, yeah.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Kaijuto disagrees with me, saying,

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
No, PlayStation 2 didn't kill the Dreamcast.

292
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The Sega Saturn and the PlayStation 1 killed it.

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And, and,

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Bleemcast.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Remember?

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Bleemcast was kind of awesome.

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I do remember that.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's like, that's unheard of.

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Imagine, like, if they had a PlayStation 3 disc or something that let you play Xbox 360 games.

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh my God.

301
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It would be fucking ridiculous.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's crazy.

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You don't see that kind of shit anymore.

305
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You really don't.

306
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's amazing, though.

307
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You really don't.

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All right, thanks for those comments.

309
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Again, over at live.vognetware.com.

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We will get into a little more Dreamcast reminiscing with the FUGL question of the week.

311
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But for now, let's fast-forward to the present.

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We have a couple weeks off to catch up on, so let's try to quickly get through.

313
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
How is your...

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Wait, wait, hold on.

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Blackwool says,

316
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Fuck yeah, Qsar.

317
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Top Gun.

318
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You guys have Qsar in Atlanta because seriously, that might help me get out there to Atlanta.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I mean, just saying.

320
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We'll find out.

321
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I didn't even know Qsar still existed.

322
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, we still got one in Concord.

323
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's still one in Concord.

324
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Still one in Vacaville.

325
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Vacaville one sucks.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But the Concord one apparently is still pretty good.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's just it's all the way in Concord.

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I want to say our pals Spike and Jon over at Game Buoy did a Qsar thing for Spike's birthday or something.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've played at all of the arenas in this area.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I mean, even like Bascom, which is in San Jose.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That is crap.

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But like, man, that's the problem, man.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's like over an hour away to go play Qsar.

334
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And it's just you go down there and there's no one playing except for like little kids.

335
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's why I wish they had the arena back in Citrus Heights.

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It sucks.

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Move to Citrus Heights.

338
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know, it's like, oh, sweet.

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's like like two minutes away.

340
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can even play so much Qsar.

341
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And then it closes.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's so funny, too, that I used to play at that same one all the time.

343
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yet we didn't know each other at the time.

344
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You probably kicked my ass because I was terrible at Qsar.

345
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Black Wolf in chat says we don't have any Qsars anymore, but there might be one in Atlanta.

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Keep in mind, Black Wolf lives in a suburb and says, nope, the last Qsar in Atlanta closed last year.

347
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A lot of them.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
All right, let's let's fast forward to the present and talk about what types of games we have been playing this week.

349
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Or the past two weeks.

350
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

351
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What have you been doing?

352
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How was your gaming week?

353
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I played some Final Fantasy 14.

354
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I actually did that today.

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
My 3DS has been kind of just being used for puzzles.

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What do we do?

357
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, yeah, we were playing Kingdom Hearts.

358
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I guess not really a whole bunch of stuff.

359
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, yeah, I started Another Shepherd on Mass Effect 3.

360
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I might have mentioned that before, but I actually played some more of it.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And some more Sims 2.

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's about it.

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not going to get Sims 4 until there's an expansion.

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Which there will be thousands of them.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean, since all the content's not in the game.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I played nothing, sadly.

367
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Two weeks off I really played nothing.

368
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Dark Sakura?

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I did remember something else I played.

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Go ahead.

371
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I started Fractal again.

372
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Because that game's awesome.

373
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, I'm done. Sorry.

374
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So nothing for two weeks, Logie?

375
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, I've been programming.

376
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Are you qualified to talk about video games?

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I am.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh, you've been programming your own game instead of playing others.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That works.

381
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I got done with my editor thing and then I realized it's not going to work.

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because, yeah.

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The way I did it, it was just not going to work at all.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So I had to go completely from scratch and redo it again.

385
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So actually I'm almost done with it again.

386
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Back to where I was.

387
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's just my complex math equation or whatever to rotate these vectors around a point.

388
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It just didn't work.

389
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I guess the math was wrong or something.

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's what you get for when you copy stuff off the internet without actually knowing how it works.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I'm actually going to go back and do it the way I was originally going to do it.

392
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I think that'll work a lot better.

393
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So I have to write that up.

394
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But it's pretty complex and hopefully this way works.

395
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Because if it doesn't work this way, then I have no idea what I'm going to do.

396
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But I think this way should be a lot more efficient.

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And then once I get this done, I can start making the game again.

398
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because it's just like engine, engine, engine, engine, engine stuff.

399
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I want something that I can see.

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's really interesting hearing you go through these growing pains though.

401
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's going to be fun to go back and listen to old episodes of R.

402
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Well, it's like anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to do it the right way anyway.

403
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to go back and redo it.

404
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I rewrote my shader this weekend because it was too complex for what I needed it to do.

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And it's like, ooh, I want to put all the bells and whistles in.

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I didn't really need it.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
For what I'm doing with it, I just stripped out everything I didn't need out of it and redid it.

408
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And so now I have that again.

409
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But, I don't know, it should be...

410
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because now everything is being procedurally created.

411
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's almost like I'm making Minecraft in a way.

412
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Because the way you would make a voxel game like Minecraft is pretty much the same way I'm generating the objects that you make in this editor.

413
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Did Loki just claim to be making Minecraft? I think he did.

414
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm not making Minecraft. It's just like...

415
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's because it's similar to the way voxel games work, so it's not exactly the same way.

416
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Some folks in chat are going...

417
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
BlackWolf says, Loki's making vaporware.

418
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Act F says, Loki nuke him forever.

419
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SSG100Matt says, I hope he doesn't get burned out.

420
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Dungeon Buster says, half Loki 3.

421
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay. It's only been like six months. It hasn't even been that long yet.

422
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But give yourself a break once in a while. Play some games. Get some inspiration.

423
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm burnt out at all though. I think it's interesting.

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Good. Good.

425
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If it's not fun, then why would you do it?

426
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Exactly. If I don't want to do it, then I won't do it. I'll take a break for a day or something.

427
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Because there's a lot of games I have to play.

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If they put out a new expansion in Grand Theft Auto 5 or something, maybe that'd give me an excuse to play some games or something.

429
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Or when Call of Duty Advanced Warfare comes out, I might have to play that for a bit.

430
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, because it's not on our show roll tonight, what's up with the release date for that?

431
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Did it get bumped again? I thought I heard it was getting bumped.

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It hasn't gotten bumped yet.

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
There was a rumor that one of the versions got bumped, but they're still saying it's fourth quarter.

434
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They'll say it's fourth quarter until it's not fourth quarter.

435
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Right now, they don't have a date nailed down yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if it got bumped.

436
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
If anything, just because there's so much stuff coming out in November, the day that it comes out now,

437
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
if it came out any day in November, it's going to be really packed.

438
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't know. I hope it comes out in November.

439
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It'd give me an excuse to buy a next-gen system, I guess.

440
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'd need a job for that, though.

441
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Let me talk quickly about my gaming week, because I didn't play a lot a lot.

442
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Obviously, I was away at the convention, but I did play a few things.

443
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
On the flight, I played on the PlayStation Vita quite a bit of Dragon's Crown,

444
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
which is a game that's on the PlayStation Vita, of course.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's also on PlayStation 3. It was part of the PlayStation Plus package, I think, last month or the month before.

446
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I finally got around to playing it.

447
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed that game, and I want to continue playing more of it.

448
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll probably get it for my PlayStation 3, because that's a game that I would like to play on a bigger screen,

449
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
maybe more than the Vita, but for the flight, it worked great.

450
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If you don't know what this game is, it's kind of like a mash-up between something like Golden Axe,

451
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
like an arcade game, like Golden Axe type of thing, mixed with an RPG.

452
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You have a town, and you do these quests, and you go out, and you'll go to the field,

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and you go a particular path through here.

454
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah, it's neat. I enjoyed that game. It was a great way to kill a little time on the flight.

455
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There was that. I've been playing probably an unhealthy amount of Diablo III.

456
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's really the one game I've been playing more than anything else.

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I've been playing Diablo III on not only PS4, but PC as well.

458
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm playing both concurrently, because the PlayStation 4 one obviously just came out last week,

459
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
so I wanted to get a character to 70 and get my trophies and all that, right?

460
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So what else happens last week? Well, not only do they release Diablo III on the PlayStation 4,

461
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
but they release the 2.1 patch on PC, which is not on consoles.

462
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So if I want to play the newest content, like some of the new maps, and most importantly,

463
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
a seasonal character and the seasons that are going on Diablo, I've got to play on PC.

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So even though I might have quit World of Warcraft six months ago,

465
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Blizzard sure sucked me back into their universe and playing a lot of their games with Diablo III.

466
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So job well done.

467
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I bet you haven't been playing The Three Vikings.

468
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I have not been playing The Three Vikings, unless they have a cameo that I'm not aware of.

469
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Only in a while.

470
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Only in a while.

471
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So nothing about the new expansion or anything that they've revealed so far,

472
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
making you interested in jumping back into WoW again?

473
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to make this short. I'm actually in the beta for Warlords of Draenor on World of Warcraft,

474
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and I am not enthused about what I'm seeing. I hate to say that.

475
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I hate to say it about a beta, something that's still in progress,

476
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
but I'm just not seeing enough to really kind of get me interested in the game again.

477
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
When are we going to see an expansion for Final Fantasy XIV?

478
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
They're still patching it pretty rarely.

479
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They're talking about the 2.4 patch that's going to actually bring out a new class.

480
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The Rogue and the Ninja are going to be in XIV.

481
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
My next class.

482
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's in a patch, and then the Shiva fight is coming,

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and they just confirmed this week that Shiva will have a move where she does a snap,

484
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and all the ice shatters.

485
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And her boobs.

486
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes, and boobs.

487
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I thought that was in XIV.

488
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They're trying to put all the primals in XIV. They just did Ramuh in the last patch.

489
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They have Ifrit and Garuda, so now the last one is Shiva.

490
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I did make another character, by the way, so I could have it be solely a ninja.

491
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm kind of in a lull on XIV right now. I'm just sucked into Diablo right now more than XIV.

492
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I kind of log into XIV, and I'm like, I don't really want to craft.

493
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I know Alan's really enjoying it. Alan plays XIV all the time.

494
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's it, Rob. We make noobs together.

495
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We'll see. I'll just make a noob in Diablo.

496
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You make a noob in XIV, and I'll make a noob in Diablo on PC.

497
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We have to livestream it.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yes.

499
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Now I'm down.

500
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's our new project.

501
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If we're doing Diablo, we're going to do a hardcore.

502
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Because more people will watch if it's hardcore, because they're all waiting for the moment you die.

503
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because you know, in hardcore, once you die, you die. It's done. Game over.

504
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Literally game over, start from the beginning.

505
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, right?

506
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Doesn't that sound like fun, Jamie?

507
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No.

508
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That might be fun.

509
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That sounds like piss.

510
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't know if my PC would be able to run Diablo.

511
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
By the way, I apologize to any of my coworkers who are listening to this for the first time.

512
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You told your folks over at the land of cubes and tech.

513
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Locat.

514
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
A couple.

515
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Shout out.

516
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Trusted people.

517
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Where else was I? I was going to say...

518
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, one other thing I checked out briefly this week.

519
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Minecraft on the PlayStation 4 came out this week.

520
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And so I downloaded that and checked it out.

521
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I only played about 30 minutes, but it is the same thing I played on 360.

522
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Just was slightly crisper graphics, which I know is ironic because it's Minecraft and the graphics aren't exactly at selling point.

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I wanted to know since, you know, because this is not this week, but it was last week since I'm assuming you got a chance to check out some more stuff on the DK2 on the Oculus.

524
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I did. Thank you for bringing it up.

525
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes, Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus to Dragon Con.

526
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And so I did play the DevKit 2 and the game I actually played was Vanguard V, which you've talked about previously on the show.

527
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So I didn't know really anything about this game.

528
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't really own an Oculus.

529
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't follow it nearly as much as Bobby does.

530
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But every time he said, here, put this on and I'm going to press a few buttons and you're going to play a game.

531
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Every time he's done that, I've really enjoyed the experience.

532
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I'm eagerly awaiting the consumer level.

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Because you have to remember, Oculus is not really for consumers right now, but it'll get there.

534
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Just like Project Morpheus is going to get there at some point, right?

535
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So I played Vanguard V, which is a game you can control completely with your head.

536
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And it plays a lot like Rez.

537
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Like imagine you're playing Rez.

538
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's what it felt like to me.

539
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Imagine you're playing Rez, but it's where you look that fires the little red kill.

540
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That fires the bullets and everything.

541
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It was actually really fun.

542
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And the music is really good because I think it was Vert.

543
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
One of those big Chiptune guys does it, yeah.

544
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So the music was really good too.

545
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The stuff that they have for the title theme, I've been playing that in my car for weeks now.

546
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But it's just so unlike him.

547
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's like an orchestral space opera track.

548
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's just fucking amazing.

549
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But yeah, he does music in the game.

550
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And actually they're kind of doing the external crowdfunding now.

551
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
They have their own Vanguard V website now you can go to.

552
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Which I didn't, just to clarify, the full game is not out.

553
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I played, I think it's like the first level as a Kickstarter thing.

554
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah, the Kickstarter demo.

555
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But it was enough of a taste of the game for me.

556
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Where I was like, alright, if I could buy one of these devices for $250,

557
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
although I imagine it's going to be more like $300 probably,

558
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'd be into a game like this.

559
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I like that it was third person, but the way that they justified that is the queue or whatever that follows.

560
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's like Rez.

561
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's very similar to that.

562
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It didn't take me out of the element at all.

563
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I definitely had that moment when I kind of took the thing off and I'm like, whoa.

564
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Cool stuff.

565
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah, I had a good time with that.

566
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's see, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,

567
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Rama says, what's Project Morpheus?

568
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Did I call it the wrong thing or is he just being silly?

569
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, I think he's just being silly.

570
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, Act F says, to be fair, the only demo is 83.

571
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh, I see, because hardly anybody's been able to touch one of those things because it's only 83.

572
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And for the record, that game, Vanguard V, is supposed to be for the Morpheus too.

573
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:25,000
He's got the dev kit stuff, so when they do get it funded, they're going to be developing it for both platforms.

574
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I did notice too that with this new kit, they have something similar to what Morpheus has with the whole fact that the camera can track your head motions.

575
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I guess they do something like that now with the new Oculus too that I don't recall being there before.

576
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
No, I wasn't there before.

577
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, so that was, I don't know how it played into the game I was playing, but yeah, so that was a feature.

578
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Alright, so there you go, that was my gaming week. Thank you, Loki, for reminding me of one other game to give a shout out there for Vanguard V.

579
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's get into housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com.

580
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Also, be sure to follow us on YouTube, where the show is also posted, for you to listen to our vast archives quickly and easily on a variety of devices, because they got YouTube on everything, right?

581
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So we are YouTube username OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Be sure to subscribe there.

582
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And a big shout out to Jason, who runs things over at the YouTube channel and makes sure things get posted in a timely manner.

583
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Although they do intentionally lag one week behind. We do want to push people to the podcast first. That's kind of our bread and butter.

584
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But for those that are interested in checking out old episodes or an archive or going directly to like 1 hour 17 minutes in a previous episode, you know, YouTube is a great way to be able to do that.

585
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Alright, let's get into the news. We're going to start tonight. I'm not going to do last week's news set to Holic, because there's really one big thing that everybody's talking about from last week, and Loki's going to get into that right now.

586
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, so Nintendo, they announced a brand new 3DS hardware SKU called the New 3DS, because apparently they've fired whoever comes up with clever names for their, you know, hardware.

587
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And this should, no one should be confused what the New 3DS is versus the old 3DS. I mean, I'm sure consumers, especially in, you know, North America and stuff that confuse the Wii and Wii U will have no trouble discerning 3DS and New 3DS.

588
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah. So what is the...

589
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Alright, I have to say this though. Didn't Apple kind of do this, and it was fine for them?

590
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
No, I actually bought a new iPad.

591
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think it's stupid. And I understand that, you know, that they have the new iPad and stuff, but it's just spec-wise it's a little bit different, but...

592
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
For...

593
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Plus, for me, on the iPad, the big thing that finally made me buy an iPad when I did was the retina display. Like, the retina display was such a huge jump from the prior iPad for me, and I realize everybody looks for different features, but for me, I was like, okay, I'm going to invest in one of these new iPads now.

594
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So, but the 3DS, this new 3DS, doesn't seem to have that big of a jump.

595
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It does, actually.

596
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Does it really?

597
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Well, here's the thing. It's got quite a few additional features to it. First off, they're going to have both the XL, or LL version that's called in Japan, and the regular 3DS size.

598
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It has different buttons. It's got apparently better 3D, so the way 3D's a little bit better is the camera tracks where your face is and adjusts the 3D projection to hit your eyes so that you're not, like, losing it if you're not straight on with it.

599
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's got this weird second, like, C-Stick nub thing that's on the right-hand side, so they're comparing it to the C-Stick that was on, like, the GameCube and stuff.

600
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's got NFC built in. Also, the ZR and ZL buttons that were in that Circle Pad Pro, so I guess with the nub and those extra buttons, it's almost like the Circle Pad Pro's built into it now.

601
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:23,000
They've got, like I said, the buttons now are colored kind of like how they were on the Famicom, or I should say the Super Famicom.

602
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Better battery. It's compatible with micro SD cards now instead of the standard SD card. You can back up your data wirelessly.

603
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
One of the things I think is really cool about it is they've fucking fixed the web browser in it now, so now it supports HTML5, which...

604
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Would they be able to stream this show through that? Are we doing HTML5, or is that, you know, Flash still?

605
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You've got to ask Bobby, because I don't know.

606
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No, we're doing HTML5 so that it can be run on iOS.

607
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh yeah, it runs on iOS, so it's HTML5.

608
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So yes, you would be able to listen to our show through the web browser.

609
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Okay, well now I'm a fan.

610
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So I think that's pretty cool. I mean, I'm just glad that they improved the web browser, because I mean, that's pretty sweet.

611
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And of course, the CPU's improved, and now I think it's also got more RAM or something in it.

612
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And you can also clip on different covers for it, so if you want to like, you know, put like a Pokemon cover on it or something, you can do that.

613
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And it'll snap on, and then say later on you decide, oh I want, you know, a Smash Brothers cover, you can snap on a Smash Brothers one.

614
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Here's the problem though. Like with everything, you know, if it was just this cool hardware upgrade and stuff, that would be cool.

615
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But, they're going to make games that only run on the new 3DS, because it's a slightly improved CPU and stuff that these games will not run on the regular 3DS.

616
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So can you imagine, say you're buying, you know, a new game or something, a new Zelda game that runs only on the new 3DS for your 3DS.

617
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You know, I want Zelda for the 3DS, you know, I think that you're going to get confusion again, because it's just, you know, it's not like the iPad, the new iPad, where if I go on, you know, the iOS store, I know all that shit works with my iPad.

618
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You know, whether I have one iPad or the other iPad, it's going to just work.

619
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Technically you could run into issues with things that you use, because at some point you aren't able to use the old iOS systems anymore on old devices.

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Very, very early ones are the only ones excluded.

621
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Right. In the iPad world right now, right. But the phones, certainly, I don't think the 3G.

622
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't know if you've actually read up on the iOS 8 stuff, the stuff that came out of the developers conference. It's supposed to go, I think, as low as the 4S.

623
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Okay.

624
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And that's, we're looking three years back, four years.

625
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't have an iPad touch and they stopped supporting it.

626
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
No.

627
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Or iPad touch, I'm sorry.

628
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
There's a lot I want to say about this 3DS thing. Okay. A, did they announce this for the US yet? Or were they going off the Japanese announcement?

629
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We're just going off the Japanese announcements right now.

630
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So they could change the name for the US. They could. It could still be a 3DSi or something. They might still change the name here, right?

631
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't think that they will.

632
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But you don't know that they won't either.

633
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I would be very surprised if they changed the name. I don't think that they will.

634
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
They've never changed system names except for Famicon.

635
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The only difference you're going to see is it's going to be new. The only difference you're going to see is a new 3DS XL and not LL.

636
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The only difference is a descriptive term.

637
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yep. DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS. I mean, they have been naming them differently every time, so I don't see why they wouldn't.

638
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But to be fair, they did it in Japan too.

639
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But I'm talking about from Japan to the US.

640
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Right.

641
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Where there have been very minor changes as far as what comes out of there versus what comes out of here.

642
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Aside from the Famicon and Super Famicon and the Super Nintendo and Nintendo, the only difference we've had naming-wise would probably be the XL and LL. That's really the only differences we've seen.

643
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And now the only game that they've announced so far that will only work on new 3DS that will not work on old 3DS is Xenoblade.

644
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But it's simply a port of the Wii game that Nintendo gimped the sales up from the beginning by only selling it through two retailers, one of them being themselves, right?

645
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah.

646
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And that they waited far too long to release.

647
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So essentially they're giving Xenoblade a second go because they realized they fucked up the first time. My opinion.

648
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But that's the only game. It's a port of a game that's been out for a while. So I'm not convinced I need one still.

649
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This would be great if maybe I didn't have a 3DS yet or I didn't have a 3DS XL or whatever. I would be like, okay, I can get this new one.

650
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But since I just bought that Zelda 3DS XL not that long ago, I'm not really interested in this until maybe they announce a few more of these must-have games that will only work on the new.

651
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Well, I'm trying to understand this. Why the hardware refresh again? I mean, I don't think 3DS sales are tanking. I mean, they're doing really well.

652
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't understand why they need to refresh the hardware again.

653
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
A lot of handheld companies do it. Apple does it every year. Samsung does it every year. They all do it every year.

654
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I mean, they're definitely not feeling the pressure to compete against Vita. If they were feeling the pressure to compete against Vita, they would probably support Unity or something.

655
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I think they're competing against the iPhone way before they're competing against the Vita.

656
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
In my opinion. I don't know. It's just kind of...

657
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay, and then here's my tinfoil hat thing. Loki, feel free to shoot a hole through this theory, but it's something I've been stewing on a little bit.

658
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Because I know in prior weeks on this program we had the whole speculation about the trademarks that were filed about the...

659
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And I don't remember what they called it, but it was basically the Nintendo Synergy or something where...

660
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I don't remember what the hell it was called, but it was basically that they were trying to bring the Wii U and the 3DS more in parity.

661
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Or it was Nintendo's next console maybe, not even just the Wii U, but whatever Nintendo's planning next.

662
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And the 3DS a little bit more in line with each other. That they're trying to maybe develop one game for both things and that whole thing.

663
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Could it be that this new 3DS is being launched with the souped up things and the new buttons because...

664
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay, here's Crazy Rob talking. It will function as a Wii U gamepad.

665
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I don't think so.

666
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Why not?

667
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Why not? Because first off, the controls on it aren't going to be close enough to the way they have on the Wii U.

668
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I mean, I guess they could do that.

669
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I've always been thinking that it's not going to necessarily function as a Wii U gamepad, but that the Wii U would support 3DS titles instead.

670
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That you would see 3DS titles on the Wii U since the gamepad could function as the bottom screen and the TV would function as the top screen.

671
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So I don't know if they're going to do that.

672
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Honestly though, if it can support Wii looking Xenoblade or something like that.

673
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
If it can support that, that's kind of a Wii level game.

674
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's kind of cool if they could...

675
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It is a Wii level game.

676
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, it is a Wii level game, but I don't know.

677
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It would make more sense if this was along the lines of the Wii or something.

678
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Whether, oh, okay, we're developing a game or making games for both systems.

679
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The handheld doesn't have to process all the data.

680
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It only has to read the feed coming in from the near broadcast field thing that comes in from the Wii U.

681
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It doesn't have to actually process the data.

682
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, the NFC stuff is for the fucking Amiibo figures. That's all that's for.

683
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's not for anything else. That's just that shit.

684
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Okay, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Kazuto says they have a new 3DS because everyone cried for two thumbsticks and more console-like. That's why.

685
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But what games really support that?

686
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

687
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's not like we have this barrage of...

688
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't even know where to get one of those 3DS control pad pros anymore.

689
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Those control pad...

690
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There's Kid Icarus and some Resident Evil games.

691
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, it was Resident Evil Revelations, Kid Icarus, and Monster Hunter were the only games.

692
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Is Smash Brothers going to use it?

693
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Smash Brothers will use the C-Stick, yes.

694
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Maybe that's why.

695
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Or it can as an option.

696
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Alright.

697
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
actdeft agrees with you, Loki. He doesn't think so either as far as what I was suggesting.

698
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob, actually.

699
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So, some folks thinking there might be something there.

700
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Dark Tetsuya says, we won't get the new 3DS until 2015, I heard.

701
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Of course. You're not going to get it this year.

702
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I imagine this is a holiday 2015 thing, maybe?

703
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't know if it would be holiday.

704
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That does seem far out, doesn't it?

705
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It could be like March.

706
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It could be March. Maybe just before the end of the financials or something.

707
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I just...

708
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Well, maybe that's why they're doing it, to try and pad the financials a little bit.

709
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I would think that they would need a game that really shows the system off.

710
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Once again, though, I still don't understand.

711
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They're literally throwing out SKUs left and right.

712
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's like they're just throwing everything out there to see what sticks.

713
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Like, oh, seriously.

714
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
They're like, oh, people don't want 3D graphics, so we got the 2DS.

715
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Unless that 2DS was just because, oh, people think they're going to go blind with 3D.

716
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
These 3D displays are going to make you go blind or something.

717
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes, because the 3D outside of those displays make me go blind, too.

718
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The 2DS was a Pokemon system, plain and simple.

719
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I mean, I still don't understand what the point is, but it's like, okay, we don't want 3D.

720
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
We do want 3D.

721
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's like they have so many SKUs out there now, but at the same time, it's like this isn't the system that needs help.

722
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The Wii U needs help.

723
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Help the Wii U.

724
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
3DS is fine.

725
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You're doing great with the 3DS already.

726
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Are they?

727
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I think they are, yes.

728
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I don't think that they're having a problem selling these systems.

729
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
There's plenty of games coming out for it.

730
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Most of the publishers out there support the system because it's rocking.

731
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's just, I don't know, like are they trying to go more hardcore with this?

732
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I mean, they're trying to like get the hardcore crowd.

733
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Are they thinking that's what's happening is that the hardcore crowd's buying Vita's?

734
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Because I can tell you what's happening with the Vita's.

735
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Nobody's buying the Vita's.

736
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You know what's happening with the hardcore crowd?

737
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
They have too much time playing hardcore games on consoles and PCs.

738
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That's why they're not buying a 3DS.

739
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's why I wouldn't buy a 3DS, because I don't have enough time to play a 3DS and console and PC.

740
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I agree to a point that I would rather see a Xenoblade reimagining or reconfiguring on the Wii U,

741
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
but then again, there is a game coming from the same developers in 2015, so we know that.

742
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm going to our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com.

743
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Kaijuto says Monster Hunter is a huge game, which I believe was in response to what the other circle pad used for.

744
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's a huge game in Japan.

745
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Well, but the Japanese market is important, and where has this 3DS only been announced so far? In Japan.

746
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So he could be onto something there, because this is upgrading for a Monster Hunter.

747
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Because the last Monster Hunter game didn't sell systems.

748
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Not here.

749
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
No, not here. It did not sell systems.

750
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And any Monster Hunter game that's come out here hasn't really sold systems.

751
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So I just...

752
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't think that's really...

753
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I mean, yeah, it's a good game, but it's just not as big over in North America.

754
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It's just, in Japan it does really well.

755
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And it's too bad, because it looks like a fun game.

756
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's just, you know, it's not something that's super mainstream, I guess.

757
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
All right. Well, we could go on and on with this topic.

758
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'll just quickly say this.

759
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
AkumaJP in chat says, not true, Loki.

760
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Vita is not selling well there, because no good game there.

761
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
There's a ton of games coming out in Japan.

762
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You know, the Vita, the interesting thing about the Vita...

763
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Didn't he say good games?

764
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, I just talked about one that I thought was pretty good at the top of the show, Dragon's Crown.

765
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I thought that was a good game, and it's available on the Vita.

766
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
However, it's also available on the PlayStation 3.

767
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And a lot of the Vita stuff is ports of PS3 and 4 stuff.

768
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's really to have Sony-branded crap with you wherever you go.

769
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's kind of where the Vita's at right now.

770
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But, to their credit, at least that stuff, the cross saves work just fine, which is fantastic.

771
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And Nintendo, come on, that would be fantastic if you put out Mario Kart 8 on the 3DS and Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U and had the saves go back and forth.

772
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That would be fantastic.

773
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I would love to see something like that, but honestly, I think they're just going to need a new console to come out.

774
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And unfortunately, I don't think that whatever new console does come out is still going to be up to the specs of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

775
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I just wish that they would put something out that was equal to that.

776
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Then we can start talking about, you know, it wouldn't be so hard developing games for them.

777
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It would be pretty easy to port shit over.

778
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And if they're going to do that, they need to do it soon, because the problem with the Wii U is that, great, you launch something that has Xbox 360 specs a year before you're already dwarfed.

779
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You know what I mean?

780
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So if they're going to bring something out in parity with Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it has to happen sooner rather than later.

781
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Because they wanted to keep the price down because they thought they were going to win on price.

782
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And unfortunately, yeah, you could win on price, but you also have specs of the system from last generation.

783
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And so now, you know, people are just going to buy that system that has a ton of games for it versus your new system that clearly doesn't have a ton of games for it.

784
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
All right. Well, good discussion, you guys.

785
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But just in the interest of time and the fact that it's already 7 o'clock, I want to just table the other new 3DS discussion to our mailbag or possibly phone calls later in the show.

786
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Again, you can always email us with your thoughts.

787
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

788
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Meanwhile, I want to move into other news, though, from this week.

789
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Sony did a little press conference over in Japan where they announced some upcoming features for the PlayStation 4.

790
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
A PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.0, one of the big things they're going to unveil with that is themes.

791
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So you know how the PlayStation 3 had a theme in the operating system?

792
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, now if you are sick of the Sony Blue that is on the PlayStation 4, you can change that to a variety of different themes that will be available.

793
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And I'm sure they'll sell some and some will be free with PlayStation Plus and, you know, so on and so on.

794
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Toro and Kuro were featured, these Japanese characters, a little more famous for PlayStation Japan, were featured in one particular theme that was demoed during the presentation.

795
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So that's pretty cool that that's going to be happening.

796
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I would like to see more of being able to rearrange some of the shit on the crossbar.

797
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Like, I need to be able to arrange my games differently because I have so much crap on PlayStation 4 now thanks to all the PlayStation Plus and the fact that anything you put a disc in for becomes an icon on your bar.

798
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Like, I could scroll to the right forever for things.

799
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Weren't they doing folders or something like that?

800
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
If that was announced that I missed it, I would love that, though.

801
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't remember if that was a hopeful feature or if that was, I thought, I'm going to check this out.

802
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I thought they had folders coming, like, in an update or something like that.

803
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That would be fantastic.

804
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh, that's what it was.

805
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It was a new, it was a PlayStation 4 user interface design. They apparently leaked.

806
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It says users will get folders to organize games and apps.

807
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But I don't remember if that was faked or not. I can't remember if that was the case or if it was real.

808
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But that'd be cool if you had folders.

809
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, floor.

810
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Some other big game announcements coming out of this news announcement that Sony did over in Japan.

811
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Disgaea 5 will be hitting the PlayStation 4 in 2015 in Japan.

812
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Again, this isn't confirmed for the US. I would imagine it's likely here, but who knows if that means holiday 2015 or later or who knows what.

813
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So that is pretty cool that that's happening. A lot of people will be throwing printies.

814
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Persona 5 also going to be coming to the PlayStation 4.

815
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Now, Persona 5, I believe, had already been announced for PS3, but they will be bringing a version out on PlayStation 4 as well.

816
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Because PlayStation 4 has been selling pretty well. A lot of people have upgraded. It makes sense for them to release on PlayStation 4.

817
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So Persona fans, I'm sure, are very happy about that.

818
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And Dark Sakura, I know you're a fan of this series. Not everybody has necessarily played these games.

819
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But over in Japan, there will be a new game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in the Ys series.

820
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Ys.

821
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Not to be confused with wise.

822
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Ys.

823
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But a lot of people say wise.

824
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And they're wrong. It's Ys.

825
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So that will be happening. This all, again, coming out of the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2014 press event.

826
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It will be coming out in the 2015 window for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Again, that's Japan.

827
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Tokyo Game Shows this week, right?

828
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
This week or next week. I don't remember. I thought it was one more week.

829
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I think it's this week.

830
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It could be. Akuma's in chat. He should know.

831
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm just curious to see if The Last Guardian's gonna be there.

832
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Ah, don't hold your breath.

833
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It might be this week because I know Square Enix unveiled their lineup for Tokyo Game Show and Final Fantasy XV is not there.

834
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
There's supposed to be a Konami panel where they're showing off...

835
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Well, it said more PT stuff, but I don't think they would show that same demo that's been out forever.

836
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I mean, hopefully that means we're gonna see more Silent Hill stuff.

837
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
AkumaJP says next week for Tokyo Game Show.

838
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Okay.

839
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So there you go.

840
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

841
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, we've been focusing on the other two. How about a little bit of attention for Microsoft?

842
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Why not?

843
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, they are tweaking the Xbox Live reward program to add some different features.

844
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And one of this right now is ways to earn credits for what you buy or what you've done.

845
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
This is for Xbox One and Xbox 360.

846
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
They have a star system that will give you rebates on your purchases.

847
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You have to spend a lot of money there to get it to work.

848
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
To get one star, you have to spend $150 annually.

849
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And then that gives you a 1% rebate.

850
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And you can get up to 5% through earning stars.

851
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You do this through your Live Gold.

852
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You do this, you know, like I said, through buying stuff.

853
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But Live Gold members will have that doubled.

854
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The typical way, like I said, is making purchases.

855
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
There will be different promotions open that, like, you buy certain things.

856
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
You get a certain amount of credit.

857
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And then there will also be surveys monthly and referring friends to the program.

858
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Gold members will earn 1,000 credits by just downloading and playing one of the free games with Gold.

859
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Releases for 10 hours. That's an example.

860
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There's a lot of information on it.

861
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Actually, through the Xbox Live rewards website at rewards.xbox.com.

862
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
$150 sure seems like a lot to spend in a year.

863
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But at the same time...

864
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In a year? That's three games?

865
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, that's where I'm having trouble.

866
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm sure there's people sitting there going, Rob, you're an idiot.

867
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But it's because I don't buy a lot of my disc-based games, for lack of a better term, digitally.

868
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But I can see where they're trying to give incentive now for people to do that.

869
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Like, the Wii U had done this too with the whole Premium Bundle that they had.

870
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Unless you get a registration code for buying physical copies.

871
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
That would be cool, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

872
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And the reason why, and we've talked about this on the show before,

873
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
is that you've got to give value to the digital games for the equity you lose in the physical games.

874
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Of being able to sell the game back.

875
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And Steam does this very well by bargain basementing the digital price.

876
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And so they say, hey, it's ten bucks over here.

877
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Exactly, that's my thing.

878
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
A lot of these new release games that come out digitally are the same damn price as...

879
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And there's nothing extra with it.

880
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Here's what's... Well, and I know we'll get into it a little later in the show,

881
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
but I think Destiny in some ways, and I know we're going to get into it later,

882
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but one thing they're doing with the collector's edition, they're trying to sell that digitally too.

883
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You know, they're really pushing the digital angle.

884
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And I think this is why, is because they're trying...

885
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
This is the creative way to get out the resale market.

886
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
My problem with digital distribution in general is that, I mean, you think about it this way.

887
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You have very little in the cost of advertising, packaging, shipping.

888
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
The companies are saving a lot of money, but they're not cutting the prices on the content.

889
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Exactly.

890
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And I don't even think that adding incentive like this for buying the content at full price is going to be enough.

891
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
There has to be another incentive, and that's where Steam is succeeding with that.

892
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Because they are making just enough overhead, I think, that they're turning an okay profit for their end of things.

893
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
But they're also, I think, being, they get their revenue in other ways as well.

894
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Packaging though, packaging for games is so damn cheap.

895
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's not, it's just really cheap.

896
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
But it's still money.

897
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's a couple bucks, but seriously though, like marketing funds, yeah, that's expensive.

898
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
They spend several million dollars.

899
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I think it's a hundred million dollars they're spending on just marketing Destiny.

900
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah.

901
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
What we heard about that was, it's a half billion dollar game, isn't it?

902
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Probably with marketing, yeah, throwing in there, it's probably, yeah, that's about right.

903
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah, I mean, again with the whole digital.

904
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You know where they're doing well with digital, it seems though.

905
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You know what they're doing smartly, and what Sony and Microsoft have both done, and I believe Nintendo has done this as well,

906
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
very smart to push the games digitally, is the whole pre-download and be able to play the game at 12.01 AM.

907
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Pre-load or whatever they call it, you know what I mean?

908
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm just trying to make my, so basically you get to download it and it activates right at release.

909
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Right, and this is a big thing Destiny's doing, is that if you download the game,

910
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
they are really buying into the instant gratification needs of the gaming community, which be real,

911
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
there's a lot of people in the gaming community that need that instant gratification.

912
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I want to play it now.

913
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
They want it.

914
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Right.

915
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And they're too used to getting their way.

916
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And you know what would help doing that is pre-order DLC.

917
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Stop doing this fucking retailer exclusive pre-order DLC and make that digital pre-order DLC.

918
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No, don't encourage them.

919
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I would like to tell the entire gaming community right now,

920
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
game makers are not, you're not entitled to your game now. End of story.

921
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But at the same time, well, I, but I know people who really love the digital thing.

922
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Good for them. Let them take advantage of it and let them read through whatever benefits there are from it.

923
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You know, but if you want to push that, you need to make it more attractive.

924
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And I don't think having the game O release, like when I'm going to be awake for an hour to play it,

925
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
or the average person is going to be awake for an hour to play it before they have to go to work the next day.

926
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You know, that's nothing that that's, that's bread, you know, little, here's a few crumbs.

927
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Thank you, sir. May I have another, whatever.

928
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
All I know is I've got money I got to spend on my Xbox account.

929
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So I'm probably gonna end up buying destiny just because I've got to spend that money.

930
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So it doesn't expire.

931
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You can run the VoG network crew on the Microsoft platforms because Bobby me.

932
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
No, no. Travis is on Microsoft as well.

933
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So you and Travis will be on the Microsoft site.

934
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I do want the PlayStation version.

935
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No, I mean, that's what it's like me and Diablo.

936
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
If only I had a way to transfer my Xbox money onto my PlayStation account, it would just be fantastic.

937
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Let's talk about my sick problem with Mass Effect.

938
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So should we remind everybody that I own the trilogy for Mass Effect on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

939
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
The only thing I don't have is Mass Effect three on the Wii U and the minute that sick puppy.

940
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Well, I'll probably when it's $20 in a bargain bin, I'll probably have that too.

941
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Let's be real.

942
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I had zero need for it on another system.

943
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We'll also have it on PlayStation four whenever they do an HD or remix.

944
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Bring it the fuck on.

945
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I want multiplayer Mass Effect on PlayStation four so fucking bad.

946
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Did you hear about the Dragon Age Inquisition multiplayer supposed to be similar to Mass Effect?

947
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yes.

948
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And I am excited.

949
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I was not really like foaming at the mouth over Dragon Age like Alan and Shane were.

950
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But now that like I'm hearing about all this other stuff, I'm like, now I'm going to fucking play Dragon Age two.

951
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Rob, I put in my order for it already for the deluxe edition.

952
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Of course you did.

953
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Was there any ever any doubt?

954
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It's except Shane and I were having a chat because we're both at low cat about like romance options.

955
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And everybody that I wanted to romance is not an option.

956
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Namely, very Vivian and Morgan.

957
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah, but you'll be on the PC hackers going to hack.

958
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You'll be able to romance whoever you want within months.

959
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
OK, then tell me why you can't.

960
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You'll be able to romance Paris.

961
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm going to put Garris in my team and then I'll reinvent my hawk on Dragon Age.

962
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
That would be awesome.

963
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
They can put Thomas the Train in Skyrim.

964
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
They can put Garris in Dragon Age.

965
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Go romance yourself.

966
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
All right.

967
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Let's move on.

968
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Loki, what do you got?

969
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
This is kind of cool.

970
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
This is a brand new kind of VR headset powered by Oculus.

971
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It's the Samsung Gear VR headset.

972
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And what's kind of cool about this is that it actually uses the Galaxy Note 4.

973
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And it's this thing that it plugs into basically that makes it into almost like an Oculus Rift.

974
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
More like the dev kit one, though, because it doesn't have the actual spatial tracking.

975
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But still pretty cool.

976
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And they've got a lot of people already making games for it, including they even showed off like a VR version of Temple Run.

977
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So I'm kind of on it.

978
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But yeah, I can't afford a new phone right now, but looks cool.

979
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And of course, it would be separate on top of the phone, which I'm guessing would be kind of expensive on top.

980
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But it's supposed to be out later this year.

981
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So we'll see.

982
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
They haven't announced pricing or when exactly we're going to see it yet.

983
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But I don't know.

984
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's kind of exciting that we're seeing a lot of stuff out now.

985
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And it's actually a consumer piece.

986
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So looking forward to it.

987
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Bobby talked about this a lot on his show tonight.

988
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
The Bobby Blackwell show, which is on before us at vognetwork.com.

989
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And he had been talking about, and I kind of agree with this, that it's going to be good that this is going to establish like a baseline kind of product.

990
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Where things can be optimized for this.

991
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Does that make sense?

992
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So that's kind of exciting.

993
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's kind of interesting to see VR on cell phones, I guess.

994
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
If that makes sense.

995
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Because this is going to be running on like a cell phone platform.

996
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So the thing that I like that's kind of cool about it is it is wireless.

997
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And one of the things I always worry with with the Oculus Rift is I have a laptop.

998
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It's a gaming laptop, I guess, if you will.

999
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But gaming laptops aren't exactly the same as a gaming PC.

1000
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's not spec-wise the most powerful thing on earth.

1001
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And a lot of the games I can't run in high.

1002
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's kind of a medium settings based PC, if you will.

1003
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So I don't know how well the Oculus Rift would run on my laptop.

1004
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But something like this that uses the phone to power it might be kind of cool.

1005
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Or something like Project Morpheus, which is supposed to have something externally,

1006
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
doing a lot of the computation for it would be fantastic.

1007
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I hope that when the Oculus Rift does come out that we have something like that.

1008
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Like Project Morpheus where it has something doing some extra computation

1009
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
so that people like me that don't have the most powerful system ever

1010
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
can still run it rather well.

1011
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
All right. Can we go back to a previous topic real quick here before we get into the next story?

1012
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Because you bought it.

1013
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Let's get into I need to play something here before we do the next segment here.

1014
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I know this is a little early.

1015
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I need to give an F.U. of the week to act deft in chat.

1016
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Don't let him act deft for your weakness.

1017
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Act deft during Loki reading that last article there linked me on Amazon.com

1018
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
to Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U for 13 bucks. 13 bucks.

1019
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It'll be here on Wednesday.

1020
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Rob. Rob. Stand up.

1021
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm standing.

1022
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Come here.

1023
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'm coming over.

1024
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Hand.

1025
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Here's my hand.

1026
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Why did you slap my hand?

1027
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Bad Rob.

1028
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
No. No.

1029
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Bad.

1030
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Says the lady who bought a video.

1031
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Bad consumer whore.

1032
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No. Says the lady who bought a video game with a fucking dish.

1033
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
No. I will not have this fuckery.

1034
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Technically Dan bought it. For me.

1035
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I will not have this fuckery because guess what?

1036
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It also had a clock.

1037
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Guess what?

1038
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Come Wednesday I own every release of Mass Effect there has been.

1039
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You're still naughty.

1040
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
BioWare just put your cock in my mouth.

1041
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Seriously.

1042
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Rob. Rob is a bottom for Mass Effect.

1043
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
That's not true. Whatever you read on the bathroom stall is not true.

1044
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh my god. I cannot believe I just fucking bought it.

1045
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I can.

1046
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Or.

1047
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Alex in chat going are you fucking serious right now?

1048
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Rob is a consumer whore.

1049
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You know you probably could have gotten that used somewhere like for a lot less than 13 dollars.

1050
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Yeah.

1051
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
On top of that it's actually supposed to be not like very great.

1052
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Because it like cuts out so many of the different options.

1053
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That like you have no option to save the council.

1054
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You like.

1055
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's just all kinds of missing stuff.

1056
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It was really strange when they gave you the option to romance Mario.

1057
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I just didn't understand why they had to throw that into that version of the game.

1058
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
But there it was.

1059
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And.

1060
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
No. Rob doesn't do the Garris romance right?

1061
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You always romance Caden.

1062
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I always romance Caden.

1063
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So.

1064
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Okay. Then you have to make me a promise in this one.

1065
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Oh god. What?

1066
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You're going to romance Steve.

1067
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I don't want to be some dude's rebound.

1068
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You're. It won't be the rebound.

1069
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
But you have to do this for me.

1070
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Alright. Fine. Fine. I'll do it.

1071
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Your first play through you romance Steve.

1072
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
For Dark Sakura I will romance Cortez.

1073
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Cortez.

1074
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Corteshep. I don't know. I don't know how you.

1075
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Sheptez.

1076
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Alright.

1077
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I will call it Sheptez.

1078
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Now. Now Alan is. Alan is giving me a mini lecture in chat right now.

1079
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And the story simulator to set up your career is missing hella shit.

1080
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Like Dark Sakura said.

1081
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Don't sit there and tell me you are not morbidly curious.

1082
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
That you don't have an ounce of morbid curiosity.

1083
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I've seen it.

1084
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
The one cool thing is that whole map thing on the thing.

1085
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Yeah.

1086
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's fun.

1087
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
You know what?

1088
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
What?

1089
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I did that with my PC by calling it the internet.

1090
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And I want to play multiplayer.

1091
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Is anybody playing Mass Effect 3 on Wii U multiplayer?

1092
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Echo. Echo.

1093
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

1094
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Mass Effect. Mass Effect. Mass Effect.

1095
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Wii. Wii. Wii.

1096
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You.

1097
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Rob.

1098
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Rob.

1099
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I can't believe. It was 13 bucks.

1100
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Rob.

1101
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Give me a break. What?

1102
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
You know what else you can get for 13 bucks?

1103
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Uh. Lunch.

1104
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Really bad heroin.

1105
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
But you don't see people going out and getting really bad heroin.

1106
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
This is really bad heroin for him.

1107
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I can't. Is there anybody out there?

1108
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Is there anybody out there who says, you know what, Rob?

1109
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Good job.

1110
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Is there anybody out there who says, Rob?

1111
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Rob, the entire internet at this moment is judging you.

1112
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And just think of how much more judgment will go during the podcast.

1113
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
But you brought the Wii version.

1114
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm gonna say something.

1115
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's a special edition.

1116
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Like as in special bus.

1117
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Dark Sakura could be a lot worse.

1118
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Cause I'm not a woman.

1119
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Right now in gaming.

1120
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Alright. You know what?

1121
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Seriously. Enough with you.

1122
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I am so tired of hearing about like, you know.

1123
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yes. Guess what?

1124
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
There's dicks on the internet.

1125
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Both physically, you know, literally and metaphorically.

1126
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Okay.

1127
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Did we just start playing games on the internet?

1128
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Do we not know that there's people out there that will do crazy, stupid shit when they're anonymous?

1129
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Really?

1130
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Are you at all surprised that this is happening?

1131
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Because I'm not at all surprised at all that this is happening.

1132
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
There actually is a study out about mental illness and anonymous bashing of other people.

1133
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
That they are technically sociopaths.

1134
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
For the record, it's all straight up fuckery.

1135
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But that's why I had to have a laugh at its expense.

1136
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So.

1137
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
By the way.

1138
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
What?

1139
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Bitch.

1140
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Let's see.

1141
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, good job Rob. Thank you.

1142
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And no one can call me a whore for it because I do not have the Garris moe pillow.

1143
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
There you go.

1144
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Alright. There we go.

1145
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Thank god.

1146
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Alright.

1147
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I want to know where Shane is during all of this.

1148
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Sleeping.

1149
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Alright.

1150
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I need some judgement in here.

1151
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Alright.

1152
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Alright.

1153
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Well, here's a console I will not be able to buy Mass Effect on because it doesn't exist.

1154
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
On the Ouya.

1155
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yes, the Ouya is still out there selling systems.

1156
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Actually, you know when the Ouya came to GamerX, they were showing off some pretty interesting

1157
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
looking things on the Ouya.

1158
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The rabbit game.

1159
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah.

1160
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
A lot of that stuff looked really cool.

1161
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I know the guys over at GamerX and gals and everybody over at GamerX are really pushing

1162
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
the read only memories thing and that's an Ouya thing.

1163
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
But maybe the Ouya is going to become something a little different because the Ouya, apparently,

1164
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
looking to be acquired.

1165
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Currently in talks with Google, Amazon, and some Chinese companies including Tencent,

1166
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
who owns Riot Games, by the way.

1167
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
This comes from some sources.

1168
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
The ever present sources with ReCode.

1169
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
No formal offers on the table yet, but we know YouTube's got a billion dollars to spend.

1170
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So, who knows?

1171
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Anything's possible.

1172
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
That'll be interesting if the Ouya does get acquired by somebody else.

1173
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That'd be very interesting if somebody like Google or Amazon got it.

1174
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I mean, I know Amazon just spent a lot of money with Twitch, so maybe they're a little

1175
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
bit, and they're trying to do their whole thing with Amazon Fire and all that too, so

1176
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
maybe they're a little bit less of a contender.

1177
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But Google, it'd be very interesting if Google walked out of this whole thing with the Ouya.

1178
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Could be interesting.

1179
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Really?

1180
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Why would they do that?

1181
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Because of the brand recognition that Ouya brings?

1182
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I mean, because I'm just thinking like, you know, a company like Google that seems to

1183
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
be pretty innovative, that they could probably whip out their own fucking console in like

1184
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
two seconds without needing the purchase.

1185
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Funny you say that, because didn't they put out the Google TV thing?

1186
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
That little USB stick or that thingy that you just plug in the TV and it's supposed

1187
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
to do all the streaming and all that?

1188
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, the Chromecast.

1189
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Okay, thank you, the Chromecast.

1190
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
That's what I'm trying to think of.

1191
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
What sold more?

1192
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Ouya's or Chromecast?

1193
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I have a Chromecast.

1194
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Do you really?

1195
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yes, I do.

1196
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't even have one.

1197
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
What sold more?

1198
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Actually, it's super awesome.

1199
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Well, considering that the Chromecast came out way after the Ouya.

1200
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It was 30 bucks.

1201
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I probably think the Chromecast sold more.

1202
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there as a question, because maybe you're asking

1203
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
like, what could Google do with Ouya, and maybe something similar to a more robust type of

1204
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Chromecast.

1205
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
They've got those, though.

1206
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
They've got like, the GameStick was supposed to be very similar to that, and they've got

1207
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
so many of these, you know, device, Android device on HDMI stick things.

1208
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I just don't see them wanting to buy this.

1209
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I mean, you want to hear something funny?

1210
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I could imagine, you know, what if GameStop bought this?

1211
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Because, you know, they're looking, they want a gaming platform.

1212
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Can you imagine?

1213
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I could see them doing that.

1214
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Don't say that, don't say that.

1215
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a code man jumping into

1216
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
the Mass Effect 3 debate a little late, but says, had to come into chat real quick to

1217
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
tell Rob I bought it this morning.

1218
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
High five, bro.

1219
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
High five.

1220
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And as you're, you know, you're high fives echo the vast nothingness that is the people

1221
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
playing on Mass Effect 3 online on the Nintendo network.

1222
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's like, dude, I'm getting my party cool because you're the only one playing.

1223
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Hey, I will play, Cody and I will be the two people playing on Wii U.

1224
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's fine.

1225
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I don't know, maybe you could, you know, beg George to play too.

1226
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
There you go.

1227
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We'll have it, the old stuff's going to be cool again.

1228
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Let's see, folks in chat seem to think the Chromecast probably sold better.

1229
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Mega Man X 400, our buddy from Video Game Realness.

1230
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah, thank you, that's right.

1231
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Chromecast sold more hands down.

1232
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I completely forgot about Android TV, yes, so there.

1233
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Don't need fucking, you know, Ouya.

1234
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
This whole, this is all speculation and tinfoil happening.

1235
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
If Google buys it, could they call it the Ouya?

1236
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm making a great marketing campaign.

1237
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Ouya!

1238
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
What's it going to do?

1239
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
It's going to Ouya.

1240
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And this is why Rob is not a marketing...

1241
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Download porn, it's a Ouya.

1242
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You know what we use our Chromecast for, by the way?

1243
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Porn?

1244
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Watching, no, watching endless, endless streams of video game playthroughs.

1245
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh, oh, I almost forgot, going way back to the new 3DS.

1246
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The new 3DS, parental locked, unless you pay money to unlock it.

1247
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Shut the fuck up, where did you hear that?

1248
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's parental locked, it's not a lot of money, it requires about 60 cents to unlock it.

1249
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
But it's parental locked when you get it, you have to pay money in order to unlock it.

1250
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1251
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Is that like just a credit card check or something?

1252
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Well, they charge you 60 cents and then they don't give you that money back.

1253
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
So I would, I guess if you want to call that a credit card check, I'd call that as a micro transaction.

1254
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
But that was something that they did, yeah.

1255
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Because, you know, those HTML5 web browsers, those are all compatible with all those porn sites out there.

1256
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Soccer, one more story before release dates.

1257
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Well, okay, you know how we have been going on and on about the Nut Neutrality thing going on,

1258
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and how it's a load of bullshit, and how different companies are going to be able to throttle our connection.

1259
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Well, on September 10th, there's actually a big protest going on by a group called Fight for the Future.

1260
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And a lot of other major sites and companies will be included on this one.

1261
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
What they're going to do is they're going to show people what the internet might look like

1262
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
if the FCC makes the changes that it wants to make.

1263
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Basically, Tom Wheeler, who's the chairman of the FCC, proposed changes that would make it okay

1264
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
for the service providers to charge content for, you know, charge for faster and better access.

1265
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:53,000
The fast lanes. So basically, there is, there's going to be, now it's not going to change the speed or anything,

1266
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
they're not going to try to throttle their own websites.

1267
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,000
But what they're going to do is start popping up things that look like rainbow wheels, or loading symbols,

1268
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:08,000
or, you know, make, just basically give you an idea of what the web's going to look like,

1269
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
how inconvenient and messy things are going to be.

1270
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It's also including Etsy, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Wordpress, Vimeo, Reddit, Mozilla, Imgur,

1271
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
is it Imgur or Imgur? Anyway.

1272
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Meetup, Cheeseburger, Namecheap, BitTorrent, Gandhi.net, Startpage, Boing Boing, and Dowola.

1273
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Some of them I haven't heard of.

1274
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We'll be also with 35 advocacy organizations and other activists to show what this is going to be looking at.

1275
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
They're going to basically put messages on there with an infinitely spinning site loading icon,

1276
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
or the wheel of death, to symbolize what the web would look like without net neutrality.

1277
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Just alert, basically, it's basically like the equivalent of standing out on the street holding signs.

1278
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It's going to be on the sites that you look at.

1279
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This is a good way to kind of bring awareness to this.

1280
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I think a lot of plugged in people I like to think already know about this,

1281
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but hopefully some of the sites participating are things that maybe are sites that people check

1282
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
that aren't necessarily going to be advocacy sort of things like, I don't know, like news websites,

1283
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
things that people, like CNN and things like that, but I don't know.

1284
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But it being on Etsy and Kickstarter, right there, though, those are pretty good.

1285
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah, those are pretty good. How about Pinterest? Can we get on Pinterest?

1286
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You know what would be funny is that if Pinterest actually changed their little pinnet icon temporarily

1287
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
to just a spinning wheel or an X, you know.

1288
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Well, just a reminder, guys, if you do not like the idea of net neutrality, write some letters,

1289
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
call Congress people, vote, vote, vote, vote.

1290
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Actually, if you do like the idea of net neutrality, then you would probably do.

1291
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Did I say it backwards?

1292
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah.

1293
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I did say it backwards, so thank you, Loki.

1294
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
If you support me buying a dictionary, vote, vote, vote.

1295
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
If you support a free and equal internet for all people who are basically all on the same type of connection

1296
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
unless you're one of those poor people in the mountains who has dial-up, they exist.

1297
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, sure. Alaska is a state.

1298
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Write Congress, write your local representatives,

1299
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
and make sure that you continue adding to the millions of others who have written into the FCC protesting this.

1300
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Make your voice heard, and I'd say hit them where it hurts.

1301
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
If, you know, I'd say, hey, especially if you're a campaign contributor,

1302
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
say I'm going to withdraw all of my campaign support until you turn this around.

1303
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Because the reason why FCC is letting this through is because they're being paid.

1304
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
They're plain and simple.

1305
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Campaign donations coming from Comcast, Time Warner, any of these companies,

1306
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,000
so that they will get the reaction out of the government that they need to lend their pockets.

1307
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
All right.

1308
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
End of story.

1309
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Before we get to the release dates, I just want to point this out because I just got a picture from Brad.

1310
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's a picture of Ouya. This is our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad.

1311
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It's a picture of his Ouya sitting on the desk, and he replied to me and he said,

1312
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
hey, don't knock the Ouya. This is my desk right now.

1313
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So I replied, hot Ouya shot.

1314
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out in a store near you.

1315
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
This week we have Destiny coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1316
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And if you're not into, you know, massive space, you know, epic shooter games, then there's hockey for you.

1317
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
NHL 15 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1318
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Also an ultimate edition of those as well if you want the extra credits for building your ultimate team.

1319
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
That's it.

1320
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
All right. I guess not a lot of people want to go up against Destiny, eh?

1321
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Nope.

1322
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Nope.

1323
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

1324
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Hey, guess what?

1325
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Destiny is a thing in Japan as well.

1326
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
September 11th is the release out over there because they get games on different days.

1327
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Also the DualShock 4 in white is also coming out in Japan to kind of celebrate that.

1328
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So check that out on the PlayStation 4.

1329
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
The Xbox One is now out in Japan.

1330
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That happened while we were out.

1331
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But no releases to note right now for the Xbox One in Japan for this week because they just obviously released it out there.

1332
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So they kind of did all the launch games already.

1333
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
PlayStation 3 will get Destiny this week as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo with Power Up Kit.

1334
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
That is a price reduction actually.

1335
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That's going into the best series along with Sangokushi 12.

1336
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
New games on the PlayStation 3 include Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Midstorm Revolution.

1337
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Because, you know, you got to have a Naruto game.

1338
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It is a day of the week ending in Y.

1339
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Eiyu Densetsu Sen no Kiseke 2 comes out in regular and limited drama CD bundle set.

1340
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Oops.

1341
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
That's the 25th.

1342
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Sorry, I got ahead of myself.

1343
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Well, there you go.

1344
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
A little preview of what's to come in two weeks.

1345
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
On the Xbox 360, Naruto Shippuden is out this week as well.

1346
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
On the Wii U, nothing until the 20th, but the 20th is Bayonetta 2.

1347
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So that's a really big release for the Wii U.

1348
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:30,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, on the 11th, Chain Chronicle 5, Criminal Girls Invitation and Sangokushi 12 gets a price reduction there.

1349
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Those last two games, price reduction games on the Vita.

1350
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Lastly but not leastly, the Nintendo 3DS.

1351
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Dairanto Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, September 13th.

1352
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Oh my God, I did not realize it was that soon.

1353
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
No wonder, my people that, my friends that own Japanese 3DSes, because you know the whole stupid thing is region locked, right?

1354
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
No wonder they're so excited.

1355
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
That is coming out, like, this week.

1356
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Holy crap.

1357
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
We're going to know a lot more about this game this week.

1358
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
We'll find out if it's true that the Duck Hunt dogs in the game are not.

1359
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's pretty cool.

1360
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'm looking forward to that being released over here.

1361
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Alright, last but not leastly, the UK, Dar Sakura.

1362
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
On the 9th, Destiny.

1363
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And on the 11th, Train Fever for Mac.

1364
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
That's it.

1365
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
They're essentially the same game.

1366
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Destiny and Train Fever.

1367
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before the classic game of the week.

1368
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Alright, speaking of Destiny.

1369
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
If you are inclined, you can purchase that digitally and guess what?

1370
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
You'll get a free upgrade to the next gen version.

1371
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That is of course if you buy a Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 version digitally.

1372
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You will get a free upgrade when, you know, for people like me that don't have a Playstation 4 or Xbox One yet.

1373
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You'll get a free upgrade to the Xbox One or Playstation 4 version depending on which platform you purchase that on.

1374
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
So, absolutely free.

1375
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000
For a limited time though. They haven't said how long that's going to last but it is for a limited time.

1376
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
On top of that you also get of course the Guardian, was it?

1377
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It also includes I guess the standard or guardian editions of the game as well as expansion passes.

1378
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So if you buy those on one platform you get them on the other one.

1379
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Cool.

1380
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And we kind of got into this a little bit earlier about the whole fact that, you know, they're really giving incentives for people to buy digitally.

1381
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
This is a huge one for people that are still on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

1382
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
In fact, it almost sounds like, Loki, this might have swayed your decision big time.

1383
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Well, I just, I don't know what the hell it's been, Mike.

1384
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I have like $70 in like fucking Xbox money, so.

1385
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Wow.

1386
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yeah, it.

1387
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Must be nice just to have that money lying around.

1388
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Long story there, but yeah.

1389
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I've got that stuck in my account and I'm like, what the fuck am I going to buy this?

1390
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So, got to pick something soon before it expires.

1391
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And then that'll be an Xbox One game if you ever get an Xbox One.

1392
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Exactly.

1393
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Alright.

1394
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Alright, lastly before we get to the classic game of the week, some updates on Mighty No. 9.

1395
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Mighty No. 9, if you were a Kickstarter backer of a certain level, you got a Mighty No. 9 beta that was available for those backers.

1396
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
A lot of this came out of PAX, so it might be just over a week old, but with a big game like Mighty No. 9, I wanted to bring this up anyway.

1397
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I've heard good things about it from people who are playing it.

1398
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah, I actually watched a Twitch stream of somebody who was kind of playing it and it looked like it was.

1399
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Our intern Drew has it.

1400
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Oh really?

1401
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yes.

1402
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So fun.

1403
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yeah, it looks like it's pretty challenging, like one of the old Mega Man games that you are going to have to kind of have that muscle memory of jump now, shoot now.

1404
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
You know, just having to get all those little patterns down, so.

1405
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You had to donate more than $80 to this in order to get this beta, but it is available and out there, so if you haven't seen this, it's all over YouTube now.

1406
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Some folks doing that.

1407
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:57,000
By the way, also coming to Mighty No. 9 multiplayer, that's pretty cool, online race battle through, and a little video posted of that earlier this week.

1408
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So this Mighty No. 9 sounds like it's going to be a pretty hot release. I'm excited about it.

1409
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Alright.

1410
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Let's go back to a simpler time.

1411
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Let's go back to a time when this game could have just been like Mega Man 11 or something.

1412
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:20,000
It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking out this game this week.

1413
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Yeah.

1414
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Not your freaking Destinies and your Diablos and whatever other crapola you're all playing this week.

1415
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah.

1416
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1417
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Well, I'm sticking with my CPS2 theme that I'd like to do for a couple months.

1418
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So I picked Mars Matrix Hyper Solid Shooting, which, yes, it was a CPS2 era game.

1419
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:55,000
This was a scrolling shooter game that came out, it was actually a vertical scrolling shooting game that was developed by Takumi in 2000 and published by Capcom for their CPS2 arcade board.

1420
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It came on the Dreamcast later on in 2001, and the arcade version actually used a horizontally aligned monitor like Giga Wink did, which is pretty rare for a shooter game.

1421
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So basically, yeah, it is a shooter game.

1422
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It's got an amazing soundtrack.

1423
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Rob, can we play a little bit of this?

1424
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
That's just the splash screen.

1425
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
But I liked it when you get to the pickle ship, so it's going to pop up in a second.

1426
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
All right, tell us a little- oh, here we go.

1427
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That's really good.

1428
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Oh yeah, this is a club song right here.

1429
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Well, the whole soundtrack was just like really just on top of it.

1430
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:50,000
It was pretty clubby, you know, but it fit the game because the game was like a kind of a rendered look to it.

1431
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It was actually really well done.

1432
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So anyway, the game only uses one button, but you have to use a different action along with the timing of how you do it.

1433
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So a normal shot is just pressing the A button.

1434
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Your shot power increases with each level up to level 8, depending on your experience points.

1435
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You have a piercing cannon, so by not pressing the A button for at least one second, you press A.

1436
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
And the attack is basically close range that hits multiple targets.

1437
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's stronger than the normal shot, and the strength also increases in proximity to the target.

1438
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
It also, though, does not change based on level.

1439
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:41,000
There's also the mosquito, where if you have like a bar up at the top that if it's full, you can hold the A button for a quarter to half a second.

1440
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,000
The barrier gets activated, which damages any enemy that touches it until the GHB gauge is drained.

1441
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Enemy bullets are attracted towards the fighter as well.

1442
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:00,000
When you release the A button while the GHB is not empty, it causes those bullets to fire in any direction away from your fighter when the A button is released.

1443
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And repelled bullets can hit the enemy when it hits the enemy and is converted to a cube.

1444
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:12,000
You have the gravity hull bomb, that's the GHB by the way, where you hold the A button until the GHB gauge is emptied.

1445
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
When activated, an explosion damages all on-screen enemies and destroys all the bullets.

1446
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Each of your fighters is a little different. The Mosquito 1 is the normal speed with a wide blaster and lower shot damage.

1447
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Mosquito 2 is higher speed with a laser shot and higher shot damage.

1448
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:37,000
So you also get, of course, your 1-up and you get cubes, as I mentioned earlier, which increase your experience and recharge your combo meter.

1449
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Bigger cubes give you larger recharge time.

1450
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Rob, did you ever play this?

1451
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Actually, no I didn't. I didn't even realize this was one of the CPS2 era games.

1452
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
This one just wasn't on my radar.

1453
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Did they release this in any of the repackagings they did?

1454
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
When they did the, what, the Playstation 2?

1455
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Well, we'll be getting to that.

1456
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Excuse me.

1457
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
There's a little bit about the experience system though.

1458
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I was curious if you had ever played it since the big Dreamcast of Fran.

1459
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I haven't.

1460
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
What about you, Loki?

1461
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
No, I've never played this.

1462
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Anyway, with the experience system, you basically capture a cube, you get EXP, and your combo meter fills up.

1463
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I do like those bullet patterns though. Those are pretty sweet.

1464
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah, it's a really gorgeous game.

1465
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So basically you can deplete your combo meter if you fail to capture a cube for a prolonged period of time or if you're destroyed.

1466
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:38,000
The cubes can be found by destroying enemies or parts of enemies or hitting an enemy with a repelled bullet like the charge meter we shared before.

1467
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:45,000
When your experience is high, your level is increased and then you can have more powerful shots.

1468
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:52,000
So as far as, yeah, the other versions that were released, there was the Dreamcast version which had arcade mode.

1469
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It says that it was a perfect conversion, but the scores for the enemies are different.

1470
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:07,000
There's elite mode, which is also called a range mode, where you can adjust certain options like your combo time, ship speed, and the GHB charge speed.

1471
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
In elite mode A, enemy ships and formations are changed. In elite B, the stages are the same as arcade mode.

1472
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You have score challenge mode or score attack mode where basically you kill an enemy with a piercing cannon that causes a bunch of cubes to appear and each of the cubes will increase the capacity value by one.

1473
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
You have a shop system, strategy mode, a movie, and a gallery.

1474
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And then there's a bug where your score cannot go beyond 999,999,999,990.

1475
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And they basically, that was the bug in the arcade version and they fixed it by adding two extra digits in the score table.

1476
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:59,000
This has only been released on the Dreamcast and arcade.

1477
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So basically, nope.

1478
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version of this a 31 out of 40, which is a decent score.

1479
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:14,000
The game also from IGN got a rating of 8.5, which was great.

1480
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And there's also in the demo sequence for the arcade version, there's a voice clip that says, I'm not programmed to give you that information.

1481
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It was taken from Season 1 Episode 16 of Star Trek The Next Generation.

1482
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Oh really?

1483
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Yes.

1484
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So it's Roddenberry's wife?

1485
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Who did, because she did all those, the computer voices and stuff.

1486
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I don't think it was the computer.

1487
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Oh.

1488
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And anyway.

1489
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Nevermind.

1490
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
But also you can get the soundtrack as I have went out on a limb looking for it.

1491
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Because yeah, anyone who has it on, like for example, it was on Amazon for 85 bucks.

1492
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But it's the Mars Matrix and GigaWing 2 soundtrack box.

1493
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And that's it.

1494
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Pretty, pretty rad game.

1495
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:06,000
That's a clever way to, I don't know if it was intentional, but it was a clever way to tie the Dreamcast birthday and the CPS2 theme together.

1496
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So there you go.

1497
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It was intentional.

1498
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Alright.

1499
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Mars Matrix, classic game of the week.

1500
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
If you like your shmups, like I know Dark Sakura does, I am terrible at them.

1501
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
If you would like to try this game, I would be happy to lend you my copy.

1502
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Hooray, I gotta dust off my Dreamcast though.

1503
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I don't even know where the damn thing is.

1504
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I just love the music in it, it's so good.

1505
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah, it sounds like the soundtrack is pretty good. I like that.

1506
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including rapid fire news, our Fugu question of the week about more Dreamcast.

1507
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:42,000
We also have some news with games like Elder Scrolls Online, Dragon Quest 7, yes, news on 7, and League of Legends.

1508
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
We got plenty of that news.

1509
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Your e-mails are FUs of the Week, your phone calls are 1-877-GAMO-LR and plenty more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1510
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on September the 7th, 2014 with the 566th episode of our show.

1511
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Which means we're only 100 away from 666th since apparently a Thufferin' Thuckattach. I can't say that number.

1512
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So there it is.

1513
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
We are going to have the year of evil.

1514
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Did you think like years ago, I think we joked about episode 666, probably back during episode 66 we probably joked about it.

1515
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And to think we might actually hit that number is kind of mind blowing.

1516
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I want to say that I am spiteful enough that we should just be spiteful against reality and make it. Make it so.

1517
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Make it so. Well what is the old saying, everything I do is motivated by spite and porn?

1518
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And porn.

1519
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Is that true Loki? Is everything you do motivated by spite and porn?

1520
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I don't know about everything. Most of the things I guess.

1521
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I would have to add to that. Spite, porn and pumpkin flavored everything in the fall.

1522
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
By the way.

1523
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Because it is that time of year everybody.

1524
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I had my one and only pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.

1525
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Did you? Your one and only?

1526
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It tasted like cancer, it was fantastic.

1527
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
What? How did some?

1528
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
The whole allegation about the stuff that's in the pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.

1529
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah, no I read the Snopes article.

1530
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Well at any rate, at any rate, because I am really back on my fitness kick.

1531
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I had my one and only and that's it.

1532
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
It's delicious.

1533
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
You know what would make it better actually?

1534
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
What?

1535
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Chocolate.

1536
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I want a pumpkin mocha frappuccino.

1537
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You could probably ask for that and get that.

1538
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Don't give me ideas.

1539
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Now she's thinking.

1540
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
But pumpkin flavored everything comes in this time of year.

1541
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Because I have the pumpkin spice Keurig coffee maker cups.

1542
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Which you know the straight up coffee is not quite as bad for you as the frappuccinos.

1543
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So that's something.

1544
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And then you know I just got the email from Noah's bagels.

1545
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Pumpkin bagel with pumpkin cream cheese spread.

1546
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Good.

1547
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Pumpkin coffee.

1548
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I love it. I love it.

1549
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:13,000
And then I think Rama posted on my wall earlier a joke that was a pumpkin direct condom.

1550
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm thinking.

1551
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Yeah I've seen that on Tumblr.

1552
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
That's a little much people.

1553
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Put down the Photoshop.

1554
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Maybe if I can make it through my first week without killing people.

1555
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I will reward myself with a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.

1556
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
With a pumpkin condom?

1557
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Oh a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.

1558
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Yes yes.

1559
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
There you go.

1560
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Ew.

1561
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Rob.

1562
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Okay so you know the thing we don't have here in California.

1563
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Actually we just finally got like two weeks ago an hour and a half away.

1564
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That they have in Atlanta that I had to have was Dunkin Donuts.

1565
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And yes if you are somewhere outside of California we do not have Dunkin Donuts here.

1566
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Although well we just got our first one in Modesto of all fucking places.

1567
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I know right.

1568
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Like which is a two hour drive away.

1569
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I think there's some Modesto.

1570
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I don't know.

1571
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
People that.

1572
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I usually know people that.

1573
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Are getting out of there quickly.

1574
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Modesto.

1575
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Actually you want to hear a funny story.

1576
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
My parents met at Modesto Junior College.

1577
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Aww.

1578
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So actually every time I make fun of Modesto I really shouldn't.

1579
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
You know that movie American Graffiti is about Modesto California.

1580
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Yes.

1581
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
It was an early George Lucas movie.

1582
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
My mother went to high school with George Lucas.

1583
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Crazy right?

1584
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Huh?

1585
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,000
My aunt went to school with Jimmy Buffett.

1586
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
One of my friends went to school with Britney Spears.

1587
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Oh my gosh.

1588
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
How privileged to be in her light.

1589
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Whatever.

1590
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I'm sure she was probably pretty awful actually.

1591
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Alright so the reason why I brought up Dunkin Donuts while I was out in Atlanta.

1592
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I had to go to Dunkin Donuts which thankfully in the SunTrust Plaza which is right next

1593
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
to the hotel where Dragon Con is at.

1594
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
They had a Dunkin Donuts.

1595
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
It's only open during the week though.

1596
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I couldn't go Saturday to Sunday but on Friday I went and bless their hearts.

1597
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
They had pumpkin donuts.

1598
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And it was so good.

1599
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Rama.

1600
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I want you to go to a Dunkin Donuts.

1601
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Vacuum wrap me a couple of those.

1602
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
You know where I live.

1603
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Ship me some.

1604
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Jamie.

1605
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Jamie.

1606
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Let's.

1607
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And I can't believe I'm actually going to suggest this.

1608
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Are we going to Modesto?

1609
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Let's go to Modesto.

1610
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Oh my god.

1611
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Okay.

1612
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Okay.

1613
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Okay.

1614
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.

1615
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Yes.

1616
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I don't.

1617
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Call in.

1618
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I'm not going to call in.

1619
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yes you are.

1620
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Co-workers enlisted at the show that will tattle on me.

1621
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Co-workers do rob a solid.

1622
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
We will buy you donuts and bring them to you.

1623
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Guys.

1624
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I seriously have a problem.

1625
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
What about next Sunday before OLR?

1626
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
We'll go in the morning.

1627
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Go get donuts with the church crowd and then bring them to OLR.

1628
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And Loki, who's sitting here criticizing us, can benefit from the rewards.

1629
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Look at Rama.

1630
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Look at Rama.

1631
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Look at Rama.

1632
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Rama, I love you.

1633
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I do not want anything pumpkin spice.

1634
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I fucking hate everything.

1635
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
More for us.

1636
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Everything pumpkin spice.

1637
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Fine.

1638
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
You can have a fucking plain glazed.

1639
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
No, no, no.

1640
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't even want plain glazed.

1641
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
You keep your own fucking donuts.

1642
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Plain glazed.

1643
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Don't look like a savage.

1644
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Rob.

1645
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1646
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
What?

1647
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
You don't want sprinkles or something?

1648
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
No.

1649
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Fuck that.

1650
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I don't want anything from Dunkin' Donuts.

1651
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Fine.

1652
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
We'll eat it in front of you.

1653
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Oh, and I won't care.

1654
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
We need to like have donuts.

1655
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Nothing but donuts all day.

1656
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,320
And there's people on the East Coast that are sitting there going, those stupid Californians

1657
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,000
freaking the fuck out over Dunkin' Donuts is not even a big ass deal.

1658
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,640
You know what I would freak out more over though?

1659
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:28,800
To which I say, now you know how I feel every time you people talk about In-N-Out Burger.

1660
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,000
It is not that big of a fucking deal.

1661
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,520
You know what I would freak out more over though?

1662
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,520
What?

1663
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,520
If we got a Tim Hortons.

1664
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,520
I'd be like, oh my God, Tim Hortons.

1665
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,660
I've had a Tim Hortons donut twice.

1666
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:42,120
Burger Hortons or Tim King might become a reality.

1667
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,120
Whatever.

1668
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,120
Burger King, you suck.

1669
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,120
All right.

1670
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,480
Look, it is a, it is a video game podcast.

1671
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,200
You cannot have video games without donuts.

1672
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,640
Damn it.

1673
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,640
I have no idea.

1674
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,640
Keep in mind, I was raised with Krispy Kreme, so when I had donuts that weren't Krispy Kreme,

1675
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,560
I was like, why are they cakey?

1676
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,760
Loki may beg to differ.

1677
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,480
Can you have video games without donuts?

1678
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,760
Yeah.

1679
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,960
What can't you have video games without pizza, right?

1680
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:13,160
You can't play video games without anything, but I like pizza.

1681
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,400
Tim Hortons is yummy.

1682
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,400
What happened to Loki?

1683
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,400
You know what is good though?

1684
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,400
You guys have seen Loki.

1685
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,640
I'm putting his, I'm putting his, uh, picture on a book card.

1686
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:22,800
You know what's good though that I finally had going to SoCal was Winchell's.

1687
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Yeah.

1688
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,800
We used to have Winchell's here.

1689
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,400
There was one in Roseville when I was growing up and they closed it.

1690
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,400
Anyway.

1691
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,400
All right.

1692
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,800
Look, by the way, our friend, uh, Mega Man X 400 from a video game realness from Canada

1693
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,640
says Tim Hortons is not that big of a deal coming from Toronto.

1694
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,640
See if you live there.

1695
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,040
It's a big deal when it's different.

1696
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,040
Exactly.

1697
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,040
It's a big deal when it's different.

1698
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,040
Well, remember, okay.

1699
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,360
Remember when we had the big boom of Krispy Kremes here, Rob?

1700
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,360
Yes.

1701
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
What was my reaction?

1702
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,360
Really?

1703
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,360
It's fucking Krispy Kreme.

1704
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,480
My reaction was buy a dozen of those and eat them during work.

1705
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,480
I'm not sharing.

1706
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,520
I'm eating them all myself.

1707
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,520
And then second reaction going inside.

1708
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,840
This doesn't look like a fucking Krispy Kreme.

1709
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:11,020
What I do want over here is I want all the fucking cool shit that's on those like Chinese

1710
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:14,880
and Japanese menus at their fast food places, you know, where they build like, they build

1711
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,600
the ridiculous burgers and stuff that would kill ordinary people.

1712
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,600
No, not the shrimp burgers.

1713
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,600
I'm talking like this.

1714
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,760
Like, you know, the burger pizzas and you know, just the ridiculous stuff they have.

1715
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,340
I want the Kuro burger that was at Burger King in Japan.

1716
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:33,360
I want the Pizza Hut commercials from Japan where all the workers are cats.

1717
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,360
That's what I want.

1718
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,080
Did you ever see the Kuro burger though?

1719
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,720
No, but quickly.

1720
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:45,200
It was a black bun, like, flung with the squid ink and like black cheese and I want the goth

1721
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,200
burger.

1722
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,200
All right, rapid fire news time, guys.

1723
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,160
Let's talk quickly about some video game topics.

1724
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,600
We just, it's a busy week.

1725
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,800
We have to get these out quickly.

1726
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:01,560
So Mortal Kombat X is finally nailed down the release date, tentatively, as April 14th,

1727
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,560
2015.

1728
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:09,600
It'll be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, and Windows PC.

1729
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,560
So yeah, hopefully they will be actually coming out that day.

1730
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,560
They do have, I guess, a pre-order incentive to, you know, unlock Goro as a playable character.

1731
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:26,040
So that's kind of lame that they lock a really cool character behind a pre-order wall.

1732
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:30,080
But what else is new?

1733
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,040
If you're not in the mood for Madden but you want to play some football, guess what?

1734
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:42,160
There is a ROM hack for Tecmo Bowl 2 updated to Tecmo Bowl 2000, or Tecmo Super Bowl 2015.

1735
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:50,440
It's basically a roster update to give everybody the, I guess, modern rosters, offensive schemes,

1736
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:54,160
and all 32 current NFL teams.

1737
01:43:54,160 --> 01:44:01,720
And so if you have an NES emulator, you can go download that, TecmoBowl.org.

1738
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:06,880
And they've got, I think it's in their forums, you can check that out.

1739
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:13,040
And last but not least, this is kind of surprising, but maybe after, you know, their presentation

1740
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:18,160
at either Gamescom or E3, I can't remember where they're talking about VibRib in a lot,

1741
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,760
but Sony has filed a trademark for VibRib in Europe.

1742
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,760
What?

1743
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,760
What?

1744
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,760
Yes.

1745
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:31,040
So they're going to be possibly either re-releasing the old game or putting out a new one.

1746
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,180
I hope it's a new one.

1747
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,220
Let's all join hands and pray.

1748
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:41,700
Oh Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, wait, bless this thy donut that with it we might

1749
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:45,820
be blessed with VibRib in.

1750
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:50,220
Whatever it is you believe in, God, Buddha, Flying Speedy Monster, whatever it is you

1751
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:55,940
believe in, join hands with me in prayer that VibRib in is making some type of comeback.

1752
01:44:55,940 --> 01:45:01,060
I mean, I don't care if it's like just a freaking like PS1 now game or something.

1753
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:06,900
What if we get the ribbon box with VibRib in emoji ribbon and like ribbon all the things.

1754
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,660
Don't fuck with my emotions.

1755
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:12,100
That's what confused me so much is was that they have the guy that created VibRib in talking

1756
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:17,540
about VibRib in for like a very long time during like GDC, it was E3, they fucking whipped

1757
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:18,540
out VibRib in E3.

1758
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,540
Oh my God.

1759
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,540
Agdef said it.

1760
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,540
What?

1761
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,540
VibRib in with MP3 support.

1762
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:25,660
For the love of Vibri, please.

1763
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:30,940
Knowing Sony, if it were to happen, it would be VibRib in with Sony Entertainment Network

1764
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:31,940
support.

1765
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:32,940
I just thought of something.

1766
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:33,940
What?

1767
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,500
How to cosplay Vibri.

1768
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:39,700
All right, anyway, quickly, it's a three hour show, not seven.

1769
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:45,820
So, yes, that's all we know so far aside from the filing that, yeah, VibRib in is possibly

1770
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:48,780
going to come back.

1771
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,980
Fifth Dream in chat says, fuck yes, please, VibRib in, I will suck some people off for

1772
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,460
VibRib in to exist.

1773
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:58,140
I'm right there with you, Fifth Dream.

1774
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:02,620
Rob says, Fifth Dream, TMI, dude.

1775
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:07,100
I already said something about BioWare earlier this evening, so tonight, all the cocks.

1776
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:13,980
I remember that day, we went to network video RIP, and I got VibRib in, and you got Kitty

1777
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,460
the Cool.

1778
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:18,860
The Hello Kitty game.

1779
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:21,860
Yeah, you kind of made out better, didn't you?

1780
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,540
All right, let's see.

1781
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:26,580
And Rama says in chat, I pray to Joe Pesci.

1782
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,220
Well, I said whatever you believe in, whatever you believe in.

1783
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:38,540
All right, MegamanX400, uh oh, uh oh, asks, what is VibRib in?

1784
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,540
Get out.

1785
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,540
No, I'm just kidding.

1786
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,540
VibRib in.

1787
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,540
We shall educate you now.

1788
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:46,060
I've already done it as a classic game, but maybe I need to just do it again.

1789
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:48,140
Just quickly, give a 60 second speech.

1790
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:54,260
VibRib is an all kind of victory 3D game, where you're a rabbit, whose name is Vibri,

1791
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:57,980
and you walk along the line, and you get different obstacles in your way, and you have to do

1792
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,780
certain button mashes to pass said obstacles.

1793
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,940
It's got its own little soundtrack, but the great thing is that you can put in your own

1794
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:08,560
CDs, and use different music, and the tracks will change based on the music that you play.

1795
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,980
And he turns into different things as he goes into this halo creature, and it's absolutely

1796
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:14,980
awesome.

1797
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:17,860
And he sings the demo, how to play the game.

1798
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:20,020
He sings how you play the game.

1799
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,220
And it's adorable.

1800
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:24,260
And he's got this little cute little voice, kind of digitally sounding, and oh my god,

1801
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:28,060
Vibri is adorable!

1802
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:34,260
It's like, it's like a endless runner, but, you know, it's not, yeah, kind of.

1803
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:38,700
And if you want, actually if you want a good idea of what the game looks like, it's got,

1804
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:43,820
it's you know, it's a, what's the group that does it, a Weebles game.

1805
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:48,940
But Weebles did something kind of based off of, it plays exactly like Vibribin for iOS,

1806
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:52,140
called Dancing Russian Men, and that will give you an idea of how the game looks.

1807
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:55,700
I mean, not how it looks, but how it plays, so.

1808
01:47:55,700 --> 01:48:03,980
And Mega Man X400 in true Canadian fashion apologizing, lol, sorry, sorry, I don't know.

1809
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:04,980
That's okay.

1810
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,980
You know what?

1811
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,980
We're here, but now you do know, and knowing is half the battle.

1812
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:13,140
Just go look up the intro to Vibribin.

1813
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:14,140
It's cute game.

1814
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:15,140
It's adorbs.

1815
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,140
Cute game.

1816
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:17,140
Alright, let's move on.

1817
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:19,580
We've got more news we've got to talk about, including with Sony.

1818
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:24,380
Maybe if Vibribin does come out on PlayStation 4 in one form or another, people will be streaming

1819
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:29,340
it on the PlayStation Vita, because there's going to be an app that will allow the PlayStation

1820
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:35,380
Vita access to the PlayStation Live network that's all over the PlayStation 4.

1821
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:39,420
So yes, you too can watch the Ustreams and Twitch channels of people sitting in their

1822
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:45,920
living room saying racist, sexist, horrible things to each other, because that's a lot

1823
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,020
of what's broadcast on there.

1824
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,020
But you know what?

1825
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,620
Amongst all that, there is a lot of good streams, too.

1826
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,460
A lot of Diablo 3 streams lately, and of course, of course, I knew this would happen the day

1827
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,780
the game came out.

1828
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:57,940
Guess what game is dominating PlayStation Live right now?

1829
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,220
Minecraft.

1830
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,980
Dominating PlayStation Live right now.

1831
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:05,440
So you can watch more Minecraft feeds on the PlayStation Vita very soon, which makes sense

1832
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:09,380
because they brought it to mobile phones as well, although I think it's just a link.

1833
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,580
News on Bravely Second.

1834
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:15,740
I know that a lot of you guys were fans of Bravely Default, Dark Soccer and myself included.

1835
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:16,740
De-fart.

1836
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,740
Bravely De-fart.

1837
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:24,340
Well, in Bravely Second, which I guess Dark Soccer would call Bravely Second fart, I don't

1838
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:25,340
know.

1839
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,620
There's some information that's come out about Bravely Second.

1840
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,900
Bravely Suck It.

1841
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,420
Bravely Suck It.

1842
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:32,140
I don't know.

1843
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:37,580
The Wind Vestal Agnus will be back in Bravely Suck It.

1844
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:45,940
There will also be some new characters, including Magnolia Arch in the roles of Valkyrie, Performer,

1845
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:46,980
Red Mage and Time Major.

1846
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,420
Some of the screenshots we see.

1847
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:54,300
Magnolia Arch in the screenshots.

1848
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,340
Also another new character revealed this week, Yu.

1849
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:00,100
That's YU.

1850
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:06,220
YU is another new character that is the Falcon of the Gale who will be joining Magnolia as

1851
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,620
a party member during the game.

1852
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:09,620
Some other characters.

1853
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:14,500
Jean, the Wolf of the Inferno and Nikolai, the Bison of Solidity.

1854
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,700
So more information on Bravely Suck It.

1855
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,820
Okay, Dungeon Buster wins.

1856
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:23,980
Bravely Second win.

1857
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,180
We're like seven years old.

1858
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,180
All right.

1859
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:27,180
I love you guys.

1860
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,180
I love you guys.

1861
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:30,860
Lastly, some news on the Retron 5.

1862
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,100
Remember this console?

1863
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,100
That thing.

1864
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,100
The aluminum box.

1865
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:38,340
I'd seen this at E3 and I got to play Zombies Ate My Neighbors and High Def, which was kind

1866
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,340
of awesome.

1867
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:42,380
Which reminds me, I need to get a Retron 5.

1868
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:47,300
I did not know that they were doing firmware updates to the Retron consoles, but they are.

1869
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:51,940
A new firmware update, firmware 2.0 Beta 1 came out for the Retron.

1870
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:58,740
It includes IPS patch support, meaning you take an imported game cartridge.

1871
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:02,980
You take a little, I guess, USB stick with the IPS file.

1872
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:06,460
You can patch the cartridge to play fan translations.

1873
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,460
That is fucking amazing.

1874
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,460
Right?

1875
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:09,460
That's awesome.

1876
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:12,420
And the Seiken fan translation is like the best.

1877
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:13,420
Seiken Densetsu.

1878
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:14,420
Right?

1879
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:15,420
So that's really cool.

1880
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,260
Some other firmware support.

1881
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,300
Support for S&S SPC 7110 cartridges.

1882
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:24,140
I don't know what games that included.

1883
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,020
Screen shaking and some GBA games fixed.

1884
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:31,860
Yeah, there was actually a test video out that was showing that it wasn't working with

1885
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:34,300
some of the add-on games.

1886
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:37,940
So I'd like to, yeah, hopefully they've addressed that.

1887
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,060
That's really cool.

1888
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:44,540
Some game compatibility fixes, meaning Sky Kid, Yokai Club, and Dark Soccer, you can

1889
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,540
rest easy.

1890
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,260
Fantasy Zone will now work.

1891
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:53,700
Can you imagine if Dark Soccer had bought one of these things and Fantasy Zone didn't

1892
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:54,700
work?

1893
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,700
Oh my god, the thing would be in pieces.

1894
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:59,540
Do you know that I have almost every home version of Fantasy Zone?

1895
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,820
Oh really, says the woman who made fun of me over Mass Effect 3 earlier.

1896
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:03,820
Yeah, guess what?

1897
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:04,820
They're all different games.

1898
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,540
Yeah, guess what?

1899
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:07,540
Suck it.

1900
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:11,620
Technically, they are different games for, you know, different consoles.

1901
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:12,620
Yeah.

1902
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:16,020
It's just, you know, the Wii U window in place.

1903
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,620
But it does support the tablet.

1904
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:23,540
Rolling my eyes so hard that it just, I think I might have strained my ocular joints.

1905
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:26,820
Roll them back so you can do the next story.

1906
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,700
Girl.

1907
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:32,280
So well, the next three stories then, to be accurate.

1908
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:38,220
So there are instructions out there on how to upgrade the next gen Minecraft, you know,

1909
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:42,500
with the new versions on Xbone and Playstation 4.

1910
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:47,860
There actually is a blog post out there about how to do the upgrade, of which I will give

1911
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:50,140
you the URL as soon as it loads.

1912
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:53,820
But there's also videos out there, so you can also check it out on various tubes of

1913
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:56,880
you that you might be able to find.

1914
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,040
So by the way, I almost got it to load, never mind.

1915
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:11,440
It's actually on a post by Brian Silva on the Playstation 4 blog, blog.US.PlayStation.com.

1916
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:17,520
And I will link that into the chat room, because it's a really long URL for the regular URL.

1917
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,680
So that being said, I'm sure you are all going to be super happy with having instructions.

1918
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:30,000
So also, there are details out now, at least for the European release of Bayonetta 2.

1919
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,640
Which will of course be a Wii U exclusive, and probably one of the few reasons to own

1920
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,640
one.

1921
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,640
What?

1922
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:36,640
So?

1923
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,640
So?

1924
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:38,640
So?

1925
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,640
So?

1926
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:46,440
Nintendo said that the first print edition, which is exclusive to Europe, will have the

1927
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:53,480
discs of Bayonetta 2, Wii U Bayonetta remake, the Art of Bayonetta 2 art book, and a 3D

1928
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:58,420
embossed leather effect packaging that recreates the Hierarchy of Laguna.

1929
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:04,240
The book of angels that were all the enemies that you have to kill with your gun shoes

1930
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,240
from.

1931
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:08,200
So yeah, pretty cool.

1932
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:11,640
Lots of details on Bayonetta 2 this week, by the way, because of the Nintendo Direct.

1933
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:16,520
So if you didn't see it, go watch it, because Dark Sakura is just touching the tip of the

1934
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,800
iceberg with this.

1935
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,640
Well, it is rapid fire, is it not?

1936
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,640
I know, I understand.

1937
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:29,200
And then, last but not least, there is a release list that came out from the Direct, actually,

1938
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:33,560
that has a list of games coming out in 2015.

1939
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:38,160
One of those games listed is Star Fox.

1940
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:44,720
There is also another Zelda game listed in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X, I guess it is,

1941
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:49,960
or X, I guess X, since there wasn't two through nine.

1942
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,800
Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, Act Deft, just letting you know.

1943
01:54:53,800 --> 01:55:00,880
Mario Maker, Yoshi's Woolly World, Splatoon, Captain Toad, bunch of stuff.

1944
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,000
So Star Fox, something else called Project Guard.

1945
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:12,480
Yeah, so a good thing that a lot of those E3 titles we saw, because Star Fox and Zelda,

1946
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:16,720
we got little tastes of at E3 this year, but nice to see that they are still targeting

1947
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:21,400
2015 for that, because I don't know, the way Nintendo rolls sometimes, I would not have

1948
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:24,480
been shocked if you told me that Zelda game wasn't happening until 2016.

1949
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,920
Act Deft, I said Star Fox, not Star Fucks.

1950
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:28,920
There's a difference.

1951
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:33,880
And maybe my little bit of a southern accent plays into that, but no.

1952
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,720
I usually emphasize when I say the word fuck.

1953
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:42,120
Alright, well let's go to the fucking FUGL question of the week right now.

1954
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,120
It's Radio Koopaloo.

1955
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:54,240
You take Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together, you get FUGL, and it's the

1956
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:58,440
FUGL question of the week, where we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook

1957
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,440
and Google Plus.

1958
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:06,000
That's Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google.com slash Plus, Orange Lounge Radio.

1959
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
This is all about the Dreamcast we talked about earlier in the show.

1960
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,360
Were you a Dreamcast owner?

1961
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,360
Why or why not?

1962
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,160
Looking back, do you have a favorite Dreamcast title?

1963
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,080
We'll start with the Googlers tonight.

1964
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:21,520
Act Deft saying, I got my Dreamcast on a Black Friday for $50 US, like 12 years ago or so.

1965
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:25,160
I played with it a lot, and it was my go-to console for fighting games, though I think

1966
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:30,360
my favorite game for the Dreamcast was either Jet Grind or Jet Set Radio or Sonic Adventure

1967
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,360
2.

1968
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,680
Crazy Taxi in a close second.

1969
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:35,000
God, I miss crazy taxi.

1970
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:41,320
Renee, Renee Y replies and says, we had a Dreamcast because we were a hardcore Sega

1971
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:47,160
family, as a good strong family should be, right?

1972
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:51,240
My favorite game to play was Phantasy Star Online, one of my first MMOs.

1973
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:55,040
It was a truly unique experience being able to play a game with my cousin who lived all

1974
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,320
the way across the country.

1975
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,400
Eventually, we ended up giving the console away to a friend who didn't have enough money

1976
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,400
to buy a console.

1977
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,400
This was in 2005.

1978
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:05,600
I can't believe it's been almost 10 years since I've given away my Dreamcast, let alone

1979
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,560
15 years from when I owned one.

1980
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,680
That's really sweet that Renee gave the console away to somebody who, you know, over here

1981
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,160
you had no console, so that's really cool.

1982
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,600
Good job.

1983
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:19,680
Reddertainment replied and said, no.

1984
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,560
That's it, no.

1985
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,640
Not a Dreamcast fan, I imagine.

1986
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:26,840
Flaco Jones replied and said, never had a Dreamcast, but a friend of mine did.

1987
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:29,000
He also had every game pirated to discs.

1988
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,360
I think I only played Tony Hawk on it, but it was good.

1989
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,960
And Collin M says, bought one shortly after it came out.

1990
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:39,480
Phantasy Star Online and Space Channel 5 were my favorite games on the system.

1991
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,920
Choo, choo.

1992
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,320
A few comments over here on Facebook, Fabrice A says, I'm a hardcore Sega fan and of course

1993
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,320
I own a Dreamcast.

1994
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:50,720
I think it's still the best console ever because of the numerous, excellent arcade games they

1995
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,720
had on it.

1996
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:55,320
Crazy Taxi is an all-time favorite game for me and I still play it from time to time.

1997
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:59,600
Occasionally I go out and look for sailors too, but not before I have a hot dog at Tom's.

1998
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:02,560
Dreamcast, it's still thinking.

1999
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,760
Tonic Vision replied and said, I actually bought a Dreamcast in college after it had

2000
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,920
been out for a little over a year.

2001
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,960
I got it for $99 on Amazon and what amazed, Amazon was a thing back then?

2002
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,960
I guess it was.

2003
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,900
I guess it was kind of in its early days.

2004
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:16,960
What amazed me the most is how easily it ran pirated CDs.

2005
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,640
A couple of floors up for me, a guy knew how to do it and made me about 10 discs packed

2006
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:22,640
with games.

2007
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:26,280
I fell in love with Code Veronica and stayed up many weekends playing Marvel versus Capcom

2008
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,600
2 with friends.

2009
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,320
Having never owned a Genesis, I thought it was a solid system overall, but I must admit

2010
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,600
that when PlayStation 2 came out, it started collecting dust immediately.

2011
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:37,400
The surprising amount of people admitting to open piracy here.

2012
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:39,360
I think you were onto something earlier when you said that.

2013
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,360
Part of the problem.

2014
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,760
Yeah, part of the problem.

2015
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,520
KingSnee replied and said, one of my favorite memories with the Dreamcast was when I first

2016
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:49,960
came in contact with it and Sonic running from a killer whale.

2017
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,920
I thought that was the coolest thing I'd seen in a game at that point and that's one

2018
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,840
of the many reasons why I got a Dreamcast.

2019
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:59,160
I still think about playing my first RPG, Grandia 2.

2020
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:03,720
Guillermo R. replies and says I was in college and skipped classes on 9999 to go pick up

2021
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:06,720
my Dreamcast, Sonic Adventure, and Soul Calibur.

2022
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,440
What an amazing system at the time.

2023
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:11,840
I still have it plugged on my TV and fire it up every now and then.

2024
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,760
While the games haven't aged as well as I like to remember them, Crazy Taxi with the

2025
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:19,200
original soundtrack, Soul Calibur, Power Stone, and Soul Reaver are still a fun ride down

2026
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:20,800
memory lane.

2027
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:26,000
Awesome Unicorn says I never owned a Dreamcast but I did have Space Channel 5 lunchbox and

2028
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,040
that's what really matters.

2029
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,040
That's a fair answer.

2030
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,040
That's a fair answer.

2031
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,080
Dr. Sunya says I still have mine.

2032
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:36,240
Maybe if there's one thing I've loved about the Dreamcast, it was the arcade ports.

2033
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:41,660
Marvel vs. Capcom, Crazy Taxi, and Soul Calibur all had ports from the arcade that were not

2034
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:45,080
only near perfect but had tons of extras to boot.

2035
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,780
Several people calling that out.

2036
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,460
Ragenator says I never got a Dreamcast even though it did appeal to me.

2037
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:53,740
At the time I already had some systems in use like Super Nintendo, N64, and PS1 with

2038
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:58,820
plenty of games for each so trying to afford a four system plus games was a no go.

2039
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:03,780
Haseo Sumeruagawa says I never owned a Dreamcast mostly because I was seven and not the richest

2040
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:07,780
family but I always wanted one to play Sonic Adventure 2 because Shadow was awesome hands

2041
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,780
down.

2042
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:09,780
Well, go to a flea market.

2043
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:12,400
You might be able to get one still.

2044
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,820
And lastly, Curlykirk replied and says I didn't get a Dreamcast when it first came out but

2045
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:21,000
I eventually got one probably soon before it stopped being made but I still have one

2046
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,760
now and love the sports games like the 2K series and Virtua Tennis.

2047
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,320
Great answers and I heard some new names in there as well so thank you guys so much for

2048
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,000
applying and participating with our question this week.

2049
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,840
I'm going to go ahead and get back into news since the hosts here in studio kind of already

2050
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:39,320
took on this question earlier in the show but yeah, now's a good reminder to friend

2051
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:42,960
us on Facebook and on Google Plus so you can answer for next week.

2052
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:43,960
Let's go back into some news.

2053
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,960
Loki.

2054
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:52,160
Alright, so I'm not surprised by this news considering how all the reviews and kind of

2055
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:57,880
impressions seem to be of this game but apparently the Elder Scrolls Online, not doing so hot

2056
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:03,680
and ZeniMax Online apparently has been hit with some layoffs but they're still seeing

2057
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:07,760
they're continuing to invest heavily in the game and says now that we're nearly six months

2058
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:15,360
post launch, we have a thriving online community in a game that runs smoothly and says that

2059
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:20,120
we remain strongly committed to the Elder Scrolls Online and continue to invest heavily

2060
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:24,920
to develop new content for PC players, prepare the game for its console launch and handle

2061
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:28,680
our planned expansion into important international territories.

2062
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:33,000
As for customer service, we continue to operate large support centers in Hunt Valley, Maryland

2063
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:41,400
and Galway, Ireland but basically saying the reason why they're having layoffs as normal

2064
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:46,280
for games of this type, we had ramped up a large workforce to develop a game of vast

2065
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:52,760
scale and the ramped up customer service to handle expected questions and community needs

2066
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:58,520
for Elder Scrolls Online launch and of course now that they don't need that so I don't know.

2067
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:03,560
Maybe it is still doing okay, I'm still, I don't know, it doesn't seem like a lot of

2068
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:10,120
people I know are interested in it so I have to wonder how well it's doing.

2069
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:13,320
We talked about this a little bit on Hoard House this week which is, you know, a cheap

2070
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:19,520
plug Wednesday nights at seven here at VOG or has its own podcast feed as well and one

2071
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,020
thing I mentioned on Hoard House I want to mention here is that this news is really surprising

2072
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:26,640
considering this is supposed to be a big console release.

2073
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,200
This game is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and I believe the Xbox One as

2074
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,200
well.

2075
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:34,400
I remember this whole thing and so it's weird that people are being laid off in advance

2076
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,400
of that happening.

2077
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:39,240
Now, I do realize that in the cycle and development of games sometimes, you know, development

2078
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,340
is finished before the game comes out so that people, you know, are laid off as the project

2079
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:44,680
closes or whatever.

2080
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,700
But you would think that they would, yeah, they were saying that they ramped up their

2081
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:52,400
customer service and stuff for the launch of that game.

2082
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:56,280
When they need that same type of thing for the launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One or their

2083
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,240
expectations that much lower now.

2084
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,240
Exactly.

2085
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:03,640
That's the same thing that concerns me about this is that it doesn't kind of add up and,

2086
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:08,120
you know, you don't hear about companies like, you know, Blizzard and Square Enix laying

2087
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:11,400
people off, you know, when the development's done because they continue to develop the

2088
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:14,120
game with enhanced, you know, patches and other things.

2089
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:18,560
Now, granted, those two companies I just mentioned are really big and probably have other projects

2090
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:23,400
that people can be assigned to whereas ZeniMax was kind of made to make Elder Scrolls so

2091
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,520
maybe the situation is a little different.

2092
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:29,440
But it doesn't get my hopes up about the game's longevity.

2093
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,240
They could also be just like, ah, fuck it, we'll just do it with what we got and, you

2094
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:37,480
know, if it's a little bit rough, well, people are kind of expecting that.

2095
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:38,480
I don't know.

2096
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:41,160
Maybe that's their thought.

2097
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:45,560
Maybe they just, they figure at this point that they're not making enough money back

2098
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:49,600
from it that they have to kind of cut their losses.

2099
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:53,640
They can't afford to ramp up employees for that launch.

2100
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,240
And who knows when that launch is coming, you know?

2101
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:01,380
Why keep all those employees around for, you know, it's supposed to be this year.

2102
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:02,380
Supposed to be.

2103
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:05,680
I mean, it's, I thought it was, I thought the beta was supposed to be first quarter

2104
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,680
this year.

2105
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:09,320
Like, I mean, like that thing got really delayed.

2106
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,320
I could be wrong.

2107
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,120
I could be mixing it up with another MMO, but I could have sworn that the Elder Scrolls

2108
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,400
online was supposed to happen a lot faster than it has been.

2109
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:21,480
EKMA JP was just adding in that Square Enix has almost all contracts and no layoffs.

2110
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:22,480
Oh, interesting.

2111
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:26,200
That's a clever way to do it so you don't have to, you know, announce all these layoffs

2112
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,200
or whatever.

2113
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,200
Interesting.

2114
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,200
Um, let's see.

2115
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:35,720
Kane shadow is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying ESO hype is done and over with thankfully.

2116
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:40,640
And um, you know, I, I don't know, but I also know people that still kind of really like

2117
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:41,640
this.

2118
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,200
Like I have some friends that actually do a podcast about ESOs.

2119
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:46,600
I almost feel bad sitting here like poo pooing on it, especially when I haven't played an

2120
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:52,160
awful lot of it, but you can't help but look at a lot of this going, I, I, I would have

2121
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:56,240
bought it if it even used like the Guild Wars model where you buy the game and then

2122
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:57,240
the online craze.

2123
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:01,000
If they did it like they're doing destiny where you buy the game and you play it online,

2124
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,640
that'd be fucking amazing.

2125
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:05,160
But no, it's not like that.

2126
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:12,160
And so yeah, unfortunately I, I just can't dedicate myself to paying for a game that

2127
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:13,160
I'm not going to play.

2128
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:17,440
You know, especially if it's a monthly fee, I'm, I can't see myself paying for something

2129
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,440
that I'm not gonna play.

2130
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:22,160
Do for the Minecraft server for now.

2131
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:23,560
But yeah, I don't know.

2132
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:28,840
I can't do that for an MMO because I just, it's just throwing money away.

2133
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,840
Yeah.

2134
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:35,080
Um, I, I, I don't know, I, I, I would hope that maybe they go to that model cause I still

2135
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:39,040
would like to see this come out on consoles just because I love the idea of MMOs on, on

2136
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,040
console.

2137
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,040
Yeah, they did it well.

2138
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,040
They did what?

2139
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:43,040
They went free to play with DC universe.

2140
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,920
I mean, I think that helped that, but I don't know if they're going to do that with Elder

2141
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:48,800
Scrolls online.

2142
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:49,800
It's a big property.

2143
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:50,800
I don't know.

2144
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,800
We'll see.

2145
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,800
We'll see.

2146
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,360
Well, moving on for now, cause we're just hypothesizing here, uh, moving on to something

2147
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,840
else that Square Enix related.

2148
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:58,440
This has to do a dragon quest seven.

2149
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,440
Yes, I seven.

2150
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,440
I know.

2151
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:04,000
I know that, you know, we should be talking about 10 or even potentially 11, but uh, here's

2152
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,920
the thing about dragon quest seven is that Square Enix has talked about this week.

2153
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:13,040
Uh, Noriyoshi Fujimoto, who's the dragon quest mobile producer for Square Enix, talked to

2154
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:17,880
Silicon era, uh, about the company doing more dragon quest games and that they would

2155
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:21,920
like to bring the remastered version of dragon quest seven for the Nintendo three D S to

2156
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:26,040
the west, but they don't think sales of the game will be high enough.

2157
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:30,280
The quote here in terms of dragon quest seven, it has a lot of texts to go through and translate,

2158
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:34,040
and we've received so many requests and so much positive feedback about the game, but

2159
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:37,360
unfortunately we have to consider the cost and the manpower needed to handle the sheer

2160
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,960
load of text in terms of scenario and script.

2161
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,040
The game is probably one of the largest in the DQ franchise.

2162
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:47,720
If a lot of people can buy it and support it, well, we can't promise anything, uh, from

2163
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:51,560
dragon quest seven and B, excuse me, from dragon quest eight and beyond, we've revamped

2164
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,560
the translation.

2165
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:56,160
For example, we've added regional twangs like those from Baltic region sounding Russian

2166
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,340
and things like that.

2167
02:06:57,340 --> 02:06:59,140
We've also updated the spells and monster names.

2168
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:02,240
So any classic titles we revisit, we want to stay consistent.

2169
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:06,260
That being said, when we go back and update the classic titles, we make these changes.

2170
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:07,260
That's another step in the process.

2171
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:12,180
Well, as you can imagine, after this quote happened, now you have Twitter lighting up

2172
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:16,880
with a lot of people sending messages to Square Enix, like I'll buy it, make it happen, do

2173
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:17,980
it, do it.

2174
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:19,700
So maybe you want to lend your own voice.

2175
02:07:19,700 --> 02:07:23,460
I'm surprised there's not a change.org petition already, although there probably is one out

2176
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:26,860
there, but, um, I'm sure some of you out there may be listening to this.

2177
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:29,380
Maybe you want to go lend your support for this game as well.

2178
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:32,020
If you think this is something that would interest you, I would check it out on, on

2179
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:33,020
3DS.

2180
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,020
Heck yeah.

2181
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:35,020
That'd be great.

2182
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:41,420
Uh, I'd almost like to see it more like on PlayStation now or something where I can play

2183
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:45,420
it on the TV, but I'll take the 3DS, it's better than nothing.

2184
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:47,140
All right.

2185
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:49,540
So let's move on Dark Sakura.

2186
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:54,380
Well, uh, for, I know that we've got a lot of listeners who are League of Legends fans,

2187
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:58,180
so there is actually something going on with League of Legends.

2188
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:01,060
Riot is re-imagining the lore.

2189
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:07,460
Um, yeah, basically they've had so many different releases and different contents added on that

2190
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:12,420
the lore has just been all kinds of fubar, so they're just wiping it and redoing it.

2191
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:19,020
Um, there is a quote out there actually from Tommy Knox, um, who said that we look back

2192
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:22,380
at the original decision, at the decisions that made perfect sense when we originally

2193
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:27,160
made them, but are now at odds with our design values and ultimately limit our ability to

2194
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,720
continually improve League of Legends.

2195
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:30,720
That's unacceptable.

2196
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:35,560
In such situations, we seek to aggressively re-imagine content in a way that realizes

2197
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,960
its full potential.

2198
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,920
So basically we done fucked up the lore.

2199
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,120
We're going to redo it.

2200
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,280
We're pulling the Star Wars.

2201
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,280
Lucas sold it.

2202
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,840
I was just going to say the same thing.

2203
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:49,640
Is this, is this akin to Disney saying, well, now that we own Star Wars, books invalid.

2204
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:52,880
We're actually doing this, doing this right.

2205
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,880
Yeah.

2206
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:54,880
Yeah.

2207
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,360
Although many would argue the books were plenty fine, but I understand the need to be like,

2208
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:04,360
because if they do episode seven and they hadn't invalidated all the extended universe,

2209
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:08,720
there was going to be so much stuff where people would be like, that can't happen because

2210
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:14,080
in such and such book on page 140, uh, this character has printing.

2211
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,080
Yeah, exactly.

2212
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,080
Right.

2213
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,080
Yeah.

2214
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:20,400
So no disrespect to those that are fans of the extended Star Wars universe, but I kind

2215
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:23,780
of understand why they had to do it for that reason that if it's like, okay, if we really

2216
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:29,000
are going to kind of take control of this and you may not agree with me, but I fully

2217
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:35,360
believe that control needed to be taken away from Lucas because the prequels were awful.

2218
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:39,600
And the way that they're handling this is more like how the Tomb Raider reboot went

2219
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:44,520
or, you know, re-imagining how Battlestar Galactica went as mentioned here in the article.

2220
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:48,120
Um, so they're just trying to make it, I guess, a more cohesive story.

2221
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:49,120
That makes sense.

2222
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,120
That's fair.

2223
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:51,120
All right.

2224
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:55,160
Uh, I do like what fifth dream said.

2225
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,160
Yeah.

2226
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,160
Retcons for everyone.

2227
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,160
You get a retcon and you get a retcon.

2228
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,320
All right.

2229
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:03,320
Uh, let's move on with some more stories then we're going to get to the mailbag.

2230
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:04,320
Loki.

2231
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:05,320
All right.

2232
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:08,400
So I don't know.

2233
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:15,480
It's Google is I guess jumping on board with, I think, um, Apple to do something very similar,

2234
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:21,600
but they've refunded $19 million worth of in-app purchases or if you would call it a

2235
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:29,400
guess accidental in-app purchases made by our children because you know, I gave them

2236
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:35,400
my tablet and they didn't have any sort of parental controls or way, you know, gave them

2237
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:40,080
my parental controls and they bought a bunch of Smurf money or whatever the fuck it is

2238
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,080
that they're buying.

2239
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:47,120
Um, but apparently, yeah, because of the, um, complaint, I guess filed with the FTC,

2240
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:54,000
they've agreed to pay $19 million in refunds made, um, I guess for purchases made without

2241
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,280
the account holders explicit consent.

2242
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:01,840
So that sucks, but Google has a ton of money.

2243
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,840
So you know what?

2244
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:04,640
Uh, I don't know.

2245
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,600
And that's why they, they couldn't afford Twitch anymore.

2246
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:10,040
It's just like, it's, that's, that's pennies, you know, I got 19 million in my wallet right

2247
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,040
now.

2248
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:18,120
But I don't know, at the same time, I think that it is a responsibility of parents to

2249
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:21,200
be monitoring what their children are allowed to buy.

2250
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:27,040
But at the same time, I could see that maybe some people that develop apps make that stuff

2251
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:31,160
a little bit too easy to purchase or confusing that kind of sense.

2252
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,220
So I don't know.

2253
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:37,120
It's interesting to see how both the, you know, Google play and the, you know, iTunes

2254
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:43,440
store are kind of starting to insert the language to make the not truly free games

2255
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,720
sound like what they are.

2256
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,720
Not truly free.

2257
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,440
It's interesting to see that evolution, you know, especially since, you know, gaming is

2258
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:50,680
getting bigger and bigger on these platforms.

2259
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:55,280
And sometimes us, us gamers that tend to tilt a little more hardcore kind of forget that.

2260
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:59,100
But um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting to see that evolution.

2261
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:04,200
I guess it's just something they have to do right now and you know, but at the same time,

2262
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:08,280
yeah, they really need to have something in place where it's just like, yeah, come

2263
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:09,280
on.

2264
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:12,040
Your parents take responsibility or we're going to get stuck in the situation.

2265
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:13,040
You know what?

2266
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:16,480
They should just enable parental controls from the start and then you have to pay 60

2267
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,480
cents to unlock it.

2268
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:18,480
How's that sound?

2269
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:24,120
Lucky fucking tend to seriously that it's absolutely lame.

2270
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:25,120
All right.

2271
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:29,160
Well speaking of Nintendo, let's not forget that back in the day they made some arcade

2272
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:30,160
classics.

2273
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:38,000
One of those all time classics is donkey Kong and donkey Kong, danky, danky Kang for his

2274
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
oldest.

2275
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,960
This game is, it still ends up in, in our video game news all the time.

2276
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,720
And a lot of this is the war over the high score, right?

2277
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:48,540
We had a whole movie about this King of Kong, right?

2278
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:53,680
And then this new guy, Hank Chen showed up and was like, Hey, I'm the new kid in school

2279
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,480
and I'm going to smash all these records.

2280
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:56,480
And he did.

2281
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:00,600
But guess what happened this past week, Robbie Lakeman.

2282
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,600
That's right.

2283
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:06,100
A new guy has now taken the throne in donkey Kong competition.

2284
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:12,040
His high score is the new world record, 1,141,800 points.

2285
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:19,440
That is pretty small victory over a Hank Chen score, which was only about 3000 less.

2286
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:25,360
This is kind of neat too, is that Robbie Lakeman would actually stream his attempts.

2287
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,920
And for whatever reason, the one where he actually broke the record was not streamed,

2288
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:31,920
but he did upload it after the fact.

2289
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:36,640
So you can actually watch an entire four hour stream or not, sorry, not stream, but four

2290
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,640
hour video.

2291
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:41,460
Cause that's the era we live in of this dude breaking the record and you could learn a

2292
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:45,180
tip or two on this 30 year old game if you would like.

2293
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:46,920
So there you go.

2294
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:50,520
But that's kind of neat though, that we live in that era now of like, you know, we can

2295
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,440
watch people shatter high scores live.

2296
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:56,800
Like it used to be, you know, you had to have a copy of the tape.

2297
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:00,720
Somebody would have a VHS tape that they were recording to send to Twin Galaxies or you

2298
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:04,320
know, whatever magazine or whatever was to keep track of the high scores.

2299
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,320
Twin Galaxies isn't around anymore.

2300
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,600
They relaunched as like a new thing.

2301
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,280
It's like a 24 hour streaming channel now or something.

2302
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,960
So do you still do all that bullshit where you got to like tape everything?

2303
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,440
I have no idea to be honest.

2304
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:23,080
I sort of think live streaming kind of negates that, but I know because they still, they

2305
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:29,360
had to like, for a member back when like I was going to do, make the attempt that, you

2306
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:35,960
know, trying to break the arcade world record thing for that stupid Ready Player One contest,

2307
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:42,080
Twin Galaxies, like you had to record like video of the board that you're using and stuff

2308
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,280
like that.

2309
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:46,400
And it has to be like, there's no breaks in it whatsoever.

2310
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:48,840
And the way you have to film it is very specific.

2311
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,840
So I don't know.

2312
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,560
It'd be interesting to see.

2313
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,160
I don't know if like that would count.

2314
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:58,480
Tiger Claw links the website so you can find out twingalaxies.com so you can check that

2315
02:14:58,480 --> 02:14:59,480
out.

2316
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,920
Yeah, I'm too lazy to look at that.

2317
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:05,440
William Murderface suggests that we need the King of Kong 2 electric boogaloo.

2318
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,440
I agree.

2319
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:08,880
Or the Donkey Kong Jr. race.

2320
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,880
Donkey Kong 3?

2321
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:10,880
Anybody?

2322
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,320
Anybody play Donkey Kong 3?

2323
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,320
Which was...

2324
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,320
I did.

2325
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,320
I tried to forget that.

2326
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:17,880
When they, when they tried to turn a platformer into a shooter.

2327
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,880
Anybody?

2328
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:24,880
Alright, anyway, um, let's see, uh, we are going to, yes, Sjoan Undermat says Twin Galaxies

2329
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,840
is under totally new management, I believe.

2330
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:27,840
That is, that is true.

2331
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:31,080
Alright, um, let's, let's go into the mailbag.

2332
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:36,720
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com and Dark Soccer dives

2333
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:41,600
in the mailbag and pulls out some emails that she thinks are worth reading on the program.

2334
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:42,600
Yep.

2335
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,200
We've got two weeks to build up some emails.

2336
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,200
All four of them.

2337
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,480
Alright, well, they better be good.

2338
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,920
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

2339
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,860
I hear you all talking about Porter Robinson on the last podcast and how his music on his

2340
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:57,040
latest album was inspired by various video games.

2341
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:00,080
I thought it'd be interesting for you guys to know that Porter actually got his start

2342
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:04,120
in electronic music because he was turned on to the genre while playing DDR and other

2343
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:07,840
Bimani games with his brothers when they were kids in North Carolina.

2344
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,200
They are huge rhythm game nerds and Porter frequently answers interviewers asking why

2345
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:15,300
he got into making music by saying he played DDR.

2346
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:19,900
In fact, I actually met his brother Nick, who now produces video content for Revision3

2347
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:24,260
at California Extreme a few years ago while playing DDR Extreme reminiscing about the

2348
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:26,020
good old days of DDR.

2349
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:29,940
Just thought you guys would find that fact interesting considering the roots of the show.

2350
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:30,940
Yours truly, AZHP.

2351
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:32,900
Pretty fun to have on the show then.

2352
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:33,900
Yeah, right?

2353
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,900
P.S.

2354
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:35,900
Open invite.

2355
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:40,260
P.S. Porter says his favorite city in the country he's visited during his tours is San

2356
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:43,300
Francisco and he wants to settle down there at some point so we must be doing something

2357
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,300
right.

2358
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:48,420
But 573 is coming up, hello.

2359
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:54,540
But in all seriousness, it is really fascinating that we're at this point where this, you know,

2360
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,740
DDR is kind of an old, DDR qualifies as a classic game of the week.

2361
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:01,780
You know, it's that old and this show has been around for 12 years.

2362
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,140
I did play something.

2363
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:04,580
Now I remember why I was out.

2364
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:05,580
I'm sorry.

2365
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:07,420
I do remember something now.

2366
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,420
Oh, alright.

2367
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:09,660
Here's why I was out.

2368
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:10,660
Now I remember.

2369
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:16,740
Because I went to, I went to my brother-in-law's, well soon to be brother-in-law's bachelor

2370
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:17,740
party.

2371
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:18,740
Wasn't anything great.

2372
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:19,740
We went to Dave & Buster's.

2373
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:27,600
But I played DDR X2, I don't know, so I played a little bit of that.

2374
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:28,940
But that's why I was out.

2375
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:30,780
You realized you were old and out of shape.

2376
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:32,300
Oh, I already knew that.

2377
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:33,300
We weren't going into it.

2378
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:37,860
Like I played, I didn't play, I played one game with doubles and I was just all singles,

2379
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:39,100
you know, from there on out.

2380
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:43,100
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but a friend of mine wanted to play some music

2381
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:46,740
games on Xbox with Kinect yesterday, so we played Just Dance.

2382
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:52,180
And I also had that whole like, wow, I'm old and out of shape moment after like three songs.

2383
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:58,380
That's why, because she had to watch the kids, so I had to take the night off because it

2384
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:02,620
wouldn't be fair that she had to watch the kids for two nights.

2385
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:03,620
That's what it was.

2386
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:04,620
Now I remember.

2387
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:09,740
Well, anyway, but the fact that DDR is so old that like it's an influential game like

2388
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,740
that.

2389
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:14,820
I mean, it influenced this show, but it's interesting that, you know, you have this

2390
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:19,020
generation that DDR influenced from a musical perspective.

2391
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:21,580
That's so fascinating to me.

2392
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:23,140
Anyway, very cool email.

2393
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:24,140
Thank you.

2394
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:25,140
We didn't have DDR.

2395
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:28,140
We wouldn't have Just Dance or Dance Central or any of that.

2396
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:29,140
Yeah.

2397
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:30,140
None of it.

2398
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:32,460
Hello, escorts in the realm of Podtopia.

2399
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:33,700
Hi.

2400
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:37,660
With all the recent talk of PT Silent Hills and the upcoming yearly Rocktober holiday

2401
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:43,220
of Halloween, I'm curious what you would say is the most scary game you've ever played.

2402
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:47,820
Not the best game that is scary, but the game that scared the ever living fuck out of you.

2403
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:48,820
Mine is Nintendogs.

2404
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:51,100
Curse you, Sinophobia.

2405
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:52,340
Stay black, redertainment.

2406
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:56,540
This message has been brought to you by PT on Xbox One and other things that may never

2407
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:57,540
happen.

2408
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:59,180
Trainer.

2409
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:03,940
I remember playing Resident Evil when the dogs burst through or yeah, when the dogs

2410
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:06,060
was it Resident Evil or Resident Evil 2?

2411
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:07,060
Yeah.

2412
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:10,460
When the dogs burst through the window, I'm like, holy crap.

2413
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:11,460
And then that was it.

2414
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:16,660
Because, but you saw, you've, I squealed during the PT that actually kind of, it wasn't like

2415
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:22,540
a scare as much as the things that actually frightened me are like games that features

2416
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:26,540
clowns and that's why I will not play Five Nights at Freddy's because whenever, if I

2417
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:31,900
see an animatronic that isn't working, it freaks the ever living fuck out of me.

2418
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,940
That is definitely a game on my list to stream.

2419
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:37,420
I have a little growing list of things I want to do YouTubes and streams out of.

2420
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:44,860
I will not be able to play that just because it hits like an old phobia of mine.

2421
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:48,580
I mean, I might, and then I might go barf for an hour.

2422
02:19:48,580 --> 02:19:51,140
Don't watch commercials for the next American Horror Story either.

2423
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:53,340
Do I watch TV?

2424
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:55,820
They show up on Facebook, so careful.

2425
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,820
I have adblock.

2426
02:19:56,820 --> 02:19:59,500
Loki, is there a game that super scared you?

2427
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:03,100
No, I don't really play any of these like super scary games.

2428
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:04,660
I just not interested in them.

2429
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:05,980
I do have Among the Sleep.

2430
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:06,980
I should play that.

2431
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:10,700
That's supposed to be pretty creepy, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that on my

2432
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:12,220
Steam backlog right now.

2433
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:16,940
Loki and I were roommates when Silent Hill 4 The Room came out and I was playing through

2434
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:21,700
that and I was like screaming and Loki was like, shut up.

2435
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:22,700
I don't remember that.

2436
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:27,100
I was so scared in that game that just made me nauseous and that's when you find the giant

2437
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,100
head.

2438
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:29,100
Yes.

2439
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:30,100
Oh my God.

2440
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:31,100
That scared the hell out of me.

2441
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:33,380
But it was more, it's more when you, there's this one place where you like kind of fall

2442
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:36,900
down and you land on the bottom and then all of a sudden these two headed little baby monster

2443
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:39,500
start going and they like start running at you.

2444
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:44,180
And I started like screaming and Loki's like, what the hell's going on over there?

2445
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:45,420
Like a concerned dad.

2446
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:46,420
I wasn't.

2447
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:50,300
That was a polite way of saying shut up.

2448
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:54,820
I would say though, honestly, the scariest game I've probably played, like scariest experience,

2449
02:20:54,820 --> 02:20:56,460
turn all the lights off.

2450
02:20:56,460 --> 02:21:02,940
Well now it's a tie because Quake, uh, with all the lights off and the headphones and

2451
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:06,700
just staring at the monitor and playing Quake, that's actually super scary because the first

2452
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:10,060
person and everything, especially when that game was out, you know, the graphics are a

2453
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:11,260
little bit ahead of its time.

2454
02:21:11,260 --> 02:21:13,820
That was really scary to me because you turn a corner and then monster.

2455
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:18,940
I guess the, the, well, the recently, I'll kind of, it had like a moment in there would

2456
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:21,700
have been, uh, the original Bioshock.

2457
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:26,060
Like there's the one, especially that one scene where you're, you know, going around

2458
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:29,460
through like the, um, I think it was a lab or something like that.

2459
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:36,180
And like the, this gas or, um, some sort of like line burst and like it's steamy and you

2460
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:40,060
turn around and there's a guy like Santa right in front of you and you're just like, ah,

2461
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:41,060
die, die, die.

2462
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,380
Uh, but then the other one I'm thinking of.

2463
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:47,100
Actually, even though this wasn't, you know, the best of the silent Hill games, I was playing

2464
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:49,740
silent Hill homecoming home alone.

2465
02:21:49,740 --> 02:21:54,660
I actually want to play that one during a rainstorm and it was dark and there was a

2466
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:58,840
scene where like the ceiling falls and all this stuff like falls down and it scared the

2467
02:21:58,840 --> 02:21:59,840
shit out of me.

2468
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:04,580
And then I got up and I saw the front door had blown open and that was the moment I said,

2469
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:06,180
Nope, Nope, Nope.

2470
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:09,780
Turned off the three 60 shut the door, went in my room and crawled into the covers.

2471
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,780
Nope.

2472
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:11,780
DS night.

2473
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:17,060
Didn't they, didn't they do though, um, a game based off of the ring that came out in

2474
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,060
Japan.

2475
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:20,700
Yeah, they'd had it on the Wii.

2476
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:23,040
I actually, I actually want that game.

2477
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:29,060
I wanted to play it, but I wanted to play like, I want like a game like that where you

2478
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:31,500
die in the end, you know, cause there's no happy endings.

2479
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,500
They had one.

2480
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:35,860
Well, I don't remember if it was a rain, but they had the one, it was, God, I don't remember

2481
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:36,860
these movies anymore.

2482
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:38,540
It's the one that was the grudge.

2483
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,540
Yeah.

2484
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:44,380
Cause there were also a bunch of TV movies and cause the ring series just got stupid

2485
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:46,140
in Japan with the Sadako 3d.

2486
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,200
It was awful.

2487
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:48,540
That was a bad movie.

2488
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:49,540
Um, let's see.

2489
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:52,120
Fifth dream says I couldn't play PT.

2490
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:55,020
Even watching sky play freaked me out for a couple days.

2491
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,020
Oh, live.vognetwork.com.

2492
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:59,540
Oh, let's move on to the next email.

2493
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:00,540
Sorry.

2494
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:01,780
Next email.

2495
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:06,540
Hey, orange lounge, I've been playing through divinity original sin and it's kicking my

2496
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:07,540
ass.

2497
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:08,540
I'm struggling.

2498
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:12,060
Completing objectives is almost like getting that good grade after hours of studying for

2499
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:13,060
a test.

2500
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:16,020
What was the, what were the most difficult games that you've ever played that made you

2501
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:18,460
rage and smile all at the same time?

2502
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:19,460
Much love.

2503
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:23,100
EA skeezy from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

2504
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,820
Rage and smile at the same time.

2505
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:33,420
I guess that sense of accomplishment for making it through something super meat boy.

2506
02:23:33,420 --> 02:23:37,380
I got that with fractal, any mega man game.

2507
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:38,380
Fractal.

2508
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:39,380
Mega man two.

2509
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,380
Mega man two.

2510
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:41,380
Mega man nine recently.

2511
02:23:41,380 --> 02:23:42,380
Oh my God.

2512
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:45,400
I haven't even played, I bought that and I never played it.

2513
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:46,900
Now's the best time.

2514
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:50,340
But you remember when I was on my really big fractal kick?

2515
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,340
Hmm.

2516
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:55,060
Just getting into level 30 on fractal cause each level was like a struggle.

2517
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:57,860
I would try for days to pass one level.

2518
02:23:57,860 --> 02:24:02,500
And then I was like, because me, I love my puzzle games and just being good at fractal.

2519
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:07,620
And then, um, there was a one day that while I was intensely intoxicated playing on Wendell's

2520
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:16,660
uh, uh, PSP that I got to like, what was it, 25 on, um, uh, great, now I can't think of

2521
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:22,260
the name, that puzzle game that has Luminesce while I was drunk and I could never do it

2522
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,260
again.

2523
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:27,140
And then I was like, I have a level 25, oh, that was great.

2524
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:32,420
Um, ask me this question again about level 85 and wow.

2525
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:36,300
Ask me this question again about rage inducing games that you love when I lose my hardcore

2526
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:40,260
character in Diablo three, especially if I end up live streaming that big moment that

2527
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:44,780
I lose my hardcore character because that's going to be a table flipping moment.

2528
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:47,100
How high is your hardcore character right now?

2529
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,220
Right now I just beat act two.

2530
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:50,140
I think I'm only 28 so it's not that far.

2531
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:54,140
I have, I have to get to 70 but I'm, I'm playing conservative right now.

2532
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:55,420
I'm not trying to push it too much.

2533
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:59,100
I'm making sure I'm a little out geared, but we'll see.

2534
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:01,580
I'll give you updates cause I'm really sucked into this right now.

2535
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,580
Like that's my goal.

2536
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:03,700
That's my current goal of the moment.

2537
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:08,180
Destiny will veer me off track for a little bit, but I'll, I'll, I can only sit in front

2538
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:12,260
of the PlayStation for so long before I'll end up back at the PC.

2539
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:13,260
Next email.

2540
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:14,260
Last email.

2541
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,260
Last email.

2542
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:18,500
Hi, I've been a long time listener since the live three 65 days.

2543
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:21,860
I don't have too much to add, but I do want to thank you for all the hard work you guys

2544
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:22,860
put into your show.

2545
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:27,020
I really do enjoy listening to the different perspectives of the events of the gaming industry

2546
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:30,260
and I was looking forward to hearing from you three or sometimes four or five.

2547
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:31,260
You get the idea.

2548
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:33,380
I hope all is well and take care.

2549
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:34,620
And that's from needle crash.

2550
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:36,580
Oh, is that no question?

2551
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:37,580
Nope.

2552
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:38,580
Just a nice wow.

2553
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:39,580
Happy email.

2554
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:40,580
Well, that's awesome.

2555
02:25:40,580 --> 02:25:41,580
Thank you.

2556
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:42,580
I love the happy emails.

2557
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:43,580
Thank you.

2558
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:46,820
And while you have been listening to us for a long time, you know what's funny and you're

2559
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:47,820
still here.

2560
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:54,300
I've been randomly meeting people at Dragon Con even this happened and just through some

2561
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:58,500
other events where people are like, yeah, you know, I've never really emailed or called

2562
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:03,260
or said anything, but I've been listening since the live 365 days and I'm like, well,

2563
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,260
nice to meet you.

2564
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:05,260
Thank you for showing up.

2565
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:07,820
I'm always just blown away by how long people have been around.

2566
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:14,020
I wouldn't know what we're doing because it doesn't feel like we're really doing much,

2567
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:15,220
but I guess we are.

2568
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:18,580
I think in some ways, not to get too sappy on you.

2569
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:20,020
It's not what we're doing.

2570
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:23,020
It's what we're not doing.

2571
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:24,700
That could be part of it.

2572
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:28,860
I think in some ways, it's like that bar cheers, right?

2573
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:29,860
Right.

2574
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:31,580
It's the old 80s sitcom cheers.

2575
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:33,900
Does that mean I get to sit in the corner and drink beer?

2576
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:37,780
You are definitely Rhea Perlman.

2577
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:40,060
I would be Ted Danson.

2578
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:41,060
Loki's Kirstie Alley.

2579
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:42,060
No, no, no.

2580
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:45,620
No, no, no, no.

2581
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:46,620
You are Norm.

2582
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:47,620
He'd be our Norm.

2583
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:48,620
He'd be Norm.

2584
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:53,380
I would say Rama's more the norm because every time, every week when he calls, Norm, Rama,

2585
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:54,380
right?

2586
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:59,340
But anyway, all that joking aside, I think it's this place and we've tried really hard

2587
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:02,580
to build a welcoming place, like no jerks allowed, right?

2588
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:06,740
A welcoming place where we can just sit around and talk about video games.

2589
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:10,660
And even when I don't agree with you guys, and there's some of you guys in chat that

2590
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:15,420
I disagree with an awful lot, you know who you are, but I respect you and I respect your

2591
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:16,420
opinion.

2592
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:20,300
And I think the fact that we all respect each other in that way and have helped create that

2593
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:24,900
environment has helped the longevity of this show in a way you guys can't even imagine

2594
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:27,260
because we don't tolerate that disrespect.

2595
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:30,780
We're not going to allow that type of environment because that's what's going to make people

2596
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:32,100
not want to be here.

2597
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:36,420
So and if you'd rather participate quietly, then that's cool too.

2598
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:40,020
Just know that if you ever want to speak up, we're here to listen.

2599
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:42,060
Every gamer has a voice.

2600
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:43,900
And it might be mine.

2601
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:48,740
It is yours an awful lot, but we love you.

2602
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:54,460
I'm the one reading the emails unless I have, you know, laryngitis or something.

2603
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:57,180
And those are the days when I sound like this.

2604
02:27:57,180 --> 02:28:01,140
Hi, this is Jamie, you're listening to Orange Lost Radio.

2605
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:05,700
Now you sound like one of those anti-smoking commercials or something.

2606
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:07,860
I sound like the tracheotomy cow.

2607
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:08,860
You do.

2608
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:09,860
You do.

2609
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:15,220
Actually, I sound like one of the Simpson sisters, Marja sisters.

2610
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:16,220
Patty and Selma.

2611
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:17,220
Patty and Selma.

2612
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:18,220
I love Patty and Selma.

2613
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:19,220
All right.

2614
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:20,220
Yeah, that's it.

2615
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:23,980
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send us an email.

2616
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:28,580
And if you want to send a very kind email like that one was, then you know what?

2617
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:30,340
Those emails really make my fricking day.

2618
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:33,140
So I appreciate that you even take 30 seconds to type that out.

2619
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:37,220
If you want to send an email that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck, then I'll read that

2620
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:38,220
too and then hit delete.

2621
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:39,220
And then we'll laugh.

2622
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:46,020
No, but again, I, I don't always agree with some of the opinions, but I respect them.

2623
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,700
As long as you're, I like things that as long as you treat respectful discussion, yes.

2624
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:52,160
As long as you treat people respectfully.

2625
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:53,160
That's all I care about.

2626
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:55,940
Sometimes we're going to get heated here in the, here in the room.

2627
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:59,620
We've all had, we've had the dark soccer and I have gotten into it.

2628
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:00,620
Dark soccer, Loki gotten into it.

2629
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:04,700
I've gotten into it, Loki, but we all respect each other a ton and more and more every week

2630
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:05,700
that we still are.

2631
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:08,780
And then Rob buys Mass Effect 3 on Wii U.

2632
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:11,100
You only, you only said that cause Shane walked in.

2633
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:15,140
I know, but it's funny, Shane, did you hear what happened earlier in the show?

2634
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:24,140
I bought, I bought Mass Effect 3 on Wii U because it was $13 on Amazon, but, but, but

2635
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:25,140
I own it.

2636
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:27,900
Shane, Shane, no one can hear anything that he's saying.

2637
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:31,900
Shane said you could have borrowed mine for free and figured out that it's garbage.

2638
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:33,980
But now Shane, now you don't understand.

2639
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:36,860
Now Shane, I own Mass Effect 3, every single version or Mass Effect.

2640
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:38,900
You don't sound like Harvey Fierstein.

2641
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:42,900
Shane, come here and get on a mic if you're going to keep talking.

2642
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:46,900
We're doing a show.

2643
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:47,900
You're talking to everybody else.

2644
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:51,420
I was just saying, why did you buy that when we need to buy cables for iPhones and we could

2645
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:52,420
have combined the order.

2646
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:53,420
Why?

2647
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:54,420
Porque no los dos?

2648
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:59,100
I don't understand Mexican.

2649
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,100
Get out.

2650
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:01,100
Okay.

2651
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:09,980
You know what, apparently I sound like Aunt Slappy and Aunt Slappy sounds like an old

2652
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:10,980
Jewish woman.

2653
02:30:10,980 --> 02:30:11,980
All right.

2654
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:17,900
I'm, I am falling more and more into the stereotype of my adopted culture.

2655
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:18,900
All right.

2656
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:19,900
I'm no good at saving money.

2657
02:30:19,900 --> 02:30:21,540
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

2658
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:23,020
You ready for the FUs of the week?

2659
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:24,020
Here we go.

2660
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:45,980
I am surprisingly good with my lot in life right now.

2661
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:54,820
The only things I have to say about FU is people who don't know how to support their

2662
02:30:54,820 --> 02:30:58,940
ideology without using fallacious arguments.

2663
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:02,860
Therefore I have decided that henceforth, anytime I disagree with somebody, I'm just

2664
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:06,660
going to point out how the argument sucks and how they've actually spouted a logical

2665
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:09,700
fallacy and tell them to talk to me when they can actually debate.

2666
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:11,740
Like we learned how to do in school.

2667
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:15,620
Is that similar to how on Twitter I have a policy where if people try to troll me with

2668
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:19,540
that messages, I just respond with a RuPaul's drag race gift?

2669
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:25,100
Kind of, but like for example, it's like, Oh, well marijuana is a slippery slope to

2670
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:26,100
this and that.

2671
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:30,220
Slippery slope arguments are considered fallacious.

2672
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:34,740
I need something with numbers and proof behind it.

2673
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:38,460
Maybe they just need to smoke some weed and chill out.

2674
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:41,620
This is like, um, you know, I don't, I don't do marijuana for the record, but I don't care

2675
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:45,660
if you just used, uh, an emotion, emotional reasoning instead of logical reasoning.

2676
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:48,420
I want you to rephrase that using proof.

2677
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:49,420
All right.

2678
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:50,420
Loki, your review of the week.

2679
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:51,420
You know what I say?

2680
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:54,860
It's snow covered mountains are slippery slope.

2681
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:55,860
It's factual.

2682
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:00,580
Especially when you go sledding and they're extra slippery.

2683
02:32:00,580 --> 02:32:02,060
Is that your FU of the week?

2684
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:06,900
No, I guess my FU of the week would be, I have nothing to do at work.

2685
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:11,300
I guess I could be looking for work, but it feels a little wrong to be looking for work

2686
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:12,300
at work.

2687
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:16,940
But since they're like, well, they're training people like on the new system, but I'm not

2688
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:19,300
one of those new people that they're trained on the system.

2689
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:25,380
And then, then apparently they're keeping a couple reps from our Dallas office for some

2690
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:26,380
reason.

2691
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:31,180
I don't know, but they wanted to keep some outside reps instead of paying for one rep

2692
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:33,860
to be in our Folsom house, but whatever.

2693
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:39,020
So I've got to get them up to speed on my accounts, but they don't give a shit.

2694
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:40,860
So fuck it.

2695
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:43,060
I don't give a shit too then.

2696
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:48,820
So I guess I have you to my boss and his boss for not fucking writing my rec letters or

2697
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:49,820
recommendation.

2698
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:52,420
Like I asked you, I fucking asked you like weeks ago.

2699
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:54,860
And then I reminded you again and you still haven't fucking done it.

2700
02:32:54,860 --> 02:32:56,940
I'm only asking you one fucking thing.

2701
02:32:56,940 --> 02:33:00,580
You can't give me a job, but the least you can do is fucking write me my goddamn letter

2702
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:02,040
of recommendations.

2703
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:05,180
So I can apply for other jobs.

2704
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:06,180
What a mess.

2705
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,460
I hope you get through that quick.

2706
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:08,460
Logie.

2707
02:33:08,460 --> 02:33:10,540
Oh, well, like a couple more weeks or a few more weeks.

2708
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:14,580
So 30th, a few comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2709
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:17,860
Rama says marijuana is a slippery slope to me having an empty fridge.

2710
02:33:17,860 --> 02:33:19,860
You know what I said?

2711
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:20,860
What?

2712
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:24,700
It's a slippery slip to Benadryl for me since I'm allergic and then that's a slippery slip

2713
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:25,700
to naps.

2714
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:26,700
Lots of naps.

2715
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:31,980
Uh, SSG100 Matt says what Jamie needs is for people to show her the receipts for their

2716
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:32,980
arguments.

2717
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:36,140
So people are actually buying their arguments or something.

2718
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:37,900
I think it's a reference to the Whitney Houston.

2719
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:39,900
I want to see the receipts.

2720
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,620
According to the market on an argument.

2721
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:43,620
So sales.

2722
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:44,620
Hello.

2723
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:47,620
I'm here to have an argument.

2724
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:51,620
Oh, this is abuse.

2725
02:33:51,620 --> 02:33:52,620
All right.

2726
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:53,620
Do I get to do my FUs of the week?

2727
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:54,620
Here's my FUs of the week.

2728
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:55,620
All right.

2729
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:56,620
Yes.

2730
02:33:56,620 --> 02:33:57,620
Remember that whole thing about respect and all that.

2731
02:33:57,620 --> 02:33:58,620
We all love and respect each other.

2732
02:33:58,620 --> 02:33:59,620
Put that on hold for a minute.

2733
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:01,060
Put that on hold for a minute.

2734
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:02,700
Shut up lady.

2735
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:07,900
My FU of the week goes to everybody with the exception of code man and fifth dream.

2736
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:08,900
My hype.

2737
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:09,900
My high five.

2738
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:15,540
F you to everybody who made fun of me for buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U.

2739
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:22,660
I'll do what I want rod buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U is like me having cheesecake

2740
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:23,660
for breakfast.

2741
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:25,220
Well, I'm a grown up.

2742
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:26,500
What's the fucking problem?

2743
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,500
I'm a grown up.

2744
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:29,500
Exactly.

2745
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:30,500
I'm a grown up.

2746
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:37,500
It's like as Gordon Modesto for Duncan.

2747
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:38,500
All right.

2748
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:40,100
Team adult.

2749
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:44,460
We know how to adult.

2750
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:48,980
Just a few more stories for you guys and then your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR

2751
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:53,440
and then, and then the week after that we go to San Francisco, just go to hot cookie.

2752
02:34:53,440 --> 02:34:55,420
And then after that we go to LA.

2753
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:56,420
Just go to Disneyland.

2754
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:57,420
All right.

2755
02:34:57,420 --> 02:34:58,420
Calm down.

2756
02:34:58,420 --> 02:34:59,420
Calm down.

2757
02:34:59,420 --> 02:35:00,420
Put the car in park.

2758
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:03,380
Uh, one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

2759
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:07,460
All one word, but first a couple more stories for you guys, uh, Loki.

2760
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:14,680
So Sega is locked in a courtroom battle with gearbox, um, regarding aliens, colonial Marines

2761
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:15,680
and some more.

2762
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:23,080
Um, I guess testimony came out, um, on September 2nd and regarding, you know, how gearbox handled

2763
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:27,940
the majority of the marketing of the game and, um, basically said the significant level

2764
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:35,060
of public relations, the anatomy and was demanded by the studio and to, you know, the TLDL of

2765
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:38,220
it is, um, or I messed that up.

2766
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:46,060
The TLDR of that is, um, basically gearbox president Randy Pitchford just did whatever

2767
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:47,060
the fuck he wanted.

2768
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:54,340
Uh, according to, uh, say guy just, just did what he wanted and, you know, uh, advertise

2769
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:55,720
the game however he wanted.

2770
02:35:55,720 --> 02:36:00,700
And so they're blaming him for the fact that the game didn't quite meet what they were

2771
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:02,180
showing off at E3.

2772
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:08,980
And I don't know, it's a drama, a whole bunch of drama.

2773
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:12,180
No shortage of that in the gaming industry these past couple of weeks.

2774
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:17,460
I mean, I think right now they're trying to distance the fact that yes, it was gearbox

2775
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:23,200
that, you know, cause this game to suck and not Sega because Sega does have another aliens

2776
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:26,840
game coming out in like a month from now.

2777
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:31,460
So they probably want to establish that, yeah, it wasn't us, it was them.

2778
02:36:31,460 --> 02:36:33,460
So that people buy that game.

2779
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,500
I think they've distanced enough from it.

2780
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:38,700
A lot of the, a lot of the people I think are pretty good about knowing that it's a

2781
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:41,460
different thing.

2782
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:44,580
That's the impression I get anyway, especially, especially when you've got Sigourney Weaver

2783
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:48,700
and some of the DLC, that's a pretty, pretty big land, you know?

2784
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:49,700
Yeah.

2785
02:36:49,700 --> 02:36:55,260
So, all right, well, uh, I got one more thing for you guys here and it has to do with a

2786
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:58,160
possible competitor to Steam and Origin.

2787
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:03,640
Another challenger enters the ring, and that could be Warner Brothers, now keep in mind

2788
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:08,880
this is all rumor, however, Warner Brothers filed a series of trademark applications this

2789
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:14,720
past week for something called WB Play, covering things like, quote, online retail store services,

2790
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:19,040
quote, audio and video broadcasting services, and quote, entertainment service.

2791
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:22,600
And also, quote, downloadable virtual goods.

2792
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:25,040
So hmm, very interesting.

2793
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:29,280
Warner Brothers has used Steam and Origin in the past, but possibly they're going to

2794
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:30,720
come up with their own thing.

2795
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:34,880
Uh, again, you have to really tinfoil hat this an awful lot, but it's not like we haven't

2796
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:40,440
seen companies kind of try to do their own thing and try to have that central, you know,

2797
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,120
hub for their stuff.

2798
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:47,280
You know, Ubisoft has one, EA's got that whole pass online, well, and they have Origin, right?

2799
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,600
So well, yeah, and it can go one of two ways.

2800
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:54,960
I mean, it could be like Uplay where their games are offered on Uplay and they're offered

2801
02:37:54,960 --> 02:38:00,040
on the Steam store, or it could be like Origin where their games aren't usually offered on

2802
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:02,400
the Steam store, it's just on Origin.

2803
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:10,440
So hopefully it's more like, you know, Uplay, but I don't know.

2804
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:15,040
Warner does some weird, having worked in the industry with Warner Brothers on the movie

2805
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:20,080
side, they do some really strange shit, and then they turn around and do some other strange

2806
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:24,960
shit and it just keeps going on and on like that, and even if it doesn't make any fucking

2807
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:29,840
sense they will keep sticking with it like, oh, they're going to sell direct to everybody,

2808
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:33,600
oh, they're not going to sell direct to everybody, oh, they're going to do that again, oh, they're

2809
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:38,360
not going to sell to, you know, distribution, they're going to just, you know, limit rental

2810
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:40,040
windows, oh, they're not going to do that.

2811
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:44,080
It's just like, ugh, I can't follow what they're doing anymore.

2812
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:48,160
Um, so, I could see them doing this, whether it's successful or not, but they're going

2813
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:52,640
to stick with it, and if anything, they may do this just for, you know, not only games

2814
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:57,080
but movies as well, you know, have a platform where they can digitally distribute their

2815
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:58,080
products.

2816
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:03,240
Well, now, WBPlay is going to be something because the domain name, wbplay.com, it was

2817
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:08,240
registered back in 2013, but they're not doing anything with it right now, so clearly something

2818
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:12,040
is going to happen with this, and, gee, the launch of Batman Arkham Origins would be a

2819
02:39:12,040 --> 02:39:17,000
great time to kick the wall down with launching something, especially with the Mortal Kombat

2820
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:21,760
10, or Mortal Kombat X, excuse me, just around the corner as well, so, you know, 2015 would

2821
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:24,680
be a great year for Warner Brothers to make a move in that department.

2822
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:29,760
I'm all for competition, but at the same time, Origin was, I don't like the whole, like,

2823
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:35,000
required thing, and yes, I realize Steam started this way, but Steam's been around so long

2824
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:40,440
now that time and an epic amount of Steam sales have really healed a lot of things.

2825
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:43,160
So I just hope if Warner Brothers is going to do their own thing, I just don't want it

2826
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:44,600
to be mandatory.

2827
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:46,400
Make me want to install it.

2828
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:50,200
Do something that's going to make me want to get on there and use the service.

2829
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:51,200
That's all.

2830
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,120
That's all I want.

2831
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:54,640
Is that a fair request, Loki?

2832
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:55,640
Yeah.

2833
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:56,640
All right.

2834
02:39:56,640 --> 02:40:00,920
Speaking of Steam, just a real quick update, they did do a client beta update that does

2835
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:08,840
some in-home streaming, I guess, optimizations and some updates for AMD, so some more video

2836
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:13,520
cards supported there for the in-home streaming support, so stay on top of your Steam beta

2837
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:16,080
updates if that's something that's of interest to you.

2838
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,360
All right.

2839
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:18,360
Now we're done.

2840
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:19,680
We're to the calls.

2841
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:20,680
So let's open it up.

2842
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:25,740
Skypline is open right now, 1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2843
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:28,800
And in the meantime, I'm going to get to the Twitters, because I know we had a few Twitter

2844
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,280
topics tonight.

2845
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:34,160
While I bring up Twitter, does Loki have any last minute stories he wants to cover?

2846
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:35,960
Uh, no.

2847
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:36,960
Really?

2848
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:40,320
It's like Borderlands 2's coming to Linux.

2849
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,320
That's kind of cool.

2850
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:42,320
Oh, that's cool.

2851
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:47,480
I don't know why this was even news anywhere, but apparently, yeah, the new 3DS models,

2852
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:50,680
they're region-locked as well.

2853
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:51,760
Really is that a shock?

2854
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:56,880
Because the original 3DS and 3DS XL were region-locked as well.

2855
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,640
What made you think they were going to all of a sudden change their mind on that?

2856
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:05,400
Although honestly, if it wasn't region-locked, they might sell a few more systems, but yeah.

2857
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:06,400
I have the reasons.

2858
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:09,800
If the new 3DS was not region-locked, I'd buy one in a heartbeat.

2859
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:12,520
Anyway, let's go ahead and go to the phones, because the phones are lighting up.

2860
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:13,520
Let's get to it.

2861
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2862
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:15,520
Who's this?

2863
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,520
Hey, what's up, guys?

2864
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:17,520
This is Kaijuto.

2865
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:18,520
Hey, Kaijuto.

2866
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:19,520
What's up, buddy?

2867
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:24,960
I got to put my two cents into the new 3DS, and also I want to let you guys know about

2868
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:27,880
a news story that I think that you should cover maybe later that I haven't really seen

2869
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:28,880
in the news.

2870
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:29,880
Okay.

2871
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:32,520
So I'm going to try to make it all quick so you can get to another phone call.

2872
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:39,760
The 3DS, I'm pretty much convinced that everything about the new 3DS is to fix whatever

2873
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,960
everybody felt was wrong about the current 3DS.

2874
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:46,840
If you think about it, the faster web browser, like Loki mentioned, a lot of people complained

2875
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,880
about that when the 3DS came out.

2876
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:52,560
Also, a lot of people hated the fact that I never had this problem, but people were

2877
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:57,720
saying, if you look too far off to the side, you lose the 3D, and what do you see now in

2878
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:58,720
the new 3DS?

2879
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:02,060
It's like you can tilt it a little further, so that means that more people can stand around

2880
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:05,440
you at the bus stop and watch you play your 3D game.

2881
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:09,920
The thumbsticks, which I mentioned before, the extra shoulder buttons, which makes it

2882
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:13,840
sound like they're making it for hardcore gamers, so-called hardcore gamers.

2883
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:18,640
The SD card slot, that's another thing that people wanted, and hopefully with all this,

2884
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:22,400
they'll bring back picture chat, or whatever the hell that thing was called.

2885
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:23,640
Oh, the swap note.

2886
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:25,120
Yeah, swap note, yeah.

2887
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:26,120
That would be great.

2888
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:27,640
They're willing to bring that back.

2889
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:31,720
Is that why there's going to be a 60 cent lock on this maybe with the parental controls?

2890
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:32,720
That actually-

2891
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:33,720
I wouldn't doubt it.

2892
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:34,720
Huh, interesting thought.

2893
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:39,160
That's a good thought, and here's where I stand with the new 3DS.

2894
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:42,320
As much crap as we've kind of been giving you here, especially over the name and things

2895
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:46,680
like that, ultimately, golden rule, we've said this before, our system is only as good

2896
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,080
as the games that are on it.

2897
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:51,380
All I'm hearing right now is that, oh, we're going to get Xenoblade, which was already

2898
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:55,060
done on the Wii and have already played, so that alone is not enough to convince me to

2899
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:58,780
replace my XL, which works for the 3DS library just fine.

2900
02:42:58,780 --> 02:43:01,960
Some of these other features, they all sound good and cool and things like that, and yay

2901
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:06,240
for the people that don't already have a 3DS, but eh, I can play my 3DS games just

2902
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,240
fine right now.

2903
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:08,240
I'm not going to-

2904
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:12,780
A lot of fans, a lot of fans of the current 3DS, I mean, it's almost like they pretty

2905
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:17,200
much heard people's cries and they fixed them.

2906
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:19,200
Obviously, that's not their main reason.

2907
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:26,120
Their ultimate goal, of course, is to make money, but yeah, to me, I applaud them for

2908
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:29,800
doing it because I think that they're actually listening to their fans and trying to correct

2909
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,800
the mistakes.

2910
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:34,880
Y'all know that the, what the hell is it, the 3D XL, whatever the hell it's called,

2911
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:37,280
I mean, people were complaining about the screen being too small.

2912
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:38,280
They fixed that.

2913
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:41,760
It seems like they just seem to make the 3DS for everyone.

2914
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,880
People hated the 3D, you got the 2DS, you know, it's like, you know, I think it's a

2915
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:46,880
good thing.

2916
02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:49,880
I don't know if I'm going to buy it anytime soon, but it's a good thing.

2917
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:54,480
See, see, wait a minute.

2918
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:59,360
At the end of the day, I'll try to put cynical Rob aside and say, you know what, if Nintendo

2919
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:03,640
is really listening to people, and I really hope you're right, that this is what they're

2920
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:09,720
trying to do, is they're really trying to listen to people, that would be fantastic.

2921
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:11,160
I do hope you're right in that regard.

2922
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:15,480
I'm a little skeptical if that's really the case, but I would love it if it is the case.

2923
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:16,480
I'm almost sure of it.

2924
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:19,480
All right, let me get to this real quick and I'll let you get to a call.

2925
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:23,000
You guys got to find out about what's going on with CraftBucket and Minecraft.

2926
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,600
I know that, Loki, you used CraftBucket for your server, right?

2927
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:29,000
Yeah, I did.

2928
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:31,560
They kind of already explained what went on with that.

2929
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:36,880
It's just that I guess the original dev or whatever doesn't want to work on it anymore,

2930
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:40,640
and apparently it was purchased by Mojang at one point, and so they're going to continue

2931
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:45,720
development on it, at least for 1.8, internally within Mojang, and they're going to release

2932
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:46,720
that at some point.

2933
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:53,400
And I don't know where Minecraft's officially supported mod singing works into it.

2934
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:58,920
I can only hope that, I mean, fuck, I'll switch over to whatever they have if it, you know,

2935
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:01,840
supports what I want to run on it.

2936
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:02,840
So we'll see.

2937
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:08,320
You know, it would be nice to have one unified thing that I don't have to wait for, oh, CraftBucket

2938
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:13,640
to update to support 1.8, you know, because right now I'm on 1.79.

2939
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:14,640
I don't know.

2940
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:17,440
I hope it's better.

2941
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,440
I don't know, man.

2942
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:22,240
With Mojang, I mean, it took them a year just to come out with 1.8.

2943
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:25,600
I mean, I know it's a big update, but it took them a year.

2944
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:27,960
Those guys have proven to be super slow.

2945
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:31,960
I don't know what the hell they're doing over there drinking goat milk or whatever the hell,

2946
02:45:31,960 --> 02:45:39,160
but they don't seem to do things on time, and they changed their mind, because I remember

2947
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:43,800
back in 2011, we were supposed to get the mod API, and all of a sudden, I didn't know

2948
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:46,480
where we got runs, which doesn't make any sense to me.

2949
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:48,880
They're doing a lot of tweaks, though, to the game.

2950
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:54,400
I saw kind of a development article about how they're redoing their calling engine for

2951
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:59,480
it and stuff to make it a lot faster, because remember, you know, if your chunks aren't

2952
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:03,120
loading or whatever, you can see kind of in the distance and see all these different caves

2953
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:09,520
and stuff that are down there, where now that's all going to be culled out so that your CPU

2954
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:12,960
isn't trying to render shit that you're nowhere near.

2955
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:17,240
So I think that's great, and they were doing that for the Pocket Edition, I think, mainly,

2956
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:22,240
but I'm sure they can apply that to the regular edition as well, and that only means better

2957
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:23,760
performance.

2958
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:29,200
I kind of wish they would move out of, you know, using Java for everything, but I mean,

2959
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:32,140
that's just the way the game's built, I guess.

2960
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:37,420
It would be nice to see some sort of, you know, boost for, you know, having a nice graphics

2961
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:38,420
card and stuff like that.

2962
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:42,960
I don't know, I just don't really see that with their client.

2963
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:47,200
But I'm hopeful once they do get the mod API support out there, and once, you know, maybe

2964
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:52,160
even if, you know, CraftBucket gets updated to 1.8, it doesn't matter that they're, you

2965
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:57,200
know, not getting every single little update, it's just, you know, you can fill the gaps

2966
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,600
in with a lot of stuff that, a lot of the mods that they have on there.

2967
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:05,440
I kind of wish that they would have, you know, like, Forge support where you can make your

2968
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:11,360
own, you know, characters and, you know, stuff in there, like, that's really what I wanted

2969
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:15,400
to have, is like, was it CraftForge or whatever, I forget how they, I don't remember what it's

2970
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:16,400
called, but basically...

2971
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:19,400
Yeah, SpoutBucket, Craft, all types of Craft.

2972
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:24,600
Yeah, it's like so many different, like, offshoots of, you know, Bucket, you know, of like, SpoutCraft

2973
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:30,160
or something like that, where you can, you know, combine, you know, Bucket plug-ins with,

2974
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:35,440
you know, just the, all this user-generated stuff, you know, new blocks, new enemies,

2975
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:38,680
new all sorts of things, that would be pretty awesome.

2976
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:45,040
But honestly, if they make it easier to put stuff in there mod-wise, at least on a server

2977
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:49,000
than they have with Bucket, because Bucket is kind of a pain in the ass sometimes, I'm

2978
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,000
all for that.

2979
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Yeah.

2980
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
It's glitchy, it's buggy as hell.

2981
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:57,520
I mean, I have a server on it, and, I mean, I'm always, like, you know, having to remove

2982
02:47:57,520 --> 02:48:02,880
something and putting something back in, downgrading, upgrading, it's a mess, so I'm what you're

2983
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:03,880
saying.

2984
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:06,320
All right, well, Kaijuto, buddy, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but have

2985
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:07,840
a good one, and thanks for the call.

2986
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:08,840
Good perspectives.

2987
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:09,840
All right.

2988
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:10,840
Later, buddy.

2989
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:15,680
All right, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to

2990
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:16,680
give us a call.

2991
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:20,000
Meanwhile, I'm reading some Twitter topics, so I wait for another call to come in.

2992
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:26,120
Alan Alchemy tweeted us earlier today, saying, another OLR challenge for me, all three hosts

2993
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:30,240
play Hatoful Boyfriend for How Is Your Gaming Week.

2994
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:32,840
Loki will say no, in parentheses.

2995
02:48:32,840 --> 02:48:35,680
I want to do it, I want to check out this game for sure.

2996
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:38,240
I will say no, because I don't have money to buy that game, and honestly, I don't need

2997
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,520
yet another game in my backlog.

2998
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:43,840
What if Alan gifted it to you?

2999
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:45,400
It looks silly, but I don't want it.

3000
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:46,480
I don't really want it.

3001
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:51,720
It's not my type of game, yeah, it's funny, it's pigeons and birds and stuff, it's a dating

3002
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:55,880
sim, it's hilarious, but I think it's just going to get old so fast, like once you get

3003
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:57,680
past that joke, it's just whatever.

3004
02:48:57,680 --> 02:48:58,840
Will Jamie play it?

3005
02:48:58,840 --> 02:49:01,000
Hatoful Boyfriend, Dating Pigeons?

3006
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
I've already played it.

3007
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Oh, well then-

3008
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,600
Not the new one, but I've played the old releases.

3009
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:07,520
You should play the new one, and tell us which they are.

3010
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:08,520
Well, maybe I will.

3011
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:09,520
All right, we'll see.

3012
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:10,520
Anyway, we're going to go to the phones again.

3013
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:11,520
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3014
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,520
Hey everyone, this is Norm Peterson.

3015
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:14,520
Hey, Norm!

3016
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:15,520
Hey, everybody.

3017
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:17,920
What up, my friend?

3018
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:18,920
Not much, not much.

3019
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:19,920
Did you appreciate that comparison?

3020
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:25,080
Oh yeah, and the funny thing is, I was about to shout in the chat room, that's me, before

3021
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,320
you said it.

3022
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:32,880
You know what though, to be fair, there's a lot of regular callers to OLR that I feel

3023
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:36,680
rightfully share the title of, Norm.

3024
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:39,680
You're very good at getting through first or second, though.

3025
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:43,840
I actually gave you a shout out on one of the panels, and I don't even remember, it

3026
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:49,520
was because we were talking about just creating that kind of environment, and I actually asked

3027
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:53,560
the room, I asked the room, I said, how many of you guys here listen to OLR?

3028
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:56,480
And a good chance, I was surprised, I was like, wow, a lot of the hands actually went

3029
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:57,480
up.

3030
02:49:57,480 --> 02:50:00,960
And I said, could you guys imagine an episode of OrangeLoungeRadio where Rama doesn't call

3031
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:01,960
in?

3032
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:02,960
And I got a resounding, no!

3033
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:08,960
So I'm a ratings bringer!

3034
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:10,920
Something like that, something like that.

3035
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:12,880
I thought you would appreciate that story.

3036
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:13,920
What's on your mind, my friend?

3037
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:19,280
Well, I just wanted to make sure I got everybody's orders correct, so Rob, you want three bags

3038
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:26,440
of pumpkin spice latte, Jamie wants a dozen donuts, shrink-wrapped, freeze-dried sent

3039
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:31,320
to her, and Loki wants a large black coffee, right?

3040
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:32,320
Loki doesn't drink coffee.

3041
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:35,600
No, this is vacuum-sealed, that way they stay fresh.

3042
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:40,120
Okay, that's why I was calling the order back over to make sure I had it correct.

3043
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:42,120
I want pumpkin as well.

3044
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:49,520
Loki wants you to knock this shit off, that's what he wants.

3045
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:52,520
I don't know, no, I think it's fantastic.

3046
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:56,440
I will be fighting Dark Sakura for those donuts, but she'll be fighting for the coffee, so

3047
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:57,440
it'll work out.

3048
02:50:57,440 --> 02:50:59,600
Rob, you are such a consumer whore.

3049
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:02,280
And how?

3050
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:06,720
I just bought Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U, that's my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3, take

3051
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:09,800
all the shots you want tonight, I don't give a fuck.

3052
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:15,440
I know you don't give a fuck.

3053
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:19,600
There's shame in your game, Mr. Rob Roberts, and for that, I salute you.

3054
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:20,600
You know what?

3055
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:22,080
Support the games you love, right?

3056
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,080
I don't know.

3057
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:24,080
Oh yeah.

3058
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,080
I got nothing.

3059
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:26,080
I got nothing.

3060
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:27,080
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

3061
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:30,520
Was it just to check the order, or what's your game been like the past couple weeks?

3062
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:32,240
We didn't have a show last week.

3063
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:35,600
I actually picked up the Lego Movie video game, and it's been pretty fun.

3064
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:36,600
Oh yeah?

3065
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:37,600
Yep.

3066
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:38,600
Everything is awesome?

3067
02:51:38,840 --> 02:51:43,640
Everything is awesome, everything is cool, and you're part of it.

3068
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:44,640
Let me stop.

3069
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,640
Let me stop.

3070
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:51,280
If I start seeing that, I'm gonna hang up, turn on the PS3, start playing this game and

3071
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:52,960
realize it's time for me to go to bed.

3072
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,440
Shit, it's six o'clock in the morning.

3073
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:56,440
I got 45 minutes.

3074
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:58,520
That ain't happening.

3075
02:51:58,520 --> 02:52:01,800
Rama, what's coming up on Anime Jam Session this week?

3076
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:06,920
Oh, actually, we don't know yet, because Marco hasn't gotten the outline to me yet.

3077
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:09,480
I usually don't know until Monday, so...

3078
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:12,360
Well, shoot, here I was trying to let you have a plug, but...

3079
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:17,560
I know, and I appreciate it, but you know how the saying is, good help is so hard to

3080
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:18,920
find these days, you know what I'm saying?

3081
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:19,920
Yeah, no, I understand.

3082
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:23,400
Well, look, I have OLR show rule done about two hours before we're live, so you know,

3083
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:24,400
I know how it goes.

3084
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:25,400
Exactly, yeah.

3085
02:52:25,400 --> 02:52:27,400
Tacking Melly Rob that morning.

3086
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:32,320
Loki, the other week, Loki had his stories in at four o'clock, and I was like, Loki,

3087
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:33,320
God damn it.

3088
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:35,560
All right, but anyway, we make it work.

3089
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:36,560
All right, Rama.

3090
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:39,600
No, no, no, no, hold on, my stories were not in at four o'clock.

3091
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:40,880
Not this week, but a prior week.

3092
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:41,880
No, that's true.

3093
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:42,880
It was like three weeks ago.

3094
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:43,880
But usually I get it before that.

3095
02:52:43,880 --> 02:52:44,880
Yeah, you're okay.

3096
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:45,880
All right.

3097
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:46,880
No, they work hard.

3098
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:51,600
I was like, I took a nap before four o'clock today, I know for a fact that those stories

3099
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,480
weren't in.

3100
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:55,080
The joys of producing a podcast.

3101
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:58,000
All right, Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls.

3102
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,480
If you really do do this donut thing, you're so awesome, I can't even...

3103
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:06,160
I'm not gonna do the donut thing, but remember, I did do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

3104
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:09,440
I called all of you out, but you don't have to worry.

3105
02:53:09,440 --> 02:53:13,400
Act Def is taking one for the team, because remember, he does work for the site.

3106
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:16,200
I don't have ice or a bucket, so that's not gonna work.

3107
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:18,640
I ship you a bucket, sir.

3108
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:19,640
Mr. Bucket?

3109
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:20,640
Mr. Bucket?

3110
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:25,520
No, I would like to continue to do things to support the MS Foundation.

3111
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:29,200
It's kind of my charity of choice right now, so I'm gonna try and put some things together

3112
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:30,720
with the Hoard House guys for that.

3113
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:32,520
But I think what you guys are doing is fantastic.

3114
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:33,520
Yeah.

3115
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,280
All right, I'm gonna let you go, buddy.

3116
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,280
Take care.

3117
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:37,280
You too, man.

3118
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:38,280
Stay black.

3119
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:39,280
You too.

3120
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:40,280
Bye.

3121
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:41,280
Bye.

3122
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:43,000
The bucket of advice right now sounds pretty good.

3123
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,400
It's kind of warm in here.

3124
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:48,360
I'm gonna make sure the AC's on or something.

3125
02:53:48,360 --> 02:53:53,280
You guys fill time while we wait for another call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

3126
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:58,600
Um, words.

3127
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:04,280
I really have no idea what to say, because I have a 10-hour day tomorrow.

3128
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:05,480
Sounds like fun.

3129
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:08,720
I did sign up for it, but I have an extra day off.

3130
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:13,480
So my goal is to have something playable in my game by episode 573.

3131
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:14,480
That's my goal.

3132
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:15,480
Really?

3133
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:16,480
Yes.

3134
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:17,480
I am back, by the way.

3135
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:18,820
I turned the AC down one degree.

3136
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:23,760
For you guys, I can spare the electric bill for one degree.

3137
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:24,760
Let's see.

3138
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:25,760
Looking at some other comments.

3139
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:30,480
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

3140
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:33,240
all one word.

3141
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:34,840
Flaco Jones sent us a tweet.

3142
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:37,120
Since you took the week off, I hope you can still touch on this story.

3143
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:39,920
I'm looking forward to Loki's reaction.

3144
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:45,320
And the story that he posted was about, and this is from the official Xbox news wire,

3145
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:50,000
talking about the Xbox One standalone Kinect sensor will be available in October.

3146
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:55,120
It will be bundled with Dance Central Spotlight, which came out while we were out as well,

3147
02:54:55,120 --> 02:54:58,200
and it will be available at retailers for $149.99.

3148
02:54:58,200 --> 02:55:00,840
Did you hear about that?

3149
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:01,840
Yeah, I did.

3150
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:04,120
A little higher than what I was expecting for retail price.

3151
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:06,120
I don't think anyone's going to buy it.

3152
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:07,120
No, seriously.

3153
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:11,000
I mean, look at who you're targeting this towards.

3154
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:15,320
You're targeting it towards somebody that wanted to buy an Xbox One system because they

3155
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:20,240
thought having Kinect in there was too expensive, and so they wanted to spend $100 less.

3156
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:24,600
And now you're telling them, oh, spend $150 on a Kinect that you probably don't want in

3157
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:31,200
the first place to play, what, a game that you didn't really know about from the beginning

3158
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,760
that you wanted to have Kinect for?

3159
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:38,680
I can't think of any game that's coming out for Kinect that would justify spending an

3160
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:39,680
extra $150.

3161
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:42,520
I can't think of anything.

3162
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:47,880
I'm sorry, Fantasia, while it's probably a cool game, is not fucking worth another $150.

3163
02:55:47,880 --> 02:55:51,280
Nor is Just Dance, nor is that Dance Central game that they're putting out on it.

3164
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:56,920
Yeah, it's like, I want to play Dance Central Spotlight, but not $150 bad, you know?

3165
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:58,320
It's really too expensive.

3166
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:02,680
The only thing I see that this is a positive is if this works on PC as well, because the

3167
02:56:02,680 --> 02:56:06,200
PC one that they had, which I don't know if it was a dev kit or something like that, was

3168
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:07,200
$200.

3169
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:08,200
Jeez.

3170
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:09,880
So it's just ridiculous.

3171
02:56:09,880 --> 02:56:17,000
It's a good way not to, I guess, if anything, this being out there makes maybe the Xbox

3172
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,880
One with Kinect a slightly better value if you really want Kinect, but honestly, you're

3173
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:26,680
probably not really going to want Kinect, because look at their track record.

3174
02:56:26,680 --> 02:56:29,120
What have they done for games with Kinect?

3175
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:31,360
Has there really been anything that innovative for it?

3176
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:32,360
No.

3177
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:35,160
I feel so bad for Harmonix, who's so invested in that.

3178
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:36,800
Harmonix is the Kinect right now.

3179
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:42,600
You know, with the Disney Fantasia and the Dance Central Spotlight, I feel so bad for

3180
02:56:42,600 --> 02:56:43,600
them in a way.

3181
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:48,160
Well, props to them that they have some really good software on there, and to be fair, the

3182
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:53,600
stuff that they do have for Kinect, like Just Dance, I'm guessing, is pretty good, and Dance

3183
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:59,120
Central was fun, but it's almost like buying a Wii U at that point, you know?

3184
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:02,480
Why am I going to spend this kind of money for two games?

3185
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:04,000
Well, there's more than two.

3186
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,720
I understand that, but I'm saying it's the equivalent of like, you know, why am I going

3187
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:13,280
to spend this kind of money for a couple games, and potentially in the future, I don't really

3188
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:18,680
know what, other than another Just Dance game, I mean, really, what else is going to be coming

3189
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:19,680
out?

3190
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,680
Another Kinect sports game?

3191
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:21,680
Does anyone give a shit about that?

3192
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:22,680
No.

3193
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:25,360
What about another Star Wars game where I can do the Han Solo?

3194
02:57:25,360 --> 02:57:28,360
All right, look, I've got to get back to Twitter topics.

3195
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:34,560
All right, Jason says, on the subject of rebuying the same game, I have three copies of Titanfall,

3196
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:39,760
360 physical, Xbox One digital, Xbox One physical with limited edition.

3197
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:44,720
Thank you, Jason, you get me, you get me, even though I don't know if I'd buy three

3198
02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:45,720
copies of that game.

3199
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:48,640
I do have at least one, so, but at least you get me.

3200
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:53,800
All right, SGA100Matt says, could the scum bar from Monkey Island become an official

3201
02:57:53,800 --> 02:57:54,800
Lego set?

3202
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:55,800
It's possible.

3203
02:57:55,800 --> 02:57:58,480
And he links us to an article from RetroCollect.com.

3204
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:01,360
Loki, you're the big Lego fan around here.

3205
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:04,960
I don't, well, I don't know if you still really do those with the kids, but I would think

3206
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:06,640
that's a fun activity you could all do together.

3207
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:09,520
Would you be interested in a scum bar from Monkey Island?

3208
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:12,680
I wouldn't pay for it, but I am sure it's one of those cousteau things.

3209
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:16,080
They have, like, was it the Back to the Future one looks pretty cool, and every time I pass

3210
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:22,760
by those Minecraft ones, I'm like, eh, maybe, but no, Legos are too damn expensive nowadays.

3211
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:26,080
I'm sure they were just as expensive when I was growing up, but it seems like it's like

3212
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:32,320
what you get for your money is just ridiculous, and I have so many Legos as it was.

3213
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:34,960
I do have the Hogwarts Express, though.

3214
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:35,960
I have a few of them.

3215
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:36,960
I should bring one of those.

3216
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:41,920
They're little tiny Hogwarts Express Lego things.

3217
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:45,360
So I've got some of those, and Star Trek Enterprises, which I gave you one of those already.

3218
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:47,640
But yeah, I don't know.

3219
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:48,960
Last call for phone calls.

3220
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:49,960
1-877-GAMO-LR.

3221
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:52,920
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

3222
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:57,880
I will be closing it here after one more tweet from Dar Tetsuya, who says, thoughts on the

3223
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,000
new Mario Kart 8 DLC coming out between now and next year.

3224
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,960
This happened during the week we were off.

3225
02:59:03,960 --> 02:59:06,440
I'm glad you brought this up, because this was some big news.

3226
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:08,640
Hopefully we can have more game nights with the new tracks.

3227
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:11,880
So if you guys haven't heard, Dar Saket, this might be of particular interest to you.

3228
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:15,080
I don't know if you saw this, but they announced for Mario Kart 8.

3229
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:20,760
There are going to be two DLC packs, and they're already pushing this shit in the game.

3230
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:24,800
In the game, they show up on the freaking character select screen.

3231
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:30,600
I gotta say, as much as Nintendo does DLC very well, the way they sell it is kind of

3232
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:31,840
shameless.

3233
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:35,840
The fact that it's right there in front of you in the game, and you just have to push

3234
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:38,480
A to buy it or whatever.

3235
02:59:38,480 --> 02:59:42,480
But anyway, the stuff that's in it, one pack will be a Zelda themed pack.

3236
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:47,840
There's going to be four Hyrule tracks, and four, I guess, retro tracks, I think.

3237
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:54,400
And the characters will be Link, and I think it's Cat Peach, and then Tanooki Mario, I

3238
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:55,840
believe are the racers.

3239
02:59:55,840 --> 03:00:02,800
But then get this, the second DLC that comes out in early 2015 is an Animal Crossing pack.

3240
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:09,400
And you get the villager, and Isabelle.

3241
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:13,920
And there's another Mario related character, I can't think of right now.

3242
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:17,480
But then four Animal Crossing themed tracks.

3243
03:00:17,480 --> 03:00:18,480
I know, it's weird.

3244
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:20,840
But didn't they have something that looked like F-Zero in there?

3245
03:00:20,840 --> 03:00:25,920
They did, I think somehow the blue racer, Captain Falcon's little racer from F-Zero

3246
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:27,120
was going to be...

3247
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:31,120
Or actually, I don't think the four tracks are all Zelda themed or all Animal Crossing

3248
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:34,680
themed, because I swear to God in one of the screenshots, it looked like it was Mute City

3249
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:37,000
or something was going to be one of the tracks.

3250
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:44,120
Which, fuck you, cocks, for fucking teasing me like that.

3251
03:00:44,120 --> 03:00:46,840
I don't know, I don't know whether to love them or hate them.

3252
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:47,840
Hate them.

3253
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:48,840
Alright, I'll hate them.

3254
03:00:48,840 --> 03:00:49,840
Hey, I turned my back.

3255
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:53,520
I think it's cool that they're having DLC for it, I think it's reasonably priced.

3256
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:57,520
I wish it was coming out sooner, because it's just like taking a look.

3257
03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:00,320
I turned my back and the phone was lighting up, I want to get to it, but I want to read

3258
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:02,200
this comment from MacDeft as well.

3259
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:05,560
Isabelle is going to be my new favorite Carter, I agree, mine too.

3260
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:07,800
Although right now it's all about Wendy Okupa, it's a close call.

3261
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:09,800
Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?

3262
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:10,800
Hey guys, it's Jason.

3263
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:11,800
Jason, how you doing buddy?

3264
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:12,800
Pretty good.

3265
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:17,920
I just wish that my train that was supposed to be here ten minutes after the show started

3266
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:18,920
was here.

3267
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:19,920
Oh my gosh.

3268
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:20,920
Yeah.

3269
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:21,920
Oh no.

3270
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:22,920
Yeah.

3271
03:01:22,920 --> 03:01:23,920
It's been quite a night.

3272
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:24,920
It's fine.

3273
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:29,960
I was going to get in in the mid-afternoon, get into Chicago in the mid-afternoon tomorrow,

3274
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:33,200
and this delay means I'll get there right around the time I have to be anyways, so you

3275
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:34,600
know, no big deal.

3276
03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:36,640
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

3277
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:37,640
We miss you here in California, buddy.

3278
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:40,800
I wanted to expand a little bit on the tweet, and there was something that Loki was talking

3279
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:42,400
about earlier that's actually relevant.

3280
03:01:42,400 --> 03:01:48,360
Not only do I own Titanfall three times, but I also own the, holy hell, what's it called,

3281
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:54,200
season pass for both the 360 and the Xbox One as well, and I was so, so, so close to

3282
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:59,560
buying it on the PC as well, but I figured that'd be mildly excessive, and I'd play it

3283
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:01,760
not at all, so I didn't.

3284
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:08,080
Well, did somebody just break a dish there in the background?

3285
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:12,080
No, I'm walking around on the platform, it's the garbage being chucked out behind me.

3286
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:13,080
Okay.

3287
03:02:13,080 --> 03:02:16,320
So wait, so wait, why all the copies of Titanfall?

3288
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:22,800
I bought it on the 360, so as I've mentioned on the show before, work has Xbox Ones, which

3289
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:27,280
exposed me to Titanfall in the first place, and I got super addicted to it.

3290
03:02:27,280 --> 03:02:29,880
I got home and I bought it, naturally.

3291
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:34,280
And then after I went back out to San Francisco and continued playing even more there, I finally

3292
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:39,320
decided to take the leap to get an Xbox One, so I did, and that answers the second question

3293
03:02:39,320 --> 03:02:41,240
of why the second copy.

3294
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:47,640
The limited edition was just because the two-scale, like, what, three-foot high Titan figure is

3295
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:51,920
kind of gorgeous, actually, so much so that I don't even want to take it out of its box

3296
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:52,920
and haven't.

3297
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:53,920
So, you know.

3298
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:56,640
Well, I guess that's fair, I guess you got a little something extra with that collector's

3299
03:02:56,640 --> 03:02:57,640
edition.

3300
03:02:57,680 --> 03:03:01,440
Yeah, that was very explicitly sought out because I'm very much looking forward to this

3301
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:06,840
game and what they continue to do with it, and I'm just having a lot of fun with it,

3302
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:10,080
so much so that I haven't paid any attention to Destiny, and I'm pretty sure all of the

3303
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:13,840
multiplayer matches on Titanfall are just going to kind of, like, disappear on Tuesday.

3304
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:16,800
Nah, they won't disappear, because there's going to be some people that aren't going

3305
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:21,600
to be able to drop the 60 bucks right away on, you know, Destiny or whatever.

3306
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:25,600
And so the thing I was going to, I was saying that was mentioned earlier in the show, was

3307
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:31,160
that it would not have been a big deal, this sounds so foolish for me to hear myself say

3308
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:35,680
it, and it always has whenever I have this conversation, the thing that's ridiculous,

3309
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:39,800
the reason why I bought the Xbox One for Titanfall, despite already having another 360, is because

3310
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:46,600
my Xbox One pilot was leveled three times higher than my pilot on the 360.

3311
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:49,960
And those, even just those, like, I wouldn't be torn up if I couldn't play against Xbox

3312
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:53,600
One players and multiplayer, but the fact that the pilot stats don't transfer between

3313
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,000
both systems is completely absurd to me.

3314
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:00,920
That sucks, and you know what, all that stuff doesn't really transfer in Mass Effect either.

3315
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:04,880
Your Galaxy rating does, but that's about it, but yeah, I hear you, I like it way better

3316
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:07,440
when there's, like, a cloud save or something like that.

3317
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:11,760
Real quick, I wanted to say about Titanfall and the multiplayer matches, PC you shouldn't

3318
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:14,360
see affected too much, because Destiny's not coming out on PC.

3319
03:04:14,360 --> 03:04:19,960
A lot of people forget that that's, for some reason, Bungie, Activision not deciding to

3320
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:24,120
release there, which I thought might have been, like, maybe a piracy thing, like, they

3321
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:28,200
were just afraid the game would get pirated to hell, but because it's so online-enabled,

3322
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:32,440
that would be a hard thing to do, so I'm kind of curious why they are omitting PC.

3323
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:37,000
I guess it's got to be a keyboard and mouse versus controller thing, I don't know, maybe

3324
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:38,640
it'll be later, I don't know.

3325
03:04:38,640 --> 03:04:42,080
Yeah, I mean, Grand Theft Auto, has Grand Theft Auto V actually hit PC yet?

3326
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:43,480
I know that was super delayed.

3327
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:46,680
No, and we actually talked about that way at the top of the show, a little bit, a little

3328
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:50,720
bit, just because, like, you know, we know that the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions

3329
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:53,760
are supposed to come out some, at some point, so.

3330
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:57,320
Yeah, it's, it's very interesting, all of these shifts that are happening, and the fact

3331
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,320
that...

3332
03:04:58,320 --> 03:05:01,560
You still there, buddy?

3333
03:05:01,560 --> 03:05:03,160
Jason, you just dropped.

3334
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:07,640
You know, the, the, we had such staying power when the, yes, yeah, that happens.

3335
03:05:07,640 --> 03:05:11,920
Okay, yeah, sorry, your audio, your audio's cutting out, buddy, I'm gonna let you go.

3336
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:13,840
I think you just hung up.

3337
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,840
All right, bye buddy, if you can hear me.

3338
03:05:15,880 --> 03:05:19,360
All right, always appreciate having Jason calling to the show.

3339
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:21,280
DarkStalker, you're, you're heading out of here, right?

3340
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:22,280
Yeah, I got work.

3341
03:05:22,280 --> 03:05:24,720
Okay, so, final thought.

3342
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:25,720
I got work.

3343
03:05:25,720 --> 03:05:26,720
All right, bye.

3344
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:27,720
Bye.

3345
03:05:27,720 --> 03:05:31,480
All right, actually, we are gonna start to wrap things up here in studio, because when

3346
03:05:31,480 --> 03:05:36,320
you have a call with tech problems, that usually says, end the damn show already, and we are

3347
03:05:36,320 --> 03:05:39,880
running a little late tonight, it's almost 930 here on the West Coast, but hey, that's

3348
03:05:39,880 --> 03:05:41,880
what happens after a week off at OLR.

3349
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:45,160
I wanna thank all you guys for listening to the show tonight, downloading the show, checking

3350
03:05:45,160 --> 03:05:48,360
it out, or listening live, however you're participating, thank you for being a part

3351
03:05:48,360 --> 03:05:49,360
of our family here.

3352
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:53,160
Again, I wanna encourage you, if you liked what you heard here at OLR, please help us

3353
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:56,040
spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.

3354
03:05:56,040 --> 03:06:03,040
I met some folks at DragonCon, actually, and one came up and introduced himself, and the

3355
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:06,400
other said that my friend got me into listening to the show, and I said, oh, well, then a

3356
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:10,680
gold star for your friend, because he did what we asked, so I really appreciate that.

3357
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:13,980
Tell a friend or two or five about our show, help spread the word about Orange on its Radio,

3358
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:19,620
we really, really appreciate it, and yeah, we'll keep doing what we do.

3359
03:06:19,620 --> 03:06:26,200
Next week, we will be back here, live in studio, Jonas and Diego will be back next week.

3360
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:31,640
They were here about a month ago, talking about the teabaggers, which, yes, is a thing,

3361
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:33,640
the big anime game room.

3362
03:06:33,640 --> 03:06:37,340
They had SAC Anime happen, since Dark Soccer didn't make it to SAC Anime, we're gonna hear

3363
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:41,460
about that whole thing from them and how that went, and what's next on their agenda, I don't

3364
03:06:41,460 --> 03:06:44,740
know what con they're doing next, but it'll be fun to have them back, and we'll talk to

3365
03:06:44,740 --> 03:06:46,140
them about what they're playing.

3366
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:50,300
Destiny's out next week, whole lot of talk gonna happen about that, at least for me,

3367
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:52,980
I don't know about my co-hosts, but I know I'm gonna be playing an awful lot of that

3368
03:06:52,980 --> 03:06:53,980
next week.

3369
03:06:53,980 --> 03:06:54,980
We'll see if I buy it or not.

3370
03:06:54,980 --> 03:06:55,980
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

3371
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:58,820
Well, meanwhile, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3372
03:06:58,820 --> 03:07:00,540
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3373
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:05,940
Working more on my game this week, and so, hopefully, I wish I get some progress, it

3374
03:07:05,940 --> 03:07:09,820
seems like every time I get somewhere, it's like, ah, crap, gotta redo that again.

3375
03:07:09,820 --> 03:07:16,420
So I'm hoping, now that I kind of, while sitting during the show, I was kind of outlining

3376
03:07:16,420 --> 03:07:22,380
what I need to do for rotating stuff, and it looks easy enough, so I'll write that up

3377
03:07:22,380 --> 03:07:28,980
tonight and test it, and hopefully it works, and if it all works, then the next thing I

3378
03:07:28,980 --> 03:07:35,340
need to do is add into my editor stuff to do level creation, because right now it's

3379
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:40,580
kind of catered towards building, like, parts, and not, if I were to build a level with it,

3380
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:44,380
it'd take fucking forever, so I gotta fix that.

3381
03:07:44,380 --> 03:07:49,620
Alright, and my final thought is, building on something I said earlier, respect.

3382
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:55,500
If we all had a little bit more of it, I think, things would not be so fucking dramatic sometimes,

3383
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:58,220
so think about that for a little bit.

3384
03:07:58,220 --> 03:08:01,820
But I know most of you guys that listen to this show all have a pretty good mindset and

3385
03:08:01,820 --> 03:08:05,260
are all very respectful, and for that, I appreciate you guys for keeping our family

3386
03:08:05,260 --> 03:08:07,940
strong here at Orange Lounge Radio and The Voice of Geeks Network.

3387
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:13,340
Thank you guys again for another great week here of OLR, we will see you in seven days,

3388
03:08:13,340 --> 03:08:17,820
until then, happy gaming, and I have my fingers in my toes crossed that Destiny will actually

3389
03:08:17,820 --> 03:08:21,700
work on Tuesday for all you guys, but if it doesn't, that's okay, I'll just level more

3390
03:08:21,700 --> 03:08:22,700
in Diablo 3.

3391
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:23,700
