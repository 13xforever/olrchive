Blizzard Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
This week, two massively multiplayer experiences are fading away.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,480
Sony announced that PlayStation Home will be shut down next year, and Blizzard revealed

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,000
that their next MMO, Codename Titan, is no more.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,960
The news is not all bad, and we'll tell you about it right now on the show, where every

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,500
gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,980
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,340
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,320
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, September the 28th, 2014, with episode

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,380
number 569 of our program.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,740
That is right, it has been 500 shows since the infamous episode 69, where Techmaster

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,700
Loki right over there did karaoke with Karaoke Revolution and sang, in fact I just got a

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:09,460
tweet about this earlier this week, where somebody said, I cannot listen to Gloria Gaynor

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,460
did that song right?

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
I'm Coming Out.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,900
I cannot hear that song anymore without, was it Donna Summer, I don't even know.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,220
I cannot hear that, thank you DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,020
I cannot hear that song anymore without hearing Loki actually singing the changed lyrics in

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
my head.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,020
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,740
You've ruined music forever.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,980
Yes, I think as soon as I open my mouth to sing that song against my will, yeah.

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:43,700
Alright so what, what'd I do?

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,540
If we're tangled, can I be Flynn Rider, alright, and I don't know why they're not hearing you

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
for some reason.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
Are you?

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
How about now?

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,020
Yeah, you weren't talking into it I don't think.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
Maybe.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,700
Alright, well, you know it is a live program.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,500
We have all those live problems.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,420
So of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,420
Eastern.

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,620
The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,700
My name is Rob Roberts and as introduced a moment ago, she is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Yep.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,220
And he is Tech Master Loki.

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,540
Yep.

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,940
Welcome back to the show by the way DarkSakura.

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
Thank you.

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,340
I know you've been extremely busy with all your cubes and techs type of things that you

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,380
do.

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,020
So hopefully things are calming down a slight bit for you.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
No, they're not.

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
They're not at all.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
But you're here.

49
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
But I'm here.

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,180
Well, I had also worked like 37 hours and three days right before that and then had

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,220
worked that morning.

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,660
Came home, passed out, woke up with a raging headache and no voice.

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,340
So it's a bummer because you missed, you missed a fun show last week.

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,520
I don't know if you had a chance to hear it yet, but we had the general manager, Mike

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,100
from Jackbox Games was here.

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,340
It was kind of a fun little party game reflection episode with you don't know Jack and Fibbage

57
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
and all that stuff.

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
It was a good time.

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
As they say, c'est la mort.

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
I know it happens.

61
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,340
It happens.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,980
Uh, but you, well, we have some, we have at least one more interview coming up.

63
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm trying to get a couple others for the end of the year.

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
So don't, don't get sick anymore DarkSakura cause you don't know what you're going to

65
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
miss.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Okay.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,260
But, but, but, but you know what?

68
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
But what?

69
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,860
They gave us pizza at work and it was awesome.

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,860
I don't know.

71
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Pizza.

72
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Pizza.

73
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Sorry.

74
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Pizza.

75
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,540
Mr. Loki, how have you been?

76
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,060
I've been okay.

77
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Yeah.

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,540
So I'm trying to break an addiction.

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
Okay.

80
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,620
I know where, I know where we get into, how is it down the pipe?

81
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,340
I know we're getting to how is your gaming week a little later in the show, but this

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
is too good.

83
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
You have to tell us about your latest addiction.

84
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,180
Oh, it was just, I'm pretty, I think I'm over it.

85
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,060
I even cheated just to try to get it over with quicker.

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,060
But um, I, I unfortunately ran across one of the random articles that were floating

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,140
around on a bunch of different websites talking about a game called clicker heroes sitting

88
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
at work.

89
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
You know, this is at the point they've already shut down our system.

90
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,420
I literally can't do anything.

91
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,940
I'm like, I'm going to sit here and program on my computer.

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Oh wait, what's this article clicker here is okay.

93
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
I'll play this for a second.

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,580
Oh, this is kind of like cookie clicker.

95
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,060
And three hours later that was that.

96
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,380
And then I come home like, okay, that was so that was fun, but I'm not gonna play here.

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Click click click click.

98
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,100
It's like, it's like, God damn it.

99
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,700
No, I'll play it for another five minutes.

100
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
And yeah.

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,460
And they were like, see, cause the game plays itself when you're not playing it.

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Yeah.

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,740
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check in and see how much my clicking's going when

104
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,420
I'm not there with my auto clicks.

105
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Yeah.

106
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
That cookie clicker shit's addicting.

107
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,020
And it really blows my mind that they don't have an official iPhone app.

108
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,720
I mean there's like 10,000 knockoffs in the store and I'm sure this is the same thing

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
on Android.

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,740
I just happened to be a iPhone user myself.

111
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,140
So I see that there's like 10,000 of these cookie clicker clones and, and, and then all

112
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
this other crap too.

113
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,900
Like the one that I've played will advertise for sushi clicker, which you just tap on.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,220
It's the same fucking thing, but it's just sushi.

115
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,420
And then like all this other lame crap too.

116
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,780
This one's a little bit different because you're not just like tapping to like generate

117
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
stuff.

118
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,900
You're basically killing monsters.

119
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,820
And so each monster has certain HP and every five levels you get a boss monster that you

120
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,380
have to kill in a certain timeframe.

121
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,400
If you're not, you don't have enough DPS going into it.

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,380
You have to almost sounds like theater them except theater them set to music.

123
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah.

124
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,220
Uh, and so if you don't have enough, um, you know, DPS and damage with your clicks and

125
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,540
stuff, you have to kind of grind a little bit.

126
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,060
But um, you know, the game will play itself when you're not playing it.

127
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,100
And um, yeah, and they just get kind of addicting, I guess.

128
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,060
Going to some of our comments in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

129
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,500
Ssj100matt says, I know people who have laptops solely dedicated to cookie clicker, just constantly

130
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
running.

131
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,060
Well, see this, you don't even have to have it constantly running.

132
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,020
You can save your game if you want.

133
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,940
And then when you don't want to play it, you just close it and forget about it and come

134
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
back like later on.

135
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,820
And cookie clicker did the same thing where even if you're not there, the auto click still

136
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,820
clicks for you.

137
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
I thought that was the thing.

138
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Oh, I don't know.

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
I don't know.

140
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Anyway.

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,720
Uh, and then an anonymous chatter in our chat room says, I'm surprised Loki isn't addicted

142
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,220
to all those weird clash of clan esque games.

143
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,300
No, I keep seeing the stupid advertisements on like my Reddit app on my phone and stuff.

144
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,780
And uh, I was showing my son, uh, angry birds today or not angry birds, uh, flappy bird

145
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,260
because he thought it was funny to tap the button once and watch the bird head plant

146
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
into the ground.

147
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,260
So he just did that like for about five minutes.

148
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,620
But uh, yeah, it just keeps seeing the advertisements for the clash of clans things and not, there

149
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,980
was like, was I was picking him up from, um, Oh God, from, uh, his like, uh, my gym thing.

150
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,540
It's like kind of this thing where they go and play and stuff.

151
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,660
But the people that were there, like the people that watch the kids and stuff we're talking

152
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
about is it?

153
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Yeah.

154
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm a total gamers.

155
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,060
Like my clans doing this stuff and I'm like thinking, Oh, you've like play call of duty

156
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
or something.

157
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,500
You know, I'll play clash of clan.

158
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,900
What's the, all the, all the ads I see for that fricking game, it kind of actually turns

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
me off.

160
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
I don't know.

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,460
It's like the same reason I don't watch game of thrones or breaking bad or whatever.

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,860
Other TV show gets super hyped up because everybody always talks nonstop about how amazing

163
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
these programs are.

164
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
And it just, I don't know.

165
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,980
It's just, it's that inherent two year old in me that just goes like, well then no, no.

166
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,220
Like every time I've tried, every time anyone said, this show is awesome.

167
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
This is awesome.

168
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
And I've sat down to watch it.

169
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
I've been like bored now.

170
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
Yeah.

171
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,400
Except for supernatural.

172
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,640
And then I don't know why, but I start, you don't know what you've done.

173
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
What did tiger call it?

174
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,340
You just ruined so much productivity.

175
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,700
Oh, somebody asked in the chat, what game is it?

176
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
And tiger call linked at clicker heroes.com.

177
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,860
Oh no, I said it.

178
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Save yourself.

179
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Just don't do it.

180
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't click on it.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,900
Orange lounge radio, ruining lives, ruining lives.

182
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,020
Uh, Brad from pod culture says, doctor who?

183
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,020
That is one of the shows that despite all the hype, I will still have to bring myself

184
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
to watch at some point.

185
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,300
Cause I did watch a little bit of it and I did enjoy it.

186
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
I've seen some ninth doctor, but I've been watching it since I was four.

187
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,700
Have you watched a lot of the new ones though?

188
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,860
I didn't think you were on top of the new ones.

189
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,740
I just haven't been watching this season yet.

190
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,020
Just because I've been too busy and haven't had time, but that's okay.

191
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,940
Cause that means you can binge watch it later if I feel like it and bringing bad is actually

192
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
supposed to be pretty good.

193
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,440
I've only watched the first couple of seasons, but it wasn't that great.

194
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,160
The first couple of seasons by here gets really good and there's only a finite amount of shows.

195
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
So when you're done, you're done.

196
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,180
I mean, it's not like game of thrones, which is still has new several seasons coming or

197
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,360
you know, a doctor who breaking bad bored the fuck out of me.

198
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,100
I try not to watch new shows because then they get canceled and I get really pissed

199
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,180
off that I invested myself into these shows that end on these cliffhangers.

200
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,620
But because I like Batman, I did watch Gotham this week, which for me is like a really big

201
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,620
deal that I sat down and I watched a TV drama.

202
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,180
I never do that, but I did watch Gotham this week and it was, there were things I liked

203
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,940
and things I didn't like, you know, I didn't, I didn't hate it as much as a lot of people

204
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,900
on Twitter sure seem to, but it had some issues including 5,000 cameos that didn't need to

205
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,940
all be in the first 30 minutes of the show.

206
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,100
But okay, it's a pilot, it's trying to get people in, let's see what happens in the next

207
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
week or whatever.

208
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,340
But anyway, we're not here to talk about TV, we're here to talk about video games.

209
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,360
So let's start off with a kickoff topic and then we'll talk about our gaming weeks.

210
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,140
This week's kickoff topic, auto invoke a lot of memories.

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,180
We like walking down memory lane for our kickoff topic and believe it or not, we're celebrating

212
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,620
this week a gaming company that turned 125 years old.

213
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,340
That's right, Nintendo is the company that was founded September 23, 1889 by Fuzajiro

214
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Yamauchi.

215
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:43,060
Nintendo, of course, they haven't been making game consoles since 1889, but similar, you

216
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,220
didn't have game consoles in the 1800s, but you did have playing cards and that is what

217
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,820
Nintendo started with.

218
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,580
They made specifically Hanafuda playing cards and I'm sure if you've read up on Nintendo,

219
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,980
you know this, that that was where their past was.

220
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,660
Or if you were a big Ranma fan, you know what Hanafuda is.

221
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,340
They also did some Disney cards when they had an agreement with Walt Disney because

222
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,420
Disney was also or is also really big in Japan.

223
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,320
So that type of partnership does very well.

224
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,820
Playing card sales started declining in the early 60s and then they eventually, I didn't

225
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,700
even, I did not know this about Nintendo, they had a taxi service and a love hotel chain.

226
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
What?

227
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I didn't know that.

228
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Awesome.

229
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
That is awesome.

230
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
That's good.

231
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Those are, those.

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
They still have love hotels in Japan.

233
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,340
But the, but the love hotel is an IP that Nintendo needs to bring to the Wii U.

234
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,340
That should be the name of the next console, the Nintendo love hotel.

235
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,780
Love hotel taxi, playing card.

236
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,100
Anyway, and as we all know, obviously Nintendo eventually got into gaming technology.

237
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,860
You know, they had the game and watches and eventually the Famicom came out and I think

238
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,620
y'all know what happened from there.

239
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,560
So yeah, there it is, 125 years of Nintendo.

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,740
I thought I'd go around the room and just ask, you know, what, what is a favorite Nintendo

241
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
memory of yours?

242
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Do you have a favorite Nintendo memory?

243
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,300
And for me, I mean, Nintendo is really the reason I'm probably into video games as much

244
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
as I am.

245
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,780
Granted, I started on Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 after that, but Nintendo really seemed

246
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,860
to kind of penetrate the marketplace in a way that those other two things hadn't, or

247
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,480
at least pop culture maybe, and that's probably, you know, thanks in big part to games like

248
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,260
Super Mario Brothers and Zelda that were so iconic that created characters that a little

249
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,780
yellow box in adventure on the 2600 just couldn't really do in the same way.

250
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,340
So you know, everybody at school was talking about Zelda and it's like, I had to have a

251
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,940
Nintendo entertainment system.

252
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,180
And so I got good grades.

253
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,620
My mom said she would buy me with Rab, not going to buy you a Nintendo because it'll

254
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,900
get bad grades, but Rab, if you get straight A's, I'll buy you Nintendo.

255
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,780
So I got straight A's and I got Nintendo.

256
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,700
You just convinced her that, hey, then, you know, there's that Donkey Kong teaches math.

257
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
You're right.

258
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Yeah.

259
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Right.

260
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Well, she kind of knew that was a line.

261
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
It's edutainment.

262
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,820
Keep in mind, I already had a 2600 at this point, a Commodore 64, so she already saw

263
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,120
how games would ruin me.

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,840
But I got good grades and got my Nintendo and, you know, it actually, despite all the

265
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,460
bullying that I went through when I was younger, Nintendo was kind of the one thing that sometimes

266
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,180
kept me cool, meaning like even the bullies who would make fun of me in my face when they

267
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,940
would see me alone later would be like, so like, where's the fourth level in the second

268
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,260
quest on Zelda?

269
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,080
And you know, of course you want to be nice so you don't get bullied anymore.

270
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,580
So I'd tell them, do the video game tips and that kind of helped keep me afloat for a little

271
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,860
while in school.

272
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,620
So thanks Nintendo for making the bullying a little less severe in elementary school

273
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,940
through deep knowledge of your games.

274
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,780
Jamie, what's some Nintendo memories from you?

275
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,660
Um, trying to get my mom out of my room so I could play it.

276
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,300
It's like, mom, this is mine.

277
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,340
Mind you, my mom had me at 17.

278
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,500
So imagine the age gap, right?

279
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,820
My mom was a twenties, thirties year old gamer.

280
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
She played everything.

281
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,980
So I'd be like, um, mom, I'd like to play my Nintendo now, please leave private time,

282
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,140
mom, private time.

283
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,660
I want to beat this level now.

284
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,460
And so, and a cutthroat, uh, Dr. Mario, would you play Dr. Mario with your mom?

285
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,300
Not with my mom, with my little sister.

286
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh really?

287
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Cutthroat.

288
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,460
I was really good at that game.

289
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:42,700
Meaning the loser gets operated on and I just, I don't know cause it was, it was sort of

290
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,740
like the whole girls don't play games like, yes we do.

291
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Shut up.

292
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,260
So I, I was just, it was my thing.

293
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,460
I, my friends all had one.

294
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,180
I begged and begged and begged and I got one and the rest was history.

295
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,260
I'd already had my Coleco vision though.

296
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,180
I liked my Coleco vision.

297
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,220
Uh, Loki, any Nintendo memories from you?

298
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,580
I just remember when I got mine, um, you know, my parents got it for me.

299
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,900
Everyone else already had one and I had a Coleco vision with like 47 games, which my

300
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,300
dad got and see, here's the things like, he's not really a gamer, he says, yes, but

301
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,140
you were the one that owned a Coleco vision system with all the, all the possible accessories

302
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,580
you can fucking get for this thing and like 40 some games for it.

303
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Yeah.

304
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
You weren't a gamer.

305
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Right.

306
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,860
You know, and my grandparents too, they had, uh, like an Atari 2600, I wonder if they still

307
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
have that.

308
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,660
Um, so I don't know, maybe they got it when he may have actually purchased that stuff

309
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,060
and, um, you know, they were clearing everything out, you know, back, back during the crash.

310
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,540
But anyways, they got it for me.

311
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,440
Um, I remember it was running, uh, the legend of Zelda when I got it and they had set it

312
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
up in my room.

313
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,700
And so first three games I had were the legend of Zelda breakthrough and bubble bubble.

314
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
And that was awesome.

315
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,500
It's funny you guys talk about like your parents being involved with the gaming because mine

316
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,420
were so disconnected from gaming.

317
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,780
Like my dad, even though my dad was kind of a nerd, he was always way more of a computer

318
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,780
nerd and I don't think he really understood video games as much and he didn't really like

319
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,180
they got in the way of his TV watching.

320
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,780
So it'd be like, get off the TV so I can watch the news or whatever it is.

321
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Well, that's the thing.

322
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,340
It's like after, you know, you have those systems, like you kind of just, I don't know,

323
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,260
I guess he got out of it or something.

324
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Yeah.

325
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,020
And then my mom, she was always, I don't know, she, she thought it was stupid and the only

326
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,780
stuff she would like to play and do remember, and I've told this about my mom on the show

327
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,460
before, she would never touch the controller.

328
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,500
Like the controller was diseased to her, but she would enjoy playing things like, um,

329
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,420
family feud, jeopardy, wheel of fortune, or she would bark at me what to do.

330
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,980
So we would play wheel of fortune.

331
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,180
She'd be like, all right, spin the wheel.

332
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,380
And then if I landed on a bankrupt, she'd be like, you didn't spin it the right way

333
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,140
or something, you know, or whatever.

334
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Let's push the button.

335
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Yeah, exactly.

336
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Right.

337
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
All right.

338
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,940
Guess an E. And then, you know, then I would, I would guess the answer to the puzzle.

339
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,860
She'd be like, how do you know that you're cheating.

340
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,740
So anyway, that was, that was some of my memories.

341
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,780
Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I grew up on the NES

342
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,140
around the time when it first came out.

343
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,220
I was with my uncle at the time.

344
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll never forget the first time I saw him playing super Mario brothers, uh, SSG at 100.

345
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,260
Matt says, my mom would sneak into my room while I was asleep in the middle of the night

346
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,060
and play Tetris and super Mario brothers.

347
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,900
My mom can still out speed run me and super Mario brothers.

348
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
That's awesome.

349
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,980
Um, Visaya925 says, Nintendo made gaming popular like Apple made smartphones popular.

350
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,380
Uh, definitely that pop culture phenomenon, I think in, in a way, uh, that those two things

351
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,940
kind of have in common.

352
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,940
Um, Dungeon Busters says, I remember someone bringing a dot matrix printout of the companies

353
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,660
that were making games for the NES.

354
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,900
I called up Vic Tokai's office to find out more about their games and the guy who would

355
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,900
probably come straight from Japan answered the phone as best as he could in English.

356
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,380
Um, Loco Poco says, I remember being a huge TMNT fan and my parents got me a super Nintendo

357
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,540
just for Ninja turtle tournament fighters for my birthday.

358
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,780
I have the Japanese version of that one.

359
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,900
And Tiger Claw says, remember the time when you had an NES and this was way before the

360
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,740
internet, you read through some gaming magazines looking for codes or buying a VHS tape that

361
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,260
contains some gameplay tips and codes.

362
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,660
One of my questions was in Nintendo power once years and years ago.

363
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,260
One of my tips was in Nintendo power.

364
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Was it really?

365
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,060
It was the, uh, mega, uh, how to get through mega man three with no life bar where you

366
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,420
know how to do the double jump, the extra high jump in mega man three, where you have

367
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,140
someone hold the other controller and hold a left and right at the same time.

368
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,700
Well, if you jump down a hole while you're holding that, let go and then hold it again,

369
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
you'll die.

370
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,820
And then you can jump back up out of the hole and you have no life bar.

371
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,700
You have to use special weapons the whole time.

372
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,420
But if you touch it, you know, a life thing, then your life will fill up and it's over.

373
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,500
But you're basically a undead mega man.

374
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,340
I think, I remember my question was about the game legacy of the wizard, which I don't

375
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,860
know if you guys have ever played this on the Nintendo entertainment system, but it's

376
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
fucking hard.

377
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,500
That game was really hard.

378
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,460
And um, it was a kind of like a side scroller adventure game, uh, where you played all the

379
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,620
members of a family.

380
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,740
Like you could even play as their pink pet, which it made sense at the time.

381
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Just roll.

382
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,540
It looked like Kirby, honestly, like they had a pet Kirby.

383
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
And that game was so hard.

384
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,180
And I think my question was something about what were the key, what order do you collect

385
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
the keys?

386
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,100
Because it was, Oh my God, that game was so hard.

387
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,620
Like looking back on it, like I don't think I ever beat it the right way.

388
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,540
I think I had to use cheat codes to do it.

389
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,540
If anybody else remembers that game, you probably know what I'm talking about.

390
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,380
But Nintendo used to be very good at answering all of their fan mail.

391
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,100
Like I probably wrote Nintendo like five letters over the years.

392
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,820
And every time I got back, like it was, it was definitely like a form letter, but the

393
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,540
middle portion, like somebody would write that would respond to whatever my question

394
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
was.

395
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,700
And then it would be like, you know, in the future, consider calling our 900 number for

396
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,260
game hotline tips.

397
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
This is cheaper.

398
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,740
I've done that a couple of times actually when I was a kid, I asked permission.

399
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,780
My mom specifically said, you cannot call the 900 number.

400
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Why don't you write them a letter?

401
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,660
Yeah, I, I, yeah, I called the nine number number once and that was because I bought

402
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,940
a used copy of star tropics without the manual in it.

403
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,900
So I was unable to dip the envelope in the water.

404
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,820
And so I was like, I can't figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to do here.

405
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,620
You know, it says, dip the envelope.

406
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,260
I don't have an envelope in my inventory.

407
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,220
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.

408
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,860
And then so I had to call them up and they're all, well, you just have to dip the envelope,

409
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,940
you know, in the manual, you know, and I'm like, well, I bought the game used at a flea

410
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,160
market.

411
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,460
I don't know exactly what they were trying to, and they're like, alright, code six, seven

412
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
67.

413
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,460
So I thought it was seven 47, 47, an airplane, seven 47.

414
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,180
So, so yeah, I had to do that.

415
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,860
I was like, sweet, I can be the game now.

416
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,100
It's like the ancient form of copy protection and how to, how to prevent used game sales.

417
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Nintendo was onto it.

418
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
Well, I don't think it was to prevent used game sales.

419
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,300
I think it was just, they just thought it was a cool thing in there and you know.

420
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Do you now?

421
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Yes.

422
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Do you now?

423
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Cause I don't know.

424
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
I mean.

425
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,740
Why haven't we seen star tropics come back?

426
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,020
Cause that was a pretty awesome Nintendo game.

427
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,100
It was, you know, and there was a star tropics too.

428
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I know, but it was on Nintendo.

429
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,300
It was like the next to last.

430
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
So does revenge.

431
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
That was like the next to last game on the NES.

432
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,740
I'm surprised we haven't seen like, I mean, wasn't that a first party Nintendo game?

433
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,300
Uh, if not first then second cause Nintendo in house.

434
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,700
That would be awesome to see like that dude come back for like smash brothers or something

435
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,420
like his yo-yo type thing or something.

436
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm sure he's an assist in one of the games or something.

437
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
He's gotta be.

438
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,220
Maybe, maybe it was second party though.

439
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,140
It might've been, did H A L H A L do it?

440
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
It may have been.

441
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,460
But then again, they did smash the first ones.

442
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
I don't know.

443
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Hmm.

444
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Anyhow.

445
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,140
Um, so there you go.

446
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:57,180
Nintendo turns 125 this week and here's to 125 more if the Wii U doesn't bankrupt you.

447
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Toast.

448
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Just kidding.

449
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
I'm kidding.

450
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,140
So question though, what was your first video game system?

451
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,980
My first very first, including computers that play games, Atari 2600, which I think the

452
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,380
family had bought one for my brother and I would have been like one or two, but I sort

453
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
of inherited it.

454
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,300
What was the first one you played?

455
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,060
The first one I played was Atari 2600.

456
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Okay.

457
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Yeah.

458
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,540
Uh, the first game was combat for sure.

459
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,980
Probably combat and Spiderman.

460
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
I know what mine was.

461
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
What?

462
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
Magnavox Odyssey 2.

463
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Nice.

464
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
Playing the, uh, what was it?

465
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,780
The, the legend of the four rings or whatever it was.

466
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Yeah.

467
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Playing that.

468
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
We forgot the board game.

469
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
We just played the little video game.

470
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,420
And what was your very, very first game you remember playing?

471
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Logie?

472
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Me?

473
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
It was definitely on the ColecoVision.

474
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,060
Um, I remember playing the Smurfs game a lot.

475
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,500
Um, dude, my dad was totally a gamer cause he bought all these like stupid ass systems,

476
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,660
like the action max.

477
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,740
He bought the fucking action max and I played the hell out of that, especially if they had

478
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,300
like the little, uh, like trailer for the other games that are in there, which was also

479
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
playable.

480
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,380
Um, but like, God, he had that too.

481
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,020
So I don't know.

482
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,740
I don't know what his problem is now.

483
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,140
It's like, Hey, so I don't play any of those systems too hard to control.

484
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
All right.

485
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,340
So from gaming's past to gaming's present, let's talk about how is your gaming week?

486
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,380
We always like to check in on what everybody's playing just to sort of see what your frame

487
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,100
of reference is and maybe if you have any reviews on new things you've played recently.

488
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,340
So we always check in at the top of the show with how is your gaming weeks?

489
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,700
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

490
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,940
I played Final Fantasy 14 a little and I played some Mass Effect a little and then I, um,

491
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,700
actually we do have a new game in the house that Dan paid 125 bucks for.

492
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
What?

493
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Yeah.

494
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,500
Um, Outrun 2 SP for the PS3 or PS2.

495
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Yeah.

496
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,380
The PS2, which is supposed to be the best version of Outrun 2 you can get as far as,

497
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,840
you know, the sound quality and everything being complete and having all the animations

498
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,860
from the arcade version.

499
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,900
And it's a little dated looking, but it's still really freaking good.

500
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
Why so much?

501
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,500
Was there just not a lot of copies made of it?

502
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I have no idea.

503
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
It's maybe, yeah, I guess maybe it was a limited run.

504
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,860
That is an import, but, um, he's been a happy boy.

505
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,900
It also supposed to be like have like some of the best support for the, uh, driving wheels.

506
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,660
Oh, is that something he puts in his little rig with the, he doesn't play it on this rig.

507
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,140
He plays it with his leftovers that he built just hook up to the TV.

508
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Oh, gotcha.

509
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,820
Um, and he's, uh, really been, it's got like all kinds of like unlockables for different

510
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,300
music and everything and you can get different cars and it's really crazy.

511
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,500
And I was like, why did the later versions of this suck so much?

512
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,340
Because like, for example, and this is a minor thing, but like when you pick magical sound

513
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,340
shower, right, you get magical sound when, before the next thing loads, but it actually

514
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,660
finishes saying magical sound shower when you pick the name and then goes forward.

515
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,780
It's like, and it's like, like the animations, like the, uh, shuttle blasting off into space

516
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,460
on one of the endings, whereas it's just sitting there.

517
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,120
Um, but yeah, Outrun 2 SP is supposed to be pretty, it's, it's pretty, pretty worthy.

518
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,080
And it was, it was a really nice, smooth game.

519
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,120
And then he's got this other one that's, um, basically it's Outrun, um, the original Outrun,

520
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
uh, recompiled to work, um, on a PC.

521
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,520
So it will run like widescreen layouts and everything.

522
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,360
And I don't remember what it was called.

523
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,040
Um, it's not called Outrun something, but it's something else.

524
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,600
But, um, popcorn, I think.

525
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I don't remember.

526
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,680
But anyway, um, but, uh, Dan's been like, the house has been nothing but Outrun music.

527
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll come home, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

528
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Every time I come home.

529
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Well, it's good.

530
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,240
I mean, it's good to spend that much on a game, you're going to get your money's worth

531
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
out of it, right?

532
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
So actually play it.

533
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,200
That and I think the cat's fascinated by watching him drive.

534
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
Midna's like, the fuck are you doing?

535
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,600
Is Midna destined to become Toonces, the driving cat?

536
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,480
I don't know, but she's like, she'll like rub up under his legs while he's, you know,

537
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
using the pedals and everything.

538
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,640
And then she'll just sit there and go, daddy, why are you turning the thing?

539
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,760
So she's just crazy.

540
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,680
So yeah, that's been my.

541
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,520
And then I, one thing I noticed you didn't mention was your Hataful Boyfriend stream

542
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
on Tuesday.

543
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, I forgot.

544
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Cause I even tuned in for some of that.

545
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,800
Hataful Boyfriend, I'm doing basically, I'm playing Hataful Boyfriend on Twitch TV.

546
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,280
I actually made a Twitch channel for OLR, for me on OLR, so it's DarkSakura underscore

547
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
OLR.

548
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,960
Um, and I'm just playing Hataful Boyfriend, I'm dating pigeons.

549
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:43,200
This week, actually Tuesday, I will try to be on, hopefully around five, cause I'm gonna

550
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
do two playthroughs and I'm gonna go for the Psycho Doctor ending.

551
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,560
If you want to see what happens to our poor girl by trying to romance the doctor.

552
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,840
My question is, do any of them talk like the pigeons from the Animaniacs?

553
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
No.

554
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Damn.

555
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,120
Although one of them is crazy and obsessed with pudding, and he apparently can't speak

556
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,320
proper English, but everyone can understand him.

557
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,940
Or proper Japanese in the game.

558
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,960
He just says, coo, and then they translate everything, his name is Oko-san and he's crazy.

559
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,280
He likes pudding.

560
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,040
I did my second date through, I dated Oko-san.

561
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Good times.

562
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
So that's been, your Tuesdays basically.

563
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
I've been dating pigeons.

564
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Alright, awesome.

565
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
My husband's okay with it.

566
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

567
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,520
You actually played things, not just the clicking heroes or whatever.

568
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah, not just the clicky hero thing, but no, I actually did play Road Redemption because

569
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,660
it was something I backed on Kickstarter.

570
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,600
It's a Unity game that's sort of like a spiritual successor to Road Rash.

571
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
The only problem is it runs like shit on my laptop, and that's no fault of the game.

572
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,280
It's the fault that my laptop runs games like shit.

573
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,160
So yeah, I mean it was fun.

574
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,440
It's just, it kind of chugged because I didn't drop the graphics settings down too much and

575
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
I kind of blame Unity a little bit because, you know, their descriptions for the different

576
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,800
graphics levels are pretty vague, so it's hard to tell.

577
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,520
But it looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game.

578
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,580
You just, you kind of play it like Road Rash and then they have different little events

579
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,800
that you do and stuff, so it's pretty cool.

580
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,280
The only thing I didn't like about it was kind of the shooting controls because you

581
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,520
can actually get a gun and shoot in the game and that was a little difficult to actually

582
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,720
manage to do that, so I don't know.

583
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
But it's fun.

584
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,240
And it's on early access if you didn't back the game, so you can check it out.

585
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Alright.

586
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,840
Let's see, my gaming week.

587
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,680
A lot of similar stuff from the previous weeks.

588
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,240
I haven't played a lot, a lot of new stuff.

589
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,600
I will mention that one new thing I did play, I played the Final Fantasy IV, which isn't

590
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,120
really a new game, but it is on Steam.

591
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
And I think I talked about this briefly last week that, you know, it would be my like seventh

592
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
time buying it if I bought it on Steam.

593
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,560
Well, of course, you know I bought it.

594
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,200
And I actually did a livestream myself later on Monday night.

595
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,360
It was pretty late Monday night.

596
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,680
I did a stream of that for a little bit.

597
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,940
And originally my whole goal was that I was going to stream a little bit every week until

598
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I beat the game.

599
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,960
Well, you and I and everybody else know that's not going to happen.

600
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,040
And a lot of that is probably because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and there were some

601
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,200
things that came out in the stream.

602
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,160
I was like, oh God, it's like totally, the sound isn't right.

603
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,960
So anyway, I might end up doing that with something else later on.

604
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:31,240
But Final Fantasy IV is, it is the iOS or DS version on your PC, probably best experienced

605
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,840
in Steam big picture mode where you, you know, can use like the 360 controller and all that,

606
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
which works very well with the game.

607
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,320
Otherwise, I guess I would say it's one of those things where maybe if you're a younger

608
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,240
listener of OLR and you've never really experienced this game, like, you know, you just, you miss

609
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,840
the boat when the Super Nintendo version was out and you haven't really ever picked up

610
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
this game.

611
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,300
And I think the story in this game is really good still and holds up very well.

612
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,960
It might feel a little cliche to you, but just keep in mind that, you know, Final Fantasy

613
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,080
IV is an older game.

614
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,520
And I think, I think it's one of those things where I think to truly appreciate, you know,

615
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,120
where RPGs have been and where they are now, Final Fantasy IV is definitely worth a look.

616
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,800
And this is a, this is a fair way to experience it.

617
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,520
I don't think this PC port is the best version of it.

618
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,680
I still think the PSP one was my favorite, but, um, it's, it's not bad.

619
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm surprised they haven't, um, remade, and maybe they have, cause I haven't been paying

620
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,640
attention, but they haven't remade, uh, the Dragon Quest games in kind of the same lore

621
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
fashion.

622
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,400
It's happening on, um, iOS because they just released, funny you bring that up, they just

623
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
released the first one.

624
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,200
The mis- misnamed one, what was it?

625
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Oh, Dargon Quest.

626
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
Well, they, that was, I think seven that they did that.

627
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,800
But like the original Dargon Quest just came out, like that was a big thing they were just

628
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,640
hyping up like in this past week or two.

629
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Sounds like my first RPG that I played that is my, well, aside from, I don't know if you

630
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,280
consider, Zelda's more of an adventure game, but you know, it was the first like RPG I

631
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,040
kind of played was Dragon Quest.

632
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,240
I wouldn't be surprised at all, actually, if Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior, I guess over

633
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
here.

634
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Yeah, Dragon Warrior over here.

635
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,160
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that does hop over to Steam, um, because you know, Square's

636
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,120
kind of been milking the Steam thing lately and especially with the 13 ports that are

637
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,240
coming now, I think they realize it's, you know, it's, it's extra money.

638
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
So why not?

639
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,560
I mean, this isn't Square, but, but, but, but Microsoft or whoever, I think it's Microsoft,

640
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,120
it was like a first party, second party game.

641
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Lost Odyssey, please.

642
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah, uh, Mistwalker.

643
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,400
So it's not Square, it's people that used to be with Square, but it's not really Microsoft

644
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
either.

645
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,240
Oh God, I don't care who it is, please.

646
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Yeah.

647
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
Or a sequel, man.

648
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
I would be all over that.

649
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I know, I know.

650
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Me too.

651
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
I still need to finish the first game.

652
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I know those feels.

653
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,000
Uh, otherwise I've been playing a lot of other stuff.

654
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,880
I've actually played some more Diablo 3, of course I've been playing more Final Fantasy

655
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:08,520
XIV, more Destiny, I hit level 20 in Destiny, um, and, um, Destiny is such a complex game

656
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,080
to talk about because there's so many things I really, really, really love about it.

657
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,160
And the game is so much fun, especially when you're like able to play with other people.

658
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,500
And even by myself, I have fun doing the little patrol missions and so forth.

659
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,480
But then on the other hand, there's the, like the way you level up after level 20 is 100%

660
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,760
based on loot.

661
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,680
And there's a stat on loot called light.

662
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,040
And the more light your character has, the higher your level goes.

663
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,000
So it's so stupid.

664
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I hate it.

665
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,680
I really hate the end game in Destiny and how you level up past 20.

666
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,480
I don't have a nice way to put it.

667
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,680
It's, it's really awful.

668
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,480
And that isn't me being a stick in the mud thinking like, oh, well, you know, because

669
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,560
every other RPG in the past has worked this way.

670
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
This one should too.

671
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm all for them doing something different, but like I've literally done all these like

672
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,400
missions and strikes and bounties on the planet and so forth and I get these drops and I have

673
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,840
yet to get to level 21 or even see my bar move.

674
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Like I'm not getting any gear with light on it.

675
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,320
So it's, it's really frustrating.

676
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,400
Now granted, I know there's a patch coming and we're going to get into some of that later

677
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,960
in the show.

678
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Some of this stuff is fixable.

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,920
I mean, if they fixed Diablo three, they can fix this, but it's just as it is right now

680
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,520
today.

681
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,560
That stuff kind of makes the end game and destiny like really not fun.

682
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,720
Now wasn't destiny supposed to be a game that they're going to be carrying out for like

683
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,560
10 years or something like that?

684
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Absolutely.

685
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,480
Can you actually see that happening?

686
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:47,280
I mean, actually, well, maybe not 10 years, but I could see through DLC, they're going

687
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,960
to probably do at least squeeze another good year out of this through the two DLC packs

688
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,760
they're planning on and then, you know, they can still drop in patches and events and so

689
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,560
forth and support the game for a few years.

690
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,640
I think can the destiny mythos or whatever last 10 years?

691
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,680
Yeah, they'll probably be a destiny two at some point or something, you know, but I,

692
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,600
this game by itself for 10 years, I, I don't know.

693
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,800
That's an awful lot of DLC and I think some of us would expect bungee to kind of do something

694
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,920
else, especially maybe after the lukewarm reception this game has got.

695
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,520
But again, I go back and I pointed Diablo three, everything that that game went through

696
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,840
and now Diablo three is a, I love playing Diablo three.

697
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,920
It's so much fun.

698
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,480
Uh, I, I still play that to this day on PlayStation four and PC.

699
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,000
Um, so you know, if Diablo three can fix itself, destiny can too, which is so weird that we

700
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,560
live in this, you know, coming off this old school Nintendo topic that we just had, you

701
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:49,480
know, you couldn't fix a game after launch like that back in the day, but now it's like,

702
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,320
it's just part of what you expect.

703
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,120
It's so interesting how those day one patches have really changed things tremendously.

704
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
I don't know.

705
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,720
It just seems to me, maybe it's just my, uh,

706
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,520
Rose colored goggles, I guess.

707
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Um, but it seemed like a lot of those like old Nintendo games, man, they were pretty

708
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
polished.

709
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,720
I mean, granted, I mean, there's some pretty big bugs and they're like, you know, blaster

710
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
master, all the exploits you can do by pausing the game and grenades and stuff like that.

711
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,400
But it ended up being coming, coming part of the game.

712
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,320
And I don't know, I just looked so fondly upon that stuff.

713
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,120
It's like, you know, everything, almost everything that came out, it's like, Oh, this is going

714
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
to be a really great game.

715
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,760
Well, can be not every single game, but like, you know, there's a lot of really great games

716
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
on there.

717
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,280
It's just, I don't know, destiny to me, it seems like it's, don't call this an MMO, even

718
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,840
though it's kind of like saying, you know, don't say this is on rails, you know, for

719
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
fable.

720
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,280
It's, I don't know.

721
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,360
It's just kind of a weird looking game.

722
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,640
Uh, I like that term mingle player I think is, is appropriate, but it's again, this,

723
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,760
every problem that I had with fantasy star online is almost exactly what is the issue

724
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,800
with destiny.

725
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,440
Although at least a fantasy star online credit, there was none of this ridiculous, like post

726
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,020
level cap junk being driven through gear.

727
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,320
Like there is, I mean, the loot system in PSO was sadly better than it is in destiny.

728
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,480
But you know, I, I feel like there, I mean, we have news coming up later about destiny's

729
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
doing a patch.

730
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,040
That's going to fix a lot of the problems like in the coming weeks.

731
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,080
So I'm not interested until you can feed mags and turn them into Opa Opa.

732
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,520
Uh, I'm, I'm hoping you can feed your ghost or change.

733
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,280
I mean, it seems like you can change your ghost because it's one of the options.

734
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,600
I mean, I don't know if anybody's seen where you can actually change the ghost or if that's

735
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,560
coming in a future, um, expansion, maybe that's just something they're leaving room for, but,

736
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
uh, yeah.

737
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,880
Uh, no Opa Opa, but you're probably no Opa Opa, uh, link in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

738
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Uh, let's see.

739
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,600
The seg agrees with me saying light is stupid.

740
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
That's right.

741
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
Grats on 20.

742
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
Now the real struggle begins.

743
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Yeah.

744
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,160
I have to beat the game.

745
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
That's the other thing.

746
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I haven't beat the game yet.

747
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm still, I still have like a bunch of missions to do on Mars.

748
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
I just got to Mars and I hit low.

749
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,360
You better get your ass to Mars.

750
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Right.

751
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Get my ass to Mars.

752
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,240
Uh, Visaya 9 25 says the leveling is so long.

753
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,800
It drives me bonkers.

754
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,120
Some of the strikes take forever.

755
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,620
I wish we could actually talk to other people.

756
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,280
The game feels so empty.

757
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah.

758
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,000
You know, when I do strikes with friends, that's no problem because you can voice chat

759
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,240
with other people, but, um, bungee made a conscious decision to disable voice chat

760
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,880
in destiny and they're getting some shit for it, but it's very interesting to see them

761
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,840
say that basically, and this is their reason for doing it is that they said, you know,

762
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,960
we had, um, voice chat on in halo and we saw what toxic things were done because of it.

763
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,120
So we made a decision to shut it off in destiny.

764
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,840
And there's a part of me that kind of goes, well, that's kind of rad actually because

765
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,240
people are real dicks on the line sometimes.

766
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
That makes sense.

767
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
And I'm glad I can't hear them.

768
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
That makes sense.

769
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,780
And a death match type situation where, you know, okay, you might wash it off, but this

770
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,600
is more like an MMO where it's more co-op.

771
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Yeah.

772
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,340
You don't really need voice chat in a death match.

773
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,760
You probably need voice chat in like a co-op type situation.

774
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,240
I mean team death match, I guess you can be doing some like, you know, strategies.

775
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
And people still find ways to troll people even with no voice chat.

776
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,960
Like I was walking around doing earth missions and I was doing some stuff.

777
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,640
Some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face, like, cause that's something

778
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
you can do in destiny.

779
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,440
You hit the trigger and it throws a punch.

780
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,940
So some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face.

781
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,240
Is that what we do to people now?

782
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,520
Is that, is that how we say hello?

783
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,440
Hey, Loki, let me come over and say hello to you.

784
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,280
How you doing buddy?

785
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,400
And I play a woman character.

786
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
Didn't your parents ever teach you not to hit a girl?

787
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Anyway.

788
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
Cause we fucking hit back.

789
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,620
Well, I did try to hit this guy back actually, but then he ran away.

790
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
So I shot him.

791
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,380
But, but that doesn't do any damage.

792
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,760
You can't actually shoot other players.

793
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,680
Well but you can throw a grenade and grenades do do damage.

794
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,520
So I did contemplate that, but I was like, you know what, no, I'm going to move on.

795
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I did.

796
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
I did.

797
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
All right.

798
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,320
Um, they have been talking about though that they're going to do like an opt in voice chat

799
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,680
thing where when you play online, you can opt into voice chat.

800
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
So

801
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,520
you've got these clans and stuff that you've made up.

802
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,780
The clan support is terrible in destiny and that's another thing they need to fix.

803
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,480
Like we have a VoG clan and it's awesome and I encourage you to join.

804
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,520
The only problem with said VoG clan is that there's nothing in game that shows me who's

805
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,480
in the clan and if you're online or not, cause I'd love to run strikes with all of you, but

806
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,400
not all of you are on my friends list.

807
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,320
So like why isn't the clan list in the game right next to your friends list?

808
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,700
I mean I think even Halo did that.

809
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,620
So that seems like a really weird decision, but whatever, whatever.

810
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,100
All right.

811
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,500
Uh, anyhow, let's see.

812
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,540
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, my fem Hunter was trolled, but I jumped into orbit and that

813
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
was that.

814
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,180
Uh, Viziah says, I love the teabagging and PVP or maybe they should limit the speaking

815
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,380
to a few seconds so that the crap talk is kept at a minimum.

816
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,740
Oh, that would be kind of awesome that like, you know, the more you prove yourself, the

817
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
longer you're allowed to talk.

818
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,220
That's going to be awesome.

819
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,220
All right.

820
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,780
That's enough about destiny for now cause I have a story coming up on it later.

821
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
We'll get into it then.

822
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,220
Or if you talk, you put down your weapon or something like that.

823
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Right.

824
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,820
So while you're talking, you can't shoot.

825
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Oh, that'd be neat.

826
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
We'll see.

827
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
We'll see.

828
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,820
All right.

829
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,820
Anyhow, uh, let's move on.

830
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,820
I think that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

831
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,820
Uh, so I did play a couple other little things like I did like crypt of the necro dancer

832
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,260
one night and I was playing eight bit boy on steam the other night too.

833
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,460
But uh, I'll talk, I guess more about those games at length at a later date.

834
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,820
So let's get into our news right after some housekeeping.

835
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Uh, we, uh, are on Facebook of course, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and Twitter, twitter.com

836
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,300
slash O L R and Google plus google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

837
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,160
We're also on YouTube at username orange launch radio and you should subscribe and check out

838
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,660
our episodes when they're released on YouTube because that's a great archive to go back

839
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,040
and visit past episodes.

840
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,540
It's a building up there on YouTube and YouTube's on everything you could watch.

841
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,700
You can watch O L R on your TV, although you're really just listening to it because

842
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,700
it's a radio show.

843
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,980
It's orange launch radio, not orange launch television.

844
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,420
Um, but let's see.

845
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,220
The other thing I wanted to mention is that we will not be here live on October 19th.

846
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,640
So if you are a live listener, you'll want to go ahead and, and uh, I don't know if Bobby's

847
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
here that week.

848
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,600
Uh, so he'll, he'll let you guys all know about that, but we will not be here live on

849
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,900
October 19th because I will be at final fantasy fan fest in Las Vegas.

850
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,420
And uh, so I won't be here.

851
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,380
We will be replaced by banjo playing chimpanzees.

852
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,280
We're trying to tape in advance that week.

853
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,200
So at least there'll be something new for you guys to listen to.

854
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,020
Cause I know we just missed a show over labor day weekend, so we don't like to miss shows

855
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,020
a lot.

856
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,460
Uh, cause you know, we want to keep you guys in the habit of having something to listen

857
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
to on Monday.

858
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
So we're gonna try to tape something prior that week.

859
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,780
Uh, but just, just see live folks know we won't be here live for sure that night, October

860
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
19th.

861
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
All right.

862
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,320
Uh, let's get into some news.

863
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,100
Loki's going to start us off with some news tonight.

864
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:14,540
So, um, it was announced that, uh, blizzard has canceled Titan and the problem is not

865
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
a lot of people know what Titan was.

866
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,100
I mean, we kind of thought it was a, you know, their next MMO and I guess that's sort of

867
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,420
what it was as a, basically their most ambitious game that they had possibly imagined.

868
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,020
And the only problem was that it wasn't fun.

869
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,660
So you can have all that ambition, but if it's not fun, then what's the point?

870
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,900
So they still didn't reveal any details regarding it other than that, you know, it just wasn't

871
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
working out.

872
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,580
So they decided to cancel it.

873
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
So I don't know.

874
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,780
I guess that means that, you know, I was kind of hoping that that was going to be like a

875
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,940
follow up to world of Warcraft, but I guess it just means there's going to be more world

876
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
of Warcraft.

877
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,580
You know, why bother putting out a new game?

878
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,660
That would be nice cause there hasn't really been world of Warcraft for about a year now

879
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,980
because of content patches.

880
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,220
They've been running that same raid for a year.

881
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:09,780
So I don't know, maybe, maybe they're just worried that if they put out another MMO,

882
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,660
that it would kind of split their user base and you know, they want more people on world

883
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,660
of Warcraft.

884
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,660
I don't know.

885
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,220
Well, there's been a lot of chatter that this game Titan, I don't know if you saw some of

886
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,660
the details about what the game was, but a lot of people have been saying that Titan

887
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,900
had a lot in common with destiny.

888
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,180
And that is why possibly they pulled the plug.

889
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,540
But, and I got into this a little more on Horde house and I don't want to repeat myself

890
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,500
because my other show, Horde house on Wednesday, we talked about this a little bit, but in

891
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,380
a nutshell, um, why would Activision fund two games that were saying the same thing?

892
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,940
Not just, I mean, cause they're both Activision games.

893
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,380
Activision is publishing the bungee destiny and Activision's public would have published

894
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,900
a blizzards, uh, Titan or whatever.

895
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,060
So Activision was not going to let two games of the exact same thing.

896
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,100
And I realized Activision might be hands off or whatever, but look like once a year,

897
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,940
these games at least are checking in.

898
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,880
So I think there must've been enough with Titan that differentiated it from destiny.

899
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,380
It almost sounds to me like there was probably a Sims type of element to this too.

900
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,700
And maybe even some elements that I would have wanted to see in a mass effect MMO.

901
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,300
I mean, maybe that's really wishful thinking, but maybe it was too disjointed and that's

902
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,420
why it didn't work.

903
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,500
It might've just been a really like a good, like they had a bunch of stuff that they wanted

904
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
to implement in there.

905
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,260
Like I think there was one where you could be like a shop vendor or something like that

906
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,700
and you didn't even have to fight.

907
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,860
You could have just, you know, sold stuff and that kind of stuff.

908
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,380
Um, and all that stuff was cool and work, but it's kind of like, well, is it fun?

909
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,140
Is it going to be fun doing this?

910
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,660
I mean, probably not.

911
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,780
I mean, I don't know.

912
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:56,380
It just has an awful long time to be developing a game just to come up, you know, with nothing

913
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,660
and well, lizard does this a lot.

914
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
Blizzard does this a lot.

915
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,220
You know, there was Warcraft adventures, which is what, that was the point and click game

916
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,780
with the, the orcs, right?

917
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,740
And then there was a Starcraft ghost, which was the actiony thing that was supposed to

918
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,740
be on.

919
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,740
What was that?

920
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,000
A PlayStation cast game to PlayStation two or one of those.

921
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,440
And that never ended up happening either.

922
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,180
So I mean, blizzard does this a lot.

923
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Yeah.

924
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,340
And then I don't know.

925
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,700
I mean, if it wasn't fun, I mean, who cares if it was being worked on for awhile?

926
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,180
I mean, some games that are worked on for a while that do eventually come out and end

927
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,340
up sucking to be going forever, for example.

928
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,860
So I don't know.

929
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,540
I mean, I'm sure they know what they're doing, so we'll just have to imagine what it was

930
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,660
and wait for the, you know, the eventual, uh, art portfolio leak from somebody looking

931
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,460
for a job or something like that, that showed like some concept art or something, uh, tiger

932
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,220
claw and chat says the reason why blizzard shut down Titan is because they want to have

933
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,100
the burden or imagine that as they don't want to have the burden of managing two MMOs

934
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,940
at the same time, they spend a lot of time maintaining, wow, it would be difficult for

935
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,860
them to balance two MMOs.

936
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,380
You know, another way I kind of look into that comment is, um, that maybe blizzard has

937
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:12,340
set their own bar too high and they, the realization was that this game was not going to get that

938
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,700
same amount as a buy-in that wow has.

939
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,980
And so it would have been written off as a failure.

940
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,100
You know what I mean?

941
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,300
Because like no MMO has even come close to touching, wow.

942
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,820
In America, in North America and probably Europe too.

943
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,980
I'm glad that they've stopped advertising different MMOs as a wow killer now that everyone's

944
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,880
kind of, you know, gotten to the point where it's like, wow's dipping though.

945
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,540
And I think, I think wow has peaked.

946
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,620
I don't see wow getting back to the subscriber numbers that had during wrath of the Lich

947
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,620
King.

948
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,220
In all honesty, I've been fortunate enough to play the Draenor alpha and beta.

949
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,840
And as much as I'm thankful for the opportunity to check that stuff out, I'm going to tell

950
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,140
you I'm, it's not good enough for me to buy the expansion.

951
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,640
I don't care.

952
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Like it's just, I, it wasn't enough.

953
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,380
Like it really just felt, it felt so boring to me.

954
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,220
Sorry, but that's kind of like where I'm at with Warcraft now.

955
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,500
You know, great community, but the game just, you know.

956
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,660
But at the same time, here I am, I can't stop fucking playing Diablo three.

957
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,500
So you can't say that Blizzard isn't doing something right and Blizzard is doing a good

958
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,180
job at having something for everyone right now.

959
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,660
I mean, there's a lot of people playing Hearthstone.

960
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,300
Hearthstone's up to like what, 20 million people have checked that out.

961
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,340
Heroes of the Storm appears to be doing very well for them.

962
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,060
Maybe Blizzard thought that Titan didn't fit in there somewhere, that Titan wasn't going

963
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,420
to bring in those new people that these other games have brought in to the fold somehow.

964
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,460
I don't know.

965
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,740
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Blizzard has always been really picky about its properties.

966
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,460
Look how long Diablo three took to finally get out.

967
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,020
And that comment over at live.fognetwork.com.

968
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,700
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, what if it were to go free to play?

969
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,540
I would probably check it out a little bit if it went free to play, but I just don't

970
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,600
see that happening.

971
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,400
They don't have to go free to play right now.

972
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
It's very hard to be a premium MMO.

973
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,080
There's so few premium MMOs right now.

974
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
So few.

975
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,080
You could probably count them on one hand.

976
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,360
Final Fantasy 14 and 11, wow, WildStar, Elder Scrolls.

977
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
And WildStar was crap.

978
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,680
I haven't really played WildStar.

979
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,580
I've watched somebody else play it and I was really impressed by the whole housing thing

980
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,960
and just how deep that is, but I'm not impressed at some of the end game stuff I'm hearing

981
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,640
about that and the awful, horrible grind that they, they, they, they basically made

982
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,840
a game for people that missed vanilla wow.

983
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,960
Who didn't realize how awful vanilla wow really was like that.

984
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
That's the impression.

985
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
I'm getting.

986
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
How many times did I quit vanilla?

987
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Wow.

988
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
Yeah, I know.

989
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Right.

990
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
Again, I haven't played WildStar myself.

991
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,960
I've only watched other people play it.

992
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,440
So there's also Ragnarok online too.

993
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Right.

994
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Which is free.

995
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,440
That's free.

996
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
Yeah.

997
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Yeah.

998
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
So I can't think of a lot.

999
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Come on Square.

1000
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Final Fantasy 11.

1001
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,920
Free to play.

1002
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,920
I know.

1003
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Come on.

1004
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,600
They still support that really well, but you know, people are flocking to free MMOs too.

1005
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,200
Like I know my Twitter feed has been lit up with a ton of people checking out arch age

1006
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,360
and complaining about server issues over there because the game is so damn popular right

1007
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
now.

1008
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,560
People are having a hard time getting in.

1009
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
That's a big one that just launched.

1010
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,920
I might be going back to Star Trek online.

1011
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,200
Star Trek online obviously is really fun.

1012
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Yeah.

1013
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
A big one too.

1014
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
And they've got a big expansion coming out.

1015
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,240
You know, there's a lot to be excited about in the free to play market as well.

1016
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,040
Ah, anyhow, let's move on.

1017
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
More news.

1018
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,800
Hey, I promised you some stuff on Destiny and let's talk about what is going to happen

1019
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,240
with patch 1.0.2, which is coming this week.

1020
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,800
And one of the big changes they're going to make with Destiny 1.0.2 is Cryptarch changes.

1021
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,600
Thank God the Cryptarch will finally learn how to decrypt things at the level they're

1022
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
supposed to be at.

1023
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,400
Meaning legendary engrams will always be legendary or better items.

1024
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,720
Rare engrams will always be rare or better.

1025
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
Thank God.

1026
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,640
And rare engrams will also have an increased chance to produce legendary quality items.

1027
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,400
So no more of this bullshit where you get a rare engram and it decodes into a green.

1028
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Fuck that shit.

1029
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,440
Some of the activity changes will change and rare and legendary engrams will be added as

1030
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
rewards.

1031
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,960
That will be something you can do to sort of motivate people to do those more.

1032
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,600
And some other item changes.

1033
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,640
Ascendant materials have been promoted to legendary status.

1034
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,880
And legendary engram items that already exist in your inventory will be demoted when the

1035
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,800
patch goes live.

1036
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,200
So that's very interesting.

1037
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,720
So if you are holding onto legendary engrams, they will be demoted.

1038
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,560
And Bungie makes a very tongue-in-cheek joke in their patch notes that says, let's be honest,

1039
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,800
even if you don't, we all know they were blues already.

1040
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,200
Like Bungie's making fun of themselves.

1041
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,820
So strange.

1042
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,960
So anyway.

1043
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,100
Also on the Destiny front, since a lot of you guys are playing it, we should mention

1044
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,100
this.

1045
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,100
There was some little previews given of the Destiny expansion.

1046
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,100
Not intentionally.

1047
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,620
I guess some leaks were found in Destiny through a bug because this game is connected and downloads

1048
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,580
patch data.

1049
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,180
Some of the information about the next patch has kind of leaked in into the game.

1050
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,340
So it looks like there will be a new raid called Crota's End.

1051
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,020
It's a level 28 raid that will be on the moon.

1052
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,300
And you can see more about this over on YouTube.

1053
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,260
Some folks have decoded some of the stuff in the game.

1054
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,340
Looks like to get into the story a little bit, I'm trying to say this in a non-spoilery

1055
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,940
way.

1056
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,780
Something that you work very hard to destroy in the expansion they will try to rebuild.

1057
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,460
That's probably the easiest way I can put it.

1058
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,040
Very generic plot, but we already know Destiny had one of those anyway.

1059
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,140
So there you go.

1060
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,700
House of Wolves content being found in the game too, but like literally there's placeholder

1061
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:18,300
text that says moon underscore portal underscore one.

1062
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:25,120
So there's not a lot to be known about that yet, but that's interesting to know that the

1063
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,760
expansion is probably coming early next year with this extra raid and extra stuff.

1064
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,880
And I really hope it will do something to make the end game a little more exciting in

1065
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,360
regards to gearing up and all that.

1066
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,320
And the seg in chat says, make sure to process your engrams before Tuesday early morning.

1067
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,160
And Rob, you're not spoiling much of the story in this game.

1068
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,040
There's not much to spoil.

1069
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,880
Exactly I know, I'm just trying to prevent that email.

1070
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,880
I was waiting to buy Destiny until I got a PS4 and you went and ruined everything about

1071
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,880
the story.

1072
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,040
And I'm like, just like put every generic sci-fi story you've ever heard right next

1073
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
to each other.

1074
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,400
And that's like what Destiny is, spoiler alert.

1075
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,880
So just saying, like don't play Destiny for the story.

1076
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,680
Just don't.

1077
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,160
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1078
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,200
Well, how about something that has nothing to do with Destiny?

1079
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,320
Obviously, and there's been a lot of, I would say, some anger, some resentment about the

1080
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,200
new 3DS.

1081
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,760
But they have release dates for them in Australia and New Zealand.

1082
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,160
It's going to be out November 21st this year.

1083
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,640
And looks like there's going to be, of course, Super Smash Brothers will be out.

1084
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:47,160
The price is going to be, and this is Australian dollars, $219.95 for the regular size of the

1085
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,680
revised one, and the XL will be $249.95.

1086
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:58,400
So I don't know, I still think having the system is kind of, I understand they're not

1087
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,280
wanting to limit the games by technology, so they're really expecting a lot of people

1088
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,760
to put out the money to buy that.

1089
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,040
I'm not sure.

1090
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,320
I'm hopeful that because they have dates for New Zealand and Australia that happen to take

1091
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:18,080
place this year, that hopefully we'll see release dates for North America as well soon,

1092
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,320
because that'd be awesome.

1093
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:27,560
Maybe, hey, Perfect Timing would be around the time that Pokemon, was it Ruby and Sapphire

1094
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,560
come out on 3DS?

1095
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,960
I don't know.

1096
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,480
I'm expecting it to be sometime around the same time over here, but I haven't been too

1097
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,240
excited about the news myself.

1098
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,000
Are you getting one?

1099
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Not yet.

1100
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Not yet.

1101
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,960
Just because I already had a 3DS and didn't really play anything on it, but we'll see.

1102
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,560
If they have some really good games out for it, maybe the next Zelda game or something.

1103
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,680
I don't want to have to redo my puzzles.

1104
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,000
So yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

1105
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,360
I just maxed out all my puzzles.

1106
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,360
I don't want to do them.

1107
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,880
Well, I think you can transfer your data over to your new system, and maybe that puzzle

1108
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,880
data will go over as well.

1109
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:18,960
So this is kind of disappointing, but apparently PlayStation Home is shutting down, both in

1110
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,360
the US and Europe.

1111
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,080
That's coming out, I guess, ending March 31st, 2015.

1112
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:34,840
Of course, it's already kind of closed, or I think it's closing sooner actually in Japan.

1113
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,240
Unfortunately they're going to stop making new content for it on the 12th of November,

1114
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:47,120
and I guess in Europe you'll be able to download your content, or download content, I guess

1115
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:54,320
until the 3rd of December, and as a thank you for supporting the platform, they're going

1116
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,720
to have some free stuff that they're going to be releasing prior to its close, and I'm

1117
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,120
sure they're going to be doing a lot more stuff with that.

1118
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,160
Now, I'm hoping, though, that there's ways to get some of those free PlayStation 1 games

1119
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,800
on there, because I remember they used to have several ways to get, was it like Warhawk

1120
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:17,880
and Twisted Metal, and I'm not really sure what the other one was, they had some other

1121
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,600
free game that was on there too, but I wanted Twisted Metal.

1122
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,960
I don't know how to feel about this whole PlayStation Home thing shutting down, because,

1123
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,000
well I mean, it's inevitable, right?

1124
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,280
We knew it was going to shut down because we heard before it was going to happen in

1125
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,280
Asia, right?

1126
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,240
And so, I think we even said then, well, mark your calendars, it's going to happen in the

1127
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,640
US too, right?

1128
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,920
And so now we have the official word, and I don't know how to feel about it, how to

1129
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:51,060
feel about it, because I feel like there was so much potential with PlayStation Home, and

1130
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:55,200
I know it had a great community behind it, because VOG, we've actually participated in

1131
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,160
some of these events in the past, and there were some good people that were playing it

1132
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,320
and participating, but there were some things about it that just really bugged me, that

1133
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,320
I think always kind of doomed it from the start.

1134
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,340
And the fact that it wouldn't load things in the background was one of the huge things

1135
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,340
for me.

1136
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,920
Like, when you would zone into a new area, you would have to wait 10 minutes for everything

1137
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,920
to download.

1138
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
An update.

1139
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Yeah, exactly, an update.

1140
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Now, I feel like that's why I'm kind of surprised in a way that it's not graduating to PlayStation

1141
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,400
4, because I would think PlayStation 4 seems to be a little more in tune with downloading

1142
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,800
things in the background.

1143
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,680
It's got a way bigger hard drive built in, so I would think that maybe more of that could

1144
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
happen.

1145
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,560
Rebuild it for PlayStation 4 or something.

1146
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,040
But that's not going to happen, because we've heard that folks are going to be out of a

1147
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,200
position because of this.

1148
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,640
So clearly, when they're closing PlayStation Home, they are closing PlayStation Home, and

1149
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,400
it's not going to continue, which, you know, I mean, on one hand, it's like, well, if you

1150
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,280
loved PlayStation Home so much, maybe you should have fucking been using it.

1151
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,200
But on the other hand, it's like, well...

1152
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,840
It was kind of a drag to use it.

1153
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,120
On paper, there was so much to really like about PlayStation Home.

1154
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:12,280
Like, and I loved the idea about like, oh, when you unlock trophies, you could have a

1155
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,320
virtual trophy cabinet, and, you know, and show these things off.

1156
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,800
But that never happened.

1157
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
It didn't really.

1158
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,400
You had some things like, you could achieve things in games that would unlock like a shirt.

1159
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,140
Like I seem to remember like in the Namco Museum game on PlayStation 3, that we have

1160
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,600
a cameo in, right?

1161
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,020
You actually play that and you unlock like a Pac-Man shirt or something that you can

1162
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,140
use in Home.

1163
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,960
And like, depending on some of the achievements you get, you do get those sorts of tangible

1164
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
items.

1165
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,280
So that in that sense, it's kind of cool.

1166
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,260
But I mean, I don't know, like, again, it just it would take like 10 minutes to get

1167
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,260
into Home.

1168
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:52,640
And then the clubhouses were limited to what, 25 people, and I couldn't really do anything

1169
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,640
with it.

1170
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,900
They're going to raise the clubhouse, you know, limit on March 30th.

1171
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:07,920
So looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, the seg says, so many feels and conflicts.

1172
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,680
Buddy of mine is getting laid off as he works for that department, which at least he has

1173
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,980
an end date and a plan, so he should be better off to make his plan.

1174
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,240
And it goes on to say, I wish that trophy cabinet thing happened, but I don't think

1175
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,200
any developer was willing slash able to make a full 3D model for a trophy.

1176
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,080
Take 3D model from said game, put trophy base on it, done.

1177
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,880
Or maybe some really easy, like maybe some generic trophy bases that were already done,

1178
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,800
where maybe they could have taken their achievement art from the Xbox 360, right?

1179
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,240
Because all those achievements on 360 have art.

1180
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,260
And then you could just slap it on a trophy somehow, I don't know, like an easy convert

1181
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,260
thing would have been cool.

1182
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:55,620
It would have been that hard and you don't have to support it, you just, I don't know.

1183
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:00,360
It's a bummer to see that they're not going to try to push PlayStation home a little more.

1184
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,940
I mean, I get it.

1185
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,740
It just wasn't probably making the money and attracting the developers and like seg said

1186
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:10,340
in his comment there, you know, people didn't really want to spend money, you know, artists

1187
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,340
are expensive.

1188
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,200
They didn't want to spend money to create all these new 3D models and things for home.

1189
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,080
It probably just wasn't a good return on investment or whatever.

1190
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,200
So I mean, from that standpoint, it makes sense, but it's just kind of, I don't know,

1191
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,720
you always kind of feel like maybe, and this might sound like a really weird thing to say,

1192
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,700
but maybe home was ahead of its time in a way.

1193
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,160
I don't know.

1194
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,880
Maybe I'm maybe homeless too much like Second Life.

1195
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,080
I don't think it was though.

1196
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,720
I think Second Life was was really different.

1197
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,020
I do because because home was really more of a celebration of video games, you know,

1198
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,740
and Second Life isn't really about that.

1199
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,740
But anyway,

1200
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,380
Second Life is for furries.

1201
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,700
Well, some would argue that home turned out into that type of thing as well.

1202
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,820
So I mean, but

1203
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,020
everything is for furries.

1204
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,020
What are we talking about?

1205
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,020
We talk about on this show all the time.

1206
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,620
Time to penis, right?

1207
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,220
TTP, time to penis.

1208
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,700
You put an internet chat room out there, somebody's going to make a chat room dedicated to cocks.

1209
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:12,000
So when you do this type of thing on PlayStation or whatever PlayStation chat room, there are

1210
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,280
going to be chat rooms dedicated to all sorts of things that you can imagine.

1211
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,120
And you know, furry when you when you sell these suits and things is one of them.

1212
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,120
But

1213
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,040
furry things don't have to necessarily be a negative either.

1214
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,400
I mean,

1215
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,400
I know people, I know people are into that and I don't care what you do, as long as you're

1216
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,020
safe and consensual.

1217
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Furries are awesome.

1218
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,080
I'm just saying that that's been the biggest thing that I've seen is a very, very big furry

1219
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,080
community.

1220
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Yeah.

1221
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,800
Bobby Blackwolf popping in saying Second Life and home are not comparable.

1222
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,740
Second Life was all about people building and creating their own experiences.

1223
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,380
Home was about people taking in Sony's experiences.

1224
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:53,760
And maybe that a little bit was a part of the problem as well as that I was expecting

1225
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:59,040
to be able to build a little more of an experience when I got a clubhouse and all that stuff.

1226
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,180
And you know, I did see some impressive stuff that was done later on down the line.

1227
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:09,340
But I mean, it's still like, how awesome would it have been if we had like a special OLR

1228
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:14,660
thing, like a little mini video or something that you could only see in our clubhouse,

1229
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,780
that you could like go into the clubhouse or like, if I happen to be playing PlayStation

1230
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:23,540
as well, you know, and I'm there in home, I could actually talk to you instead of like

1231
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,220
typing, I could be sitting at the top at the back of the room and actually talking and

1232
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,920
doing like a podcast in PlayStation home.

1233
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,760
But maybe now that Twitch is a thing and we have PlayStation live and all that, that's

1234
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,220
kind of trumped anything that maybe home would have done.

1235
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,220
I don't know.

1236
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,220
So anyhow.

1237
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,220
All right.

1238
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,220
Well, there it is.

1239
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,920
PlayStation home going to be closing.

1240
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,360
Let's move on to talk about Bayonetta 2, which as you know, is going to be coming out here

1241
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,160
in the US very soon.

1242
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:01,660
Well, Bayonetta 2 actually came out in Japan and Bayonetta 2 sales numbers in Japan.

1243
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,760
Honestly, there's no way to spin this.

1244
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,500
It's not probably as good as it should be.

1245
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,060
Bayonetta 2 sold 67% of their first shipment in Japan.

1246
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,380
I guess from that perspective, that's not terrible, but here's the thing.

1247
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:20,580
Bayonetta 2 sold 38,828 copies.

1248
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:28,560
The original Bayonetta in 2009 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 sold 200,000 copies

1249
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
in the same time.

1250
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,060
So that's like what?

1251
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,560
Maybe 18, 19% of what the first Bayonetta sold.

1252
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,500
Now granted, we have to take into consideration.

1253
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,860
There's just not as many Wii U's in Japan out there as there were PlayStation 3's combined

1254
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,860
with Xbox 360.

1255
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:49,540
I mean, there weren't a lot of 360s either, but combined with Xbox 360s back then.

1256
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:55,180
But still, when you kind of see this that, oh, Bayonetta 2 sold not even 40,000 copies

1257
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:00,140
in Japan on launch week, it's pretty hard to spin that number positively.

1258
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,660
I mean, Loki, what do you think when you hear that number?

1259
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,100
I think that it's just there's not a lot of systems out there and it's not surprising,

1260
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,100
I guess.

1261
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:13,420
And sadly, I mean, it's kind of along the lines of Platinum Games and even with the

1262
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,420
Wii.

1263
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:21,380
Mad World looked like such an awesome game and really hyped up and people were excited

1264
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,660
about it and it didn't sell very well.

1265
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,440
And same with, you know, Bayonetta, unfortunately, yeah, there are a lot of people that are fans

1266
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,740
of Nintendo that own a Wii U, but the Wii U is kind of also directed towards more of

1267
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:39,680
like families and kids and unfortunately those aren't the people that are going to be purchasing,

1268
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,540
you know, Bayonetta 2.

1269
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:47,260
Am I hearing in a way that maybe Nintendo ought to just embrace its status as a family

1270
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,700
friendly game maker?

1271
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,220
Because I mean, there's a lot of people out there that say Nintendo needs to do more hardcore

1272
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,220
shit.

1273
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,540
Nintendo needs to do stuff that caters to the hardcore gamer.

1274
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Well, here they go.

1275
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,220
They're doing Bayonetta 2 and then it does this.

1276
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,220
No, that's the thing is, yeah, they do need to dedicate themselves a little bit more towards

1277
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,220
hardcore stuff.

1278
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:11,180
But the problem was you're forgetting that the hardcore games back when the NES was out

1279
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,340
and stuff were like Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda.

1280
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,260
It was their mainstream games that were also, you know, bringing in new people to play them.

1281
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,340
You just need to make games that kind of bring in both.

1282
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:30,060
Like I think, like for example, the, you know, Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker, whatever

1283
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:37,220
that's coming out, I think that kind of, it's more of like an easy, you know, slower paced

1284
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,540
game for everybody else.

1285
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:43,220
Maybe we're just getting too lazy in our game playing that, you know, they're afraid

1286
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:47,220
that too hard, you know, gameplay that's too hard is going to drive off people from playing

1287
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,220
those games.

1288
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,220
And the other hand, I think it's good to have gameplay that's hard because it makes you

1289
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,220
a better gamer.

1290
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,040
Akuma JP in chat says, what do you expect?

1291
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,900
It was on the Wii U.

1292
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Maybe that's it in a nutshell.

1293
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,900
I don't know.

1294
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,860
You know, something we didn't really talk about at the top of the show and this game

1295
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,300
did come out this week was Hyrule Warriors.

1296
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,500
And I only didn't talk about it because none of us have bought it yet.

1297
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,780
I think I'm the only Wii U owner in the room and I just didn't get around to buying it

1298
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,780
this weekend.

1299
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,860
I'm kind of waiting to see a little more, like what the reactions are to the game for

1300
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:20,940
my friends before I decide if I want to plunk $60 on it, which is a lot of money, right?

1301
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,040
So, but I did see the pictures out in New York City where people were lined up around

1302
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,340
the block at that Nintendo World Store for that limited edition thing that not everybody

1303
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:33,380
didn't even get because Nintendo wasn't anticipating demand being as high as it was.

1304
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:37,940
And a bunch of resellers got their hands on those little limited edition figurines for

1305
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,980
Hyrule Warriors or whatever it was they were giving away in New York City.

1306
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:47,500
So maybe Bayonetta 2 stands to do a little better here in the U.S. potentially?

1307
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,980
I mean, we'll find out in a couple of weeks.

1308
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,800
We do know a few things about Bayonetta 2 in advance of the U.S. release here.

1309
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:02,860
As if it's any surprise, it has been rated mature by the ESRB due to blood, gore, intense

1310
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:08,300
violence, partial nudity, strong language, and suggestive themes.

1311
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:14,140
And there's also an online component, which you could be exposed to unrated user-generated

1312
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,140
content.

1313
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:18,020
Here's the official summary.

1314
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,740
This is an action game in which players assume the role of an ancient witch that battles

1315
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,980
angels and demons in a fantasy world.

1316
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,460
Players use hand-to-hand combat, pistols, giant scythes, axes, and magic to kill enemy

1317
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,580
creatures.

1318
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:34,620
Players can also perform various finishing moves, which depict exaggerated and intense

1319
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,260
acts of violence.

1320
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:41,060
Enemies thrown into spinning spiked wheels, characters decapitated by a guillotine, a

1321
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:47,260
dragon ripping characters apart, large blood-splattered effects and gore can be seen frequently.

1322
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,780
During the course of the game, some female characters perform suggestive taunts and poses.

1323
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,420
For example, opening their legs, dancing on poles.

1324
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:00,260
Outfits are occasionally shed during battle, with characters' breasts and buttocks partially

1325
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,260
exposed.

1326
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,820
The words fuck and shit appear in the dialogue.

1327
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,340
This game sounds awesome!

1328
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,140
That should be like a searchable tag in eShop.

1329
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,220
The words fuck and shit appear in dialogue.

1330
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:20,020
Just print that on the back of the box.

1331
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:24,860
I mean, come on, characters decapitated by a guillotine and a dragon rips characters

1332
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,380
apart.

1333
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,080
Awesome.

1334
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,640
One other awesome thing that should be mentioned about Bayonetta 2, as the game is out in Japan,

1335
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,800
people are tearing this apart on YouTube.

1336
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:42,440
And get this, there is a Star Fox Easter egg hidden in Bayonetta 2, and apparently it goes

1337
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,960
so far as to like, you're actually playing something that feels like Star Fox within

1338
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,000
the game.

1339
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,360
And that is all within Bayonetta 2.

1340
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,160
At least they didn't have an F-Zero Easter egg in the game, otherwise you would just

1341
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
piss me off.

1342
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,680
Well, they're saving that for Mario Kart just to piss me off.

1343
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,880
That means they probably won't do another one.

1344
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,480
But there you go, Bayonetta 2, all the latest on that.

1345
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,320
Now what's funny is that even though I'm kind of like, on the fence about Hyrule Warriors,

1346
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,360
I'm definitely getting Bayonetta 2.

1347
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,680
If for no other reason than what I just read.

1348
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,400
And I want the original on Wii U too.

1349
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,380
So we can have games that they're not going to make a sequel to, Excite Truck.

1350
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,080
They should totally have.

1351
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,080
What about Excite?

1352
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,080
They did have that sequel.

1353
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,080
Excite Bots.

1354
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,080
Excite Bots.

1355
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,080
Yeah, that was crap.

1356
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,360
I mean, it's a game you make a sandwich in the race, and you throw a pie at a clown,

1357
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,080
or you knock a star, it didn't make any sense.

1358
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,880
But it would be awesome to have the Excite truck or Excite Bots as an assist in Smash

1359
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:47,320
Brothers, but Nintendo's not going to actually put their own properties like that in there.

1360
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,320
Such an awesome racing game.

1361
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,500
Alright, let's move on.

1362
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,240
We got one more story here, and then we're going to do release dates.

1363
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,240
Start Sakura.

1364
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,560
How would you ever like to game in your own arena?

1365
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,040
Or at least have a dedicated arena.

1366
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,620
The US is finally getting one.

1367
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:06,000
I have an arena in my living room, and I don't have to wear pants there.

1368
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,040
I don't want to know about your pants off dance off.

1369
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,240
It's more of a peen arena.

1370
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:19,360
I even have a little referee, a little furry referee that meows at me when I...

1371
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:24,080
She just looks at you like you're a weirdo, and then runs when people come over, and hides

1372
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,560
under the bed the whole time.

1373
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,000
She's such a crazy old lady.

1374
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,400
Anyway, so now we get an esports stadium!

1375
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Yay!

1376
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,320
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1377
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,800
Are you ready to rumble?

1378
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
MLG is putting it out.

1379
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,800
It's going to be called the MLG.TV arena, which will be 15 minutes away from Ohio State

1380
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,800
University.

1381
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Why are they putting it in Ohio?

1382
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
I don't know.

1383
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,760
Anyway, since Columbus has actually hosted some of their most successful events, they

1384
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,840
said that's where it'll be.

1385
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Wasn't Ohio also...

1386
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,520
Wasn't that also the school that did the scholarship program?

1387
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,260
We talked about this a few weeks ago on the show.

1388
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:05,540
That might have been the same school.

1389
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,800
That could be why.

1390
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,760
Ohio might be some type of hotbed for this stuff that we just don't see here in California.

1391
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,440
What else do they have to do in Ohio?

1392
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,560
I know we have listeners there, so...

1393
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,560
Tell us what there is to do in Ohio.

1394
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,920
Be sad.

1395
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,920
That's Alabama.

1396
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,920
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1397
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,920
That's be sad and go to New Orleans.

1398
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,680
You leave the state.

1399
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,840
So that's cool that they're putting in a little arena there, but an arena?

1400
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:40,120
I mean, aren't they going to use the arena for Lady Gaga concerts too?

1401
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,880
If it's only for gaming events, it seems like such a waste of space.

1402
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
You know what I mean?

1403
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,640
Actually Fifth Dream says pantsless dojo.

1404
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,640
That's the name of my living room.

1405
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,360
For the record, I'm not wearing pants.

1406
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,120
I'm wearing shorts.

1407
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,880
Those guys are wearing pants.

1408
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
Let's see.

1409
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,000
The SEG says, woo, tax breaks.

1410
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,600
Maybe that's part of it there.

1411
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Let's see.

1412
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,480
What Up G says, the Ohio State marching band.

1413
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,560
Oh, that would be some marching bands.

1414
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,140
That's something to do in Ohio.

1415
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:12,200
And Brad from Pod Culture says, Dark Sakura, Christina is from Cleveland.

1416
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
That's okay.

1417
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,920
But as I understand it, she moved.

1418
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,440
No, I'm just kidding.

1419
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,320
God, I don't want angry emails coming from Ohio.

1420
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
No, no, no.

1421
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,640
We make fun of all States of the Union.

1422
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,920
I make fun of all the States, especially the ones I'm from.

1423
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,680
Alabama really gets a ration of shit from me.

1424
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,240
We could spend a whole three hours talking about what irritates us about California,

1425
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,040
but people, traffic, that'll be another day.

1426
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,040
All right.

1427
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,600
So go around the world and check out some release dates and things that will be coming

1428
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,000
out in every state across the nation.

1429
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,800
And then we'll even travel to some other countries.

1430
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Loki.

1431
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,800
All right.

1432
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,520
This week, we've got a few things coming out, including Natural Doctrine, which is on PlayStation

1433
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,960
3, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.

1434
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:05,160
Crimes and Punishments Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and

1435
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,280
Xbox One.

1436
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:15,560
We've also got Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax on PlayStation

1437
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:24,680
3 and Xbox 360, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Falling

1438
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:33,480
Skies The Game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus Limited Edition,

1439
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:42,280
the Let's Get Physical Edition, and that's on Vita.

1440
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:47,520
Game on the 3DS called Super Smash Brothers, I'm sure no one's interested in.

1441
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
And then coming out...

1442
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,040
I just love the way you phrased that.

1443
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,640
And then since we had, you know, last week, Disney Infinity 2.0, now we're going to have

1444
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,640
Skylanders...

1445
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,960
I guess if you want to call it 4.0 or whatever, Skylanders Trap Team, they've got that coming

1446
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:14,240
out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and even

1447
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,560
if you want to, a tablet version for Android and iOS.

1448
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:26,000
And that includes even a little Bluetooth controller, which is kind of cool.

1449
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,720
And they have also got that regular and dark editions, if you want to do the limited edition

1450
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,720
for that.

1451
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,720
That's it.

1452
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,720
All right.

1453
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,760
We're going to travel over to Japan and check out the release dates there, but I'm looking

1454
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,760
at chat.

1455
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,480
We're getting read the Riot Act on Ohio right now in chat.

1456
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,680
And guess who doesn't really care?

1457
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,240
Let's see.

1458
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,840
Kick-ass amusement parks in Ohio, especially Cedar Point, says WhatUpG.

1459
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,320
I have heard about that.

1460
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,280
And Brad from PodCulture says, got to interview the eighth doctor in Ohio.

1461
01:13:53,560 --> 01:14:02,160
I love how people get massive, like, butt-hurt wedgies when someone makes a joke about something.

1462
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,960
You go in the bathroom and dig out your panties.

1463
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,480
Let's find another state to pick on.

1464
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,480
Where do we not?

1465
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,480
Delaware!

1466
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,480
Oh, we're in Delaware.

1467
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,040
I'm going to go look at the map.

1468
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,280
I want to think of a place I've been that I have a beef with.

1469
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,780
Where's a place that I've been that I have a beef with?

1470
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,780
You know what?

1471
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:20,840
I kind of, I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.

1472
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,960
I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.

1473
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,160
Dan's grandmother's from Wyoming.

1474
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,160
Really?

1475
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,160
Yeah.

1476
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
Well, sorry.

1477
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
I don't care.

1478
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
I've never been there.

1479
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,160
Anyway.

1480
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
Moving on.

1481
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,160
How about Stockton?

1482
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
How about, yeah.

1483
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,160
That's not a state.

1484
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:41,640
I can think of a ton of places in California that are way worse than any of these states

1485
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,640
that we're talking about.

1486
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,080
Stockton's near the top of the list, honestly.

1487
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,320
Or like, fucking, can we talk for a minute about Bakersfield?

1488
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,320
Oh my god.

1489
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,560
Biggest source of boring ever.

1490
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
Anyway.

1491
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,800
Sorry to, I think we actually have a listener in Bakersfield.

1492
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,320
Sorry, but you know, you know.

1493
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,320
You know.

1494
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:05,880
The only thing that I would ever go to Bakersfield for was because they had a Sonic, and then

1495
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,880
we got Sonic.

1496
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,040
So that was good.

1497
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,880
Yeah, the only reason to go to Modesto is that's the only Dunkin Donuts now in all

1498
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,880
of Northern California.

1499
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,160
We went to the Madera County Fair on purpose once.

1500
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,440
To see where it all.

1501
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,320
Tigerclaw in chat says, what about Sacramento?

1502
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,320
Hey, fuck you.

1503
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,320
You know what?

1504
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
Sacramento's awesome.

1505
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm kind of, you know what, I'm kind of with you a little bit.

1506
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,400
Sacramento's kind of just like, eh.

1507
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,000
You know what, though, is near Fresno?

1508
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,480
You know what, Tigerclaw?

1509
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,560
Don't fucking get me started on Florida.

1510
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,960
Do not get me started on your home state of Florida.

1511
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,960
Do not.

1512
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,960
But.

1513
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,040
Like, we could talk about Florida more than the other 49 states combined.

1514
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,040
Anyway.

1515
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
Yes, Dark Sakura?

1516
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,040
Nothing.

1517
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,040
Florida man.

1518
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,040
Florida woman.

1519
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,040
I'm done.

1520
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,640
All right, let's talk about Japan.

1521
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:05,520
Japan has a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 that might be of interest to Dark Sakura.

1522
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,120
Are you a fan of Quintet, Dark Sakura?

1523
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Quintet?

1524
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
Yeah, I thought you, uh.

1525
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,120
Quartet.

1526
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Oh.

1527
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
It's Quintet.

1528
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,280
But I guess, uh.

1529
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,760
Quartet's an action-adventure game, not a dating sim with dancing girls.

1530
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,240
I guess, yeah, this dancing girl game is not really something that would be up your alley.

1531
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,400
I don't know, but it looks like at one point they're, like, fighting a tentacle monster,

1532
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,400
so.

1533
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,400
What, with the power of dance?

1534
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
Yeah.

1535
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
There's something.

1536
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,200
Anyway, the game is actually called Omega Quintet, and it comes out.

1537
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,200
And it says it's Quartets by Sega.

1538
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,440
All right, there you go.

1539
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,440
So they're different.

1540
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,440
I got them mixed up.

1541
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Oh, well.

1542
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:45,080
Mixing elements of the idle simulation and JRPGs into a brand new IP.

1543
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:51,120
Takuto manages to protect the verse maidens, five pop idols, who have the ability to defeat

1544
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,680
the invading Beep, that's what it's called, the Beep, with the power of their song and

1545
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,040
dance.

1546
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,640
This game sounds awesome.

1547
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,520
I wish the PlayStation 4 wasn't region locked.

1548
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,520
I hope there's some streams on PlayStation.

1549
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,520
Isn't that on, oh.

1550
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,200
This is on PlayStation 4, believe it or not.

1551
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,640
Let's see, looking at some other games coming out in Japan, is that coming out on the Xbox

1552
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,640
One?

1553
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,960
Looking at Xbox One releases, no.

1554
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,280
But Forza Horizon 2 gets its release in Japan this week.

1555
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,480
So look forward to that.

1556
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:25,360
On the PlayStation 3 on October 2nd, Kingdom Hearts 2.5 remix gets its release in Japan.

1557
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,960
I did not realize that was this soon in Japan.

1558
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,760
And there's also a 1.5 and 2.5 starter pack coming out.

1559
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,240
And you can import that here in the US for 150 bucks.

1560
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,280
Is that the 4.0 pack?

1561
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,280
Right.

1562
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,960
That's what it adds up to, right?

1563
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,800
So that must be the case.

1564
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,000
Let's see, on the Wii U, nothing to report this week on the Wii U, unless I read the

1565
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
list wrong.

1566
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
No, I did not read it wrong.

1567
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,680
There's nothing on the Wii U this week.

1568
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:56,880
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Nikketsu Ino Bukkatsu Tan Trigger Kiss comes out this

1569
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,320
week on the Vita.

1570
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,080
And lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

1571
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,160
Hot blooded something.

1572
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,600
Let's see, there is Kinken no Maguna and Nozotoki Battle Tori Densetsu no Makyuu wo

1573
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Fukkatsu Saseo comes out.

1574
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,600
You want me to look up with that?

1575
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,240
It's an Amco Bandai game.

1576
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,440
It looks like Explore the Pyramids.

1577
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,920
It looks like some type of Temple Run game on the 3DS sort of thing.

1578
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:31,600
But maybe less Temple Run and more like puzzle minigame Egyptian tomb.

1579
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,600
That's what it is.

1580
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,160
All right, let's travel over to the UK, DarkSagra.

1581
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:44,960
On the 30th, Chariot on PS4 and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PC and October 1st, Chariot

1582
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,400
on Xbox One and I think that's it.

1583
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:54,720
All right, let's see, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic

1584
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,440
game of the week.

1585
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:01,640
I'm looking at the states of the union argument going on in our chat right now.

1586
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,680
Oh my gosh.

1587
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,680
What about Alaska?

1588
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,680
I'm about to leave chat.

1589
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,600
What, uh, PlayStation 4 is region free, is it?

1590
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,240
I thought it was region locked.

1591
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,440
No.

1592
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,120
I thought that was a big change in the new generation is that they were region locked.

1593
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,120
I know the PS3 wasn't.

1594
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,640
PS4 and Xbox One are not region locked.

1595
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,200
Holy shit, I might have to, uh, well I don't really understand Japanese though.

1596
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,520
I'm gonna have a hard time playing that game probably.

1597
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,520
Which game?

1598
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Uh, the Quintet.

1599
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
Oh.

1600
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
RPG.

1601
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,120
It's gonna like totally be in Japanese and I don't, you guys hear how horrible I am at

1602
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,680
speaking and I don't understand it at all.

1603
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,680
All right.

1604
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,280
Anyhow, uh, let's go to those two more stories here.

1605
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Loki.

1606
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,080
Well, unlike, uh, this should be something that people are getting used to on the Wii

1607
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,680
U unfortunately, um, Ubisoft has confirmed that the bad blood downloadable content for

1608
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,680
Watch Dogs will not be coming to the soon to be released Wii U version of the game.

1609
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:02,800
And um, no, the Wii U version does not have DLC they confirmed and, um, they haven't really

1610
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,880
said why.

1611
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,920
But they've done that in the past I thought with Assassin's Creed where they didn't have

1612
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,200
a DLC for that maybe or was it Batman?

1613
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,580
One of those didn't have DLC even though Batman's not technically a Ubisoft game but it's kind

1614
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,580
of weird.

1615
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,420
I guess they just don't want to port it over.

1616
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:23,480
Maybe they think that they're not gonna make their money back or something or maybe, I

1617
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,940
don't know.

1618
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:30,340
But yeah, they're lackluster support for the Wii U now and even more, less support

1619
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,300
for any sort of download content for said games.

1620
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,700
Why are they even bothering to release this game on the Wii U?

1621
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,940
I think because it was, I think this is one of those games that was done already and they're

1622
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,980
just waiting to release it.

1623
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,980
Which is stupid.

1624
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,140
I don't understand why.

1625
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:48,060
It's gonna be an embarrassment and then people are gonna point at it and go, well this is

1626
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,580
why we don't release games on the Wii U because this is how they sell.

1627
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:58,300
Yeah, because you totally treated it like the bastard kid of the family, like it's gross

1628
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,300
what they're doing with this.

1629
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,900
They did that with Rayman Legends last year.

1630
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,140
Uh huh.

1631
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,220
And is, uh, why bother?

1632
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:09,100
Or do a digital only release or something, save yourself the fucking trouble.

1633
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:13,300
I think this is literally the last game that they have slated for the Wii U right now.

1634
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Just Dance, I'm sure.

1635
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,700
Well yeah, Just Dance will be coming out because they make their money on the Wii U and Wii

1636
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,380
for that but that's pretty much it.

1637
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:27,420
Well still though, this comes out after Just Dance 2015 or whatever it's called this year.

1638
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,220
So it is technically the last Wii U game that they have slated right now.

1639
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,300
Maybe they're gonna go that way where they're just gonna, you know, they supported them

1640
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:38,780
all this time but now they're just gonna cut support for the Wii U.

1641
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,780
Which is sad.

1642
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,900
Well I'm just saying it's kind of their own damn fault.

1643
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,160
Yeah.

1644
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,540
When you set games up to fail, surprise, they're gonna fail.

1645
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,540
Why even bother at this point?

1646
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:55,740
I mean, it's coming out so far after, you know, the launch of the, you know, Watchdog

1647
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:00,900
game on the other systems so I don't understand what's the point of running out.

1648
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:06,020
I mean, as much as I want to see Nintendo succeed and I want to see, I mean Nintendo's

1649
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:10,260
got a lot of their own stuff that's gonna, you know, keep the Wii U afloat for a couple

1650
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,260
of years, so whatever.

1651
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,940
I kind of just hope this game doesn't sell a single copy.

1652
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:19,460
That's not gonna happen, but yeah, it won't sell a lot of copies, you know, maybe a few

1653
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,720
thousand.

1654
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,980
I think though, I mean that just kind of cements support that yeah, these games aren't gonna

1655
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:27,980
do that well.

1656
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,380
But at the same time though, they're kind of, Ubisoft is kind of going this route where

1657
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,300
they're doing these really huge games, aside from, you know, like the Assassin's Creed

1658
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:41,820
and Far Cry franchises and stuff, but like they've got a few MMO-like games coming out

1659
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:42,820
already.

1660
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:47,260
They've got, was it The Division and they've also got The Crew coming out.

1661
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:53,180
And both of those are gonna be these really vast multiplayer games, of which they're not

1662
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:55,780
even gonna try to port that stuff over.

1663
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:58,140
I just, I don't know.

1664
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:03,060
Maybe they're just too ambitious in their, what they want to do on console I guess.

1665
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,360
But, indies, indies will save the day I guess because, you know, Nintendo's gonna save their

1666
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,100
own stuff with first party stuff.

1667
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:14,060
I mean when the new Zelda next year comes out, it's gonna, you know, they've got enough

1668
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:18,980
stuff to keep themselves afloat I think, but they're really probably gonna be thinking

1669
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,500
on the drawing board how to get the third parties back with whatever they do next.

1670
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:29,940
And also, let's just say that, hypothetically speaking, VR, retail VR takes off, once again

1671
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:36,220
they're gonna be behind the game, well, technically they were ahead of the game, but yeah, that

1672
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,620
wasn't, you know, much of an attempt.

1673
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,020
So I don't know.

1674
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:45,860
It's gonna be interesting to see what they do to, I mean Zelda will help, but let's just

1675
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,580
say Zelda doesn't help enough, then what?

1676
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,420
Then they rush that new system, I don't know.

1677
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:58,260
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VOG Network.com,

1678
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,860
use the passphrase, Sunday.

1679
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:04,180
Alright, moving on to another game that won't be on Wii U, that's for sure, but it will

1680
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,580
be on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.

1681
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:10,660
We talked a lot about this game last week, coming off Tokyo Game Show, that's Final Fantasy

1682
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,940
15.

1683
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,180
And some more details have come out since Tokyo Game Show, just a little bit more about

1684
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,180
it.

1685
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:22,300
Right now, the director, Hajime Tabata, estimates that Final Fantasy 15 is like 55% complete,

1686
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:27,140
which I kind of sit there and go, it's been this long and it's only 55% complete, so when's

1687
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:30,980
this game coming out, like 2020 or when?

1688
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:35,100
But obviously, it's, you know, the number's been held back a little bit because they've

1689
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:40,260
had to reboot a few times, you know, and they say this is not the same game, the director's

1690
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,700
different, the platform switched to the current gen, and because the platform changed, we

1691
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:47,660
had to re-evaluate some things, so this is why, you know, it seems like the number's

1692
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,340
so low, although it really does seem like we're gonna get this game next year, I mean,

1693
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:55,820
we know the demo's coming in the early part of the year, so it may be a holiday release,

1694
01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:01,700
we'll see, I don't know, 55% right now, it may or may not, who knows.

1695
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:07,540
Also, the road trip-like atmosphere is meant to inspire a sense of freedom in players,

1696
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:12,580
and the open world elements are restrained a little bit for the sake of narrative, so

1697
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:16,020
don't expect the game to be completely open world, but I'm assuming it's not gonna be

1698
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:21,660
quite as bad as Final Fantasy XIII's first 10 hours either, so we'll see with that.

1699
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:26,940
Combat, you do not just simply press a button once for a single action to happen, it's a

1700
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,300
continuous flow of movement.

1701
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,560
You have to push it several times.

1702
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,220
It's more about the movements that are associated with the buttons and building upon them for

1703
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:39,140
actions to go through the combat system, that, well, I mean, that really is gonna be different.

1704
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,180
That reminds me of, like, was it Xenogears, remember Xenogears, where they had, like,

1705
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:48,180
a combo system where you would, you know, tap different button presses to do different

1706
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,180
attacks?

1707
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,180
That was kinda cool.

1708
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:55,460
So, uh, they are saying that Episode Duske, I don't know how to even say that word, this

1709
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:58,900
is gonna be the demo that comes out for the game, and they're gonna say it's an hour's

1710
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:03,860
worth of narrative content, but three to four hours of gameplay if you fully explore the

1711
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,060
game's world.

1712
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,220
And the demo.

1713
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,060
That's a pretty impressive thing.

1714
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:13,500
That's longer than fuckin' ground zeroes, so, bravo to you for giving that away for

1715
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,500
free.

1716
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Well, free in quotes, because it's with the Final Fantasy Type 0.

1717
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,340
But they are also gonna have the demo available afterwards, remember?

1718
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,820
Oh, that's right, that's right.

1719
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:27,480
Also, a lot of memes and things coming out about the Broad Trip that we saw in the Tokyo

1720
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,940
Game Show trailer, I just kinda wanted to say on that, like, I'm sure that's probably

1721
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,780
part of the story, but I think it's also one part, and I think we'd be a little silly

1722
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:42,500
to assume that's gonna be the entire game, is Broad Trip, Final Fantasy Broad Trip, because

1723
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,780
in that first trailer we saw for the game, where they announced that it changed from,

1724
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:53,820
you know, versus 13 to 15, we saw a lot of other stuff that wasn't just that.

1725
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:58,180
So, just kinda throwing that out there, that I would expect that maybe the Broad Trip is

1726
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:01,820
what we'll see in the demo, but I imagine there's gotta be more to it.

1727
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:09,820
So, all right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane, back to a time where, you know,

1728
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:15,220
you didn't have four hour demos of games, you read about them in Nintendo Power, that

1729
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:20,100
was your option, because they're not gonna produce a cartridge with a four hour demo

1730
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,100
in it.

1731
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:24,180
That's right, it's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer's gonna step into

1732
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:27,940
the gaming vault and find a game, and she thinks, hey, you should check out this game

1733
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,940
this week.

1734
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,780
Forget all this new shit, this is all stupid.

1735
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,020
Check out this classic.

1736
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,460
Dark Soccer, back on her CPS kick this week, yes?

1737
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,460
CPS2.

1738
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:46,140
The game is 1944 The Loop Master, which is a vertical scrolling shooter made by Capcom,

1739
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:52,280
it came out in 2000, and this actually was not programmed by Capcom, but done by Rising.

1740
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:58,280
It's the fifth of a series of World War II shooters that Capcom made in the 19XX series.

1741
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:07,160
It actually is the sequel to 19XX The War Against Destiny, and it has a lot of the same

1742
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:16,660
planes, including the P-38 Lightning and Mitsubishi A6M-0, but does not include the De Havilland

1743
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:20,060
Mosquito and the Q-Shooter J7W.

1744
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,700
Those were replaced by others.

1745
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:29,260
So basically it's just your standard shooter, you know, you shoot planes, tanks, battleships,

1746
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:35,820
other boats, other things, but it's a lot more like the earlier games as opposed to

1747
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,060
19XX.

1748
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:43,500
You get the different stats for the planes, each of them operate equally, one is the first

1749
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:48,820
or second player, and they do have the form change that was in 19XX.

1750
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:53,540
You hold the fire button, charge it until it's full, and then the plane will fly up

1751
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,060
and become temporarily invincible.

1752
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:59,620
It also has a bomb button that uses Tomahawk missiles.

1753
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:05,520
You also have the wingmen in the game as well, where you get a small golden plane icon that

1754
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,900
comes down the screen that will release a wingman icon.

1755
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:15,060
And that gives you firepower, but they are vulnerable to enemy fire, and in stage 8 they

1756
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,060
fire laser shots.

1757
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:20,340
There are 15 stages in the game.

1758
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:24,840
On the arcade board actually you get an option to start from 1, 6, or 11.

1759
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:31,380
If it's set to endless, then you can also choose 1, 2, or 3, and of course with different

1760
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,200
difficulties you go through.

1761
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:41,020
And after destroying the level 15 boss, you actually get back to stage, the first stage,

1762
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:42,020
it's a loop.

1763
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,380
Therefore, you can play the game endlessly.

1764
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,320
And the enemies will fire more rapidly if it's set to endless.

1765
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,100
So it's the loop master for a reason.

1766
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,800
And that's it.

1767
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,660
So you do eventually master the loop when you beat the game, because everything comes

1768
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,660
full circle.

1769
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,660
So there it is.

1770
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,100
Alright, I forgot about this one.

1771
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,540
I mean, I of course know the 1944 shooters.

1772
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:13,380
You know, one of them was on the NES, it was 1942, 43, maybe both of them, but I forgot

1773
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,380
about 44.

1774
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,380
Yeah.

1775
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:21,840
Well, technically the big one that a lot of people do remember in the series is 19XX as

1776
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,940
far as the arcade ones go, because that one got really big right around that time.

1777
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:31,220
The loop master was a little bit, I'd say lesser known.

1778
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:35,220
Well, XX was also a little bit more like Raiden, I think, wasn't it?

1779
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,220
It was.

1780
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:42,300
It had a lot more of that just sort of fantastical element to it.

1781
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:47,180
This is like fun though, and it does the widescreen thing too, which is a very different look

1782
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:49,780
from the other 19 games, so.

1783
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:52,380
It's also on a arcade cabinet sitting right behind you.

1784
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,380
Is it?

1785
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,460
Is it really?

1786
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:58,180
I gotta get my little booster thing that I was supposed to get this weekend and didn't,

1787
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,180
so.

1788
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,620
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, 1944, the loop master.

1789
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,300
There you go.

1790
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,300
You master the loops.

1791
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:11,380
Just like you do at Cedar Point, apparently, there, in 1944.

1792
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,140
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

1793
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,820
When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come, including rapid fire

1794
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:23,020
news, the FUGAL QUESTION OF THE WEEK, talk about Minecraft clones on some big consoles,

1795
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:29,340
and it sounds like maybe League of Legends getting another Supernanny step for the very

1796
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:35,180
naughty players, and, and, SCIENCE, when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1797
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,660
Alright, after this.

1798
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:48,500
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, September the

1799
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:56,460
28th, 2014, our 569th show, already in progress, and we're gonna get to some rapid fire news.

1800
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:00,260
But let me, let me ask this question of, of Dark Soccer and Loki and, and all the folks

1801
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:04,880
that are listening live tonight, do I, do I need to get Orange Lounge Radio and Ello?

1802
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,320
Is that, is that where the, is that where the internet's going?

1803
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,320
Do I need, does, do we need an O-L-R-L-O?

1804
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,320
No.

1805
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,320
Why not?

1806
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,320
Because we don't.

1807
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,320
Wouldn't it be like an O-L-O-R?

1808
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,320
O-L-O-R?

1809
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh, I like that one.

1810
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That's good.

1811
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Uh, but, no, I mean, I guess, I guess people have kind of had it with Facebook and, and

1812
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,320
are talking to these other social networks, although I have an LO account.

1813
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,320
If you want to follow me on LO, I'm Rob Roberts, it's not a video, you're not going to find

1814
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,320
anything.

1815
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,320
Mine's Dark Soccer.

1816
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,560
Yeah, you're not going to find anything on there that exciting.

1817
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
Maybe a selfie or two.

1818
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:41,040
I, I, uh, submitted a request to get one, just, oh, fuck of it.

1819
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,560
I'm sure her, I could get you an invite if you really want one.

1820
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,560
I don't really care.

1821
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,440
I just, you know, put myself on there.

1822
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,440
I mean, whatever.

1823
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:52,120
But here's, okay, so here's the thing with that is that, like, everybody's talking like,

1824
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:57,360
oh, you know, Facebook's screwed because everybody's going to LO, but like, LO isn't Facebook.

1825
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:02,800
LO is missing a lot that Facebook has, and not that I'm saying, you know, we should all

1826
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,840
kneel and worship at the altar of Facebook, because believe me, there's a lot about Facebook

1827
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,280
that pisses me off.

1828
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:12,600
And that whole rabble rabble you're hearing with the drag queens about the real name policy,

1829
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,600
guess what?

1830
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,860
It doesn't just affect drag queens.

1831
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,480
It affects roller derby girls.

1832
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,320
It affects transgender individuals.

1833
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,780
It affects people that are trying to hide from stalkers.

1834
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:30,320
It affects sassy internet podcasters who don't feel like using their real name to keep their

1835
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,920
online life separate, you know?

1836
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,960
It affects the luchador industry.

1837
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,440
It affects a lot of people.

1838
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:41,100
And so I think people are, and what really pissed me off personally is when Zuckerberg

1839
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:46,600
in some, some interview or something had the audacity to say, if you don't use your real

1840
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,440
name, you don't have integrity or something like that.

1841
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:53,320
And like, I don't have a middle finger big enough for that guy after hearing that because

1842
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:58,480
it's like, okay, says the guy who literally wrote a business after, you know, using people's

1843
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,800
personal information and profiting off that.

1844
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,800
Wait a second.

1845
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,800
I don't have integrity because I use the name that people know me by on my Facebook.

1846
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,520
People are convinced this is my name, which I'm fine with.

1847
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,280
I completely forgot this.

1848
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,680
So the website's L O dot co or L loco.

1849
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,680
Yeah, it is.

1850
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,680
It is.

1851
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,680
It's perfect for the luchadors.

1852
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:18,680
It's perfect.

1853
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,680
L loco.

1854
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,880
I love it.

1855
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,040
And then, uh, let's see.

1856
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,940
So, uh, and then, uh, VXJ's next V links to one of those articles that talks about the

1857
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:31,320
dark side of L O, which I always am going to anticipate whenever something starts to

1858
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,600
grab momentum, there's always going to be that article about the dark side.

1859
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,780
I'm calling it L loco from now on.

1860
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:44,960
It's seriously, it's L loco and act, act deaf actually says he, it's a real thing.

1861
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,620
Even though I was joking about it and he has luchador friends.

1862
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,620
That's awesome.

1863
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,920
And, uh, VXJ's next V says the food glow question of the week.

1864
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,280
Uh, probably not.

1865
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:58,720
I don't, unless L O really catches some more steam and fixes some of these other things

1866
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,720
they've got going on.

1867
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,780
I don't really see us.

1868
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:06,880
My weekly O L R is on today post on L O. Did you see it?

1869
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,480
I did, but I couldn't, I couldn't retweet it and I couldn't favorite it.

1870
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:15,880
That's why I removed the retweet or repost or whatever, because whatevs.

1871
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,880
Yeah.

1872
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,880
All right.

1873
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,920
So anyway, there you go.

1874
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,520
A little, little L O talk.

1875
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,240
I'll be curious to see how L O is doing in seven days.

1876
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,240
We'll see.

1877
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,520
In the meantime, let's talk about some other gaming news going on around the industry back

1878
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,520
to games.

1879
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,280
And I don't, I don't think I've seen any video game companies on L O yet.

1880
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,280
So we'll see.

1881
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,280
All right.

1882
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,280
Let's move on now.

1883
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,280
Loki.

1884
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,280
Hey, what do you know?

1885
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,200
There's an actual guitar game coming out for PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1886
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,200
Yes.

1887
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:47,000
They're porting Rocksmith 2014 to PlayStation four and Xbox one's going to be coming out

1888
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,280
a little bit later this year.

1889
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,200
And um, I guess this was outed through the ESRB listing for the game.

1890
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,040
So cool.

1891
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,760
And uh, maybe the DLC will transfer as well for that stuff.

1892
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,760
So I'm pretty cool.

1893
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,400
And I'm assuming that it comes with the, you know, the USB thing that plug into your guitar

1894
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,400
too.

1895
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,360
So rock on.

1896
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:14,120
Um, so Xbox live games with gold for October, they've got a few games coming out, uh, for

1897
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:18,920
Xbox three 60 members will get, uh, Darksiders two and battlefield bad company.

1898
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:23,080
Of course, battlefield bad company being the first game, um, that's available from October

1899
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:28,280
first through the 15th and Darksiders two from the 16th through the 31st.

1900
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:36,520
Um, and then for Xbox one it, uh, for you, which, uh, chariots is going to be the game

1901
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,960
that's going to be coming out.

1902
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:41,680
And that was actually a, one of the, uh, ID at Xbox games.

1903
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,920
So God love those indie games.

1904
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen an actual retail Xbox one game yet, or maybe we're just not

1905
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,240
at that point yet since the system hasn't even been out for a year yet to be fair.

1906
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:57,400
We haven't had a retail PlayStation four game either on PlayStation plus yet.

1907
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,600
So there's, nobody's kind of broken that barrier yet, although I don't know what's, what's

1908
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:08,200
happening with drive club because they're going to get, it's like a, uh, stripped down

1909
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:14,360
version, I guess like a demo, it's like a Ridge racer Vita version of the game, if you

1910
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,360
will.

1911
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,080
Um, you know where they're going to have a few cars, a few tracks, and you can purchase

1912
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,000
the rest piecemeal, or you can purchase just an upgrade, the upgrade to the full version,

1913
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,840
but it's not going to be as much as buying the full version of the game, I guess.

1914
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,840
Interesting.

1915
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:34,320
Um, I mean, it's cool that they have that kind of a demo out there, um, and, uh, battlefield

1916
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,480
bad company too, and dark sires, you haven't played those yet, despite the fact that dark

1917
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,600
sires two has been sitting in my steam library forever now, but I still haven't played it

1918
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,600
shock.

1919
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,640
Um, such as the way of the steam library and, and you know, me, you know, I've just like

1920
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,960
every month that they have free stuff, we're going to download that.

1921
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,920
I got download, I got download that I'm like, I'm not going to play these games on my X-Box

1922
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,920
got up.

1923
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:57,920
I got them all.

1924
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,920
It's seriously.

1925
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,920
It's like, Oh God, I get that.

1926
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,480
Cause what, what if I want to play that one day then I'm going to, I need it, you know,

1927
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,480
so seriously.

1928
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,000
Um, but yeah, might as well, I mean, it's free, you know, and, and that's the thing

1929
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,800
is like when I was, uh, you know, through my retail job and still not retail, but through

1930
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:18,280
my job at work, um, I get Microsoft training and stuff that I do on my own.

1931
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:22,880
And each year they have a accreditation program for X-Box and what's the reward for finishing

1932
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,880
that?

1933
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,880
You're alive.

1934
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,720
So I'm always, you know, got live gold aside.

1935
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:32,560
I wish they had that on Sony's end because I could use some PlayStation plus right now.

1936
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,560
That's it.

1937
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,680
Um, Oh, and then, um, last but not least, um, even though it's already been announced

1938
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,360
that, you know, Amazon is purchasing twist, they have finished their acquisitions.

1939
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:49,120
So money's changed hands or at least some of that and is now owned by Amazon.

1940
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:57,980
So cool is officially part of the Amazon collective, which is, I like Amazon well enough.

1941
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:01,200
So again, I'm curious to see if being a prime member is going to get me any perks.

1942
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:05,640
I, you know, I don't know if they will do anything because Amazon does own other companies,

1943
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:09,400
like for example, Zappos, and they really haven't done anything with that.

1944
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,640
Aside from, you know, they own it, but nothing has really changed.

1945
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,640
Very true.

1946
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:14,640
Very true.

1947
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,640
All right.

1948
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,480
Well, moving on to some other news, uh, you know, Super Smash Brothers 3DS is coming out

1949
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:23,560
here in the States soon, but it's been out in Japan for about a week now and, uh, there's

1950
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,460
some glitches that are being found inside the game.

1951
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:30,600
And one of them, uh, is apparently there's a glitch in the game where you will hear a

1952
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:38,200
cheer, uh, a taunter, not really cheer, but like an audience, um, demand or chant an audience

1953
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,000
chant for the ice climbers.

1954
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,300
Well, as you know, the ice climbers are not in the new Smash Brothers game.

1955
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,760
So, uh, that is very interesting.

1956
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,120
Uh, we've heard that, you know, they were supposed to be in there, but that the 3DS

1957
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,000
didn't really have the processing power to keep them in.

1958
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,880
Maybe the Wii U will have it though.

1959
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,880
Maybe the Wii U.

1960
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,520
Although isn't it supposed to be cross, can you play like, uh, versus someone on the Wii

1961
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:01,520
U?

1962
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,520
No, I don't think so.

1963
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:08,120
Although they wanted to really keep the games in parody, maybe DLC on, like, maybe DLC

1964
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,120
that only works with the new 3DS or something.

1965
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,120
I mean, I don't know.

1966
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,120
I'm getting really crazy with that.

1967
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:17,400
I just can't believe that that can't support, like, I don't even get that, that they can't...

1968
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,120
I'm sorry, that character's too complex.

1969
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,120
I mean, why?

1970
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,120
It's just two characters.

1971
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,280
Well, because the problem was with all four people playing ice climbers is when it was

1972
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,280
a problem.

1973
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,280
Oh.

1974
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,280
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

1975
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,280
Yeah.

1976
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,280
So, anyhow.

1977
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,640
Uh, so yeah, you can, uh, hear that.

1978
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,640
That's pretty cool.

1979
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,160
Uh, anyhow.

1980
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:40,560
Um, also on Super Smash Brothers, uh, this will probably surprise nobody, uh, some people

1981
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:46,560
finding in the Japanese version there's a stage DLC content in the ROM dump.

1982
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,040
So apparently, uh, there are some stages that will appear later on through DLC.

1983
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,220
Well, I mean, that seems like a big duh, doesn't it?

1984
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,960
Also a duh.

1985
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,640
Content for LittleBigPlanet 3!

1986
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:03,080
Uh, yes, LittleBigPlanet 3, of course, coming very soon to PlayStation 4, what, November

1987
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,080
18th?

1988
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,080
I believe is when the game's out.

1989
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:10,460
And, uh, there will be some Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes Sackboy stuff.

1990
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:14,280
So yeah, you can, uh, put a little eye patch on your Sackboy and you can have your little

1991
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,480
Sackboy tank and all this other stuff.

1992
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,480
So that's pretty cool.

1993
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:23,080
Skull Face, Miller Outfits, uh, the game releases on November 18th, of course, LittleBigPlanet.

1994
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:27,520
We don't know when these come out, but it will be soon.

1995
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,800
Also, um, Order 1886 costume is supposed to be a part of that too.

1996
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:32,800
That's pretty neat.

1997
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:38,040
And lastly, what would you say if I said Suikoden 6?

1998
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,040
Hmm.

1999
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,080
I would say there's a lot of characters in it.

2000
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,080
That's right.

2001
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,200
Well, unfortunately, I'm not here to tell you that Suikoden 6 is happening.

2002
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:50,120
Uh, what I'm telling you is that, uh, Yuichi Haga, who's the online content producer for

2003
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,840
Konami Digital Entertainment, was doing a livestream for Suikoden 2, and of course there

2004
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,640
was a ton of questions about Suikoden 6.

2005
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:04,800
And no update, sadly, about this RPG being developed, but Japanese fans apparently associate

2006
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,640
Suikoden with the Konami brand more than any other franchise, meaning Metal Gear, Pro Evo

2007
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:16,480
Soccer, Castlevania, and yes, even DDR, uh, it gets, uh, not as associated as much as

2008
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,480
Suikoden does.

2009
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,760
They tried to forget about Silent Hill lately.

2010
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,760
Apparently.

2011
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Until the PT.

2012
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,760
Yeah, until PT.

2013
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:26,080
And, uh, here in the US, I would think, oh my gosh, people have to think like Castlevania

2014
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,080
before they would think of Suikoden.

2015
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,040
Don't get me wrong, I love Suikoden, but, you know.

2016
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,360
Castlevania and Gradius, maybe?

2017
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,360
I don't know.

2018
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,800
But nowadays, I guess they would think Metal Gear, I would imagine.

2019
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,000
Metal Gear.

2020
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,880
By the way, Suikoden 5, eight years ago on the PlayStation 2, was the last entry in the

2021
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,880
series.

2022
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,160
Uh, why was, why was Suikoden 2 being streamed?

2023
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:51,560
Well, it was to show the head of honchos in Japan that fans are interested in the re-release

2024
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:56,440
of the game as a digital offering on the Sony Entertainment Network store, because the game

2025
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:01,720
was rated for PS3 and PlayStation Portable, but it never actually came out, which kinda

2026
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,720
sucks.

2027
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:07,560
And if Shane was in the studio, I'm sure he would be having a cry, because I know he loves

2028
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,560
Suikoden 2.

2029
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,840
But then he'd just be like, whatever, I can play my PSP version.

2030
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:16,040
I can't imagine there would be that much work to put, like, any of those games on the PlayStation

2031
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,040
store.

2032
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,040
I mean...

2033
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,360
I have heard that it is incredibly easy to get a game on PlayStation 3.

2034
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,360
Just put everything.

2035
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,040
Fuck, if it doesn't sell, who cares?

2036
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,080
Not on PS, but like, what are those, like, PS1 is incredibly easy process.

2037
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:31,240
Just like, yeah, just seriously put everything that you have.

2038
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,560
Why hold yourself back?

2039
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,480
That, that, that, I mean, I guess the only re- that, that kind of boils it down, like,

2040
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,320
with, uh, you know, the e-sh, I guess the eShop and the Virtual Console releases.

2041
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:45,600
Like, I never understood, I mean, they do a little bit more now, I guess, but I never

2042
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,080
understood why, if it was so easy to put that stuff on there, why didn't you just dump a

2043
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,080
whole bunch of stuff?

2044
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:54,600
I guess maybe, you know, they'd lose stuff, but I, they don't really have regular releases.

2045
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:59,160
It's like, maybe a couple games each week, if we're lucky, a few, a couple games each

2046
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,160
month.

2047
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,160
I don't know, I just don't...

2048
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:05,240
And now with PlayStation Now, but, I mean, I, I understand that PlayStation Now is supposed

2049
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:09,360
to bring trophy support to old games and things like that, I mean, we're not seeing it yet.

2050
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,360
That would be a little bit more complicated.

2051
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,600
That would be a little more complicated, but, um, hopefully some games will do it.

2052
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:17,760
Maybe that's something they're holding Suikoden for, who knows?

2053
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,000
I mean, if they announce that Suikoden was, like, one of the first PS2 games on PlayStation

2054
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,640
Now, it would definitely give that service a big kick in the butt, like, in the up direction,

2055
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,640
I think.

2056
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,540
Whereas a lot of people are bitching about the price now and all that stuff, I mean,

2057
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:34,680
if they sold Suikoden 2 at a flat fee with, like, trophy support and shit on PlayStation

2058
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,580
Now, that's a huge boost for the service, I think.

2059
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:41,840
But of course, I'm being very tinfoil-hat with that, but, you know, could be a thing,

2060
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:42,840
could be a thing.

2061
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:43,840
Uh, DarkSakura.

2062
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:51,280
Well, uh, Sega 3D Classics was, uh, released, well, announced in Japan for a retail release,

2063
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:56,360
which will include, uh, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Outrun, Streets of Rage, Shinobi II,

2064
01:44:56,360 --> 01:45:02,480
Echo the Dolphin, um, Space Harrier, I already said Space Harrier, um, Outrun, uh, I already

2065
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,480
said Outrun, too, didn't I?

2066
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,480
Yeah.

2067
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,480
Whatever.

2068
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,240
Um, anyway, um, thank you, List, for being redundant.

2069
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:14,480
Um, but anyway, it will be, uh, 3980 yen, um, and will be out December 18th for the

2070
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,520
Nintendo 3DS, and hopefully we will hear about a US release before too long.

2071
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,800
But I can tell you, if it's the same one as the Sega Ages release that came out, um,

2072
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,360
those 3D versions of Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone are really good.

2073
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:30,680
A bunch of fans have said, you know what, not having Mother 4 is shit, so they're making

2074
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,680
it themselves.

2075
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:36,960
Um, there's a fan-made project that's going to be out on PC, Mac, and Linux for free,

2076
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:42,160
and it will basically be faithful to the story and art style of the last Mother games.

2077
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:48,600
And last but not least, the bundle I just bought was the Humble Bundle weekly, uh, female

2078
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,960
protagonist bundle.

2079
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:56,720
It's called the Leading Ladies Bundle, and, um, so it has, uh, Ms. Splosion Man, uh, Lily

2080
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:04,280
Looking Through, uh, RPG Defenders Quest, Valley of the Forgotten, um, and the Cat Lady,

2081
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,280
which I kind of wanted for a while, so I just got it just to get Cat Lady.

2082
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:15,000
Um, you can pay, uh, 6 bucks or more and get the Yogg and, or, uh, Long Live the Queen.

2083
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,320
If you pay 10 bucks or more, you get, uh, the, uh, Valda's Story, Abyssal City.

2084
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,800
So a good portion of the proceeds will go to Girls Make Games charity.

2085
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:26,800
Go get it.

2086
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,640
Buy lots of it.

2087
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,640
I love the Humble Bundle.

2088
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,480
They have a lot of good stuff on there.

2089
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,760
Oh, it's a great way to contribute to my Steam library of games that I intend on playing

2090
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,760
at some point.

2091
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:40,200
Yeah, see, like, I wanted to buy the new Humble Bundle, but there's just too many repeats

2092
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,840
for stuff that I have already.

2093
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,960
Uh, SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, uh, responding to one of the other things

2094
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:51,760
you talked about, DarkSakura, uh, SGA100Matt says, ETA to the shutdown order of that Mother

2095
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,760
Project.

2096
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,760
Yes.

2097
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,760
Sadly, with Nintendo involved.

2098
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,040
That's why you don't announce those things.

2099
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,880
You just do it and release it.

2100
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,600
When it's on the internet, it's done.

2101
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,600
Exactly.

2102
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,080
Maybe they're, maybe they're trying to recruit help.

2103
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,480
That's probably part of the reason.

2104
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,560
And so they have to kind of put it out there to recruit the help because, you know, you

2105
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,200
got to work for free with stuff like that.

2106
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:14,040
So that's why you use a project name and not, I don't know.

2107
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,040
Yeah.

2108
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,040
Might be hard though.

2109
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,040
All right.

2110
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,040
Uh, let's get to the foogle.

2111
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:19,040
Sorry.

2112
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:22,480
Not the fugello, but the foogle.

2113
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,480
The foogle question.

2114
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,480
Someday maybe.

2115
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,480
I like that.

2116
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,200
Foogle horn question of the week.

2117
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:35,320
Did you ever play a foogle horn, DarkSakura?

2118
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,840
I know you played a lot of instruments.

2119
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,840
No.

2120
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,840
I've eaten bugles though.

2121
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,840
Does that count?

2122
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,840
Delicious.

2123
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,840
Not quite.

2124
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,840
They're very corny, I guess.

2125
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,840
Like your jokes.

2126
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,840
All right.

2127
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,440
Uh, you take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam those together, you get foogle plus

2128
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:53,720
and the foogle question of the week.

2129
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,080
Uh, let's get to it.

2130
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:59,040
Every week we ask a question and this week is about PlayStation Home and we asked, will

2131
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,040
you miss it?

2132
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,040
Did you ever give it a try?

2133
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,400
Are you sad to see it go?

2134
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,400
Why or why not?

2135
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,640
Uh, we'll start off over on Facebook with Burr who says, I always found it amusing when

2136
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:11,760
people would compare Home to Second Life, only look at the graphics missing the point

2137
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,080
late that the latter is all user created.

2138
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,720
Make some tired joke about flying dongs and declare Home superior.

2139
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:22,160
Meanwhile, Second Life is still alive and its graphics have improved to a point surpassing

2140
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:23,160
Home.

2141
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,680
KJ says, I won't miss PlayStation Home.

2142
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,280
Well, maybe the 49 cents I paid for a ninja costume.

2143
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,240
I miss my 49 cents frown.

2144
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,220
Are you going to miss your Santa Claus outfit, Logie?

2145
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:39,120
My guy seriously looks like a drunken, uh, like hobo Santa.

2146
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:42,840
So it'll be, it'll make sense if I'm PlayStation homeless.

2147
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,900
All right.

2148
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,440
Let's go to Segg next who gave us two answers.

2149
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:52,120
He gave us a TLDR version, but to be honest, I liked the long form answer, so I'm going

2150
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,120
to read it.

2151
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,960
In conversations about this in the past few weeks, the like dislike had a very interesting

2152
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,600
gender overtone to it.

2153
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,360
My friends who identify as male either liked it enough to enjoy what was there for free

2154
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,780
or didn't care about it.

2155
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,840
My female friends tried it out.

2156
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:11,560
Get sexually harassed by men via the chat and character actions, never to return.

2157
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,360
Home is best remembered by learning from the flaws.

2158
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:17,880
The platform decisions you make in a game will directly affect the society it creates.

2159
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,360
Playing with friends was hard if not impossible.

2160
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,800
Even with all the premium housing, costumes, items, et cetera, there wasn't a good way

2161
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,720
to show that off to people you know.

2162
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,840
There was no way to make a better environment for yourself.

2163
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,160
We all lived in public.

2164
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,600
This leaves one with a sea of random people, abuse and all where flagging the behavior

2165
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,320
was a journey in itself.

2166
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,360
There were games that I enjoyed in the home platform.

2167
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,360
Sure.

2168
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,080
There were low level and basic, but some were fun, especially for free.

2169
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:44,200
Ultimately, Sony didn't place their investments in the right way to make home better.

2170
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:48,400
What we've left is what we're left with is a mediocre or less experience, which we can

2171
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,080
learn lessons from in the future.

2172
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,920
I think Destiny learned a bit of home's problems with the fire team functions.

2173
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,600
Easy to add friends in a group, then everyone's always in the same instance of gameplay.

2174
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,600
When you play with randoms, you don't see, you don't hear or see them speak.

2175
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,160
Still, I'll take Uru missed online any day.

2176
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,920
Note a friend of mine worked on home and is losing his job with his closure.

2177
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,200
Thankfully, it's known with a timeline, so he's in a much better position to find his

2178
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,560
next job.

2179
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:19,400
So I know that was a long answer, but it definitely brought an interesting thing to light with

2180
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,920
that whole gender issue.

2181
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,920
It's not.

2182
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:23,920
Yeah.

2183
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,520
I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily a gender issue.

2184
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,640
It's more of a people are anonymous on the Internet and they act like assholes issue.

2185
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:35,520
And this has been something ever since voice chat on the Internet was not even voice chat.

2186
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,520
Like chatting on the Internet was a thing.

2187
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,360
Oh, my God, a girl.

2188
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,360
Show me your boobs.

2189
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:43,720
And it doesn't even be like it doesn't even have to be that you're a girl.

2190
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,640
And I mean, if you're a nature of people, if your avatar is a girl in the game, you're

2191
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:51,640
gonna get people acting like idiots because they can anonymously because there's no way

2192
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,000
to get it tracked back to you.

2193
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Yeah.

2194
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We don't need feminism.

2195
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,600
Just saying slash sarcasm.

2196
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,280
But I like to play.

2197
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,780
My character in Destiny's female.

2198
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:04,960
Of course, I got punched in the face the other day, but I think that would have happened

2199
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,160
no matter what.

2200
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,680
But anyway, moving on.

2201
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:12,520
Gaming nerd says I've never tried it myself and was always curious to check it out and

2202
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,800
see what it was like.

2203
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,400
Maybe some time before it shuts down for good, I'll have a look just to see what I've missed

2204
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,760
out on.

2205
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,320
And Chiggers says they should give everyone a store credit if they spent real money on

2206
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,920
clothes or accessories since they're shutting it down.

2207
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,720
See, Chiggers, I understand where that reaction comes from.

2208
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:34,320
But the problem is this is something you have to understand when you buy gear in a virtual

2209
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,320
game.

2210
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,320
That game will go away.

2211
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,320
And it doesn't matter what it is.

2212
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,280
It's typically written into the terms of service as well.

2213
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,600
So you agreed that they have the right to do this.

2214
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,600
Exactly.

2215
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:46,400
And I know it kind of like sucks in retrospect, but like literally any game you've bought

2216
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:50,680
digital content for, that's another reason why I get nervous buying digital games.

2217
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:54,840
I mean, sure, I can always redownload the game at a later date if I, you know, delete

2218
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,180
the game off my system.

2219
01:51:56,180 --> 01:52:01,640
But what if one day Microsoft shuts off Xbox Live?

2220
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,520
I mean, someday that's going to happen.

2221
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,760
That's going to suck for being Titanfall.

2222
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,520
So that's just I mean, these are all things you have to consider is that it is unlimited

2223
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,520
time.

2224
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,520
Anyway, just the thing that people need to realize, though, is that it's not they forced

2225
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,480
you to do this or this, that, the other.

2226
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,480
You agreed to it.

2227
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,480
Yeah.

2228
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,840
If you didn't agree to it, then you wouldn't be playing it right now.

2229
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,540
It's also like a digital rental.

2230
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,760
You know, you watch the movie and now it's gone.

2231
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,600
Well, you don't get your money back, you know, because you got the value out of it for that

2232
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:35,440
limited time that you agreed to, I guess, is the closest comparison I can think of.

2233
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,600
Anyway, I don't mean to poo poo your opinion, Chiggers, but I just I kind of go, I see

2234
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,760
that what you're saying is kind of like a real kind of like gut reaction.

2235
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,360
But if you really kind of like look at the bigger picture, it's like, oh, anything digital

2236
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,000
is going to have this problem.

2237
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,680
And we hear this a lot with anything digital that shuts down.

2238
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,680
All right.

2239
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,680
I am the laziest.

2240
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,680
I love.

2241
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:56,400
No, I am the laziest.

2242
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,160
No, I am the I am the laziest one.

2243
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,560
I Dark Sakura just yawned.

2244
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,040
She is the laziest.

2245
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,680
All right.

2246
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:08,680
Wow.

2247
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:14,080
The man claiming to be the laziest says, I gave it a shot when I first got my PS3.

2248
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,440
Then when I actually got games, I ignored it.

2249
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:21,240
S2100 Matt says, I think home was a great idea ahead of its time.

2250
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:22,280
That just didn't work out.

2251
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:27,560
I think the next incarnation of it as possibly an onboard OS will be more useful and intuitive.

2252
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:30,840
I was really hyped for it when it was announced because I saw the possibility of it being

2253
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,460
a cool gaming social network.

2254
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:38,900
And I finally played it when I got a PS3 many years later, and it looked totally deserted.

2255
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:42,420
Over to Google Plus and getting some of our answers over there.

2256
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:46,900
I think we had just a couple of answers on Google Plus, and I'm waiting on Google Plus

2257
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,460
to load and show me those answers.

2258
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,460
Here we go.

2259
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,460
We have three comments tonight.

2260
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:52,580
I'll start with DNL.

2261
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,580
I love DNL.

2262
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:58,420
DNL says, I used PlayStation Home and once upon a time was tapped to join the team.

2263
01:53:58,420 --> 01:53:59,540
I turned them down.

2264
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:04,020
Ultimately, the execution of the system was not self-sustaining, monetization of the content

2265
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:08,020
was non-existent, and integration into the home system was not seamless.

2266
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:12,100
It was cumbersome to use at best, and I'm sad to say that the vision of the overall

2267
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,540
product was shortchanged.

2268
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:16,140
I'll be sad to see it go.

2269
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:20,620
A very respectful but very accurate read that I have to agree with.

2270
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:25,820
I mean, I think she hits the nail on the head when she says, where is it?

2271
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:27,900
Integration into the home system was not seamless.

2272
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:29,620
It was cumbersome to use at best.

2273
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:35,420
I mean, that's my biggest issue with it, is that like on paper, I love the idea of home,

2274
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:41,380
but like, here's me with my big finger pointing up saying this.

2275
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:48,180
Anyhow, Reddertainment says, I remember spending a couple of hours fooling around in PlayStation

2276
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,180
Home.

2277
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:52,020
I played some of the games, wandered around in some of the spaces, and even took in the

2278
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:54,940
uncharted area of home that Naughty Dog had set up.

2279
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:59,740
In the end, I didn't find enough compelling inside of home to spend and substantive time

2280
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:03,300
in it outside of the handful of times I briefly logged on.

2281
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:06,560
Unfortunately, this is the experience that most people had with home.

2282
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:12,020
Much like 1 versus 100, home had the promise of potential that was never actually realized.

2283
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,460
Oh, kick me in the gut, why don't you?

2284
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,980
But see, here's where I would argue.

2285
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:23,500
One versus 100, I think was a little more realized in a way.

2286
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:28,820
But anyway, I mean, can you imagine if they built something like 1 versus 100 into PlayStation

2287
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,820
Home?

2288
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:34,260
The biggest hurdle to that would have just been that seamlessness that we heard about

2289
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,260
in the other comment.

2290
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:39,980
But anyway, one more answer from ActDeft who says, PS Home wasn't something that appealed

2291
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:42,500
to me or something that I had to get a PS3 for.

2292
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,880
It had potential, but it lacked substance, so I can see why it failed and why it's getting

2293
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,940
taken down.

2294
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,420
Sucks for the people that actually enjoyed it and also had bought stuff for it, but in

2295
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:54,160
this day and age of digital content, nothing lasts forever.

2296
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,160
True facts.

2297
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:56,160
Thanks for the answers.

2298
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,160
Appreciate it, guys.

2299
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:04,540
Again, you can friend us on Facebook and Google Plus and answer a future Google Question of

2300
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:05,540
the Week.

2301
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:08,220
Meanwhile, we get back into some long form news.

2302
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:11,580
I usually ask for our perspectives on the question, but we kind of already talked about

2303
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,420
that earlier in the show.

2304
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,220
My perspective is...

2305
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,220
Did you ever really get to try it?

2306
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:20,100
I didn't care.

2307
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,440
I read it because this is how I do about everything.

2308
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,300
I read up on it, decide if I want to do it or not.

2309
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,300
I read up on it.

2310
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:29,780
It seemed like monumental waste of time to me.

2311
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:32,200
I wouldn't call it a waste of time.

2312
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:33,200
To me.

2313
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,860
To me, it would have been a waste of time.

2314
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:37,240
Some would say video games are a waste of time, but no, I understand everything's a

2315
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,240
personal taste.

2316
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,900
Keep in mind, I did try Second Life.

2317
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,900
Did you?

2318
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,420
And I stayed with it for two whole weeks.

2319
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:46,420
Two whole weeks?

2320
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:48,060
It was free.

2321
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:53,100
It was when I was on my big Avatar kick.

2322
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,100
Like the movie Avatar.

2323
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:55,100
The movie Avatar.

2324
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:56,100
Did people build pandorans?

2325
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,100
Yeah, people did.

2326
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,420
It was actually really cool.

2327
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:03,260
It was really neat going around and seeing what other people created and just seeing

2328
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:07,460
the different ways that people would try to interpret what they saw of their fandoms.

2329
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,860
I saw some for various fantasy universes.

2330
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:17,900
I kind of did avoid the sexy playground ones or whatever, but it was actually very robust.

2331
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,700
Going to chat room, because we have Gossipy Dish in our chat room, and I love me some

2332
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:27,460
Gossipy Dish over at live.vognetwork.com, and yet again, the SEG, who said earlier in

2333
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,940
the show he should have driven up tonight, and I'm starting to agree, SEG.

2334
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:33,140
You should have just been here tonight, because lots of great comments from SEG tonight.

2335
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:38,180
SEG says, one versus 100 only failed because the ad team didn't do their job.

2336
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:41,820
Talk to an engineer who worked on one versus 100 at GDC this year.

2337
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,580
That literally was the reason.

2338
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,820
Gold sales went up with one versus 100.

2339
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,540
Is it that the ad team didn't or couldn't?

2340
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:52,180
I mean, I'm just curious.

2341
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:55,900
Not that I don't think you don't know the difference, but I'm wondering, was it that

2342
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:56,900
people...

2343
01:57:56,900 --> 01:58:00,260
Yeah, now that I think about it, I only ever saw Sprint commercials on that thing.

2344
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:03,500
That was the only company I ever saw back one versus 100.

2345
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:06,860
Did no one else get it, maybe?

2346
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:07,860
I don't know.

2347
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:12,020
But SEG, if you haven't heard it, you got to hear last week's show because when we had

2348
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:16,780
Jackbox Games on, they talked about how You Don't Know Jack was almost game number two

2349
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:20,380
for that whole thing, and that was a huge...

2350
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:25,100
I'm surprised more people aren't talking about what he said last week on the show, but there

2351
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:26,100
you go.

2352
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,100
I thought it was very interesting.

2353
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,780
So anyway, let's move on.

2354
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:31,780
More news.

2355
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:32,780
Loki.

2356
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:37,940
All right, I don't know how much news this really is, but apparently if you're digging,

2357
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:41,340
you really, really want to play Minecraft on the Wii U, well, you're not going to be

2358
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,940
able to play Minecraft on the Wii U right now, but don't worry because someone's there

2359
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:51,660
to fill the void, and they're making their own Minecraft clone called U-Craft, and it's

2360
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:58,220
by some anonymous developer, a licensed developer for the Wii U.

2361
01:58:58,220 --> 01:58:59,740
And it's a UND game.

2362
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:05,320
I can totally tell, just screenshot, it's a UND game, but I don't know if you really

2363
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:11,140
should be getting that excited about it because we've seen these kind of a dime a dozen on

2364
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,140
the Xbox Indie game.

2365
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:16,700
I was going to say, I was like, well, I don't think I've really seen studios do just straight

2366
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:20,540
up Minecraft clones, and I'm like, wait a minute, no, Xbox Live Indie games, oh my God,

2367
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:22,400
there was 100 million billion of them.

2368
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:28,340
And even on mobile app stores, iTunes and Google Play, there's tons of them out there.

2369
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:31,580
There are, and I'm going to tell you right now, I mean, once you get one on there, it's

2370
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:37,260
not going to be the end of it, and especially now that the Wii U, you can export to the

2371
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:43,700
Wii U using Unity, I'm sure you're going to see a lot more of these types of games.

2372
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:48,260
But I just hope it's not like a literal, because a lot of these Minecraft clones, like I've

2373
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:54,300
played, what was it, Castle Miner Z and stuff like that, and they're okay, I mean, they

2374
01:59:54,300 --> 02:00:00,100
were like a buck, and it had, you know, it's just like really terrible graphics, and it's

2375
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:04,420
Minecraft with zombies and skeletons and shit, and you have guns.

2376
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,740
I mean, that was kind of the difference.

2377
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:10,100
And this right now, just in the screenshots, looks like it's very basic, I mean, they've

2378
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:17,160
got the standard assets, you know, skybox in there, diffuse textures, it just looks

2379
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:23,020
really basic, but they're claiming it's like an alpha, you know, the alpha images, but

2380
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:26,700
I don't know, whatever, I mean, hey, cool, if it's cheap enough, you know what, it might

2381
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:30,660
not be a bad thing to waste your time on, because there is a lot of those clones that

2382
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:36,620
came out on Xbox Indie games that people really liked, so, cool, I hope that does come out

2383
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:41,020
and maybe at least shows, you know, Mojang or Microsoft or whoever, that there might

2384
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,060
be some interest on that platform.

2385
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:49,300
Well, it's not gonna matter now, after Microsoft has no interest in building this on Nintendo,

2386
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:53,540
well, I say that, but then I go back and think, oh yeah, there was a Viva Pinata 3DS game,

2387
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:58,740
so I guess anything is fucking possible, but I just, I really don't see it happening.

2388
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:05,820
I sort of think what needs to happen, if Nintendo really wants this to be a thing, then if this

2389
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:10,580
hasn't already happened with whatever developer is making this, Nintendo needs to find the

2390
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:16,180
developer capable of doing it and Pope Nintendo needs to bless the game by saying, you can

2391
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:21,620
put Mario and Link in it, because if you can put Mario and Link in Minecraft or whatever,

2392
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:28,280
then, then it'll sell, like, Mario goes mining, will sell 11 billion copies.

2393
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:33,980
Think about it, if you could marry the Minecraft world with Mario, I mean, there it is.

2394
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:36,740
Mario or what about, like, Rosetti?

2395
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:43,060
Mr. Rosetti's Digging Adventure, and then he yells at you if you turn the game off too early.

2396
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,300
I actually kind of love that idea.

2397
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:49,260
Have you ever actually been in Mr. Rosetti's house in, uh...

2398
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,860
Didn't it only show up, like, once in a blue moon type of thing?

2399
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:53,300
I've managed to make it into his house.

2400
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,300
Yeah, yeah.

2401
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,860
He has a couple of toilets.

2402
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:57,860
That's awesome.

2403
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:58,860
Yeah.

2404
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:01,420
What if the next Animal Crossing were to take elements of Minecraft?

2405
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:02,420
I think they're actually...

2406
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:03,420
It's not.

2407
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:04,420
Yeah, I don't know.

2408
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:05,420
I just...

2409
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:06,420
Animal Crossing will never change.

2410
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:08,060
Yeah, Animal Crossing does kind of have a forest.

2411
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:10,540
The forest will always be the forest.

2412
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:13,900
But man, I think about, like, what those games would look like if they could get married

2413
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:17,100
a little bit, and it's kind of awesome, but, I don't know, maybe it's a bit much.

2414
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:22,580
And I don't know, see, like, ironically enough, you know, for my game, I actually had to build

2415
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:27,180
something that basically is like Minecraft, you know, for my editor, and, you know, what

2416
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:29,500
they have on the screen is actually not that difficult to make.

2417
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:35,140
I mean, there's tutorials out there that build that pretty easy, so, I don't know.

2418
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:38,500
Hopefully it's fun, because that's really, when it comes down to the end of it, I mean,

2419
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:42,180
it can look like shit, but if it's fun, it doesn't matter.

2420
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:46,820
All right, well, this game's doing very well, because it's a lot of fun for a lot of people,

2421
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:50,820
and that is League of Legends, but you know what makes this game not fun and really turns

2422
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:54,060
some people off sometimes, like, you know, it's done with me and some other people I

2423
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,060
know?

2424
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:56,060
Assholes?

2425
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,060
Assholes, that's right.

2426
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:58,060
Toxic players.

2427
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:59,060
People that are dicks.

2428
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:03,460
Well, Riot Games has been doing, you know, to be fair, they've been trying to come up

2429
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:07,980
with ways to sort of, you know, punish those toxic players and basically let them know

2430
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:11,580
that they're not welcome inside League of Legends, and this is going to be interesting.

2431
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:16,660
There is a patch coming to League of Legends, and if a player is voted down for negative

2432
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:22,900
behavior, and they're already operating under a chat restriction, they will have to, I'm

2433
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:27,860
sorry, what's happening in the game now, you are already operating under chat restriction

2434
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:30,300
if you're voted down for negative behavior.

2435
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:34,320
You have to play a certain number of games, and then you can speak in the game again.

2436
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:40,860
So being able to speak in League of Legends is something you earn, essentially, if, you

2437
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:43,220
know, you don't act like a jackass.

2438
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,700
But here's another restriction that's coming with this patch.

2439
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:50,180
You will not be able to play ranked play.

2440
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:51,180
That's right.

2441
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:55,500
Ranked restricted players will have a certain number of games that you have to play before

2442
02:03:55,500 --> 02:04:01,380
you can return to queuing for ranked matches, meaning, what's the only possible pool of

2443
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:02,380
players?

2444
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:07,120
They'll have to play with new players in the basic pool to work their way back up to the

2445
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:10,700
ranked pool, and not only do they have to play with the basic players, they have to

2446
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:14,660
act nice, because if they keep getting ranked down, they'll never get to see the ranked

2447
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:15,840
matches again.

2448
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,140
This is kind of awesome.

2449
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:18,140
I love it.

2450
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,820
I love it!

2451
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:22,920
Good job, Riot Games.

2452
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,920
If you are too deeply in negative territory and rank restricted at the end of a given

2453
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:32,760
competitive season, you will be ineligible for receiving special rewards for ranked play.

2454
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,660
So it's like, Riot Games is now written, you will not be a dick into the rules.

2455
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:40,600
If you want to get rewards, you will not be a jerk.

2456
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:43,240
Jerks do not get rewarded.

2457
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,360
Super Nanny is at work over at Riot Games, and I love this.

2458
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,320
What do you guys think in our chatroom over at live.volgnetwork.com?

2459
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,480
I'm applauding it with my brain.

2460
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:56,840
Let's see, Act F says, my brother plays League of Legends and just uses Skype instead

2461
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,200
of the in-game chat.

2462
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,680
When he's playing with friends, of course.

2463
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:02,320
When he isn't, he just doesn't talk.

2464
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:08,280
SSG100Matt says, hmm, I just wonder how people can abuse this, like an entire clan downvoting

2465
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,360
one person just to be a jerk.

2466
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:17,400
Ooh, I hope that isn't something that people can take advantage of.

2467
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:22,040
The Segg says, I don't know if throwing the most toxic players to your new users is a

2468
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:23,040
good idea.

2469
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,040
Ah, but at the same time.

2470
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:25,400
As long as they can't talk to them.

2471
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:29,760
If they can't talk to them, remember, they already got their right to talk stripped away.

2472
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,000
So if they don't shape up, they have to ship out.

2473
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,120
Bojikawa says, to be honest, I like that a lot.

2474
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:39,680
I never do ranked matches and usually just hush if someone wants to start talking out

2475
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:40,840
of their butt.

2476
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:45,520
And Fifth Dream says, that should be the first line in any end user license agreement.

2477
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,840
You agree to not be a jerk.

2478
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,040
That should be like the big font right at the top.

2479
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,280
Loki, is the game you're making going to have online play?

2480
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:55,920
Because I think your EULA should have that in like 24 point font right at the top.

2481
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:01,320
I can put it on there anyways, but no, it's not, at least right now I'm not planning on

2482
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,000
doing any sort of online stuff.

2483
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,680
It could pop up with a question.

2484
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,640
Like when you start the game, are you a jerk?

2485
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:07,640
Yes or no.

2486
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:08,640
And if they click yes, the game uninstalls.

2487
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,640
It's kind of dumb.

2488
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,640
No, I'm not going to do that.

2489
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,640
Ah, you're no fun at all.

2490
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,760
Alright, let's move on.

2491
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,400
Dark Sakura.

2492
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:24,160
This one actually, what gave me the decision to post this story was Becky's reaction to

2493
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,160
it.

2494
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:28,100
Because as you know, my best friend Becky has a seven year old.

2495
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:33,680
It's a game called Galaxies, G-A-L-X-Y-Z.

2496
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:41,520
And it's put out, it actually has affiliation with the New York Academy of Sciences.

2497
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:47,560
The game is launching in 2015, and it's going to be an online educational game for children.

2498
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:52,320
Basically it's kindergarteners through 12th graders.

2499
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:57,880
It was created because a dad saw his kids getting bored playing science education games.

2500
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,520
He wanted them to be challenging, which makes them more effective.

2501
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:08,440
And so his name is Osman Rashid, and he's the CEO of Galaxies.

2502
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:15,360
And this is a quote from him, students have more capacity to learn than we give them credit

2503
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,360
for.

2504
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:19,520
They are naturally perceptive and will easily see through the products that seek to fool

2505
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,280
them into thinking they're fun.

2506
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:28,320
So basically, the New York Academy of Sciences is going to be keeping an eye on students

2507
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:33,040
as they play the game across the world that show more science aptitude.

2508
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:38,960
And those that excel will be considered for free science education through an online talent

2509
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:41,760
organization called the Junior Academy.

2510
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,700
And so if they are let in, they will get mentoring, high-level online science courses, and opportunities

2511
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:49,960
to participate on research teams.

2512
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:54,600
So they're starting with an initial pool of 500 students and are hoping to increase into

2513
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,760
the thousands as the project goes on.

2514
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:59,840
So I think this is really awesome.

2515
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,440
Hooray for science.

2516
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,520
We don't talk enough about like edutainment games on the show, really.

2517
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:08,840
So it's kind of neat to always see how they kind of bridge education and gaming together,

2518
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,840
you know.

2519
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:13,840
You can learn more about it at galaxies.com, g-a-l-y-x-z.com.

2520
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,640
All right.

2521
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:18,760
Do you think do you think lots of kids will learn about science thanks to this?

2522
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,760
I hope so.

2523
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,300
I'd really the thing is, this is not so much learning as seeing because I always think

2524
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:29,760
that when it's something that you can be engaged in, that's what makes it fun and interesting

2525
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:30,760
to keep up with it.

2526
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:36,840
And when you start participating with it and finding a reason to keep participating, then

2527
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,960
you're going to keep learning something.

2528
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,520
It's going to be something new every time.

2529
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:44,240
It'll keep bringing you back instead of making it seem like just something they're shoving

2530
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:47,880
down your throat, like, you know, linear algebra.

2531
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:53,880
Tiger Claw in chat says, now only if these games had people perform actual science experiments.

2532
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:57,240
You mean like on Mr. Wizard's World, even though they would always have the disclaimer,

2533
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,240
don't try this at home?

2534
02:08:58,240 --> 02:09:00,080
You know, you know, he hated children, right?

2535
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,080
You know, you're going to do that at home.

2536
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,080
I've always heard.

2537
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:07,240
I always thought that was urban legend and not actually fact, but that's kind of like

2538
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:11,780
one of those, like the same urban legend that Mr. Rogers was like a trained sharpshooter

2539
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:14,440
in the military or something like that was completely not true.

2540
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:22,640
He was a Methodist minister, but still just people love the imagery of Mr. Rogers, like

2541
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:27,240
carrying around a sniper rifle, just, you know, won't you be my neighbor?

2542
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,240
My dead neighbor.

2543
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,240
All right.

2544
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,240
Moving on.

2545
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,240
Loki.

2546
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,240
All right.

2547
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:35,240
So there is a lawsuit against Activision.

2548
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:36,920
I don't even really remember this.

2549
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:41,680
I think this was from a while ago, but there was a lawsuit where there was a, I guess,

2550
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:48,160
regarding a patent that a company called them, was it McRoe Inc had, which was automatic

2551
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:53,120
animated lip synchronization and facial expressions of 3D characters.

2552
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:58,840
So basically they took a, you see a lot of this with like patent trolls where they took

2553
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:04,800
the process for, you know, lip syncing something like you would do in like a cartoon or something

2554
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,040
and add on a computer to the end of the patent.

2555
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:14,880
And so like there was a precedent set with, was it Alice Corp versus a CLS bank international,

2556
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:19,320
where I think it was the same type of situation where they were like, okay, we have a patent

2557
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:25,040
for banking, you know, like something banking related, but on a computer, you know?

2558
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:31,880
And so because the precedent was set by that case in which they invalidated those patents,

2559
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:36,680
the same thing kind of happened here where the case was dismissed and those patents that

2560
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:43,160
were owned by McRoe were actually invalidated because you can't just add on a computer at

2561
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:46,700
the end of a patent and hope to have something brand new.

2562
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:52,020
So hopefully, hopefully they did this a lot more with different, you know, uh, patents

2563
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:53,020
because there's a lot of them.

2564
02:10:53,020 --> 02:10:54,020
Yeah, like the podcasting patent.

2565
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:56,780
That would be fantastic if that happened to this.

2566
02:10:56,780 --> 02:11:01,940
Well, that one's tough because people keep settling with them when they, you know, win

2567
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:02,940
or lose.

2568
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:03,940
I don't know.

2569
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:06,780
I don't think they've won any of them, but they keep settling.

2570
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:08,020
I think they keep settling.

2571
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:12,300
I think they're going to go after the NBC or yeah, NBC, CBS.

2572
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:14,920
They've basically said they're not going to go after like individual podcasters with these

2573
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,920
big companies.

2574
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,280
Anyway, I'm starting to digress, but it is, it is obviously an issue that raises all of

2575
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:22,940
our eyebrows because it's a little ridiculous.

2576
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:29,720
If you ask me, it's like claiming to invent the RSS feed, but anyway, anyway, all right.

2577
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,120
Another week, another lawsuit here on the program.

2578
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:37,360
Uh, let's talk about something that, uh, probably would be a lawsuit except it's a Chinese bootleg

2579
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:42,120
and there's really not a lot he can do about that because this happens all the time.

2580
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:47,760
But it has to do with a hearthstone bootleg in China, but it's not what you think.

2581
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,960
It's not the computer version of hearthstone being bootlegged.

2582
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:54,320
It's like an actual tangible version of hearthstone.

2583
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,320
Yes.

2584
02:11:55,320 --> 02:12:01,960
Uh, in, in China, they have actually made a like paper version of hearthstone with like

2585
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:05,840
printed cards and everything and counters to keep track of life's and all this stuff.

2586
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:09,080
It's a physical version of hearthstone.

2587
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:16,000
So, uh, yeah, um, you can apparently track this down in China for about $50, uh, even

2588
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,920
though the original is free to play, but, uh, there it is.

2589
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:24,120
Uh, you can read more about this if you want games in Asia.com has a full rundown on this,

2590
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:29,280
uh, real life hearthstone cards, and you can even see what some of these like little counters

2591
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,160
that count down the life and so forth look like.

2592
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:37,280
Um, but there was a, uh, there's no coin to flip to start the match at the beginning.

2593
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,240
They have a coin card itself though, which is part of the game.

2594
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:48,440
So, uh, yeah, there it is hearthstone is available, um, tangibly overseas.

2595
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:49,600
Interesting.

2596
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:52,920
I wonder if there would be enough demand for this if Blizzard's interested at all in putting

2597
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:53,920
out a physical version of this.

2598
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:57,440
I would think probably not because they're making all their money off the, uh, you know,

2599
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:01,120
the, the cards and the mystery packs, the open and all that stuff.

2600
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:05,280
But, uh, interesting, uh, fifth dream in chat says, I assume they were going to make a real

2601
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,280
one.

2602
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:11,760
So, uh, Bochi Kawa says Wizards of the Coast needs to get on top of that market.

2603
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,760
So there it is.

2604
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:15,120
All right.

2605
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:17,540
Um, let's get into the mailbag.

2606
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:22,040
Every week you guys send us emails and, uh, we bootleg with your permission, your emails

2607
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:24,040
and read them on the show.

2608
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:26,920
Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send your emails.

2609
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:31,800
Darsakha will dive into the mailbag and, uh, pull out whatever emails there are and, uh,

2610
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:37,880
make sure that they are fit for user consumption, that, you know, it's not like a penis enlargement

2611
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:39,880
email that somebody's sending the show.

2612
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,720
Uh, she will read it for all of our, uh, listeners and for us here in studio to respond to.

2613
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:49,640
So participate at orangelauntrader.com, Darsakha, what's in the mailbag tonight?

2614
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:50,640
One mail.

2615
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:51,640
One?

2616
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:52,640
Hi, OLR.

2617
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:53,880
Just a quick email for you guys.

2618
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:56,080
Please know Kim Kardashian Music.

2619
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:00,240
You mentioned last week something about who would name their company Skynet.

2620
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:05,880
Funny story, the biggest telecom company in Belgium, Belgacom, calls their ISP Skynet.

2621
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:10,640
According to Wikipedia, Skynet's operations are almost, uh, almost exclusively performed

2622
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:16,520
by war machines, cyborg, usually a terminator, and, it gives a link, and other computer systems

2623
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,600
with the goal of exterminating the human race.

2624
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:21,720
This is fairly accurate as having to deal with their customer service will surely make

2625
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:25,320
you want to kill the person on the other end of the phone, thus contributing to exterminating

2626
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:26,320
the human race.

2627
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:31,640
I hope you make it to episode 666, and thanks to Rob for posting the podcast promptly nowadays

2628
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:34,560
so your overseas listeners can enjoy it on Monday morning.

2629
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,720
All the best, Martin from Belgium.

2630
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:41,120
Hooray, emails from overseas, and you're welcome, and, uh, yeah.

2631
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,120
Semi-chocolate.

2632
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:45,520
I've been a good boy about posting podcasts pretty promptly for a few years now.

2633
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,520
Martin, semi-chocolate.

2634
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,960
I haven't had good Belgian chocolate in ages.

2635
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,920
No, seriously, Belgian chocolate is, like, the best chocolate in the world.

2636
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,520
Here's what I want to know.

2637
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:59,320
And, Darsakar, I know you weren't here last week, but in a nutshell, um, Square Enix is

2638
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:04,320
going to be doing a cloud computing service called Shinra, which, you know, right?

2639
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:05,920
Yeah, see?

2640
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:10,160
And so I said, that would be like announcing a new computing service that you're calling

2641
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,240
Skynet.

2642
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,880
And so that's why he sent in this email.

2643
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:18,060
So my question is, is the terminator, like, a big part of pop culture in Belgium like

2644
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,060
it is here?

2645
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:22,760
Or is it, like, not really a, like, people don't know what that is?

2646
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:24,280
That would explain that.

2647
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:26,280
I've actually never been to Belgium, Rob.

2648
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:27,280
Me neither.

2649
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,280
Let's go.

2650
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,280
Let's go right now.

2651
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,280
Martin, we're going to come stay in your living room.

2652
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:31,280
That's right.

2653
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,280
We're crashing.

2654
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:33,280
Clean off the couch.

2655
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,400
Have some chocolate waiting for me.

2656
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,280
Have some fries waiting for me.

2657
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:40,280
Loki, you want to come with?

2658
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:41,280
We're going to Belgium.

2659
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:42,600
What about fries in Belgium?

2660
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:43,600
Waffles.

2661
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:44,600
All right, waffles.

2662
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,600
Waffles, fries, and chocolate.

2663
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:46,600
Hey, Rob.

2664
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,600
What?

2665
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:49,560
Penguins in sweaters.

2666
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:50,560
That's not in the mailbag.

2667
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,560
No, it's not.

2668
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,560
But I just scrolled past it and I thought of you.

2669
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:54,560
All right.

2670
02:15:54,560 --> 02:16:00,800
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

2671
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,480
And it can be from whatever country you want.

2672
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:05,640
We'll even take emails from Ohio, of which I'm expecting a few this week.

2673
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,640
All right.

2674
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,360
I have no fucking problem with Ohio.

2675
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,040
Stop it.

2676
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:17,160
Every state has fucking boring shit in it.

2677
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:20,040
Let's de- Especially New Jersey.

2678
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:21,840
Let's detail them all right now.

2679
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:22,840
All right.

2680
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:26,440
You can hear Dark Soccer is starting to get agitated and there's no better time during

2681
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:44,440
the show to do the FUs of the Week.

2682
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:46,240
Fuck my headache.

2683
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,760
Fuck my headache.

2684
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:53,480
I'm so just tired all the time, so fuck being tired too.

2685
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,480
I mean, okay.

2686
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:55,480
I really love what I do.

2687
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,480
Love it.

2688
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:01,320
And no, I'm not telling any of you where I work, but I love it.

2689
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:07,760
At the same time, holy shit, I just like to be home for an entire day, so.

2690
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:12,680
I love what I do too, but I also really love sitting on the couch and playing video games

2691
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:13,680
all day.

2692
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:16,360
I love not wearing pants.

2693
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:19,240
That's why you work from home, if you can.

2694
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:23,640
I like- Well, there's just some days I'll be like, it's lunchtime.

2695
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:26,280
I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.

2696
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,280
It's my break.

2697
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,080
I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.

2698
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,080
No.

2699
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,680
No, I really- I like what I do.

2700
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:36,120
I am happy, happy, happy to dedicate the time that I do to it because this is the first

2701
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:41,240
place I've worked at in ages that I have actually really felt like I'm contributing.

2702
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:45,640
You know, like I'm a part of things and I really love it, but I'm really tired at the

2703
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:51,320
same time and with just like a day where nobody asks me to draw something, I don't

2704
02:17:51,320 --> 02:18:00,000
have to do flyers, I don't have to talk to people, I don't have to look at people, I

2705
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:07,840
don't have to wear actual clothes or makeup or- my hair could be a big poofy rat's nest.

2706
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:08,840
Don't care.

2707
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:14,880
It's just me and the cat eating ice cream, both of us out of the same bowl, watching

2708
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:15,880
YouTube.

2709
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:18,040
It'd be great.

2710
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,040
Alright.

2711
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:26,520
Look, I want to say something, but I can't talk about your job, so I'll say it off here.

2712
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,520
Alright, Loki.

2713
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:32,960
Fuck you, the farmer's insurance, mainly all the independent farmer's insurance agents

2714
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,600
out there.

2715
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,000
That seriously is such a pyramid scheme.

2716
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,840
You're looking for work that happened to be dumb enough to post your resume online publicly,

2717
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:48,100
you will get called by literally thousands of these people because for some reason there's

2718
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:50,200
all these independent branches.

2719
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:54,360
Can you imagine how the massive army of farmer's insurance people that are actually trying

2720
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:57,520
to get people to buy insurance from them?

2721
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:00,720
No thanks.

2722
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:05,680
My FU of the week goes to my lack of motivation to really buckle down and lose some weight

2723
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:10,680
because I really want to get on that and I just keep falling off the wagon continuously

2724
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:14,560
over and over again and I know that the chips are so good.

2725
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:20,420
I need to channel the strength of Richard Simmons, who by the way tweeted me this week

2726
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:26,280
and I quit the internet because once you get Richard Simmons to tweet you, you win.

2727
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:28,880
Are you going to glitter squat?

2728
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:31,840
That's the only way I'm going to lose weight is to glitter squat and if you don't know

2729
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:34,840
what I'm talking about, you need to go to Richard Simmons Facebook page and if you hate

2730
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:38,560
Richard Simmons or you make fun of Richard Simmons, I'm coming for you.

2731
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:42,960
Ain't nobody got time for a Richard Simmons hater because seriously, what negative thing

2732
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:44,600
has that man ever done?

2733
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:45,600
He does nothing but help people.

2734
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:46,600
He's a good person.

2735
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,600
I love him.

2736
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:54,920
Platonically, don't take it to a weird place, but he tweeted me and I win the internet and

2737
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:55,920
you lost.

2738
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:56,920
Yeah.

2739
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:03,480
All right, let's get to a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll open up the

2740
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:10,440
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2741
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:13,280
Let's get to the last few news stories here.

2742
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,280
Loki.

2743
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,280
All right.

2744
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:20,440
So Steam has hit a milestone surpassing a hundred million users.

2745
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:25,560
With that also, of course, they've added the whole curation system now.

2746
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:30,840
So now you can actually, I believe if you have a Steam group, you can add your own curation

2747
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:36,360
page where you can recommend different games and give them reviews and that kind of stuff

2748
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:38,720
and people can go visit that.

2749
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,440
And you may have been seeing a lot of this on like social media where they're talking

2750
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:46,560
about like, hey, go like our curation page or go join it or something like that.

2751
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:47,560
So they have that.

2752
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:52,640
And then of course, the Steam music player that was in beta for the longest time has

2753
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,000
now been released.

2754
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,880
So you can actually use the Steam music player.

2755
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:03,320
It's integrated into Steam and use your own library with that.

2756
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:07,800
So kind of one of the things that they're going to be using for the Steam OS and be

2757
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:12,200
curious to see what other kind of non-gaming applications they have for Steam OS because

2758
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:16,640
we don't really know too much about it yet.

2759
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,680
Yeah.

2760
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:21,240
What is the status of all that stuff with Steam?

2761
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:25,680
I noticed though that Steam, like it looks a lot different now.

2762
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:30,040
Like they did some weird, like it looks blue and they use some different fonts.

2763
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,160
Like I like its look.

2764
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:36,760
I like the blue look a lot because you know, blue is prettier than gray, but it definitely

2765
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,660
looks like they're like ramping up to something.

2766
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:40,520
But what was the last on this whole Steam OS?

2767
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,100
I have no idea.

2768
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:46,080
Another cool thing about the Steam music player, if you do happen to check it out, you'll notice

2769
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,460
if you own some Valve games that you'll have the soundtracks for said games.

2770
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:57,720
So like Half-Life, Portal, Portal 2, and also I guess was it they've got, I wonder if that's

2771
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,100
how Humble Bundle is going to do the soundtracks in the future.

2772
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:02,100
Possibly that'd be pretty cool.

2773
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:03,100
I bet it is.

2774
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:05,700
Have like a Steam code for the soundtrack.

2775
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:07,660
Have you tried Steam in big picture mode lately?

2776
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:09,380
It's a slick little interface.

2777
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:12,060
I haven't tried it lately, but I've used it in the past.

2778
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:15,740
I've looked at big picture mode, but you know, on my laptop, it's kind of useless.

2779
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:19,380
Yeah, no, it's a, I was actually just using it last night cause I was feeling lazy and

2780
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:23,060
I just kind of had the controller and I was like, well, it also, when you upgraded Steam,

2781
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:25,980
and I don't know if this is just because I'm opted into the beta program, a little picture

2782
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,700
of a controller now shows up in the upper right.

2783
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:28,700
Yeah.

2784
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:29,700
And I was like, what's this do?

2785
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,340
And I clicked it and it was like, oh, it's in big picture mode.

2786
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:35,880
And I was like, wow, this is like all splashy and blue and different from what I remember.

2787
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:42,360
So yeah, it's, it feels very fluid and that that's what led me to playing things like

2788
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:45,960
Crypt of the Necrodancer again and stuff that that's enabled for big picture mode.

2789
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:50,680
It's like, it's like playing a, playing a Xbox or something.

2790
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:52,320
It's great.

2791
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:57,860
So fifth dream in chat says, how do I delete these valve albums from my Steam player?

2792
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:59,720
It's not like they gave you, you too.

2793
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:04,600
Come on, don't even start.

2794
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:05,600
Let's see.

2795
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,120
Uh, what else?

2796
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:11,240
Act F says Steam is blue da ba dee ba da ba dee ba ba dee.

2797
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,240
Oh boy.

2798
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:17,520
Uh, and, uh, Causton says Humble doesn't do Steam codes anymore.

2799
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:18,520
Unfortunately.

2800
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,360
Why did they link them to your Steam account?

2801
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:21,960
Oh yeah, that's right.

2802
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:23,640
You link them to your account instead.

2803
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,640
That's okay.

2804
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,640
That's not, that's the same thing.

2805
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:32,000
Not entirely true because I had to enter a Steam code in, I think for, um, road redemption.

2806
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,800
It might, it might depend on what it is you're getting through the Humble store and just

2807
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,880
like what, you know, Kickstarter might be a different thing.

2808
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:39,880
Who knows?

2809
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,520
Anyhow.

2810
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:46,240
I kind of like that I don't have to enter in Steam code sometimes, so I'm all in with

2811
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:47,240
that.

2812
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:50,640
Bobby Black Wolf is toying with what I said earlier about big picture mode and Xbox saying,

2813
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:52,720
you mean it's like playing a Steam box?

2814
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:56,880
Well, yes, it is actually a lot like that, but it's cool that I can get the sense of

2815
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,640
what that would really feel like, like on my PC.

2816
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:00,640
I don't know.

2817
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:04,000
It's just kind of, and that I didn't actually buy a damn Steam box.

2818
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,560
I just am using my PC to do it.

2819
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,840
It's still kind of neat.

2820
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:14,800
So all right, let's move on with one more story here about speaking about consoles and

2821
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:17,000
what they really do.

2822
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:22,720
Game consoles are actually the most popular streaming device in most American homes.

2823
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,760
And a lot of you guys are probably sitting here going, well, I probably could have told

2824
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:26,760
you that.

2825
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:32,080
But this is important because this is research from Parks Associates, which was reported

2826
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:37,960
on in Home Media Magazine, 46% of American households with broadband have a video game

2827
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:43,760
console connected, and 38% use said console as their primary means of streaming entertainment

2828
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:46,640
like Netflix or Hulu.

2829
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:47,840
But here's the thing.

2830
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:53,040
A comment from Barbara Krauss, who's the director of research, says, quote, gaming consoles

2831
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:58,200
are the most frequently used connected CE device because of their high adoption rates.

2832
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:03,160
Of the broadband households that have only one connected CE device, nearly 60% have a

2833
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:04,160
game console.

2834
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:08,680
As the non-gaming capabilities of consoles have expanded, so too has the potential for

2835
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:13,760
consoles to become an entertainment platform for online content such as video, music, and

2836
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:14,760
apps.

2837
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:21,080
So this means that right now consoles are bigger than Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Google

2838
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,240
TV, Google Chromecast.

2839
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:28,560
Only 9% use a Blu-ray disc player that has all that stuff built into it.

2840
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:33,280
I mean, gaming consoles really are becoming that all-in-one box.

2841
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:38,360
So even more so than, you know, when I, it wasn't really till I heard this is bigger

2842
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:42,880
than Roku and Apple TV when I was like, oh shit, gaming consoles like really are kind

2843
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,200
of a big deal with the streaming stuff.

2844
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:50,760
So kind of neat to hear about, but also kind of shows you this is why sometimes Microsoft

2845
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:56,320
walks out on stage and has a press conference that is TV, TV, TV, TV, and why Sony might

2846
02:25:56,320 --> 02:26:02,360
spend part of their E3 conference talking TV, TV, TV, because it is getting bigger.

2847
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:04,480
That's what these things do.

2848
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:10,600
And you know, another article I saw on this made the comparison to, oh, hey, remember

2849
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:14,800
the PlayStation 2 and why it did so well because it played DVDs.

2850
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:21,520
So game consoles being an all-in-one media box, definitely not a new thing.

2851
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:24,040
So let's see.

2852
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:28,440
Brad from Pod Culture says the biggest missing feature from Xbox One for me was the connection

2853
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:29,760
to Media Center.

2854
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:36,600
I comment from our chat over live.vognetwork.com along with Kane Shadow who says consoles is

2855
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:39,800
for media centers, not video games.

2856
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:42,280
Games are just the sideshow.

2857
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:43,280
That's it.

2858
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:46,440
This is a media box that happens to play games too.

2859
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,440
That's where we're headed.

2860
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:48,440
All right.

2861
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:52,380
Anyhow, that does it for our stories tonight.

2862
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:56,720
We are done with the stories, but that means now it's on to you guys and you can call us

2863
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:57,720
right now.

2864
02:26:57,720 --> 02:27:02,760
Our Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

2865
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:06,320
if there's something you want to give your thoughts on that we've talked about tonight

2866
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:11,840
or any other topic as well, maybe something we didn't get to, although I got to say just

2867
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:14,800
in trying to put together this week's show and everything, I was like, boy, it was kind

2868
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,240
of a slow news week.

2869
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:17,240
So I don't know.

2870
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:18,240
That's pretty slow.

2871
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:22,120
I don't know what we might have missed, but maybe you guys are on something that, you

2872
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:27,440
know, or maybe there's like a project we overlooked or a funny YouTube or something that you want

2873
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:30,160
to talk about or something else.

2874
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,160
Who knows?

2875
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:32,160
Let's get to it though.

2876
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:33,160
The phone is ringing.

2877
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:34,160
Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.

2878
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,160
Who's this?

2879
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,160
Hey, guys.

2880
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,160
It's Jason.

2881
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:38,160
Hey, Jason, buddy.

2882
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,160
How you doing?

2883
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:40,160
I'm doing pretty good.

2884
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:43,000
You are, but I understand you don't actually live in California.

2885
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Yeah.

2886
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,400
Well, after being on the show for like three months straight, you might think otherwise.

2887
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:48,400
Oh, come on.

2888
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:49,400
We love to have you here.

2889
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:50,600
What's on your mind, buddy?

2890
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:54,840
So you made a comment earlier when we were talking about the esports arena.

2891
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,800
I like the fact that I've adopted the royal we.

2892
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:59,000
Well, that's the intro for you.

2893
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,400
You made the comment when talking about the story about the esports arena, and you said

2894
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:08,960
that you feel that that should be getting put to use for things besides just gaming.

2895
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:15,480
I think you named us a couple of artists and actually like that kind of a performance.

2896
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:16,920
It was a little bit of a...

2897
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:21,960
Not a joke, but more of a, you know, just to kind of show like, you know, there are

2898
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:27,800
performers that do big arena shows that, you know, or the circus or Disney on ice or whatever

2899
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:30,520
else an arena is used for.

2900
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:35,640
And so I guess the question that I wanted to ask you though is, do you know how many

2901
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:42,000
like, as far as Korea is concerned and like the legitimate, for lack of a better word,

2902
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:46,360
esports circuit, do you know how many gaming events take place?

2903
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:50,160
Yes, but we're not on Korea's level yet.

2904
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:51,680
We're nowhere close to that.

2905
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,400
But when should we actually take those same steps?

2906
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:58,800
Well, I'm not saying that the gaming arena is like a bad thing or anything.

2907
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:03,960
I'm just surprised that they're not talking about a multipurpose arena, that this is like

2908
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:08,560
a gaming dedicated thing, because I wouldn't think that these huge gaming events happen

2909
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:10,000
365 days a year.

2910
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,280
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

2911
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:13,940
I think it is already there.

2912
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:17,920
And I think the fact that there is a dedicated venue for this, the problem is going to be

2913
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:23,160
like when you go to branch out into different games, how many like game facilities do they

2914
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:24,160
have?

2915
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:30,000
But like WCS, if I remember correctly, they stopped doing it in America.

2916
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:35,920
But there was some circuit that I was watching a Starcraft match in a New York tower that

2917
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:40,800
the view on stream, just like watch the players and then just look behind them, look out the

2918
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,800
window.

2919
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:42,800
Gorgeous view.

2920
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:45,800
They were like 50, 60 stories up in some New York tower.

2921
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:48,040
Anyways, it was good.

2922
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:51,600
You said something else about, you know, what would be, what's the problem or so forth.

2923
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:56,160
And I'm said, the problem is, and I'm going to get haters with this comment and I'm sorry,

2924
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:59,720
but the problem is it's in Ohio.

2925
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:04,080
But the only people that need to be there are the players.

2926
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:07,760
Like web streams are such that everybody can watch at home and it really doesn't matter

2927
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:18,560
where they have to fill the arena to not necessarily, not except for the biggest like finals events.

2928
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:21,400
So the, the point that I, the point that I was making about the New York tower thing

2929
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:26,140
is that I was watching at like three or four in the morning local.

2930
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:32,840
So it was what, 7am New York and it was a bunch of overseas players, which was even

2931
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:35,580
crazier for like jet lag purposes and all that kind of stuff.

2932
02:30:35,580 --> 02:30:39,540
But it was like crack of dawn first thing in the morning in a New York tower and American

2933
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,940
circuit Starcraft matches.

2934
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:48,200
So the, my counterpoint is that there is already enough content that with a dedicated space,

2935
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:55,160
they can put the facility to use for everything to be set up correctly and then just add concessions

2936
02:30:55,160 --> 02:31:00,800
and do everything else they need for the big grand arena, 16 player, semi-finals, quarter

2937
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:04,160
finals, finals kind of thing.

2938
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:05,160
I don't know.

2939
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,520
I mean, I get, we'll see.

2940
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:11,080
It's just an arena seems like such a big, big undertaking and I'm just, again, I'm just

2941
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:15,440
surprised we're talking about it only for gaming and not more of a community thing.

2942
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:20,720
But keep in mind too, here's where my perspective is that right now is that here in Sacramento,

2943
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:24,440
they have been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena.

2944
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:26,680
And this really doesn't have anything to do with gaming, but just to show you where

2945
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:31,240
my perspective is that they've been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena

2946
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:36,520
downtown and they threatened to move our only professional sports team, uh, ma major league,

2947
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:39,280
I should say, uh, the Sacramento Kings, part of the NBA, right?

2948
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:44,000
They threatened to move them to Seattle and they literally almost left because their current

2949
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,160
arena Arco arena is so, or whatever the fuck they call it now, but it's always be Arco

2950
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:52,080
arena to me, I guess they say is too damn old and falling apart or whatever.

2951
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:57,800
So basically the NBA strong armed the town into building a new arena, but they had to

2952
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:03,960
kind of be like, it's not just about basketball, it's going to be the downtown spot for all

2953
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:04,960
these events.

2954
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:07,840
So we're going to lure all these, you know, artists and concerts.

2955
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:11,880
So I guess that's why Jason, and at the end of the day, my head is that, how did the community

2956
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:15,680
let them build this fucking arena just for games?

2957
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:21,960
But again, 15 minutes outside of major city, Ohio and downtown Sacramento, I suppose are

2958
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,040
much different, but yeah, and there's a lot of other details like the fact that it may

2959
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:29,960
not be quite as big as a multipurpose arena.

2960
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:34,280
Um, and they may have to concede to do that in the future to let other events in and do

2961
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:36,420
that kind of thing just because it does make sense.

2962
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:44,080
But I, I, I don't follow esports, uh, esports games enough to say that I'm like gonna be

2963
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,880
a fan and support this kind of stuff.

2964
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:49,100
I'm hopeful for it for the people that do this kind of thing.

2965
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:55,260
There is enough gaming variety, variety out there that things can be happening very perpetually.

2966
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:58,660
Every first person shooter, every strategy game, special events.

2967
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:03,400
I mean, they could eat not, not even just esports, but just gaming events in general,

2968
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:11,220
like big, big debuts, uh, uh, uh, SDA speed run, uh, speed running events can take place

2969
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:12,220
there.

2970
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:17,120
Like the, the amount of content that's grown to such in the gaming world that a lot can

2971
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:22,460
be done with a dedicated, well-stocked, wired up venue, and I'm looking forward to that.

2972
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:26,360
You know, you won't really be seeing me getting on a plane to Ohio anytime soon to, to go

2973
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:30,280
to one of these events in person, unless they, they asked me to host one.

2974
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,040
Then I'd be, I'd be, I'd so be there.

2975
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:34,720
I'll be, I'll, I'll go to the Rock and Roll Museum.

2976
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,720
I will go to Cedar Point and take some selfies.

2977
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:40,840
You'll be hosting this event with none other than Richard Simmons.

2978
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:42,960
Oh my, I would die.

2979
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:43,960
He's my hero.

2980
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,360
I would, oh my God.

2981
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:51,480
I just, just, I could drop dead the next day and I would have lived a full life anyway.

2982
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:57,120
Why don't we have a Richard Simmons fitness video game?

2983
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:01,200
There's I, I was, you know, what got me the tweet on Twitter from Richard Simmons was

2984
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:04,320
I was asking, why doesn't Richard Simmons have a podcast?

2985
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:07,240
Because I would listen every day to a Richard Simmons podcast.

2986
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:09,880
And then my buddy Spike from Game Buoy said something to that.

2987
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:13,960
And then I think I replied to that just with just something general that was like, um,

2988
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:18,120
I just think Richard Simmons is motivated by what he really does for people and not

2989
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:19,640
like by money.

2990
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:24,320
And he, that's where Richard Simmons replied and said, thank you for your kind words, XO.

2991
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:27,840
So because they haven't made a microphone, they could keep up with him.

2992
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:28,840
Anyway.

2993
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:32,360
Um, well, Jason, thank you very much for the call.

2994
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:35,560
I'm going to let you go, but I just want to address one other thing you brought up, like

2995
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:38,440
just way in passing at the very beginning of your call and you probably didn't even

2996
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:41,920
mean to go here, but I just want to make sure I clear the air on something.

2997
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:47,100
I am totally fine with our callers using we that's totally fine because this is the

2998
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:51,400
show where every gamer has a voice and it is your show as well as our show.

2999
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:57,160
So when you call in and talk about, we talked about this or we, we did so we is fine anytime.

3000
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:58,160
We did.

3001
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,160
We, the community, we, the vogue.

3002
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:00,160
All right.

3003
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,160
Well now we're going to hang up on you.

3004
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,160
Absolutely.

3005
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,160
All right.

3006
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:04,160
Take care, buddy.

3007
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:05,160
Bye.

3008
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:06,160
One eight seven seven game OLR.

3009
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:08,400
Our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

3010
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:11,740
Uh, if you'd like to get through, I was going to read some tweets, but I wasn't really

3011
02:35:11,740 --> 02:35:18,460
seeing a whole lot on the Twitters this week, um, for questions or things like that.

3012
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:22,300
There's a lot of activity, but it was mostly just like some talking back and forth.

3013
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:25,380
That's how we got our guests for October 12th was through Twitter, but I'll talk more about

3014
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:26,380
that next week.

3015
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:29,340
Um, Oh, I did see one quick little tweet here.

3016
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:30,740
There's the one I wanted to see, uh, from red.

3017
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:35,420
The Hayes had tweeted us saying, uh, S sky and dark soccer and OLR.

3018
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:37,740
This sounds like up y'all's alley.

3019
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:42,780
F zero meets audio surf and it's a game called specter game.

3020
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:47,460
The only issue I had with it is that it's like only available for like systems.

3021
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:53,100
I don't have like Xbox one and windows phone, but I think it said it was coming to, um,

3022
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:55,300
iOS at some point as well in Android.

3023
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:56,300
So that's kind of cool.

3024
02:35:56,300 --> 02:35:58,080
And chip Zell does the music to it.

3025
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:01,020
And you honestly sold me right there because, uh, she's great.

3026
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:04,020
Like super hexagons, like one of the greatest soundtracks out there.

3027
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:06,300
But anyway, we are getting other calls, so let's get to it.

3028
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:07,300
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3029
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:08,860
Who is this?

3030
02:36:08,860 --> 02:36:09,860
Hey, it's Ron.

3031
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:10,860
What's up everyone?

3032
02:36:10,860 --> 02:36:11,860
Hey, uh, not much.

3033
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:12,860
How are you?

3034
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:13,860
I am good.

3035
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:14,860
Rob, get the coffee.

3036
02:36:14,860 --> 02:36:15,860
We got a dish.

3037
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:16,860
We got a dish.

3038
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:17,860
All right.

3039
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:18,860
Well, we're going to dish more.

3040
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:19,860
We've got to dish so much tonight.

3041
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:20,860
I love it.

3042
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:21,860
What are we dishing about?

3043
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:22,860
Okay.

3044
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:27,020
I don't know if you remember, but two years ago I called in and did my review of Otacon

3045
02:36:27,020 --> 02:36:33,000
and I talked about a particular fan game that was more or less based on the convention

3046
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:37,080
itself called crisis heart brawlers.

3047
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:41,720
I mean, you talk about a lot of cons on this show, but I do remember this whole talk about

3048
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,720
like a game.

3049
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:43,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3050
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,720
I sort of remember this.

3051
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:45,720
Yeah.

3052
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:46,720
Yeah.

3053
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:50,840
Well, they had a Kickstarter to raise the funds and an article popped up recently.

3054
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,120
Like where are they now?

3055
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:54,320
Like what's going on?

3056
02:36:54,320 --> 02:36:59,740
Evidently, they, I think they hit their funds with the Kickstarter, but you know, as with

3057
02:36:59,740 --> 02:37:06,400
most Kickstarters, when it comes to independent games, it's not enough to fill what they need

3058
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,520
to do.

3059
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:12,640
So pretty much, I think you have a pretty good idea where this went.

3060
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,160
Down the toilet?

3061
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,160
More or less.

3062
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:18,760
A couple of friends of mine who were voice acting in the game pretty much had to beg

3063
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:21,600
the studio to pay them pretty much.

3064
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:22,600
Wow.

3065
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:27,560
And when I had discussed this, a friend of a friend messaged me and pretty much told

3066
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:36,280
me before the Kickstarter, this guy who was behind the studio, he financially backed this

3067
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:38,880
guy to get some of these projects off the ground.

3068
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:46,400
Pretty much this guy, I like to call him a poor man Steve Jobs cross PT Barnum.

3069
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:47,400
Wow.

3070
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:52,840
Well, the good news is, good in quotes, is that these types of Kickstarters aren't really

3071
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:55,920
going to work in the future because you know, Kickstarter changed their terms of service

3072
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:02,660
like two weeks ago and it can't legally retroactively apply to old Kickstarters, but moving forward,

3073
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:07,500
people that donate to Kickstarters that don't get anything as a result will have the rights

3074
02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:11,260
to take legal action against the people that do the Kickstarter.

3075
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:17,140
So don't be going on Kickstarter planning to steal people's money because you're going

3076
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:18,140
to be hurting.

3077
02:38:18,140 --> 02:38:20,780
Yeah, that's what it boils down to.

3078
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:25,780
And I've dealt with a few Kickstarters in the past, you know, I've covered where it

3079
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:28,160
gets quiet, nobody knows what's going on.

3080
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:32,520
The people who backed it start raising hell and then the people behind the Kickstarter

3081
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:37,840
just miraculously show up out of nowhere and just start, this is what we're going to do,

3082
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:38,840
this is what we're going to do.

3083
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:42,620
And they start sending out the gifts, the prizes and everything.

3084
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:48,600
As for this one, he appeared to say the game is still in production, but that's the last

3085
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:49,600
of it.

3086
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:52,840
No gifts or anything have been passed out in between you and me.

3087
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:57,440
If I had Kickstarted at $500 to this, I'd be ready to hang somebody.

3088
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:59,880
But how's the convention doing in spite of all this?

3089
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:03,640
I mean, did it have any type of official blessing of the convention or no?

3090
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,640
They did.

3091
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:09,560
But because there was no updates or changes or anything, they've pulled out of the project

3092
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:16,800
so the game is now called Crisis Heart Brawlers instead of like Otakon or whatever, you know.

3093
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:21,080
The Otakorp felt that they didn't want to be attached to it because there has been no

3094
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:23,880
update and it kind of seems very unprofessional.

3095
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:24,880
It's vaporware.

3096
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:25,880
Yeah.

3097
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:31,200
Actually the person that told me this information, he pretty much believes it's going to be vaporware

3098
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:36,960
because the same issue I see with Kickstarter, when people Kickstart video games and other

3099
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:44,020
projects and so forth, I tell people, start small and build your way up.

3100
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:48,000
This guy started out big and wanted to keep going bigger.

3101
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,400
He was trying to do something, he was trying to pretty much one-up Scott Pilgrim versus

3102
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:53,160
the world of the game.

3103
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:58,200
Well now, what about what Loki's doing because you know Loki refuses to build a Pong clone.

3104
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:02,560
He's going big on his first project but of course, he hasn't taken a dime from anybody

3105
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,560
either.

3106
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:06,000
Well, that's okay because this is his own money, so hey.

3107
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,000
That's right.

3108
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
I would.

3109
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,760
I mean, it will definitely help but no, I haven't done a Kickstarter yet.

3110
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,160
I'm not saying that I wouldn't.

3111
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:14,240
I probably would actually.

3112
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:17,920
But you're waiting until you actually have something done and you want to Kickstart more

3113
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:19,760
like the publishing of the title is what I'm getting right now.

3114
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,360
Yeah, pretty much because I don't really need anything for the development because it's

3115
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:23,360
just my time.

3116
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:26,600
I'm not going to hire like people coders and stuff like that.

3117
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:31,280
I would need just, it's basically just music and any software that I have to pay for the

3118
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:32,280
licensing for.

3119
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:33,840
You should get Marisa to do narration for you.

3120
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:34,840
Well, yeah.

3121
02:40:34,840 --> 02:40:38,240
I was thinking her and I have another friend that does voice acting too, so I've got people

3122
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,240
lined up.

3123
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,240
I want to be in it.

3124
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:42,280
I can use my wacky morning DJ voice.

3125
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,280
That's fine.

3126
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:44,280
You're playing the Loki game.

3127
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:46,520
Hey, more talent the better, okay?

3128
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:47,520
I'm down with that.

3129
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:49,120
Otherwise, I don't want to tell the voice.

3130
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:54,440
Marisa is true talent, but you know, I'll make your flyers.

3131
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,440
Everybody excels in something.

3132
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,440
We'll do video game posters.

3133
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:57,440
Everybody excels in something.

3134
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,440
We can all help.

3135
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,440
I'll do cabinet art.

3136
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:00,440
There you go.

3137
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:01,440
All right.

3138
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,680
That sounds pretty cool because that was one of the main problems with this.

3139
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:08,200
This guy who wanted to make this, he has no software experience.

3140
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:09,560
He was just a rep.

3141
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:14,400
He was bringing people in to design this game based on his idea.

3142
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:15,560
Yeah.

3143
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:19,720
Well, it's going to be a lot harder to put those types of Kickstarters through in the

3144
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:20,720
future.

3145
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:21,720
That's for damn sure.

3146
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:22,720
That's good.

3147
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:23,720
All right.

3148
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:25,960
Well, Rama, I'm out of coffee now, so.

3149
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:30,360
Well, maybe Sailor Chibi Arthur can get you some.

3150
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:34,200
That thing has been posted to my Facebook wall three times now, but it's great.

3151
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:35,920
I believe in Sailor B.

3152
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:37,280
Me too.

3153
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:41,360
I would probably watch more Sailor Moon if it was the Golden Girls starring in it.

3154
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:42,460
Let's be real.

3155
02:41:42,460 --> 02:41:43,460
Not that I'm hating.

3156
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:50,980
I know you're not hating because once all the DVDs come out through Viz, you know Alan's

3157
02:41:50,980 --> 02:41:55,140
going to get them and he's going to sit you down and you're going to have a moon marathon.

3158
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:56,140
No, he'll be too busy playing.

3159
02:41:56,140 --> 02:41:57,140
I was going to be on the left.

3160
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:58,140
No.

3161
02:41:58,140 --> 02:41:59,140
Jamie's going to be on the right.

3162
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:00,140
You're going to be stuck in the middle.

3163
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:01,140
So enjoy.

3164
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:03,140
He'll be too busy playing Final Fantasy XIV.

3165
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:06,460
I'm still just going to kidnap Rob and sit him down with my Crunchyroll subscription.

3166
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:10,860
Now, I'm talking about the original 200 episodes, the classic, not Crystal.

3167
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:12,020
I like Crystal.

3168
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:15,300
I know, but I'm just saying the DVDs, I already have mine pre-ordered, so.

3169
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:21,020
I'm not bothering because I've actually still got my fan subs, if that says anything.

3170
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:23,100
I still have my raw copies.

3171
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:29,100
I still have my fan subs too, but I am really enjoying the dub so far, so I'm just-

3172
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,700
Refusal, refusal, refusal, refusal.

3173
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:31,900
All right, nerds.

3174
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:34,540
I'm ending this talk so we can get more calls.

3175
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:35,540
Pot Meets Kettle.

3176
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:36,540
Rob?

3177
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:37,540
Well, yeah.

3178
02:42:37,540 --> 02:42:38,540
Pot Meets Kettle?

3179
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:39,540
I know, right?

3180
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:41,540
Hey, did you go to the Hyrule Warriors thing at the Nintendo store?

3181
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,260
I would have, but there was something stopping me.

3182
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:45,260
It's called work.

3183
02:42:45,260 --> 02:42:46,260
Dope.

3184
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:47,260
Yes.

3185
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,740
Hate it when we get foiled by work.

3186
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:49,740
Yes.

3187
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:50,740
And one more thing before I get out of here.

3188
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:54,500
I know people have given me shit for this on my own Facebook, but a deal is a deal.

3189
02:42:54,500 --> 02:42:58,420
Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, 40 bucks at Target.

3190
02:42:58,420 --> 02:43:00,700
You can't beat that.

3191
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:03,540
I'm going to hold out and maybe the Steam version will be even cheaper.

3192
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:04,540
That's-

3193
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:08,220
I don't, like, the first one's like, what, 12 bucks on Steam right now?

3194
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:12,740
I have all three for the PS3, and much as I know everyone enjoys Steam, but I'd rather

3195
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:16,980
play a game like this in front of my 32-inch instead of my little inky dinky 21-inch.

3196
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:17,980
I completely understand.

3197
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:22,380
I like having my two monitors so that I can actually just jabber with people while I'm

3198
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:23,380
playing my game.

3199
02:43:23,380 --> 02:43:24,620
Everybody's got their thing.

3200
02:43:24,620 --> 02:43:25,620
And not hurt my hand.

3201
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:26,620
All right, Rom.

3202
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,620
I'm going to let you go.

3203
02:43:27,620 --> 02:43:28,620
Take care, buddy.

3204
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,620
You got it, bro.

3205
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:30,620
All right.

3206
02:43:30,620 --> 02:43:31,620
Anime Jam Session.

3207
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:32,620
Listen to it.

3208
02:43:32,620 --> 02:43:33,620
Or I'll kick you in the foot.

3209
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,620
I want to be on it again.

3210
02:43:34,620 --> 02:43:36,820
Listen to the show or else Mako-chan will come after you, and that's not going to be

3211
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,820
pretty.

3212
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:39,820
Ron-chan, I want to be on again.

3213
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:40,820
Working on it.

3214
02:43:40,820 --> 02:43:41,820
Kay.

3215
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:42,820
All right.

3216
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:43,820
Bye.

3217
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:44,820
Bye.

3218
02:43:44,820 --> 02:43:50,500
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3219
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:54,540
How about any- I don't- I doubt there is any, but I'm going to check with Loki anyway.

3220
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:56,060
Is there any last-minute stories?

3221
02:43:56,060 --> 02:43:57,060
No.

3222
02:43:57,060 --> 02:43:58,060
I had a feeling.

3223
02:43:58,060 --> 02:44:00,460
I have a last-minute statement.

3224
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:03,020
There's cake waiting for me at Becky's house.

3225
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,020
Where's my cake?

3226
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,580
You can come with me.

3227
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:06,660
I'm sure she'd give you cake.

3228
02:44:06,660 --> 02:44:09,100
I would, but I have to- It's pumpkin chocolate.

3229
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:14,660
I have to go pick up Alan, and I have to edit the show, and I have to take this phone call

3230
02:44:14,660 --> 02:44:17,180
because we've got at least one more call coming in.

3231
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,180
Let's get to it.

3232
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,180
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3233
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:20,180
Who's this?

3234
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:24,100
A seg enters OrangeLoungeRadio audio broadcast.

3235
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:26,460
I'll throw a pester ball.

3236
02:44:26,460 --> 02:44:27,460
Quick.

3237
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:28,460
Get up defensive shields.

3238
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:29,460
Red alert.

3239
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:32,460
Shucks, how are y'all doing?

3240
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:33,460
Great.

3241
02:44:33,460 --> 02:44:34,460
You know what?

3242
02:44:34,460 --> 02:44:35,460
I'll be here in person.

3243
02:44:35,460 --> 02:44:37,460
This is the next best thing, right?

3244
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,460
Yeah.

3245
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:43,180
I was even thinking this afternoon, like, you know, I wonder ... Nah, I shouldn't ... Oh,

3246
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:44,180
well.

3247
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:45,180
You're always welcome.

3248
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:47,180
Just try to let me know in advance because- No, I know.

3249
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:49,820
That's why I figured I didn't let you know in advance.

3250
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:50,820
Like, that's too late.

3251
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:52,180
Well, honestly- You've gone too far.

3252
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:54,900
If you'd told me this afternoon, I would have been like, sure, I ain't got anything going

3253
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:55,900
on tonight.

3254
02:44:55,900 --> 02:45:00,820
But anyway, seg, of all the many things you've commented on during the show tonight, I'm

3255
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:02,420
dying to know which one you called in about.

3256
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:03,420
What's up?

3257
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:12,820
Well, you know, just to bring back on home a little bit and to expand on that, first

3258
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:17,820
of all, I think it needs to be said that that was going on for five years?

3259
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:18,820
How long?

3260
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,820
It's been a while.

3261
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:25,180
And I think that's really a credit that it ran so long.

3262
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:32,140
Yes, because at least ... And I would credit Sony with that because Microsoft would have

3263
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:36,260
pulled the plug on it in nine months if their track record is any indication.

3264
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,260
Hello, game room.

3265
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:38,260
Hello, one versus 100.

3266
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:40,260
Hello, Kinect.

3267
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:46,420
Anyway, so I actually credit Sony a little more for believing in that, and that's a good

3268
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:47,420
thing.

3269
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:48,420
That's a good thing.

3270
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:49,420
Yeah, exactly.

3271
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:54,580
And what I don't like to necessarily just go, oh, it's closing, therefore it was bad,

3272
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:57,260
but try to learn from it.

3273
02:45:57,260 --> 02:46:03,660
And I think that's what we all should do is just celebrate what it was for all its good

3274
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:08,100
and bad and expand from it.

3275
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:11,620
And I don't think ... This is sort of something that was inevitable.

3276
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:16,140
As PlayStation 3s come off of the living room shelves and get replaced with PlayStation

3277
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:23,340
4s, the real question became not when is PlayStation Home going to disappear from PlayStation 3,

3278
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:26,060
but are they going to continue it on PlayStation 4?

3279
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:30,300
And unfortunately, it appears the answer is no if we're hearing about layoffs.

3280
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:33,780
Yeah, which is sad.

3281
02:46:33,780 --> 02:46:41,940
But at least with this, they know it's coming and it's schedulable, and they have five years

3282
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:46,660
to look, to point at, so ... Yes, and which you can't always do in the

3283
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:47,660
games industry.

3284
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:54,020
I mean, we hear all these stories every day about, oh, Microsoft just axed 8,000 people

3285
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:56,940
today.

3286
02:46:56,940 --> 02:47:00,740
So at least there's that sort of dignity with it, so that's really good.

3287
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:06,900
So the other pivot I want to make, and I know it's a little bit promotion-y, but there's

3288
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:13,620
a, well, actually a street fair for video games coming up, again, in the LA area called

3289
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:14,620
Indicade.

3290
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:16,100
Oh, I want to go to this so bad.

3291
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,100
Oh, please do.

3292
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:18,100
I can't.

3293
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:20,420
I'm literally in Vegas the very next week.

3294
02:47:20,420 --> 02:47:22,400
It's like this next weekend, right?

3295
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:27,160
What if I were to give you and your listeners a discount code for Indicade?

3296
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:28,440
Oh, you're killing me.

3297
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:29,440
You're killing me.

3298
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:32,440
Well, you can still get the listeners the code, because I know we have listeners in

3299
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:37,360
the LA area who would have a lot more realistic chance of going.

3300
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:46,040
So ICF14-FF-Love is the weird code.

3301
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,040
I love that.

3302
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:48,040
One more time.

3303
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,040
Warren, get your pen and paper, people.

3304
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:50,040
One more time.

3305
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:51,040
Yeah, it is ICF14-FF-Love.

3306
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:59,320
Love, I love it.

3307
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:04,960
And the reason is that I'm going to be back there again, and I'm going to be professional

3308
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:12,440
extrovert again for Squinky, because their follow-up, I don't know, it's not really a

3309
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:20,200
follow-up piece, but the piece that they worked on after dominating Palpomus is up for awards.

3310
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:27,760
It's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and thank you, chat, for typing in the code in

3311
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:29,240
chat.

3312
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:34,360
So it's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and it's an interactive performing arts piece

3313
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:43,880
featuring the Performatron, because Squinky really is good at naming things.

3314
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:53,600
And it's four people and whatever musicians decide to show up for it, and two people control

3315
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:59,000
the dialogue tree of a play that two other people are acting, and everyone has mobile

3316
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:04,220
devices that are picking the lines or reading the lines, and there's dynamic sheet music

3317
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:05,220
to it.

3318
02:49:05,220 --> 02:49:07,460
Oh, wait a minute, so this is like a multiplayer game?

3319
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:08,460
You could say that, yeah.

3320
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:13,000
Oh, this sounds, and it's mobile, like, we were just, again, you really have to listen

3321
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,160
to last week's show, because we talked about Fibbage with Jackbox Games, and they're doing

3322
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:21,440
the whole mobile phone thing, and after having played that, I was like, oh my god, like,

3323
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:25,040
why did it take this long for somebody to think to use a mobile phone as a controller?

3324
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:27,880
And now you're talking about this is now happening in the indie scene, too.

3325
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:28,880
Yep.

3326
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:29,880
Amazing.

3327
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:35,280
So, if you're going to pick one day, pick the Saturday, because of night games, which,

3328
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:41,040
so IndieCade is a street festival for video games, I think it has a lot more heavy of

3329
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:44,240
a film festival vibe as far as its structure.

3330
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:49,640
There's no films being shown there, but it has this sort of structure of a film festival,

3331
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:53,600
and that all the games there were selected to be there.

3332
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:59,320
It's not, I mean, there are a few sponsor booths, but the games that are there in general

3333
02:49:59,320 --> 02:50:00,320
didn't pay to get in.

3334
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:03,560
They were picked, they applied to and got picked to showcase.

3335
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:07,740
Yeah, it's very similar to a film festival, because I'm involved with a horror, even though

3336
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:10,280
I hate horror films, I'm still involved.

3337
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:14,480
I love cult films, and they kind of bleed together a little bit, pun intended.

3338
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:19,320
I'm involved with a horror film festival here in SAC, and it's a really big thing for NorCal,

3339
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:21,600
and it's a very similar process.

3340
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:22,600
Yes.

3341
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:28,480
So, during the day, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they're showing the selection, but

3342
02:50:28,480 --> 02:50:33,280
on Saturday night, they close out those games, and out come the night games.

3343
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:38,020
And I don't know what's going to be shown this year, except for one piece called Coffee

3344
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:46,500
and Misunderstanding, but games that are very much heavy installation pieces, or just have

3345
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:50,460
a lot of tech, or something strange and weird, get played.

3346
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:56,140
So if you go the Saturday, make sure you're going afternoon to play the stuff that's shown

3347
02:50:56,140 --> 02:51:03,940
in the daytime, and then night games after, which starts, I want to say eight, but look

3348
02:51:03,940 --> 02:51:07,500
on the website for the full details.

3349
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:10,420
If you see me there, please say hello.

3350
02:51:10,420 --> 02:51:15,100
I don't mind you pimping at all, because even though, sadly, it's not going to work out

3351
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:19,100
for me to go to LA, because I'm literally taking a trip the very next week already,

3352
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:23,380
I did go by the IndieCade booth at E3, they had a really big presence at E3 this year,

3353
02:51:23,380 --> 02:51:27,660
and it was one of my very favorites, because that was one of the only booths where I could

3354
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:30,260
just walk right up and talk to the person that made the game.

3355
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:35,980
You can't do that at any other booth at E3, and I don't care if your game is a triple

3356
02:51:35,980 --> 02:51:41,140
A, multi-billion dollar Destiny title, or if it's a small thing that was made in your

3357
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:44,860
basement, you know, is it fun?

3358
02:51:44,860 --> 02:51:49,880
And when I can talk to the people that made them and really feel that enthusiasm, it raises

3359
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:53,900
my enthusiasm tenfold.

3360
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:56,700
That's the great thing about something like this, with the street festival and everything,

3361
02:51:56,700 --> 02:52:00,420
is that you'll be able to walk up and talk to people who are enthusiastic about the game,

3362
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:02,740
like Sake says, he's a paid professional extrovert.

3363
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:10,860
Yes, and it's also, at least for IndieCade, it's such a refreshing vibe than, what I'll

3364
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:16,220
say, the conference, or the con scene, whether it be Comic-Con and all the various flavors,

3365
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:25,900
or PAX, or because there's a lot more non-game people that show up that really makes it a

3366
02:52:25,900 --> 02:52:30,220
different tone of a place that you don't get anywhere else, so I highly recommend it if

3367
02:52:30,220 --> 02:52:33,980
you're in the area, say hello.

3368
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:39,100
I hope Errol Flynn's always there.

3369
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:47,300
Which think PlayStation Move controllers in a, I think it was an 8x8 grid hanging from

3370
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:49,580
the ceiling.

3371
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:55,580
And then it's four players, you hold two of the controllers at the corners, that's where

3372
02:52:55,580 --> 02:53:01,340
everyone starts, and your PlayStation Move controller will show a color of the ones that

3373
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:05,580
you're holding, and everyone has one of four colors, and then one of them turns off, and

3374
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:09,740
there's another one somewhere in the grid that you have to, quote unquote, swing over,

3375
02:53:09,740 --> 02:53:15,740
it's not like American Gladiators where you're actually swinging, but you find your color

3376
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:20,980
and hold onto that one, and the moment you do, a few seconds later, the one that you

3377
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:27,220
were always holding turns off, and you have to find another one that has your color, and

3378
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:28,220
so on.

3379
02:53:28,220 --> 02:53:34,340
And then as the game progresses, the time in which to do that increases, and so eventually

3380
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:38,380
people lose and get dropped out, and the last person standing wins.

3381
02:53:38,380 --> 02:53:40,900
That sounds crazy expensive with all those Move controllers.

3382
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:48,380
Yeah, it's the same people who did, oh, I'm forgetting the name of it.

3383
02:53:48,380 --> 02:53:49,380
Sports Friends?

3384
02:53:49,380 --> 02:53:50,380
Is it Sports Friends?

3385
02:53:50,780 --> 02:53:51,780
Yeah, it's in Sports Friends.

3386
02:53:51,780 --> 02:53:57,780
Yeah, I know what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name of the game.

3387
02:53:57,780 --> 02:54:01,580
Yeah, the one with the fencing.

3388
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:04,780
You'll think of it as soon as you hit the hang-up button, it's a way to go.

3389
02:54:04,780 --> 02:54:05,780
Will do.

3390
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:10,340
All right, well, hey, so anybody in the LA area or even remotely close that's willing

3391
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:15,420
to take the drive, check it out, indicate, and even though I can't go myself, just based

3392
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:19,940
on what I've seen previously at E3 and so forth, your time will not be wasted, and you're

3393
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:23,540
going to find games you haven't heard about before, and I think that's such a refreshing,

3394
02:54:23,540 --> 02:54:24,540
great thing.

3395
02:54:24,540 --> 02:54:25,540
Yes.

3396
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:32,940
So, and if you see me there, say hello, try to not make it as creepy.

3397
02:54:32,940 --> 02:54:34,260
Say hi and don't be creepy.

3398
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:38,060
All right, Seg, thanks so much for calling in, I got to let you go so we can wrap up

3399
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:39,060
though.

3400
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:40,060
Yep, great hearing from you guys.

3401
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:41,060
It's John.

3402
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:44,260
It was Johan Sebastian Joust.

3403
02:54:44,260 --> 02:54:45,860
Yes, that's it.

3404
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:47,420
Oh, I've heard about that.

3405
02:54:47,420 --> 02:54:48,420
Okay.

3406
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:49,420
Or maybe it's Johan.

3407
02:54:49,900 --> 02:54:51,900
That was the night games way back in the day too.

3408
02:54:51,900 --> 02:54:52,900
Nice.

3409
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:56,300
All right, Seg, buddy, have fun and take lots of pictures because remember what they say,

3410
02:54:56,300 --> 02:54:57,300
pics or it didn't happen.

3411
02:54:57,300 --> 02:54:58,300
Yep, totally.

3412
02:54:58,300 --> 02:54:59,300
Take care of my friends.

3413
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:00,300
Except for things that don't need to happen.

3414
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:04,300
All right, take care, folks.

3415
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:06,300
All right, that's awesome that Seg's going to be at IndieCade.

3416
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:09,300
Well, I knew he was going to IndieCade, but I wish I could go.

3417
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:12,740
It sounds like fun, but, you know, too many road trips.

3418
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:17,660
I'm already going to LA in November for BlizzCon, which I know is really Anaheim, and the SoCal

3419
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:22,580
people get pissed off when I call Orange County, LA, but you know what, when you're driving,

3420
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:23,580
it's LA.

3421
02:55:23,580 --> 02:55:24,580
It's all just, it's one big blur.

3422
02:55:24,580 --> 02:55:25,580
It's LA.

3423
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:30,500
Anyway, that is going to do it for the Skype line, and that is really going to just about

3424
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:31,500
wrap up our show.

3425
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:34,420
In fact, Dark Soccer, she had to head out, so she's already out of here.

3426
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:37,780
So sadly, we will not get to hear her final thought, but I'm sure it has something to

3427
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:38,780
do with cake.

3428
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:41,140
I'm sure that's what her final thought was.

3429
02:55:41,140 --> 02:55:42,140
But we'll go around.

3430
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:43,940
Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?

3431
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:47,820
My final thought is, last week I work.

3432
02:55:47,820 --> 02:55:48,820
Wow.

3433
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:49,820
The last two days.

3434
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:51,540
Well, technically, I'm not working.

3435
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:57,060
I'm just showing up at work to clean my desk and eat pizza and whatever breakfast donuts

3436
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,860
that they bring in and then program in my game.

3437
02:55:59,860 --> 02:56:01,740
So I'm going to get lots of work done on my game.

3438
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:04,900
Well, I'm going to apply for jobs too, but I'm also going to get lots of work done on

3439
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:12,260
my game in this time that I have off because I'm going to be home with the baby for most

3440
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:15,420
of the week, and then he's going to be going to daycare for the rest of it.

3441
02:56:15,420 --> 02:56:19,220
And so, yeah, I'm just going to...

3442
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:22,660
But if you have a job lead for Loki, local people, if you have a job lead for Loki, let

3443
02:56:22,660 --> 02:56:23,660
us know.

3444
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:24,660
Email the show.

3445
02:56:24,660 --> 02:56:25,660
Customer service!

3446
02:56:25,660 --> 02:56:28,520
As long as it's not fucking direct sales, because I've gotten contacted, I am not going

3447
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:31,140
door to door or in a parking lot or something like that.

3448
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:35,740
If your only experience with Loki is this show, you may not believe that he's great

3449
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:39,660
with customer service, but think of this show as a release.

3450
02:56:39,660 --> 02:56:41,860
He really is good with the customer service stuff.

3451
02:56:42,700 --> 02:56:45,380
He had his job for a very long time and was very good at what he did.

3452
02:56:45,380 --> 02:56:46,380
Fourteen and a half years.

3453
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:47,380
Oh my God.

3454
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:48,380
Well, you know what?

3455
02:56:48,380 --> 02:56:50,460
In the distribution industry, what are you going to do?

3456
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:51,460
You know what?

3457
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:52,780
It'll lead to something better.

3458
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:53,780
It really will.

3459
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:54,780
Something with advancement.

3460
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:55,780
All right.

3461
02:56:55,780 --> 02:57:00,020
And my final thought for tonight is, oh my gosh, I don't know.

3462
02:57:00,020 --> 02:57:01,440
I don't really have a final thought.

3463
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:06,480
My final thought is I'm going to IKEA to get this thing a stand to sit on so I can take

3464
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:09,740
pictures of it and put it online and everybody can oogle this arcade cabinet.

3465
02:57:09,740 --> 02:57:10,740
That'll be awesome.

3466
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:11,740
Not yet.

3467
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:14,620
In fact, the way I'm going to be working on it is a marquee.

3468
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:16,900
I'll put my hand over the marquee so people can't see it.

3469
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:17,900
I'll make a new marquee.

3470
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:19,260
A new marquee looks awesome.

3471
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:22,060
I just haven't figured out what else to put in the background because I have some DDR

3472
02:57:22,060 --> 02:57:26,740
arrows in there, but it's very much like a, was it a Street Fighter cross Tekken?

3473
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:29,060
But it's minimalist is okay.

3474
02:57:29,060 --> 02:57:30,060
You don't have to go crazy.

3475
02:57:30,060 --> 02:57:31,060
I know.

3476
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:32,060
I understand.

3477
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:35,500
I may take the DDR arrows and just do a gradient and then print.

3478
02:57:35,500 --> 02:57:36,500
And then...

3479
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:37,500
Talk to Cody.

3480
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:38,500
That guy's great with graphics.

3481
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:39,500
Jamie's good too.

3482
02:57:39,500 --> 02:57:40,500
They probably got a lot of...

3483
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:41,500
Can I say something real quick?

3484
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:46,700
Just to replace the, cause right now it says, you know, my company's name, was it a games

3485
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:49,780
arcade in there and it has, it's got a really cool background.

3486
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:53,420
I wish I'd saved it cause then I could just remove our company logo out of it and just

3487
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:54,580
put this.

3488
02:57:54,580 --> 02:57:56,500
But the new one's pretty cool too.

3489
02:57:56,500 --> 02:58:00,300
And I was like, I was all, damn, do I have colored buttons that match that?

3490
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:04,500
Because that would have been cool to do the orange and the purple buttons, but I don't.

3491
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:05,500
Oh well.

3492
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:06,500
Oh well.

3493
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:09,380

02:58:33,940 --> 02:58:38,060
We will be back next week with another episode to recap the week's news.

3504
02:58:38,060 --> 02:58:41,180
Smash Brothers 3DS will be out by then, so I'm sure we're going to have a lot of chatter

3505
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:42,180
with that.

3506
02:58:42,180 --> 02:58:43,900
Maybe some matches during the show.

3507
02:58:43,900 --> 02:58:44,900
Who knows?

3508
02:58:44,900 --> 02:58:49,180
Uh, we'll be talking about the destiny patch and is the loot system bearable.

3509
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:53,160
We'll find out next week on another episode of orange lounge radio.

3510
02:58:53,160 --> 02:58:54,160
See you then.

3511
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:55,160
