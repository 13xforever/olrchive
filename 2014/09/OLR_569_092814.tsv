14000	16800	This week, two massively multiplayer experiences are fading away.
16800	19480	Sony announced that PlayStation Home will be shut down next year, and Blizzard revealed
19480	22000	that their next MMO, Codename Titan, is no more.
22000	24960	The news is not all bad, and we'll tell you about it right now on the show, where every
24960	27500	gamer has a voice.
27500	31500	Orange Lounge Radio
31500	34980	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34980	36340	where every gamer has a voice.
36340	43320	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, September the 28th, 2014, with episode
43320	48380	number 569 of our program.
48380	55740	That is right, it has been 500 shows since the infamous episode 69, where Techmaster
55740	61700	Loki right over there did karaoke with Karaoke Revolution and sang, in fact I just got a
61700	69460	tweet about this earlier this week, where somebody said, I cannot listen to Gloria Gaynor
69460	70460	did that song right?
70460	71460	I'm Coming Out.
71460	74900	I cannot hear that song anymore without, was it Donna Summer, I don't even know.
74900	80220	I cannot hear that, thank you DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
80220	85020	I cannot hear that song anymore without hearing Loki actually singing the changed lyrics in
85020	86020	my head.
86020	87020	I'm sorry.
87020	88740	You've ruined music forever.
88740	95980	Yes, I think as soon as I open my mouth to sing that song against my will, yeah.
95980	103700	Alright so what, what'd I do?
103700	109540	If we're tangled, can I be Flynn Rider, alright, and I don't know why they're not hearing you
109540	110540	for some reason.
110540	111540	Are you?
111540	112540	How about now?
112540	114020	Yeah, you weren't talking into it I don't think.
114020	115020	Maybe.
115020	117700	Alright, well, you know it is a live program.
117700	119500	We have all those live problems.
119500	122420	So of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
122420	123420	Eastern.
123420	127620	The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
127620	132700	My name is Rob Roberts and as introduced a moment ago, she is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
132700	133700	Yep.
133700	135220	And he is Tech Master Loki.
135220	136540	Yep.
136540	137940	Welcome back to the show by the way DarkSakura.
137940	138940	Thank you.
138940	143340	I know you've been extremely busy with all your cubes and techs type of things that you
143340	144380	do.
144380	147020	So hopefully things are calming down a slight bit for you.
147020	148020	No, they're not.
148020	149020	They're not at all.
149020	150020	But you're here.
150020	151020	But I'm here.
151020	156180	Well, I had also worked like 37 hours and three days right before that and then had
156180	158220	worked that morning.
158220	162660	Came home, passed out, woke up with a raging headache and no voice.
162660	165340	So it's a bummer because you missed, you missed a fun show last week.
165340	168520	I don't know if you had a chance to hear it yet, but we had the general manager, Mike
168520	170100	from Jackbox Games was here.
170100	175340	It was kind of a fun little party game reflection episode with you don't know Jack and Fibbage
175340	176340	and all that stuff.
176340	177340	It was a good time.
177340	178340	As they say, c'est la mort.
178340	179340	I know it happens.
179340	180340	It happens.
180340	182980	Uh, but you, well, we have some, we have at least one more interview coming up.
182980	185100	I'm trying to get a couple others for the end of the year.
185100	188100	So don't, don't get sick anymore DarkSakura cause you don't know what you're going to
188100	189100	miss.
189100	190100	Okay.
190100	192260	But, but, but, but you know what?
192260	193260	But what?
193260	194860	They gave us pizza at work and it was awesome.
194860	195860	I don't know.
195860	196860	Pizza.
196860	197860	Pizza.
197860	198860	Sorry.
198860	199860	Pizza.
199900	201540	Mr. Loki, how have you been?
201540	203060	I've been okay.
203060	204060	Yeah.
204060	206540	So I'm trying to break an addiction.
206540	207540	Okay.
207540	210620	I know where, I know where we get into, how is it down the pipe?
210620	213340	I know we're getting to how is your gaming week a little later in the show, but this
213340	214340	is too good.
214340	216340	You have to tell us about your latest addiction.
216340	219180	Oh, it was just, I'm pretty, I think I'm over it.
219180	222060	I even cheated just to try to get it over with quicker.
222060	228060	But um, I, I unfortunately ran across one of the random articles that were floating
228060	233140	around on a bunch of different websites talking about a game called clicker heroes sitting
233140	234140	at work.
234140	236140	You know, this is at the point they've already shut down our system.
236140	237420	I literally can't do anything.
237420	239940	I'm like, I'm going to sit here and program on my computer.
239940	242940	Oh wait, what's this article clicker here is okay.
242940	243940	I'll play this for a second.
243940	246580	Oh, this is kind of like cookie clicker.
246580	249060	And three hours later that was that.
249060	255380	And then I come home like, okay, that was so that was fun, but I'm not gonna play here.
255380	256380	Click click click click.
256380	258100	It's like, it's like, God damn it.
258100	261700	No, I'll play it for another five minutes.
261700	262700	And yeah.
262700	265460	And they were like, see, cause the game plays itself when you're not playing it.
265460	266460	Yeah.
266460	269740	So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check in and see how much my clicking's going when
269740	271420	I'm not there with my auto clicks.
271420	272420	Yeah.
272420	273420	That cookie clicker shit's addicting.
273420	277020	And it really blows my mind that they don't have an official iPhone app.
277020	280720	I mean there's like 10,000 knockoffs in the store and I'm sure this is the same thing
280720	281720	on Android.
281720	283740	I just happened to be a iPhone user myself.
284420	289140	So I see that there's like 10,000 of these cookie clicker clones and, and, and then all
289140	290140	this other crap too.
290140	294900	Like the one that I've played will advertise for sushi clicker, which you just tap on.
294900	297220	It's the same fucking thing, but it's just sushi.
297220	299420	And then like all this other lame crap too.
299420	303780	This one's a little bit different because you're not just like tapping to like generate
303780	304780	stuff.
304780	305900	You're basically killing monsters.
305900	309820	And so each monster has certain HP and every five levels you get a boss monster that you
309820	311380	have to kill in a certain timeframe.
312100	315400	If you're not, you don't have enough DPS going into it.
315400	319380	You have to almost sounds like theater them except theater them set to music.
319380	320380	Yeah.
320380	325220	Uh, and so if you don't have enough, um, you know, DPS and damage with your clicks and
325220	327540	stuff, you have to kind of grind a little bit.
327540	331060	But um, you know, the game will play itself when you're not playing it.
331060	336100	And um, yeah, and they just get kind of addicting, I guess.
336100	339060	Going to some of our comments in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
339060	344500	Ssj100matt says, I know people who have laptops solely dedicated to cookie clicker, just constantly
344500	345500	running.
345500	347060	Well, see this, you don't even have to have it constantly running.
347060	349020	You can save your game if you want.
349020	351940	And then when you don't want to play it, you just close it and forget about it and come
351940	352940	back like later on.
352940	356820	And cookie clicker did the same thing where even if you're not there, the auto click still
356820	357820	clicks for you.
357820	358820	I thought that was the thing.
358820	359820	Oh, I don't know.
359820	360820	I don't know.
360820	361820	Anyway.
361820	363720	Uh, and then an anonymous chatter in our chat room says, I'm surprised Loki isn't addicted
363720	366220	to all those weird clash of clan esque games.
366220	371300	No, I keep seeing the stupid advertisements on like my Reddit app on my phone and stuff.
371300	375780	And uh, I was showing my son, uh, angry birds today or not angry birds, uh, flappy bird
375780	379260	because he thought it was funny to tap the button once and watch the bird head plant
379260	380260	into the ground.
380260	383260	So he just did that like for about five minutes.
383260	388620	But uh, yeah, it just keeps seeing the advertisements for the clash of clans things and not, there
388620	395980	was like, was I was picking him up from, um, Oh God, from, uh, his like, uh, my gym thing.
395980	398540	It's like kind of this thing where they go and play and stuff.
398540	401660	But the people that were there, like the people that watch the kids and stuff we're talking
401660	402660	about is it?
402660	403660	Yeah.
403660	404660	I'm a total gamers.
404660	408060	Like my clans doing this stuff and I'm like thinking, Oh, you've like play call of duty
408060	409060	or something.
409060	410500	You know, I'll play clash of clan.
410500	414900	What's the, all the, all the ads I see for that fricking game, it kind of actually turns
414900	415900	me off.
415900	416900	I don't know.
416900	420460	It's like the same reason I don't watch game of thrones or breaking bad or whatever.
420460	425860	Other TV show gets super hyped up because everybody always talks nonstop about how amazing
425860	426860	these programs are.
426860	427860	And it just, I don't know.
427860	432980	It's just, it's that inherent two year old in me that just goes like, well then no, no.
432980	436220	Like every time I've tried, every time anyone said, this show is awesome.
436220	437220	This is awesome.
437220	438220	And I've sat down to watch it.
438220	439220	I've been like bored now.
439220	440220	Yeah.
440220	441400	Except for supernatural.
441400	444640	And then I don't know why, but I start, you don't know what you've done.
444640	445640	What did tiger call it?
445640	447340	You just ruined so much productivity.
447340	449700	Oh, somebody asked in the chat, what game is it?
449700	451700	And tiger call linked at clicker heroes.com.
451700	454860	Oh no, I said it.
454860	455860	Save yourself.
455860	456860	Just don't do it.
456860	458000	Don't click on it.
458000	461900	Orange lounge radio, ruining lives, ruining lives.
461900	465020	Uh, Brad from pod culture says, doctor who?
465020	469020	That is one of the shows that despite all the hype, I will still have to bring myself
469020	470020	to watch at some point.
470020	472300	Cause I did watch a little bit of it and I did enjoy it.
472300	477300	I've seen some ninth doctor, but I've been watching it since I was four.
477300	478700	Have you watched a lot of the new ones though?
478700	480860	I didn't think you were on top of the new ones.
480860	483740	I just haven't been watching this season yet.
483740	486020	Just because I've been too busy and haven't had time, but that's okay.
486020	489940	Cause that means you can binge watch it later if I feel like it and bringing bad is actually
489940	490940	supposed to be pretty good.
490940	494440	I've only watched the first couple of seasons, but it wasn't that great.
494440	498160	The first couple of seasons by here gets really good and there's only a finite amount of shows.
498160	499160	So when you're done, you're done.
499160	503180	I mean, it's not like game of thrones, which is still has new several seasons coming or
503180	506360	you know, a doctor who breaking bad bored the fuck out of me.
506360	511100	I try not to watch new shows because then they get canceled and I get really pissed
511100	515180	off that I invested myself into these shows that end on these cliffhangers.
515180	520620	But because I like Batman, I did watch Gotham this week, which for me is like a really big
520620	523620	deal that I sat down and I watched a TV drama.
523620	527180	I never do that, but I did watch Gotham this week and it was, there were things I liked
527180	530940	and things I didn't like, you know, I didn't, I didn't hate it as much as a lot of people
530940	536900	on Twitter sure seem to, but it had some issues including 5,000 cameos that didn't need to
536900	539940	all be in the first 30 minutes of the show.
539940	544100	But okay, it's a pilot, it's trying to get people in, let's see what happens in the next
544100	545100	week or whatever.
545100	548340	But anyway, we're not here to talk about TV, we're here to talk about video games.
548340	552360	So let's start off with a kickoff topic and then we'll talk about our gaming weeks.
552360	556140	This week's kickoff topic, auto invoke a lot of memories.
556140	562180	We like walking down memory lane for our kickoff topic and believe it or not, we're celebrating
562180	568620	this week a gaming company that turned 125 years old.
568620	575340	That's right, Nintendo is the company that was founded September 23, 1889 by Fuzajiro
575340	576340	Yamauchi.
576340	583060	Nintendo, of course, they haven't been making game consoles since 1889, but similar, you
583060	588220	didn't have game consoles in the 1800s, but you did have playing cards and that is what
588220	589820	Nintendo started with.
589820	594580	They made specifically Hanafuda playing cards and I'm sure if you've read up on Nintendo,
594580	596980	you know this, that that was where their past was.
596980	600660	Or if you were a big Ranma fan, you know what Hanafuda is.
600660	605340	They also did some Disney cards when they had an agreement with Walt Disney because
605340	608420	Disney was also or is also really big in Japan.
608420	611320	So that type of partnership does very well.
611320	616820	Playing card sales started declining in the early 60s and then they eventually, I didn't
616820	622700	even, I did not know this about Nintendo, they had a taxi service and a love hotel chain.
622700	623700	What?
623700	624700	I didn't know that.
624700	625700	Awesome.
625700	626700	That is awesome.
626700	627700	That's good.
627700	628700	Those are, those.
628700	629700	They still have love hotels in Japan.
629700	636340	But the, but the love hotel is an IP that Nintendo needs to bring to the Wii U.
636340	639340	That should be the name of the next console, the Nintendo love hotel.
639340	643780	Love hotel taxi, playing card.
643780	649100	Anyway, and as we all know, obviously Nintendo eventually got into gaming technology.
649100	652860	You know, they had the game and watches and eventually the Famicom came out and I think
652860	654620	y'all know what happened from there.
654620	658560	So yeah, there it is, 125 years of Nintendo.
658560	662740	I thought I'd go around the room and just ask, you know, what, what is a favorite Nintendo
662740	663740	memory of yours?
663740	666740	Do you have a favorite Nintendo memory?
666740	671300	And for me, I mean, Nintendo is really the reason I'm probably into video games as much
671300	672300	as I am.
672300	677780	Granted, I started on Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 after that, but Nintendo really seemed
677780	682860	to kind of penetrate the marketplace in a way that those other two things hadn't, or
682860	688480	at least pop culture maybe, and that's probably, you know, thanks in big part to games like
688480	694260	Super Mario Brothers and Zelda that were so iconic that created characters that a little
694260	698780	yellow box in adventure on the 2600 just couldn't really do in the same way.
698780	703340	So you know, everybody at school was talking about Zelda and it's like, I had to have a
703340	704940	Nintendo entertainment system.
704940	706180	And so I got good grades.
706180	709620	My mom said she would buy me with Rab, not going to buy you a Nintendo because it'll
709620	712900	get bad grades, but Rab, if you get straight A's, I'll buy you Nintendo.
712900	714780	So I got straight A's and I got Nintendo.
714780	718700	You just convinced her that, hey, then, you know, there's that Donkey Kong teaches math.
718700	719700	You're right.
719700	720700	Yeah.
720700	721700	Right.
721700	722700	Well, she kind of knew that was a line.
722700	723700	It's edutainment.
723700	725820	Keep in mind, I already had a 2600 at this point, a Commodore 64, so she already saw
725820	728120	how games would ruin me.
728120	733840	But I got good grades and got my Nintendo and, you know, it actually, despite all the
733840	739460	bullying that I went through when I was younger, Nintendo was kind of the one thing that sometimes
739500	744180	kept me cool, meaning like even the bullies who would make fun of me in my face when they
744180	748940	would see me alone later would be like, so like, where's the fourth level in the second
748940	751260	quest on Zelda?
751260	755080	And you know, of course you want to be nice so you don't get bullied anymore.
755080	759580	So I'd tell them, do the video game tips and that kind of helped keep me afloat for a little
759580	760860	while in school.
760860	765620	So thanks Nintendo for making the bullying a little less severe in elementary school
765620	768940	through deep knowledge of your games.
768940	772780	Jamie, what's some Nintendo memories from you?
772780	777660	Um, trying to get my mom out of my room so I could play it.
777660	781300	It's like, mom, this is mine.
781300	783340	Mind you, my mom had me at 17.
783340	785500	So imagine the age gap, right?
785500	789820	My mom was a twenties, thirties year old gamer.
789820	790820	She played everything.
790820	796980	So I'd be like, um, mom, I'd like to play my Nintendo now, please leave private time,
796980	799140	mom, private time.
799140	801660	I want to beat this level now.
801660	808460	And so, and a cutthroat, uh, Dr. Mario, would you play Dr. Mario with your mom?
808460	810300	Not with my mom, with my little sister.
810300	811300	Oh really?
811300	812300	Cutthroat.
812300	814460	I was really good at that game.
814460	822700	Meaning the loser gets operated on and I just, I don't know cause it was, it was sort of
822700	825740	like the whole girls don't play games like, yes we do.
825740	826740	Shut up.
827500	830260	So I, I was just, it was my thing.
830260	832460	I, my friends all had one.
832460	838180	I begged and begged and begged and I got one and the rest was history.
838180	840260	I'd already had my Coleco vision though.
840260	842180	I liked my Coleco vision.
842180	844220	Uh, Loki, any Nintendo memories from you?
844220	848580	I just remember when I got mine, um, you know, my parents got it for me.
848580	855900	Everyone else already had one and I had a Coleco vision with like 47 games, which my
855900	861300	dad got and see, here's the things like, he's not really a gamer, he says, yes, but
861300	866140	you were the one that owned a Coleco vision system with all the, all the possible accessories
866140	870580	you can fucking get for this thing and like 40 some games for it.
870580	871580	Yeah.
871580	872580	You weren't a gamer.
872580	873580	Right.
873580	877860	You know, and my grandparents too, they had, uh, like an Atari 2600, I wonder if they still
877860	878860	have that.
878860	883660	Um, so I don't know, maybe they got it when he may have actually purchased that stuff
883660	887060	and, um, you know, they were clearing everything out, you know, back, back during the crash.
887060	888540	But anyways, they got it for me.
888540	893440	Um, I remember it was running, uh, the legend of Zelda when I got it and they had set it
893440	894440	up in my room.
894440	899700	And so first three games I had were the legend of Zelda breakthrough and bubble bubble.
899700	902700	And that was awesome.
902700	906500	It's funny you guys talk about like your parents being involved with the gaming because mine
906500	908420	were so disconnected from gaming.
908420	911780	Like my dad, even though my dad was kind of a nerd, he was always way more of a computer
911780	915780	nerd and I don't think he really understood video games as much and he didn't really like
915780	918180	they got in the way of his TV watching.
918180	921780	So it'd be like, get off the TV so I can watch the news or whatever it is.
921780	922780	Well, that's the thing.
922780	926340	It's like after, you know, you have those systems, like you kind of just, I don't know,
926340	928260	I guess he got out of it or something.
928260	929260	Yeah.
929260	933020	And then my mom, she was always, I don't know, she, she thought it was stupid and the only
933020	936780	stuff she would like to play and do remember, and I've told this about my mom on the show
936780	939460	before, she would never touch the controller.
939460	944500	Like the controller was diseased to her, but she would enjoy playing things like, um,
944500	950420	family feud, jeopardy, wheel of fortune, or she would bark at me what to do.
950420	951980	So we would play wheel of fortune.
951980	953180	She'd be like, all right, spin the wheel.
953180	956380	And then if I landed on a bankrupt, she'd be like, you didn't spin it the right way
956380	958140	or something, you know, or whatever.
958140	959140	Let's push the button.
959140	960140	Yeah, exactly.
960140	961140	Right.
961140	962140	All right.
962140	964940	Guess an E. And then, you know, then I would, I would guess the answer to the puzzle.
964940	968860	She'd be like, how do you know that you're cheating.
968860	970740	So anyway, that was, that was some of my memories.
970740	976780	Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I grew up on the NES
976780	978140	around the time when it first came out.
978140	979220	I was with my uncle at the time.
979220	983500	I'll never forget the first time I saw him playing super Mario brothers, uh, SSG at 100.
983500	986260	Matt says, my mom would sneak into my room while I was asleep in the middle of the night
986260	988060	and play Tetris and super Mario brothers.
988060	990900	My mom can still out speed run me and super Mario brothers.
990900	991900	That's awesome.
991900	998980	Um, Visaya925 says, Nintendo made gaming popular like Apple made smartphones popular.
998980	1005380	Uh, definitely that pop culture phenomenon, I think in, in a way, uh, that those two things
1005380	1006940	kind of have in common.
1006940	1010940	Um, Dungeon Busters says, I remember someone bringing a dot matrix printout of the companies
1010940	1012660	that were making games for the NES.
1012660	1016900	I called up Vic Tokai's office to find out more about their games and the guy who would
1016900	1020900	probably come straight from Japan answered the phone as best as he could in English.
1020900	1027380	Um, Loco Poco says, I remember being a huge TMNT fan and my parents got me a super Nintendo
1027380	1030540	just for Ninja turtle tournament fighters for my birthday.
1030540	1032780	I have the Japanese version of that one.
1032780	1036900	And Tiger Claw says, remember the time when you had an NES and this was way before the
1036900	1041740	internet, you read through some gaming magazines looking for codes or buying a VHS tape that
1041740	1044260	contains some gameplay tips and codes.
1044260	1047660	One of my questions was in Nintendo power once years and years ago.
1047660	1049260	One of my tips was in Nintendo power.
1049260	1050260	Was it really?
1050260	1055060	It was the, uh, mega, uh, how to get through mega man three with no life bar where you
1055060	1058420	know how to do the double jump, the extra high jump in mega man three, where you have
1058420	1063140	someone hold the other controller and hold a left and right at the same time.
1063140	1068700	Well, if you jump down a hole while you're holding that, let go and then hold it again,
1068700	1069700	you'll die.
1069700	1072820	And then you can jump back up out of the hole and you have no life bar.
1072820	1075700	You have to use special weapons the whole time.
1075700	1079420	But if you touch it, you know, a life thing, then your life will fill up and it's over.
1079420	1082500	But you're basically a undead mega man.
1082500	1086340	I think, I remember my question was about the game legacy of the wizard, which I don't
1086340	1088860	know if you guys have ever played this on the Nintendo entertainment system, but it's
1088860	1089860	fucking hard.
1089860	1091500	That game was really hard.
1091500	1096460	And um, it was a kind of like a side scroller adventure game, uh, where you played all the
1096460	1097620	members of a family.
1097620	1102740	Like you could even play as their pink pet, which it made sense at the time.
1102740	1103740	Just roll.
1103740	1106540	It looked like Kirby, honestly, like they had a pet Kirby.
1107460	1108460	And that game was so hard.
1108460	1112180	And I think my question was something about what were the key, what order do you collect
1112180	1113180	the keys?
1113180	1115100	Because it was, Oh my God, that game was so hard.
1115100	1117620	Like looking back on it, like I don't think I ever beat it the right way.
1117620	1119540	I think I had to use cheat codes to do it.
1119540	1122540	If anybody else remembers that game, you probably know what I'm talking about.
1122540	1126380	But Nintendo used to be very good at answering all of their fan mail.
1126380	1129100	Like I probably wrote Nintendo like five letters over the years.
1129100	1132820	And every time I got back, like it was, it was definitely like a form letter, but the
1132820	1136540	middle portion, like somebody would write that would respond to whatever my question
1136540	1137540	was.
1137540	1140700	And then it would be like, you know, in the future, consider calling our 900 number for
1140700	1142260	game hotline tips.
1142260	1143260	This is cheaper.
1143260	1147740	I've done that a couple of times actually when I was a kid, I asked permission.
1147740	1150780	My mom specifically said, you cannot call the 900 number.
1150780	1151780	Why don't you write them a letter?
1151780	1155660	Yeah, I, I, yeah, I called the nine number number once and that was because I bought
1155660	1158940	a used copy of star tropics without the manual in it.
1158940	1161900	So I was unable to dip the envelope in the water.
1161900	1165820	And so I was like, I can't figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to do here.
1165820	1167620	You know, it says, dip the envelope.
1167620	1169260	I don't have an envelope in my inventory.
1169260	1171220	I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.
1171220	1174860	And then so I had to call them up and they're all, well, you just have to dip the envelope,
1174860	1178940	you know, in the manual, you know, and I'm like, well, I bought the game used at a flea
1178940	1180160	market.
1180160	1184460	I don't know exactly what they were trying to, and they're like, alright, code six, seven
1184460	1185460	67.
1185460	1191460	So I thought it was seven 47, 47, an airplane, seven 47.
1191500	1194180	So, so yeah, I had to do that.
1194180	1195860	I was like, sweet, I can be the game now.
1195860	1200100	It's like the ancient form of copy protection and how to, how to prevent used game sales.
1200100	1201100	Nintendo was onto it.
1201100	1202900	Well, I don't think it was to prevent used game sales.
1202900	1206300	I think it was just, they just thought it was a cool thing in there and you know.
1206300	1207300	Do you now?
1207300	1208300	Yes.
1208300	1209300	Do you now?
1209300	1210300	Cause I don't know.
1210300	1211300	I mean.
1211300	1212740	Why haven't we seen star tropics come back?
1212740	1215020	Cause that was a pretty awesome Nintendo game.
1215020	1217100	It was, you know, and there was a star tropics too.
1217100	1218100	I know, but it was on Nintendo.
1218100	1219300	It was like the next to last.
1219300	1220300	So does revenge.
1220340	1222340	That was like the next to last game on the NES.
1222340	1225740	I'm surprised we haven't seen like, I mean, wasn't that a first party Nintendo game?
1225740	1229300	Uh, if not first then second cause Nintendo in house.
1229300	1232700	That would be awesome to see like that dude come back for like smash brothers or something
1232700	1234420	like his yo-yo type thing or something.
1234420	1237100	I'm sure he's an assist in one of the games or something.
1237100	1238100	He's gotta be.
1238100	1240220	Maybe, maybe it was second party though.
1240220	1243140	It might've been, did H A L H A L do it?
1243140	1244140	It may have been.
1244140	1245460	But then again, they did smash the first ones.
1245460	1246460	I don't know.
1246460	1247460	Hmm.
1247460	1248460	Anyhow.
1248620	1250140	Um, so there you go.
1250140	1257180	Nintendo turns 125 this week and here's to 125 more if the Wii U doesn't bankrupt you.
1257180	1258180	Toast.
1258180	1259180	Just kidding.
1259180	1260180	I'm kidding.
1260180	1263140	So question though, what was your first video game system?
1263140	1268980	My first very first, including computers that play games, Atari 2600, which I think the
1268980	1274380	family had bought one for my brother and I would have been like one or two, but I sort
1274380	1275380	of inherited it.
1275380	1277300	What was the first one you played?
1277340	1279060	The first one I played was Atari 2600.
1279060	1280060	Okay.
1280060	1281060	Yeah.
1281060	1282540	Uh, the first game was combat for sure.
1282540	1283980	Probably combat and Spiderman.
1283980	1284980	I know what mine was.
1284980	1285980	What?
1285980	1286980	Magnavox Odyssey 2.
1286980	1287980	Nice.
1287980	1288980	Playing the, uh, what was it?
1288980	1292780	The, the legend of the four rings or whatever it was.
1292780	1293780	Yeah.
1293780	1294780	Playing that.
1294780	1295780	We forgot the board game.
1295780	1296780	We just played the little video game.
1296780	1299420	And what was your very, very first game you remember playing?
1299420	1300420	Logie?
1300420	1301420	Me?
1301420	1302420	It was definitely on the ColecoVision.
1302420	1306060	Um, I remember playing the Smurfs game a lot.
1306060	1311500	Um, dude, my dad was totally a gamer cause he bought all these like stupid ass systems,
1311500	1313660	like the action max.
1313660	1316740	He bought the fucking action max and I played the hell out of that, especially if they had
1316740	1321300	like the little, uh, like trailer for the other games that are in there, which was also
1321300	1322300	playable.
1322300	1325380	Um, but like, God, he had that too.
1325380	1327020	So I don't know.
1327020	1328740	I don't know what his problem is now.
1328740	1334140	It's like, Hey, so I don't play any of those systems too hard to control.
1334140	1335140	All right.
1335220	1339340	So from gaming's past to gaming's present, let's talk about how is your gaming week?
1339340	1343380	We always like to check in on what everybody's playing just to sort of see what your frame
1343380	1347100	of reference is and maybe if you have any reviews on new things you've played recently.
1347100	1350340	So we always check in at the top of the show with how is your gaming weeks?
1350340	1351700	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1351700	1358940	I played Final Fantasy 14 a little and I played some Mass Effect a little and then I, um,
1358940	1362700	actually we do have a new game in the house that Dan paid 125 bucks for.
1362700	1363700	What?
1363700	1364700	Yeah.
1365260	1369500	Um, Outrun 2 SP for the PS3 or PS2.
1369500	1370500	Yeah.
1370500	1377380	The PS2, which is supposed to be the best version of Outrun 2 you can get as far as,
1377380	1380840	you know, the sound quality and everything being complete and having all the animations
1380840	1382860	from the arcade version.
1382860	1386900	And it's a little dated looking, but it's still really freaking good.
1386900	1387900	Why so much?
1387900	1389500	Was there just not a lot of copies made of it?
1389500	1390500	I have no idea.
1390500	1392900	It's maybe, yeah, I guess maybe it was a limited run.
1392900	1396860	That is an import, but, um, he's been a happy boy.
1396860	1400900	It also supposed to be like have like some of the best support for the, uh, driving wheels.
1400900	1404660	Oh, is that something he puts in his little rig with the, he doesn't play it on this rig.
1404660	1408140	He plays it with his leftovers that he built just hook up to the TV.
1408140	1409140	Oh, gotcha.
1409140	1414820	Um, and he's, uh, really been, it's got like all kinds of like unlockables for different
1414820	1419300	music and everything and you can get different cars and it's really crazy.
1419300	1422500	And I was like, why did the later versions of this suck so much?
1422500	1426340	Because like, for example, and this is a minor thing, but like when you pick magical sound
1426340	1431340	shower, right, you get magical sound when, before the next thing loads, but it actually
1431340	1435660	finishes saying magical sound shower when you pick the name and then goes forward.
1435660	1440780	It's like, and it's like, like the animations, like the, uh, shuttle blasting off into space
1440780	1444460	on one of the endings, whereas it's just sitting there.
1444460	1451120	Um, but yeah, Outrun 2 SP is supposed to be pretty, it's, it's pretty, pretty worthy.
1451120	1453080	And it was, it was a really nice, smooth game.
1453080	1459120	And then he's got this other one that's, um, basically it's Outrun, um, the original Outrun,
1459120	1463200	uh, recompiled to work, um, on a PC.
1463200	1466520	So it will run like widescreen layouts and everything.
1466520	1468360	And I don't remember what it was called.
1468360	1471040	Um, it's not called Outrun something, but it's something else.
1471040	1473600	But, um, popcorn, I think.
1473600	1474600	I don't remember.
1474600	1479680	But anyway, um, but, uh, Dan's been like, the house has been nothing but Outrun music.
1479720	1483960	I'll come home, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
1483960	1484960	Every time I come home.
1484960	1485960	Well, it's good.
1485960	1488240	I mean, it's good to spend that much on a game, you're going to get your money's worth
1488240	1489240	out of it, right?
1489240	1490240	So actually play it.
1490240	1493200	That and I think the cat's fascinated by watching him drive.
1493200	1495520	Midna's like, the fuck are you doing?
1495520	1498600	Is Midna destined to become Toonces, the driving cat?
1498600	1503480	I don't know, but she's like, she'll like rub up under his legs while he's, you know,
1503480	1504480	using the pedals and everything.
1504480	1509640	And then she'll just sit there and go, daddy, why are you turning the thing?
1510600	1512760	So she's just crazy.
1512760	1514680	So yeah, that's been my.
1514680	1518520	And then I, one thing I noticed you didn't mention was your Hataful Boyfriend stream
1518520	1519520	on Tuesday.
1519520	1520520	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, I forgot.
1520520	1521520	Cause I even tuned in for some of that.
1521520	1525800	Hataful Boyfriend, I'm doing basically, I'm playing Hataful Boyfriend on Twitch TV.
1525800	1531280	I actually made a Twitch channel for OLR, for me on OLR, so it's DarkSakura underscore
1531280	1532280	OLR.
1532280	1535960	Um, and I'm just playing Hataful Boyfriend, I'm dating pigeons.
1536520	1543200	This week, actually Tuesday, I will try to be on, hopefully around five, cause I'm gonna
1543200	1546880	do two playthroughs and I'm gonna go for the Psycho Doctor ending.
1546880	1551560	If you want to see what happens to our poor girl by trying to romance the doctor.
1551560	1556840	My question is, do any of them talk like the pigeons from the Animaniacs?
1556840	1557840	No.
1557840	1558840	Damn.
1558840	1563120	Although one of them is crazy and obsessed with pudding, and he apparently can't speak
1563120	1565320	proper English, but everyone can understand him.
1565320	1566940	Or proper Japanese in the game.
1566940	1571960	He just says, coo, and then they translate everything, his name is Oko-san and he's crazy.
1571960	1573280	He likes pudding.
1573280	1578040	I did my second date through, I dated Oko-san.
1578040	1579040	Good times.
1579040	1580640	So that's been, your Tuesdays basically.
1580640	1581640	I've been dating pigeons.
1581640	1582640	Alright, awesome.
1582640	1584640	My husband's okay with it.
1584640	1586560	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1586560	1589520	You actually played things, not just the clicking heroes or whatever.
1589520	1594360	Yeah, not just the clicky hero thing, but no, I actually did play Road Redemption because
1594360	1596660	it was something I backed on Kickstarter.
1596660	1601600	It's a Unity game that's sort of like a spiritual successor to Road Rash.
1601600	1605600	The only problem is it runs like shit on my laptop, and that's no fault of the game.
1605600	1608280	It's the fault that my laptop runs games like shit.
1608280	1612160	So yeah, I mean it was fun.
1612160	1617440	It's just, it kind of chugged because I didn't drop the graphics settings down too much and
1617440	1622400	I kind of blame Unity a little bit because, you know, their descriptions for the different
1622400	1626800	graphics levels are pretty vague, so it's hard to tell.
1626800	1629520	But it looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game.
1629520	1633580	You just, you kind of play it like Road Rash and then they have different little events
1633580	1636800	that you do and stuff, so it's pretty cool.
1636800	1641280	The only thing I didn't like about it was kind of the shooting controls because you
1641280	1645520	can actually get a gun and shoot in the game and that was a little difficult to actually
1645520	1649720	manage to do that, so I don't know.
1649720	1650720	But it's fun.
1650720	1656240	And it's on early access if you didn't back the game, so you can check it out.
1656240	1657240	Alright.
1657240	1658840	Let's see, my gaming week.
1658840	1661680	A lot of similar stuff from the previous weeks.
1661680	1663240	I haven't played a lot, a lot of new stuff.
1663240	1668600	I will mention that one new thing I did play, I played the Final Fantasy IV, which isn't
1668600	1671120	really a new game, but it is on Steam.
1671120	1674720	And I think I talked about this briefly last week that, you know, it would be my like seventh
1674720	1676400	time buying it if I bought it on Steam.
1676400	1678560	Well, of course, you know I bought it.
1678560	1682200	And I actually did a livestream myself later on Monday night.
1682200	1683360	It was pretty late Monday night.
1683360	1685680	I did a stream of that for a little bit.
1685680	1688940	And originally my whole goal was that I was going to stream a little bit every week until
1688940	1689940	I beat the game.
1689940	1692960	Well, you and I and everybody else know that's not going to happen.
1692960	1696040	And a lot of that is probably because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and there were some
1696040	1697200	things that came out in the stream.
1697200	1700160	I was like, oh God, it's like totally, the sound isn't right.
1700160	1702960	So anyway, I might end up doing that with something else later on.
1702960	1711240	But Final Fantasy IV is, it is the iOS or DS version on your PC, probably best experienced
1711240	1716840	in Steam big picture mode where you, you know, can use like the 360 controller and all that,
1716840	1718840	which works very well with the game.
1718840	1722320	Otherwise, I guess I would say it's one of those things where maybe if you're a younger
1722320	1727240	listener of OLR and you've never really experienced this game, like, you know, you just, you miss
1727240	1730840	the boat when the Super Nintendo version was out and you haven't really ever picked up
1730840	1731840	this game.
1731840	1735300	And I think the story in this game is really good still and holds up very well.
1735300	1739960	It might feel a little cliche to you, but just keep in mind that, you know, Final Fantasy
1739960	1741080	IV is an older game.
1741080	1745520	And I think, I think it's one of those things where I think to truly appreciate, you know,
1745520	1750120	where RPGs have been and where they are now, Final Fantasy IV is definitely worth a look.
1750120	1752800	And this is a, this is a fair way to experience it.
1752800	1757520	I don't think this PC port is the best version of it.
1757520	1763680	I still think the PSP one was my favorite, but, um, it's, it's not bad.
1763680	1768040	I'm surprised they haven't, um, remade, and maybe they have, cause I haven't been paying
1768040	1771640	attention, but they haven't remade, uh, the Dragon Quest games in kind of the same lore
1771640	1772640	fashion.
1772640	1778400	It's happening on, um, iOS because they just released, funny you bring that up, they just
1778400	1779400	released the first one.
1779400	1782200	The mis- misnamed one, what was it?
1782200	1783200	Oh, Dargon Quest.
1783200	1786720	Well, they, that was, I think seven that they did that.
1786720	1791800	But like the original Dargon Quest just came out, like that was a big thing they were just
1791800	1793640	hyping up like in this past week or two.
1793640	1798640	Sounds like my first RPG that I played that is my, well, aside from, I don't know if you
1798640	1802280	consider, Zelda's more of an adventure game, but you know, it was the first like RPG I
1802280	1804040	kind of played was Dragon Quest.
1804040	1808240	I wouldn't be surprised at all, actually, if Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior, I guess over
1808240	1809240	here.
1809240	1810240	Yeah, Dragon Warrior over here.
1810240	1815160	I wouldn't be surprised at all if that does hop over to Steam, um, because you know, Square's
1815200	1819120	kind of been milking the Steam thing lately and especially with the 13 ports that are
1819120	1823240	coming now, I think they realize it's, you know, it's, it's extra money.
1823240	1824240	So why not?
1824240	1830560	I mean, this isn't Square, but, but, but, but Microsoft or whoever, I think it's Microsoft,
1830560	1834120	it was like a first party, second party game.
1834120	1835120	Lost Odyssey, please.
1835120	1836960	Yeah, uh, Mistwalker.
1836960	1841400	So it's not Square, it's people that used to be with Square, but it's not really Microsoft
1841400	1842400	either.
1842640	1845240	Oh God, I don't care who it is, please.
1845240	1846240	Yeah.
1846240	1848640	Or a sequel, man.
1848640	1849640	I would be all over that.
1849640	1850640	I know, I know.
1850640	1851640	Me too.
1851640	1852640	I still need to finish the first game.
1852640	1853640	I know those feels.
1853640	1856000	Uh, otherwise I've been playing a lot of other stuff.
1856000	1859880	I've actually played some more Diablo 3, of course I've been playing more Final Fantasy
1859880	1868520	XIV, more Destiny, I hit level 20 in Destiny, um, and, um, Destiny is such a complex game
1868520	1873080	to talk about because there's so many things I really, really, really love about it.
1873080	1877160	And the game is so much fun, especially when you're like able to play with other people.
1877160	1881500	And even by myself, I have fun doing the little patrol missions and so forth.
1881500	1887480	But then on the other hand, there's the, like the way you level up after level 20 is 100%
1887480	1888760	based on loot.
1888760	1891680	And there's a stat on loot called light.
1891680	1895040	And the more light your character has, the higher your level goes.
1895040	1897000	So it's so stupid.
1897000	1898000	I hate it.
1898000	1902680	I really hate the end game in Destiny and how you level up past 20.
1902680	1904480	I don't have a nice way to put it.
1904480	1906680	It's, it's really awful.
1906680	1911480	And that isn't me being a stick in the mud thinking like, oh, well, you know, because
1911480	1913560	every other RPG in the past has worked this way.
1913560	1914560	This one should too.
1914560	1919520	I'm all for them doing something different, but like I've literally done all these like
1919520	1925400	missions and strikes and bounties on the planet and so forth and I get these drops and I have
1925400	1928840	yet to get to level 21 or even see my bar move.
1928840	1931240	Like I'm not getting any gear with light on it.
1931240	1933320	So it's, it's really frustrating.
1933320	1936400	Now granted, I know there's a patch coming and we're going to get into some of that later
1936400	1937960	in the show.
1937960	1939640	Some of this stuff is fixable.
1939640	1943920	I mean, if they fixed Diablo three, they can fix this, but it's just as it is right now
1943920	1945520	today.
1945520	1949560	That stuff kind of makes the end game and destiny like really not fun.
1949560	1952720	Now wasn't destiny supposed to be a game that they're going to be carrying out for like
1952720	1954560	10 years or something like that?
1954560	1955560	Absolutely.
1955560	1957480	Can you actually see that happening?
1957480	1967280	I mean, actually, well, maybe not 10 years, but I could see through DLC, they're going
1967280	1971960	to probably do at least squeeze another good year out of this through the two DLC packs
1971960	1976760	they're planning on and then, you know, they can still drop in patches and events and so
1976760	1979560	forth and support the game for a few years.
1979560	1983640	I think can the destiny mythos or whatever last 10 years?
1983640	1987680	Yeah, they'll probably be a destiny two at some point or something, you know, but I,
1987680	1991600	this game by itself for 10 years, I, I don't know.
1991600	1995800	That's an awful lot of DLC and I think some of us would expect bungee to kind of do something
1995800	1999920	else, especially maybe after the lukewarm reception this game has got.
1999920	2004520	But again, I go back and I pointed Diablo three, everything that that game went through
2004520	2007840	and now Diablo three is a, I love playing Diablo three.
2007840	2008920	It's so much fun.
2008920	2013480	Uh, I, I still play that to this day on PlayStation four and PC.
2013480	2019000	Um, so you know, if Diablo three can fix itself, destiny can too, which is so weird that we
2019000	2023560	live in this, you know, coming off this old school Nintendo topic that we just had, you
2023560	2029480	know, you couldn't fix a game after launch like that back in the day, but now it's like,
2029480	2031320	it's just part of what you expect.
2031320	2035120	It's so interesting how those day one patches have really changed things tremendously.
2035120	2036120	I don't know.
2036120	2038720	It just seems to me, maybe it's just my, uh,
2039400	2041520	Rose colored goggles, I guess.
2041520	2045360	Um, but it seemed like a lot of those like old Nintendo games, man, they were pretty
2045360	2046360	polished.
2046360	2048720	I mean, granted, I mean, there's some pretty big bugs and they're like, you know, blaster
2048720	2052800	master, all the exploits you can do by pausing the game and grenades and stuff like that.
2052800	2056400	But it ended up being coming, coming part of the game.
2056400	2059320	And I don't know, I just looked so fondly upon that stuff.
2059320	2063120	It's like, you know, everything, almost everything that came out, it's like, Oh, this is going
2063120	2064120	to be a really great game.
2064120	2067760	Well, can be not every single game, but like, you know, there's a lot of really great games
2067760	2068760	on there.
2068760	2075280	It's just, I don't know, destiny to me, it seems like it's, don't call this an MMO, even
2075280	2078840	though it's kind of like saying, you know, don't say this is on rails, you know, for
2078840	2079840	fable.
2079840	2081280	It's, I don't know.
2081280	2083360	It's just kind of a weird looking game.
2083360	2089640	Uh, I like that term mingle player I think is, is appropriate, but it's again, this,
2089640	2094760	every problem that I had with fantasy star online is almost exactly what is the issue
2094760	2095800	with destiny.
2095800	2100440	Although at least a fantasy star online credit, there was none of this ridiculous, like post
2100440	2104020	level cap junk being driven through gear.
2104020	2109320	Like there is, I mean, the loot system in PSO was sadly better than it is in destiny.
2109320	2114480	But you know, I, I feel like there, I mean, we have news coming up later about destiny's
2114480	2115480	doing a patch.
2115480	2118040	That's going to fix a lot of the problems like in the coming weeks.
2118040	2122080	So I'm not interested until you can feed mags and turn them into Opa Opa.
2122240	2125520	Uh, I'm, I'm hoping you can feed your ghost or change.
2125520	2130280	I mean, it seems like you can change your ghost because it's one of the options.
2130280	2134600	I mean, I don't know if anybody's seen where you can actually change the ghost or if that's
2134600	2138560	coming in a future, um, expansion, maybe that's just something they're leaving room for, but,
2138560	2139560	uh, yeah.
2139560	2146880	Uh, no Opa Opa, but you're probably no Opa Opa, uh, link in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2146880	2147880	Uh, let's see.
2147880	2150600	The seg agrees with me saying light is stupid.
2150600	2151600	That's right.
2151760	2153040	Grats on 20.
2153040	2154560	Now the real struggle begins.
2154560	2155560	Yeah.
2155560	2157160	I have to beat the game.
2157160	2158160	That's the other thing.
2158160	2159160	I haven't beat the game yet.
2159160	2161280	I'm still, I still have like a bunch of missions to do on Mars.
2161280	2162840	I just got to Mars and I hit low.
2162840	2164360	You better get your ass to Mars.
2164360	2165360	Right.
2165360	2166360	Get my ass to Mars.
2166360	2169240	Uh, Visaya 9 25 says the leveling is so long.
2169240	2170800	It drives me bonkers.
2170800	2172120	Some of the strikes take forever.
2172120	2174620	I wish we could actually talk to other people.
2174620	2176280	The game feels so empty.
2176280	2177280	Yeah.
2177280	2181000	You know, when I do strikes with friends, that's no problem because you can voice chat
2181000	2186240	with other people, but, um, bungee made a conscious decision to disable voice chat
2186240	2190880	in destiny and they're getting some shit for it, but it's very interesting to see them
2190880	2194840	say that basically, and this is their reason for doing it is that they said, you know,
2194840	2201960	we had, um, voice chat on in halo and we saw what toxic things were done because of it.
2201960	2204120	So we made a decision to shut it off in destiny.
2204120	2207840	And there's a part of me that kind of goes, well, that's kind of rad actually because
2207840	2210240	people are real dicks on the line sometimes.
2210240	2211240	That makes sense.
2211240	2212240	And I'm glad I can't hear them.
2212240	2213240	That makes sense.
2213240	2216780	And a death match type situation where, you know, okay, you might wash it off, but this
2216780	2219600	is more like an MMO where it's more co-op.
2219600	2220600	Yeah.
2220600	2223340	You don't really need voice chat in a death match.
2223340	2226760	You probably need voice chat in like a co-op type situation.
2226760	2230240	I mean team death match, I guess you can be doing some like, you know, strategies.
2230240	2233440	And people still find ways to troll people even with no voice chat.
2233440	2236960	Like I was walking around doing earth missions and I was doing some stuff.
2236960	2240640	Some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face, like, cause that's something
2240640	2241640	you can do in destiny.
2241640	2243440	You hit the trigger and it throws a punch.
2243440	2245940	So some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face.
2245940	2247240	Is that what we do to people now?
2247240	2248520	Is that, is that how we say hello?
2248520	2250440	Hey, Loki, let me come over and say hello to you.
2250440	2255280	How you doing buddy?
2255280	2258400	And I play a woman character.
2258400	2260880	Didn't your parents ever teach you not to hit a girl?
2260880	2261880	Anyway.
2261880	2264400	Cause we fucking hit back.
2265120	2267620	Well, I did try to hit this guy back actually, but then he ran away.
2267620	2268620	So I shot him.
2268620	2270380	But, but that doesn't do any damage.
2270380	2273760	You can't actually shoot other players.
2273760	2276680	Well but you can throw a grenade and grenades do do damage.
2276680	2280520	So I did contemplate that, but I was like, you know what, no, I'm going to move on.
2280520	2281520	I did.
2281520	2282520	I did.
2282520	2283520	All right.
2283520	2289320	Um, they have been talking about though that they're going to do like an opt in voice chat
2289320	2292680	thing where when you play online, you can opt into voice chat.
2292680	2293680	So
2293960	2297520	you've got these clans and stuff that you've made up.
2297520	2301780	The clan support is terrible in destiny and that's another thing they need to fix.
2301780	2305480	Like we have a VoG clan and it's awesome and I encourage you to join.
2305480	2309520	The only problem with said VoG clan is that there's nothing in game that shows me who's
2309520	2313480	in the clan and if you're online or not, cause I'd love to run strikes with all of you, but
2313480	2315400	not all of you are on my friends list.
2315400	2320320	So like why isn't the clan list in the game right next to your friends list?
2320320	2322700	I mean I think even Halo did that.
2322700	2326620	So that seems like a really weird decision, but whatever, whatever.
2326620	2328100	All right.
2328100	2330500	Uh, anyhow, let's see.
2330500	2334540	Dungeon Buster says, yeah, my fem Hunter was trolled, but I jumped into orbit and that
2334540	2335540	was that.
2335540	2340180	Uh, Viziah says, I love the teabagging and PVP or maybe they should limit the speaking
2340180	2343380	to a few seconds so that the crap talk is kept at a minimum.
2343380	2347740	Oh, that would be kind of awesome that like, you know, the more you prove yourself, the
2347740	2349420	longer you're allowed to talk.
2349420	2352220	That's going to be awesome.
2352220	2353220	All right.
2353220	2355780	That's enough about destiny for now cause I have a story coming up on it later.
2355780	2356780	We'll get into it then.
2356780	2359220	Or if you talk, you put down your weapon or something like that.
2359220	2360220	Right.
2360220	2361820	So while you're talking, you can't shoot.
2361820	2363820	Oh, that'd be neat.
2363820	2364820	We'll see.
2364820	2365820	We'll see.
2365820	2366820	All right.
2366820	2367820	Anyhow, uh, let's move on.
2367820	2368820	I think that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
2368820	2372820	Uh, so I did play a couple other little things like I did like crypt of the necro dancer
2372820	2376260	one night and I was playing eight bit boy on steam the other night too.
2376260	2379460	But uh, I'll talk, I guess more about those games at length at a later date.
2379460	2382820	So let's get into our news right after some housekeeping.
2382820	2388820	Uh, we, uh, are on Facebook of course, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and Twitter, twitter.com
2388820	2393300	slash O L R and Google plus google.com slash plus orange launch radio.
2393300	2399160	We're also on YouTube at username orange launch radio and you should subscribe and check out
2399160	2403660	our episodes when they're released on YouTube because that's a great archive to go back
2403660	2405040	and visit past episodes.
2405040	2408540	It's a building up there on YouTube and YouTube's on everything you could watch.
2408540	2411700	You can watch O L R on your TV, although you're really just listening to it because
2411700	2412700	it's a radio show.
2412700	2414980	It's orange launch radio, not orange launch television.
2414980	2417420	Um, but let's see.
2417420	2423220	The other thing I wanted to mention is that we will not be here live on October 19th.
2423220	2427640	So if you are a live listener, you'll want to go ahead and, and uh, I don't know if Bobby's
2427640	2428640	here that week.
2428640	2432600	Uh, so he'll, he'll let you guys all know about that, but we will not be here live on
2432600	2437900	October 19th because I will be at final fantasy fan fest in Las Vegas.
2437940	2439420	And uh, so I won't be here.
2439420	2442380	We will be replaced by banjo playing chimpanzees.
2442380	2444280	We're trying to tape in advance that week.
2444280	2446200	So at least there'll be something new for you guys to listen to.
2446200	2449020	Cause I know we just missed a show over labor day weekend, so we don't like to miss shows
2449020	2450020	a lot.
2450020	2452460	Uh, cause you know, we want to keep you guys in the habit of having something to listen
2452460	2453460	to on Monday.
2453460	2455460	So we're gonna try to tape something prior that week.
2455460	2459780	Uh, but just, just see live folks know we won't be here live for sure that night, October
2459780	2460780	19th.
2460780	2461780	All right.
2461780	2465320	Uh, let's get into some news.
2465320	2467100	Loki's going to start us off with some news tonight.
2467100	2474540	So, um, it was announced that, uh, blizzard has canceled Titan and the problem is not
2474540	2475540	a lot of people know what Titan was.
2475540	2481100	I mean, we kind of thought it was a, you know, their next MMO and I guess that's sort of
2481100	2487420	what it was as a, basically their most ambitious game that they had possibly imagined.
2487420	2489020	And the only problem was that it wasn't fun.
2489020	2493660	So you can have all that ambition, but if it's not fun, then what's the point?
2493660	2499900	So they still didn't reveal any details regarding it other than that, you know, it just wasn't
2499900	2500900	working out.
2500900	2503580	So they decided to cancel it.
2503580	2504580	So I don't know.
2504580	2508780	I guess that means that, you know, I was kind of hoping that that was going to be like a
2508780	2511940	follow up to world of Warcraft, but I guess it just means there's going to be more world
2511940	2512940	of Warcraft.
2512940	2514580	You know, why bother putting out a new game?
2514580	2518660	That would be nice cause there hasn't really been world of Warcraft for about a year now
2518660	2519980	because of content patches.
2519980	2523220	They've been running that same raid for a year.
2523220	2529780	So I don't know, maybe, maybe they're just worried that if they put out another MMO,
2529780	2535660	that it would kind of split their user base and you know, they want more people on world
2535660	2536660	of Warcraft.
2536660	2537660	I don't know.
2537660	2542220	Well, there's been a lot of chatter that this game Titan, I don't know if you saw some of
2542220	2546660	the details about what the game was, but a lot of people have been saying that Titan
2546660	2549900	had a lot in common with destiny.
2549900	2553180	And that is why possibly they pulled the plug.
2553180	2556540	But, and I got into this a little more on Horde house and I don't want to repeat myself
2556540	2559500	because my other show, Horde house on Wednesday, we talked about this a little bit, but in
2559500	2565380	a nutshell, um, why would Activision fund two games that were saying the same thing?
2565380	2567940	Not just, I mean, cause they're both Activision games.
2567940	2572380	Activision is publishing the bungee destiny and Activision's public would have published
2572380	2574900	a blizzards, uh, Titan or whatever.
2574900	2579060	So Activision was not going to let two games of the exact same thing.
2579060	2584100	And I realized Activision might be hands off or whatever, but look like once a year,
2584100	2585940	these games at least are checking in.
2585940	2592880	So I think there must've been enough with Titan that differentiated it from destiny.
2592880	2597380	It almost sounds to me like there was probably a Sims type of element to this too.
2597380	2600700	And maybe even some elements that I would have wanted to see in a mass effect MMO.
2600700	2606300	I mean, maybe that's really wishful thinking, but maybe it was too disjointed and that's
2606300	2607420	why it didn't work.
2607420	2611500	It might've just been a really like a good, like they had a bunch of stuff that they wanted
2611500	2612500	to implement in there.
2612500	2615260	Like I think there was one where you could be like a shop vendor or something like that
2615260	2616700	and you didn't even have to fight.
2616700	2619860	You could have just, you know, sold stuff and that kind of stuff.
2619860	2625380	Um, and all that stuff was cool and work, but it's kind of like, well, is it fun?
2625380	2627140	Is it going to be fun doing this?
2627140	2628660	I mean, probably not.
2628660	2629780	I mean, I don't know.
2629780	2636380	It just has an awful long time to be developing a game just to come up, you know, with nothing
2636380	2638660	and well, lizard does this a lot.
2638660	2639660	Blizzard does this a lot.
2639660	2643220	You know, there was Warcraft adventures, which is what, that was the point and click game
2643220	2644780	with the, the orcs, right?
2644780	2647740	And then there was a Starcraft ghost, which was the actiony thing that was supposed to
2647740	2648740	be on.
2648740	2649740	What was that?
2649740	2653000	A PlayStation cast game to PlayStation two or one of those.
2653000	2654440	And that never ended up happening either.
2654440	2657180	So I mean, blizzard does this a lot.
2657180	2658180	Yeah.
2658180	2659340	And then I don't know.
2659340	2663700	I mean, if it wasn't fun, I mean, who cares if it was being worked on for awhile?
2663700	2667180	I mean, some games that are worked on for a while that do eventually come out and end
2667180	2669340	up sucking to be going forever, for example.
2669340	2670860	So I don't know.
2670860	2675540	I mean, I'm sure they know what they're doing, so we'll just have to imagine what it was
2675540	2681660	and wait for the, you know, the eventual, uh, art portfolio leak from somebody looking
2681660	2685460	for a job or something like that, that showed like some concept art or something, uh, tiger
2685460	2689220	claw and chat says the reason why blizzard shut down Titan is because they want to have
2689220	2694100	the burden or imagine that as they don't want to have the burden of managing two MMOs
2694100	2697940	at the same time, they spend a lot of time maintaining, wow, it would be difficult for
2697940	2699860	them to balance two MMOs.
2699860	2704380	You know, another way I kind of look into that comment is, um, that maybe blizzard has
2704380	2712340	set their own bar too high and they, the realization was that this game was not going to get that
2712340	2716700	same amount as a buy-in that wow has.
2716700	2718980	And so it would have been written off as a failure.
2718980	2720100	You know what I mean?
2720100	2724300	Because like no MMO has even come close to touching, wow.
2724300	2727820	In America, in North America and probably Europe too.
2727820	2732980	I'm glad that they've stopped advertising different MMOs as a wow killer now that everyone's
2732980	2738880	kind of, you know, gotten to the point where it's like, wow's dipping though.
2738880	2740540	And I think, I think wow has peaked.
2740540	2744620	I don't see wow getting back to the subscriber numbers that had during wrath of the Lich
2744620	2745620	King.
2745820	2751220	In all honesty, I've been fortunate enough to play the Draenor alpha and beta.
2751220	2754840	And as much as I'm thankful for the opportunity to check that stuff out, I'm going to tell
2754840	2759140	you I'm, it's not good enough for me to buy the expansion.
2759140	2760640	I don't care.
2760640	2762640	Like it's just, I, it wasn't enough.
2762640	2767380	Like it really just felt, it felt so boring to me.
2767380	2771220	Sorry, but that's kind of like where I'm at with Warcraft now.
2771220	2774500	You know, great community, but the game just, you know.
2774500	2778660	But at the same time, here I am, I can't stop fucking playing Diablo three.
2778660	2782500	So you can't say that Blizzard isn't doing something right and Blizzard is doing a good
2782500	2785180	job at having something for everyone right now.
2785180	2788660	I mean, there's a lot of people playing Hearthstone.
2788660	2792300	Hearthstone's up to like what, 20 million people have checked that out.
2792300	2795340	Heroes of the Storm appears to be doing very well for them.
2795340	2800060	Maybe Blizzard thought that Titan didn't fit in there somewhere, that Titan wasn't going
2800060	2805420	to bring in those new people that these other games have brought in to the fold somehow.
2805420	2808460	I don't know.
2808460	2812740	Dungeon Buster in chat says, Blizzard has always been really picky about its properties.
2812740	2815460	Look how long Diablo three took to finally get out.
2815460	2818020	And that comment over at live.fognetwork.com.
2818020	2823700	Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, what if it were to go free to play?
2823700	2827540	I would probably check it out a little bit if it went free to play, but I just don't
2827540	2828600	see that happening.
2828600	2832400	They don't have to go free to play right now.
2832400	2834400	It's very hard to be a premium MMO.
2834400	2837080	There's so few premium MMOs right now.
2837080	2838080	So few.
2838080	2841080	You could probably count them on one hand.
2841080	2846360	Final Fantasy 14 and 11, wow, WildStar, Elder Scrolls.
2846360	2848360	And WildStar was crap.
2848360	2849680	I haven't really played WildStar.
2849680	2853580	I've watched somebody else play it and I was really impressed by the whole housing thing
2853580	2857960	and just how deep that is, but I'm not impressed at some of the end game stuff I'm hearing
2857960	2863640	about that and the awful, horrible grind that they, they, they, they basically made
2863640	2866840	a game for people that missed vanilla wow.
2866840	2870960	Who didn't realize how awful vanilla wow really was like that.
2870960	2871960	That's the impression.
2871960	2872960	I'm getting.
2872960	2873960	How many times did I quit vanilla?
2873960	2874960	Wow.
2874960	2875960	Yeah, I know.
2875960	2876960	Right.
2876960	2877960	Again, I haven't played WildStar myself.
2877960	2878960	I've only watched other people play it.
2878960	2880440	So there's also Ragnarok online too.
2880440	2881440	Right.
2881440	2882440	Which is free.
2882440	2883440	That's free.
2883440	2884440	Yeah.
2884440	2885440	Yeah.
2885440	2886440	So I can't think of a lot.
2886440	2887440	Come on Square.
2887920	2888920	Final Fantasy 11.
2888920	2889920	Free to play.
2889920	2890920	I know.
2890920	2891920	Come on.
2891920	2896600	They still support that really well, but you know, people are flocking to free MMOs too.
2896600	2901200	Like I know my Twitter feed has been lit up with a ton of people checking out arch age
2901200	2905360	and complaining about server issues over there because the game is so damn popular right
2905360	2906360	now.
2906360	2907560	People are having a hard time getting in.
2907560	2908560	That's a big one that just launched.
2908560	2910920	I might be going back to Star Trek online.
2910920	2913200	Star Trek online obviously is really fun.
2913200	2914200	Yeah.
2914200	2915200	A big one too.
2915200	2916200	And they've got a big expansion coming out.
2916200	2920240	You know, there's a lot to be excited about in the free to play market as well.
2920240	2924040	Ah, anyhow, let's move on.
2924040	2925040	More news.
2925040	2928800	Hey, I promised you some stuff on Destiny and let's talk about what is going to happen
2928800	2933240	with patch 1.0.2, which is coming this week.
2933240	2938800	And one of the big changes they're going to make with Destiny 1.0.2 is Cryptarch changes.
2938800	2943600	Thank God the Cryptarch will finally learn how to decrypt things at the level they're
2943600	2945000	supposed to be at.
2945000	2949400	Meaning legendary engrams will always be legendary or better items.
2949400	2951720	Rare engrams will always be rare or better.
2951720	2952720	Thank God.
2952720	2956640	And rare engrams will also have an increased chance to produce legendary quality items.
2956640	2962400	So no more of this bullshit where you get a rare engram and it decodes into a green.
2962400	2963400	Fuck that shit.
2963400	2969440	Some of the activity changes will change and rare and legendary engrams will be added as
2969440	2970440	rewards.
2970440	2974960	That will be something you can do to sort of motivate people to do those more.
2974960	2977600	And some other item changes.
2977600	2980640	Ascendant materials have been promoted to legendary status.
2980640	2985880	And legendary engram items that already exist in your inventory will be demoted when the
2985880	2987800	patch goes live.
2987800	2989200	So that's very interesting.
2989200	2993720	So if you are holding onto legendary engrams, they will be demoted.
2993720	2999560	And Bungie makes a very tongue-in-cheek joke in their patch notes that says, let's be honest,
2999560	3002800	even if you don't, we all know they were blues already.
3002800	3007200	Like Bungie's making fun of themselves.
3007200	3008820	So strange.
3008820	3010960	So anyway.
3010960	3015100	Also on the Destiny front, since a lot of you guys are playing it, we should mention
3015100	3016100	this.
3016100	3021100	There was some little previews given of the Destiny expansion.
3021100	3022100	Not intentionally.
3022100	3027620	I guess some leaks were found in Destiny through a bug because this game is connected and downloads
3027620	3029580	patch data.
3029580	3034180	Some of the information about the next patch has kind of leaked in into the game.
3034180	3038340	So it looks like there will be a new raid called Crota's End.
3038340	3041020	It's a level 28 raid that will be on the moon.
3041020	3044300	And you can see more about this over on YouTube.
3044300	3048260	Some folks have decoded some of the stuff in the game.
3048260	3054340	Looks like to get into the story a little bit, I'm trying to say this in a non-spoilery
3054340	3055940	way.
3055940	3060780	Something that you work very hard to destroy in the expansion they will try to rebuild.
3060780	3062460	That's probably the easiest way I can put it.
3062460	3066040	Very generic plot, but we already know Destiny had one of those anyway.
3066040	3068140	So there you go.
3068140	3072700	House of Wolves content being found in the game too, but like literally there's placeholder
3072700	3078300	text that says moon underscore portal underscore one.
3078300	3085120	So there's not a lot to be known about that yet, but that's interesting to know that the
3085120	3091760	expansion is probably coming early next year with this extra raid and extra stuff.
3091760	3095880	And I really hope it will do something to make the end game a little more exciting in
3095880	3099360	regards to gearing up and all that.
3099360	3104320	And the seg in chat says, make sure to process your engrams before Tuesday early morning.
3104320	3107160	And Rob, you're not spoiling much of the story in this game.
3107160	3109040	There's not much to spoil.
3109040	3111880	Exactly I know, I'm just trying to prevent that email.
3112200	3115880	I was waiting to buy Destiny until I got a PS4 and you went and ruined everything about
3115880	3116880	the story.
3116880	3122040	And I'm like, just like put every generic sci-fi story you've ever heard right next
3122040	3123040	to each other.
3123040	3125400	And that's like what Destiny is, spoiler alert.
3125400	3128880	So just saying, like don't play Destiny for the story.
3128880	3130680	Just don't.
3130680	3132160	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
3132160	3137200	Well, how about something that has nothing to do with Destiny?
3137200	3143320	Obviously, and there's been a lot of, I would say, some anger, some resentment about the
3143320	3145200	new 3DS.
3145200	3149760	But they have release dates for them in Australia and New Zealand.
3149760	3154160	It's going to be out November 21st this year.
3154160	3159640	And looks like there's going to be, of course, Super Smash Brothers will be out.
3159640	3167160	The price is going to be, and this is Australian dollars, $219.95 for the regular size of the
3167160	3170680	revised one, and the XL will be $249.95.
3170680	3178400	So I don't know, I still think having the system is kind of, I understand they're not
3178400	3182280	wanting to limit the games by technology, so they're really expecting a lot of people
3182280	3183760	to put out the money to buy that.
3183760	3186040	I'm not sure.
3186040	3191320	I'm hopeful that because they have dates for New Zealand and Australia that happen to take
3191320	3198080	place this year, that hopefully we'll see release dates for North America as well soon,
3198080	3200320	because that'd be awesome.
3200320	3207560	Maybe, hey, Perfect Timing would be around the time that Pokemon, was it Ruby and Sapphire
3207560	3211560	come out on 3DS?
3211560	3213960	I don't know.
3213960	3219480	I'm expecting it to be sometime around the same time over here, but I haven't been too
3219480	3222240	excited about the news myself.
3222240	3225000	Are you getting one?
3225000	3226000	Not yet.
3226000	3227000	Not yet.
3227000	3230960	Just because I already had a 3DS and didn't really play anything on it, but we'll see.
3230960	3236560	If they have some really good games out for it, maybe the next Zelda game or something.
3236560	3239680	I don't want to have to redo my puzzles.
3239680	3241000	So yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
3241000	3242360	I just maxed out all my puzzles.
3242360	3243360	I don't want to do them.
3243360	3248880	Well, I think you can transfer your data over to your new system, and maybe that puzzle
3248880	3251880	data will go over as well.
3251880	3258960	So this is kind of disappointing, but apparently PlayStation Home is shutting down, both in
3258960	3261360	the US and Europe.
3261360	3267080	That's coming out, I guess, ending March 31st, 2015.
3267080	3274840	Of course, it's already kind of closed, or I think it's closing sooner actually in Japan.
3274840	3280240	Unfortunately they're going to stop making new content for it on the 12th of November,
3280240	3287120	and I guess in Europe you'll be able to download your content, or download content, I guess
3287120	3294320	until the 3rd of December, and as a thank you for supporting the platform, they're going
3294320	3299720	to have some free stuff that they're going to be releasing prior to its close, and I'm
3299720	3302120	sure they're going to be doing a lot more stuff with that.
3302120	3306160	Now, I'm hoping, though, that there's ways to get some of those free PlayStation 1 games
3306160	3310800	on there, because I remember they used to have several ways to get, was it like Warhawk
3310800	3317880	and Twisted Metal, and I'm not really sure what the other one was, they had some other
3317880	3324600	free game that was on there too, but I wanted Twisted Metal.
3324600	3327960	I don't know how to feel about this whole PlayStation Home thing shutting down, because,
3327960	3330000	well I mean, it's inevitable, right?
3330200	3333280	We knew it was going to shut down because we heard before it was going to happen in
3333280	3334280	Asia, right?
3334280	3338240	And so, I think we even said then, well, mark your calendars, it's going to happen in the
3338240	3339640	US too, right?
3339640	3343920	And so now we have the official word, and I don't know how to feel about it, how to
3343920	3351060	feel about it, because I feel like there was so much potential with PlayStation Home, and
3351060	3355200	I know it had a great community behind it, because VOG, we've actually participated in
3355200	3359160	some of these events in the past, and there were some good people that were playing it
3359160	3364320	and participating, but there were some things about it that just really bugged me, that
3364320	3367320	I think always kind of doomed it from the start.
3367320	3371340	And the fact that it wouldn't load things in the background was one of the huge things
3371340	3372340	for me.
3372340	3375920	Like, when you would zone into a new area, you would have to wait 10 minutes for everything
3375920	3376920	to download.
3376920	3377920	An update.
3377920	3378920	Yeah, exactly, an update.
3378920	3384640	Now, I feel like that's why I'm kind of surprised in a way that it's not graduating to PlayStation
3384640	3389400	4, because I would think PlayStation 4 seems to be a little more in tune with downloading
3389400	3390800	things in the background.
3390800	3395680	It's got a way bigger hard drive built in, so I would think that maybe more of that could
3395680	3396680	happen.
3396680	3398560	Rebuild it for PlayStation 4 or something.
3398560	3403040	But that's not going to happen, because we've heard that folks are going to be out of a
3403040	3404200	position because of this.
3404200	3408640	So clearly, when they're closing PlayStation Home, they are closing PlayStation Home, and
3408640	3413400	it's not going to continue, which, you know, I mean, on one hand, it's like, well, if you
3413400	3417280	loved PlayStation Home so much, maybe you should have fucking been using it.
3417280	3420200	But on the other hand, it's like, well...
3420200	3421840	It was kind of a drag to use it.
3421840	3426120	On paper, there was so much to really like about PlayStation Home.
3426120	3432280	Like, and I loved the idea about like, oh, when you unlock trophies, you could have a
3432280	3436320	virtual trophy cabinet, and, you know, and show these things off.
3436320	3438800	But that never happened.
3438800	3439800	It didn't really.
3439800	3444400	You had some things like, you could achieve things in games that would unlock like a shirt.
3444400	3448140	Like I seem to remember like in the Namco Museum game on PlayStation 3, that we have
3448140	3449600	a cameo in, right?
3449600	3453020	You actually play that and you unlock like a Pac-Man shirt or something that you can
3453020	3454140	use in Home.
3454140	3457960	And like, depending on some of the achievements you get, you do get those sorts of tangible
3457960	3458960	items.
3458960	3461280	So that in that sense, it's kind of cool.
3461280	3466260	But I mean, I don't know, like, again, it just it would take like 10 minutes to get
3466260	3467260	into Home.
3467260	3472640	And then the clubhouses were limited to what, 25 people, and I couldn't really do anything
3472640	3473640	with it.
3473640	3478900	They're going to raise the clubhouse, you know, limit on March 30th.
3478900	3487920	So looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, the seg says, so many feels and conflicts.
3487920	3491680	Buddy of mine is getting laid off as he works for that department, which at least he has
3491680	3494980	an end date and a plan, so he should be better off to make his plan.
3494980	3498240	And it goes on to say, I wish that trophy cabinet thing happened, but I don't think
3498240	3505200	any developer was willing slash able to make a full 3D model for a trophy.
3505200	3510080	Take 3D model from said game, put trophy base on it, done.
3510080	3515880	Or maybe some really easy, like maybe some generic trophy bases that were already done,
3515880	3520800	where maybe they could have taken their achievement art from the Xbox 360, right?
3520800	3523240	Because all those achievements on 360 have art.
3523740	3527260	And then you could just slap it on a trophy somehow, I don't know, like an easy convert
3527260	3528260	thing would have been cool.
3528260	3535620	It would have been that hard and you don't have to support it, you just, I don't know.
3535620	3540360	It's a bummer to see that they're not going to try to push PlayStation home a little more.
3540360	3541940	I mean, I get it.
3541940	3545740	It just wasn't probably making the money and attracting the developers and like seg said
3545740	3550340	in his comment there, you know, people didn't really want to spend money, you know, artists
3550340	3551340	are expensive.
3551340	3555200	They didn't want to spend money to create all these new 3D models and things for home.
3555200	3558080	It probably just wasn't a good return on investment or whatever.
3558080	3561200	So I mean, from that standpoint, it makes sense, but it's just kind of, I don't know,
3561200	3564720	you always kind of feel like maybe, and this might sound like a really weird thing to say,
3564720	3567700	but maybe home was ahead of its time in a way.
3567700	3569160	I don't know.
3569160	3572880	Maybe I'm maybe homeless too much like Second Life.
3572880	3574080	I don't think it was though.
3574080	3576720	I think Second Life was was really different.
3576720	3582020	I do because because home was really more of a celebration of video games, you know,
3582020	3583740	and Second Life isn't really about that.
3583740	3584740	But anyway,
3584740	3586380	Second Life is for furries.
3586380	3591700	Well, some would argue that home turned out into that type of thing as well.
3591700	3593820	So I mean, but
3593820	3595020	everything is for furries.
3595020	3596020	What are we talking about?
3596020	3599020	We talk about on this show all the time.
3599020	3600620	Time to penis, right?
3600620	3602220	TTP, time to penis.
3602220	3606700	You put an internet chat room out there, somebody's going to make a chat room dedicated to cocks.
3606700	3612000	So when you do this type of thing on PlayStation or whatever PlayStation chat room, there are
3612000	3615280	going to be chat rooms dedicated to all sorts of things that you can imagine.
3615280	3619120	And you know, furry when you when you sell these suits and things is one of them.
3619120	3621120	But
3621120	3624040	furry things don't have to necessarily be a negative either.
3624040	3626400	I mean,
3626400	3630400	I know people, I know people are into that and I don't care what you do, as long as you're
3630400	3632020	safe and consensual.
3632020	3633020	Furries are awesome.
3633020	3637080	I'm just saying that that's been the biggest thing that I've seen is a very, very big furry
3637080	3638080	community.
3638080	3639080	Yeah.
3639080	3642800	Bobby Blackwolf popping in saying Second Life and home are not comparable.
3642800	3646740	Second Life was all about people building and creating their own experiences.
3646740	3649380	Home was about people taking in Sony's experiences.
3649380	3653760	And maybe that a little bit was a part of the problem as well as that I was expecting
3653760	3659040	to be able to build a little more of an experience when I got a clubhouse and all that stuff.
3659040	3663180	And you know, I did see some impressive stuff that was done later on down the line.
3663180	3669340	But I mean, it's still like, how awesome would it have been if we had like a special OLR
3669340	3674660	thing, like a little mini video or something that you could only see in our clubhouse,
3674660	3678780	that you could like go into the clubhouse or like, if I happen to be playing PlayStation
3678780	3683540	as well, you know, and I'm there in home, I could actually talk to you instead of like
3683540	3687220	typing, I could be sitting at the top at the back of the room and actually talking and
3687220	3690920	doing like a podcast in PlayStation home.
3690920	3695760	But maybe now that Twitch is a thing and we have PlayStation live and all that, that's
3695760	3699220	kind of trumped anything that maybe home would have done.
3699220	3700220	I don't know.
3700220	3701220	So anyhow.
3701220	3702220	All right.
3702220	3706220	Well, there it is.
3706220	3707920	PlayStation home going to be closing.
3707920	3713360	Let's move on to talk about Bayonetta 2, which as you know, is going to be coming out here
3713360	3715160	in the US very soon.
3715160	3721660	Well, Bayonetta 2 actually came out in Japan and Bayonetta 2 sales numbers in Japan.
3721660	3724760	Honestly, there's no way to spin this.
3724760	3728500	It's not probably as good as it should be.
3728500	3732060	Bayonetta 2 sold 67% of their first shipment in Japan.
3732060	3735380	I guess from that perspective, that's not terrible, but here's the thing.
3735380	3740580	Bayonetta 2 sold 38,828 copies.
3740580	3748560	The original Bayonetta in 2009 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 sold 200,000 copies
3748560	3749560	in the same time.
3749560	3751060	So that's like what?
3751060	3755560	Maybe 18, 19% of what the first Bayonetta sold.
3755560	3757500	Now granted, we have to take into consideration.
3757500	3762860	There's just not as many Wii U's in Japan out there as there were PlayStation 3's combined
3762860	3763860	with Xbox 360.
3763860	3769540	I mean, there weren't a lot of 360s either, but combined with Xbox 360s back then.
3769540	3775180	But still, when you kind of see this that, oh, Bayonetta 2 sold not even 40,000 copies
3775180	3780140	in Japan on launch week, it's pretty hard to spin that number positively.
3780140	3783660	I mean, Loki, what do you think when you hear that number?
3783660	3787100	I think that it's just there's not a lot of systems out there and it's not surprising,
3787100	3788100	I guess.
3788100	3793420	And sadly, I mean, it's kind of along the lines of Platinum Games and even with the
3793420	3794420	Wii.
3794420	3801380	Mad World looked like such an awesome game and really hyped up and people were excited
3801380	3803660	about it and it didn't sell very well.
3803660	3808440	And same with, you know, Bayonetta, unfortunately, yeah, there are a lot of people that are fans
3808440	3813740	of Nintendo that own a Wii U, but the Wii U is kind of also directed towards more of
3813740	3819680	like families and kids and unfortunately those aren't the people that are going to be purchasing,
3819680	3821540	you know, Bayonetta 2.
3821540	3827260	Am I hearing in a way that maybe Nintendo ought to just embrace its status as a family
3827260	3829700	friendly game maker?
3829700	3834220	Because I mean, there's a lot of people out there that say Nintendo needs to do more hardcore
3834220	3835220	shit.
3835220	3836540	Nintendo needs to do stuff that caters to the hardcore gamer.
3836540	3837540	Well, here they go.
3837540	3839220	They're doing Bayonetta 2 and then it does this.
3839220	3844220	No, that's the thing is, yeah, they do need to dedicate themselves a little bit more towards
3844220	3845220	hardcore stuff.
3845220	3851180	But the problem was you're forgetting that the hardcore games back when the NES was out
3851180	3854340	and stuff were like Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda.
3854340	3859260	It was their mainstream games that were also, you know, bringing in new people to play them.
3859260	3864340	You just need to make games that kind of bring in both.
3864340	3870060	Like I think, like for example, the, you know, Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker, whatever
3870060	3877220	that's coming out, I think that kind of, it's more of like an easy, you know, slower paced
3877220	3879540	game for everybody else.
3879540	3883220	Maybe we're just getting too lazy in our game playing that, you know, they're afraid
3883220	3887220	that too hard, you know, gameplay that's too hard is going to drive off people from playing
3887220	3888220	those games.
3888220	3891220	And the other hand, I think it's good to have gameplay that's hard because it makes you
3891220	3892220	a better gamer.
3892220	3895040	Akuma JP in chat says, what do you expect?
3895040	3897900	It was on the Wii U.
3897900	3898900	Maybe that's it in a nutshell.
3898900	3899900	I don't know.
3899900	3902860	You know, something we didn't really talk about at the top of the show and this game
3902860	3905300	did come out this week was Hyrule Warriors.
3905300	3907500	And I only didn't talk about it because none of us have bought it yet.
3907500	3910780	I think I'm the only Wii U owner in the room and I just didn't get around to buying it
3910780	3911780	this weekend.
3911780	3914860	I'm kind of waiting to see a little more, like what the reactions are to the game for
3914860	3920940	my friends before I decide if I want to plunk $60 on it, which is a lot of money, right?
3920940	3925040	So, but I did see the pictures out in New York City where people were lined up around
3925040	3929340	the block at that Nintendo World Store for that limited edition thing that not everybody
3929340	3933380	didn't even get because Nintendo wasn't anticipating demand being as high as it was.
3933380	3937940	And a bunch of resellers got their hands on those little limited edition figurines for
3937940	3940980	Hyrule Warriors or whatever it was they were giving away in New York City.
3940980	3947500	So maybe Bayonetta 2 stands to do a little better here in the U.S. potentially?
3947500	3949980	I mean, we'll find out in a couple of weeks.
3949980	3954800	We do know a few things about Bayonetta 2 in advance of the U.S. release here.
3954800	3962860	As if it's any surprise, it has been rated mature by the ESRB due to blood, gore, intense
3962860	3968300	violence, partial nudity, strong language, and suggestive themes.
3968300	3974140	And there's also an online component, which you could be exposed to unrated user-generated
3974140	3975140	content.
3975140	3978020	Here's the official summary.
3978020	3981740	This is an action game in which players assume the role of an ancient witch that battles
3981740	3983980	angels and demons in a fantasy world.
3983980	3988460	Players use hand-to-hand combat, pistols, giant scythes, axes, and magic to kill enemy
3988460	3990580	creatures.
3990580	3994620	Players can also perform various finishing moves, which depict exaggerated and intense
3994620	3996260	acts of violence.
3996260	4001060	Enemies thrown into spinning spiked wheels, characters decapitated by a guillotine, a
4001060	4007260	dragon ripping characters apart, large blood-splattered effects and gore can be seen frequently.
4007260	4011780	During the course of the game, some female characters perform suggestive taunts and poses.
4011780	4015420	For example, opening their legs, dancing on poles.
4015420	4020260	Outfits are occasionally shed during battle, with characters' breasts and buttocks partially
4020260	4021260	exposed.
4021260	4024820	The words fuck and shit appear in the dialogue.
4024820	4026340	This game sounds awesome!
4026340	4030140	That should be like a searchable tag in eShop.
4030140	4033220	The words fuck and shit appear in dialogue.
4033220	4040020	Just print that on the back of the box.
4040020	4044860	I mean, come on, characters decapitated by a guillotine and a dragon rips characters
4044860	4046380	apart.
4046380	4048080	Awesome.
4048080	4052640	One other awesome thing that should be mentioned about Bayonetta 2, as the game is out in Japan,
4052640	4054800	people are tearing this apart on YouTube.
4054800	4062440	And get this, there is a Star Fox Easter egg hidden in Bayonetta 2, and apparently it goes
4062440	4066960	so far as to like, you're actually playing something that feels like Star Fox within
4066960	4068000	the game.
4068000	4069360	And that is all within Bayonetta 2.
4069360	4073160	At least they didn't have an F-Zero Easter egg in the game, otherwise you would just
4073160	4074160	piss me off.
4074160	4077680	Well, they're saving that for Mario Kart just to piss me off.
4077680	4079880	That means they probably won't do another one.
4079880	4082480	But there you go, Bayonetta 2, all the latest on that.
4082480	4087320	Now what's funny is that even though I'm kind of like, on the fence about Hyrule Warriors,
4087320	4089360	I'm definitely getting Bayonetta 2.
4089360	4093680	If for no other reason than what I just read.
4093680	4095400	And I want the original on Wii U too.
4095400	4099380	So we can have games that they're not going to make a sequel to, Excite Truck.
4099380	4101080	They should totally have.
4101080	4103080	What about Excite?
4103080	4104080	They did have that sequel.
4104080	4105080	Excite Bots.
4105080	4106080	Excite Bots.
4106080	4107080	Yeah, that was crap.
4107480	4111360	I mean, it's a game you make a sandwich in the race, and you throw a pie at a clown,
4111360	4114080	or you knock a star, it didn't make any sense.
4114080	4119880	But it would be awesome to have the Excite truck or Excite Bots as an assist in Smash
4119880	4127320	Brothers, but Nintendo's not going to actually put their own properties like that in there.
4127320	4129320	Such an awesome racing game.
4129320	4131500	Alright, let's move on.
4131500	4134240	We got one more story here, and then we're going to do release dates.
4134240	4135240	Start Sakura.
4135400	4138560	How would you ever like to game in your own arena?
4138560	4140040	Or at least have a dedicated arena.
4140040	4141620	The US is finally getting one.
4141620	4146000	I have an arena in my living room, and I don't have to wear pants there.
4146000	4149040	I don't want to know about your pants off dance off.
4149040	4154240	It's more of a peen arena.
4154240	4159360	I even have a little referee, a little furry referee that meows at me when I...
4159360	4164080	She just looks at you like you're a weirdo, and then runs when people come over, and hides
4164080	4165560	under the bed the whole time.
4165560	4168000	She's such a crazy old lady.
4168000	4172400	Anyway, so now we get an esports stadium!
4172400	4173400	Yay!
4173400	4177320	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
4177320	4178800	Are you ready to rumble?
4178800	4179800	MLG is putting it out.
4179800	4185800	It's going to be called the MLG.TV arena, which will be 15 minutes away from Ohio State
4185800	4186800	University.
4186800	4187800	Why are they putting it in Ohio?
4187800	4189800	I don't know.
4189800	4195760	Anyway, since Columbus has actually hosted some of their most successful events, they
4195760	4197840	said that's where it'll be.
4197840	4198840	Wasn't Ohio also...
4198840	4202520	Wasn't that also the school that did the scholarship program?
4202520	4204260	We talked about this a few weeks ago on the show.
4204260	4205540	That might have been the same school.
4205540	4207800	That could be why.
4207800	4211760	Ohio might be some type of hotbed for this stuff that we just don't see here in California.
4211760	4215440	What else do they have to do in Ohio?
4215440	4217560	I know we have listeners there, so...
4217560	4220560	Tell us what there is to do in Ohio.
4220560	4222920	Be sad.
4222920	4223920	That's Alabama.
4223920	4224920	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4224920	4227920	That's be sad and go to New Orleans.
4227920	4229680	You leave the state.
4229680	4234840	So that's cool that they're putting in a little arena there, but an arena?
4234840	4240120	I mean, aren't they going to use the arena for Lady Gaga concerts too?
4240120	4242880	If it's only for gaming events, it seems like such a waste of space.
4242880	4243880	You know what I mean?
4243880	4247640	Actually Fifth Dream says pantsless dojo.
4247640	4248640	That's the name of my living room.
4248640	4250360	For the record, I'm not wearing pants.
4250360	4252120	I'm wearing shorts.
4252120	4254880	Those guys are wearing pants.
4254880	4255880	Let's see.
4255880	4258000	The SEG says, woo, tax breaks.
4258000	4260600	Maybe that's part of it there.
4260600	4261600	Let's see.
4261600	4263480	What Up G says, the Ohio State marching band.
4263480	4265560	Oh, that would be some marching bands.
4265560	4267140	That's something to do in Ohio.
4267140	4272200	And Brad from Pod Culture says, Dark Sakura, Christina is from Cleveland.
4272200	4273200	That's okay.
4273200	4276920	But as I understand it, she moved.
4276920	4281440	No, I'm just kidding.
4281440	4284320	God, I don't want angry emails coming from Ohio.
4284320	4285320	No, no, no.
4285320	4286640	We make fun of all States of the Union.
4286640	4289920	I make fun of all the States, especially the ones I'm from.
4289920	4292680	Alabama really gets a ration of shit from me.
4292680	4297240	We could spend a whole three hours talking about what irritates us about California,
4297240	4301040	but people, traffic, that'll be another day.
4301040	4302040	All right.
4302040	4304600	So go around the world and check out some release dates and things that will be coming
4304600	4308000	out in every state across the nation.
4308000	4309800	And then we'll even travel to some other countries.
4309800	4310800	Loki.
4310800	4311800	All right.
4311800	4315520	This week, we've got a few things coming out, including Natural Doctrine, which is on PlayStation
4315520	4317960	3, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.
4317960	4325160	Crimes and Punishments Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and
4325160	4327280	Xbox One.
4327280	4335560	We've also got Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax on PlayStation
4335560	4344680	3 and Xbox 360, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Falling
4344680	4353480	Skies The Game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus Limited Edition,
4353480	4362280	the Let's Get Physical Edition, and that's on Vita.
4362280	4367520	Game on the 3DS called Super Smash Brothers, I'm sure no one's interested in.
4367520	4368520	And then coming out...
4368520	4373040	I just love the way you phrased that.
4373040	4378640	And then since we had, you know, last week, Disney Infinity 2.0, now we're going to have
4378640	4379640	Skylanders...
4379640	4384960	I guess if you want to call it 4.0 or whatever, Skylanders Trap Team, they've got that coming
4384960	4394240	out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and even
4394240	4400560	if you want to, a tablet version for Android and iOS.
4400560	4406000	And that includes even a little Bluetooth controller, which is kind of cool.
4406000	4411720	And they have also got that regular and dark editions, if you want to do the limited edition
4411720	4412720	for that.
4412720	4413720	That's it.
4413720	4414720	All right.
4414720	4417760	We're going to travel over to Japan and check out the release dates there, but I'm looking
4417760	4418760	at chat.
4418760	4421480	We're getting read the Riot Act on Ohio right now in chat.
4421480	4423680	And guess who doesn't really care?
4423680	4425240	Let's see.
4425240	4428840	Kick-ass amusement parks in Ohio, especially Cedar Point, says WhatUpG.
4428840	4430320	I have heard about that.
4430320	4433280	And Brad from PodCulture says, got to interview the eighth doctor in Ohio.
4433560	4442160	I love how people get massive, like, butt-hurt wedgies when someone makes a joke about something.
4442160	4444960	You go in the bathroom and dig out your panties.
4444960	4446480	Let's find another state to pick on.
4446480	4447480	Where do we not?
4447480	4448480	Delaware!
4448480	4449480	Oh, we're in Delaware.
4449480	4451040	I'm going to go look at the map.
4451040	4454280	I want to think of a place I've been that I have a beef with.
4454280	4456780	Where's a place that I've been that I have a beef with?
4456780	4457780	You know what?
4457780	4460840	I kind of, I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.
4460840	4462960	I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.
4462960	4464160	Dan's grandmother's from Wyoming.
4464160	4465160	Really?
4465160	4466160	Yeah.
4466160	4467160	Well, sorry.
4467160	4468160	I don't care.
4468160	4469160	I've never been there.
4469160	4470160	Anyway.
4470160	4471160	Moving on.
4471160	4472160	How about Stockton?
4472160	4473160	How about, yeah.
4473160	4474160	That's not a state.
4474160	4481640	I can think of a ton of places in California that are way worse than any of these states
4481640	4482640	that we're talking about.
4482640	4485080	Stockton's near the top of the list, honestly.
4485080	4490320	Or like, fucking, can we talk for a minute about Bakersfield?
4490320	4491320	Oh my god.
4491320	4493560	Biggest source of boring ever.
4493560	4494560	Anyway.
4494560	4497800	Sorry to, I think we actually have a listener in Bakersfield.
4497800	4499320	Sorry, but you know, you know.
4499320	4500320	You know.
4500320	4505880	The only thing that I would ever go to Bakersfield for was because they had a Sonic, and then
4505880	4506880	we got Sonic.
4506880	4508040	So that was good.
4508040	4512880	Yeah, the only reason to go to Modesto is that's the only Dunkin Donuts now in all
4512880	4513880	of Northern California.
4513880	4517160	We went to the Madera County Fair on purpose once.
4517160	4519440	To see where it all.
4519440	4521320	Tigerclaw in chat says, what about Sacramento?
4521320	4522320	Hey, fuck you.
4522320	4523320	You know what?
4523320	4524320	Sacramento's awesome.
4524320	4530000	I'm kind of, you know what, I'm kind of with you a little bit.
4530000	4532400	Sacramento's kind of just like, eh.
4532400	4535000	You know what, though, is near Fresno?
4535000	4536480	You know what, Tigerclaw?
4536480	4538560	Don't fucking get me started on Florida.
4538560	4541960	Do not get me started on your home state of Florida.
4541960	4542960	Do not.
4542960	4543960	But.
4543960	4549040	Like, we could talk about Florida more than the other 49 states combined.
4549040	4550040	Anyway.
4550040	4552040	Yes, Dark Sakura?
4552040	4553040	Nothing.
4553040	4554040	Florida man.
4554040	4555040	Florida woman.
4555040	4556040	I'm done.
4556040	4559640	All right, let's talk about Japan.
4559640	4565520	Japan has a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 that might be of interest to Dark Sakura.
4565520	4568120	Are you a fan of Quintet, Dark Sakura?
4568120	4569120	Quintet?
4569120	4571120	Yeah, I thought you, uh.
4571120	4572120	Quartet.
4572120	4573120	Oh.
4573280	4574280	It's Quintet.
4574280	4575280	But I guess, uh.
4575280	4578760	Quartet's an action-adventure game, not a dating sim with dancing girls.
4578760	4582240	I guess, yeah, this dancing girl game is not really something that would be up your alley.
4582240	4585400	I don't know, but it looks like at one point they're, like, fighting a tentacle monster,
4585400	4586400	so.
4586400	4587400	What, with the power of dance?
4587400	4588400	Yeah.
4588400	4589400	There's something.
4589400	4593200	Anyway, the game is actually called Omega Quintet, and it comes out.
4593200	4594200	And it says it's Quartets by Sega.
4594200	4595440	All right, there you go.
4595440	4596440	So they're different.
4596440	4597440	I got them mixed up.
4597440	4598440	Oh, well.
4598440	4605080	Mixing elements of the idle simulation and JRPGs into a brand new IP.
4605080	4611120	Takuto manages to protect the verse maidens, five pop idols, who have the ability to defeat
4611120	4615680	the invading Beep, that's what it's called, the Beep, with the power of their song and
4615680	4617040	dance.
4617040	4618640	This game sounds awesome.
4618640	4620520	I wish the PlayStation 4 wasn't region locked.
4620520	4621520	I hope there's some streams on PlayStation.
4621520	4622520	Isn't that on, oh.
4622520	4625200	This is on PlayStation 4, believe it or not.
4625200	4630640	Let's see, looking at some other games coming out in Japan, is that coming out on the Xbox
4630640	4631640	One?
4631640	4632960	Looking at Xbox One releases, no.
4632960	4637280	But Forza Horizon 2 gets its release in Japan this week.
4637280	4638480	So look forward to that.
4638480	4645360	On the PlayStation 3 on October 2nd, Kingdom Hearts 2.5 remix gets its release in Japan.
4645360	4647960	I did not realize that was this soon in Japan.
4647960	4651760	And there's also a 1.5 and 2.5 starter pack coming out.
4651760	4654240	And you can import that here in the US for 150 bucks.
4654280	4656280	Is that the 4.0 pack?
4656280	4657280	Right.
4657280	4658960	That's what it adds up to, right?
4658960	4660800	So that must be the case.
4660800	4665000	Let's see, on the Wii U, nothing to report this week on the Wii U, unless I read the
4665000	4666000	list wrong.
4666000	4667000	No, I did not read it wrong.
4667000	4668680	There's nothing on the Wii U this week.
4668680	4676880	On the PlayStation Vita this week, Nikketsu Ino Bukkatsu Tan Trigger Kiss comes out this
4676880	4678320	week on the Vita.
4678320	4681080	And lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
4681080	4683160	Hot blooded something.
4683160	4689600	Let's see, there is Kinken no Maguna and Nozotoki Battle Tori Densetsu no Makyuu wo
4689600	4694600	Fukkatsu Saseo comes out.
4694600	4695600	You want me to look up with that?
4695600	4697240	It's an Amco Bandai game.
4697240	4699440	It looks like Explore the Pyramids.
4699440	4702920	It looks like some type of Temple Run game on the 3DS sort of thing.
4702920	4711600	But maybe less Temple Run and more like puzzle minigame Egyptian tomb.
4711600	4712600	That's what it is.
4713040	4717160	All right, let's travel over to the UK, DarkSagra.
4717160	4724960	On the 30th, Chariot on PS4 and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PC and October 1st, Chariot
4724960	4728400	on Xbox One and I think that's it.
4728400	4734720	All right, let's see, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic
4734720	4736440	game of the week.
4736440	4741640	I'm looking at the states of the union argument going on in our chat right now.
4741680	4742680	Oh my gosh.
4742680	4743680	What about Alaska?
4743680	4744680	I'm about to leave chat.
4744680	4747600	What, uh, PlayStation 4 is region free, is it?
4747600	4749240	I thought it was region locked.
4749240	4750440	No.
4750440	4754120	I thought that was a big change in the new generation is that they were region locked.
4754120	4755120	I know the PS3 wasn't.
4755120	4757640	PS4 and Xbox One are not region locked.
4757640	4761200	Holy shit, I might have to, uh, well I don't really understand Japanese though.
4761200	4763520	I'm gonna have a hard time playing that game probably.
4763520	4764520	Which game?
4764520	4765520	Uh, the Quintet.
4765520	4766520	Oh.
4766520	4767520	RPG.
4767520	4771120	It's gonna like totally be in Japanese and I don't, you guys hear how horrible I am at
4771120	4773680	speaking and I don't understand it at all.
4773680	4774680	All right.
4774680	4777280	Anyhow, uh, let's go to those two more stories here.
4777280	4778280	Loki.
4778280	4783080	Well, unlike, uh, this should be something that people are getting used to on the Wii
4783080	4789680	U unfortunately, um, Ubisoft has confirmed that the bad blood downloadable content for
4789680	4795680	Watch Dogs will not be coming to the soon to be released Wii U version of the game.
4795680	4802800	And um, no, the Wii U version does not have DLC they confirmed and, um, they haven't really
4802800	4803880	said why.
4803880	4806920	But they've done that in the past I thought with Assassin's Creed where they didn't have
4806920	4810200	a DLC for that maybe or was it Batman?
4810200	4815580	One of those didn't have DLC even though Batman's not technically a Ubisoft game but it's kind
4815580	4816580	of weird.
4816580	4818420	I guess they just don't want to port it over.
4818420	4823480	Maybe they think that they're not gonna make their money back or something or maybe, I
4823480	4824940	don't know.
4824940	4830340	But yeah, they're lackluster support for the Wii U now and even more, less support
4830340	4833300	for any sort of download content for said games.
4833300	4835700	Why are they even bothering to release this game on the Wii U?
4835700	4839940	I think because it was, I think this is one of those games that was done already and they're
4839940	4841980	just waiting to release it.
4841980	4842980	Which is stupid.
4842980	4844140	I don't understand why.
4844140	4848060	It's gonna be an embarrassment and then people are gonna point at it and go, well this is
4848060	4851580	why we don't release games on the Wii U because this is how they sell.
4851620	4858300	Yeah, because you totally treated it like the bastard kid of the family, like it's gross
4858300	4859300	what they're doing with this.
4859300	4861900	They did that with Rayman Legends last year.
4861900	4863140	Uh huh.
4863140	4866220	And is, uh, why bother?
4866220	4869100	Or do a digital only release or something, save yourself the fucking trouble.
4869100	4873300	I think this is literally the last game that they have slated for the Wii U right now.
4873300	4874300	Just Dance, I'm sure.
4874300	4877700	Well yeah, Just Dance will be coming out because they make their money on the Wii U and Wii
4877700	4881380	for that but that's pretty much it.
4881380	4887420	Well still though, this comes out after Just Dance 2015 or whatever it's called this year.
4887420	4892220	So it is technically the last Wii U game that they have slated right now.
4892220	4895300	Maybe they're gonna go that way where they're just gonna, you know, they supported them
4895300	4898780	all this time but now they're just gonna cut support for the Wii U.
4898780	4899780	Which is sad.
4899780	4902900	Well I'm just saying it's kind of their own damn fault.
4902900	4904160	Yeah.
4904160	4908540	When you set games up to fail, surprise, they're gonna fail.
4908540	4909540	Why even bother at this point?
4909740	4915740	I mean, it's coming out so far after, you know, the launch of the, you know, Watchdog
4915740	4920900	game on the other systems so I don't understand what's the point of running out.
4920900	4926020	I mean, as much as I want to see Nintendo succeed and I want to see, I mean Nintendo's
4926020	4930260	got a lot of their own stuff that's gonna, you know, keep the Wii U afloat for a couple
4930260	4931260	of years, so whatever.
4931260	4933940	I kind of just hope this game doesn't sell a single copy.
4933940	4939460	That's not gonna happen, but yeah, it won't sell a lot of copies, you know, maybe a few
4939460	4941720	thousand.
4941720	4946980	I think though, I mean that just kind of cements support that yeah, these games aren't gonna
4946980	4947980	do that well.
4947980	4951380	But at the same time though, they're kind of, Ubisoft is kind of going this route where
4951380	4955300	they're doing these really huge games, aside from, you know, like the Assassin's Creed
4955300	4961820	and Far Cry franchises and stuff, but like they've got a few MMO-like games coming out
4961820	4962820	already.
4962820	4967260	They've got, was it The Division and they've also got The Crew coming out.
4967260	4973180	And both of those are gonna be these really vast multiplayer games, of which they're not
4973180	4975780	even gonna try to port that stuff over.
4975780	4978140	I just, I don't know.
4978140	4983060	Maybe they're just too ambitious in their, what they want to do on console I guess.
4983060	4987360	But, indies, indies will save the day I guess because, you know, Nintendo's gonna save their
4987360	4989100	own stuff with first party stuff.
4989100	4994060	I mean when the new Zelda next year comes out, it's gonna, you know, they've got enough
4994060	4998980	stuff to keep themselves afloat I think, but they're really probably gonna be thinking
4998980	5002500	on the drawing board how to get the third parties back with whatever they do next.
5002500	5009940	And also, let's just say that, hypothetically speaking, VR, retail VR takes off, once again
5009940	5016220	they're gonna be behind the game, well, technically they were ahead of the game, but yeah, that
5016220	5019620	wasn't, you know, much of an attempt.
5019620	5021020	So I don't know.
5021020	5025860	It's gonna be interesting to see what they do to, I mean Zelda will help, but let's just
5025860	5030580	say Zelda doesn't help enough, then what?
5030580	5034420	Then they rush that new system, I don't know.
5034420	5038260	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VOG Network.com,
5038260	5039860	use the passphrase, Sunday.
5039860	5044180	Alright, moving on to another game that won't be on Wii U, that's for sure, but it will
5044180	5046580	be on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.
5046580	5050660	We talked a lot about this game last week, coming off Tokyo Game Show, that's Final Fantasy
5050660	5051940	15.
5051940	5055180	And some more details have come out since Tokyo Game Show, just a little bit more about
5055180	5056180	it.
5056180	5062300	Right now, the director, Hajime Tabata, estimates that Final Fantasy 15 is like 55% complete,
5062300	5067140	which I kind of sit there and go, it's been this long and it's only 55% complete, so when's
5067140	5070980	this game coming out, like 2020 or when?
5070980	5075100	But obviously, it's, you know, the number's been held back a little bit because they've
5075100	5080260	had to reboot a few times, you know, and they say this is not the same game, the director's
5080260	5083700	different, the platform switched to the current gen, and because the platform changed, we
5083700	5087660	had to re-evaluate some things, so this is why, you know, it seems like the number's
5087660	5091340	so low, although it really does seem like we're gonna get this game next year, I mean,
5091340	5095820	we know the demo's coming in the early part of the year, so it may be a holiday release,
5095820	5101700	we'll see, I don't know, 55% right now, it may or may not, who knows.
5101700	5107540	Also, the road trip-like atmosphere is meant to inspire a sense of freedom in players,
5107540	5112580	and the open world elements are restrained a little bit for the sake of narrative, so
5112580	5116020	don't expect the game to be completely open world, but I'm assuming it's not gonna be
5116020	5121660	quite as bad as Final Fantasy XIII's first 10 hours either, so we'll see with that.
5121660	5126940	Combat, you do not just simply press a button once for a single action to happen, it's a
5126940	5128300	continuous flow of movement.
5128300	5130560	You have to push it several times.
5130560	5135220	It's more about the movements that are associated with the buttons and building upon them for
5135220	5139140	actions to go through the combat system, that, well, I mean, that really is gonna be different.
5139140	5143180	That reminds me of, like, was it Xenogears, remember Xenogears, where they had, like,
5143180	5148180	a combo system where you would, you know, tap different button presses to do different
5148180	5149180	attacks?
5149180	5150180	That was kinda cool.
5150180	5155460	So, uh, they are saying that Episode Duske, I don't know how to even say that word, this
5155460	5158900	is gonna be the demo that comes out for the game, and they're gonna say it's an hour's
5158900	5163860	worth of narrative content, but three to four hours of gameplay if you fully explore the
5163860	5165060	game's world.
5165060	5166220	And the demo.
5166220	5168060	That's a pretty impressive thing.
5168060	5173500	That's longer than fuckin' ground zeroes, so, bravo to you for giving that away for
5173500	5174500	free.
5174500	5178500	Well, free in quotes, because it's with the Final Fantasy Type 0.
5178500	5181340	But they are also gonna have the demo available afterwards, remember?
5181340	5182820	Oh, that's right, that's right.
5182820	5187480	Also, a lot of memes and things coming out about the Broad Trip that we saw in the Tokyo
5187480	5191940	Game Show trailer, I just kinda wanted to say on that, like, I'm sure that's probably
5191940	5196780	part of the story, but I think it's also one part, and I think we'd be a little silly
5196780	5202500	to assume that's gonna be the entire game, is Broad Trip, Final Fantasy Broad Trip, because
5202500	5207780	in that first trailer we saw for the game, where they announced that it changed from,
5207780	5213820	you know, versus 13 to 15, we saw a lot of other stuff that wasn't just that.
5213820	5218180	So, just kinda throwing that out there, that I would expect that maybe the Broad Trip is
5218180	5221820	what we'll see in the demo, but I imagine there's gotta be more to it.
5221820	5229820	So, all right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane, back to a time where, you know,
5229820	5235220	you didn't have four hour demos of games, you read about them in Nintendo Power, that
5235220	5240100	was your option, because they're not gonna produce a cartridge with a four hour demo
5240100	5241100	in it.
5241100	5244180	That's right, it's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer's gonna step into
5244180	5247940	the gaming vault and find a game, and she thinks, hey, you should check out this game
5247940	5248940	this week.
5248940	5252780	Forget all this new shit, this is all stupid.
5252780	5255020	Check out this classic.
5255020	5258460	Dark Soccer, back on her CPS kick this week, yes?
5258460	5259460	CPS2.
5259460	5266140	The game is 1944 The Loop Master, which is a vertical scrolling shooter made by Capcom,
5266140	5272280	it came out in 2000, and this actually was not programmed by Capcom, but done by Rising.
5272280	5278280	It's the fifth of a series of World War II shooters that Capcom made in the 19XX series.
5278280	5287160	It actually is the sequel to 19XX The War Against Destiny, and it has a lot of the same
5287160	5296660	planes, including the P-38 Lightning and Mitsubishi A6M-0, but does not include the De Havilland
5296660	5300060	Mosquito and the Q-Shooter J7W.
5300060	5302700	Those were replaced by others.
5302700	5309260	So basically it's just your standard shooter, you know, you shoot planes, tanks, battleships,
5309260	5315820	other boats, other things, but it's a lot more like the earlier games as opposed to
5315820	5318060	19XX.
5318060	5323500	You get the different stats for the planes, each of them operate equally, one is the first
5323500	5328820	or second player, and they do have the form change that was in 19XX.
5328820	5333540	You hold the fire button, charge it until it's full, and then the plane will fly up
5333540	5335060	and become temporarily invincible.
5335060	5339620	It also has a bomb button that uses Tomahawk missiles.
5339620	5345520	You also have the wingmen in the game as well, where you get a small golden plane icon that
5345520	5348900	comes down the screen that will release a wingman icon.
5348900	5355060	And that gives you firepower, but they are vulnerable to enemy fire, and in stage 8 they
5355060	5356060	fire laser shots.
5356060	5360340	There are 15 stages in the game.
5360340	5364840	On the arcade board actually you get an option to start from 1, 6, or 11.
5364840	5371380	If it's set to endless, then you can also choose 1, 2, or 3, and of course with different
5371380	5373200	difficulties you go through.
5373200	5381020	And after destroying the level 15 boss, you actually get back to stage, the first stage,
5381020	5382020	it's a loop.
5382020	5385380	Therefore, you can play the game endlessly.
5385380	5388320	And the enemies will fire more rapidly if it's set to endless.
5388320	5391100	So it's the loop master for a reason.
5391100	5393800	And that's it.
5393800	5397660	So you do eventually master the loop when you beat the game, because everything comes
5397660	5398660	full circle.
5398660	5400660	So there it is.
5400660	5403100	Alright, I forgot about this one.
5403100	5406540	I mean, I of course know the 1944 shooters.
5406540	5413380	You know, one of them was on the NES, it was 1942, 43, maybe both of them, but I forgot
5413380	5414380	about 44.
5414380	5415380	Yeah.
5415380	5421840	Well, technically the big one that a lot of people do remember in the series is 19XX as
5421840	5427940	far as the arcade ones go, because that one got really big right around that time.
5427940	5431220	The loop master was a little bit, I'd say lesser known.
5431220	5435220	Well, XX was also a little bit more like Raiden, I think, wasn't it?
5435220	5436220	It was.
5436900	5442300	It had a lot more of that just sort of fantastical element to it.
5442300	5447180	This is like fun though, and it does the widescreen thing too, which is a very different look
5447180	5449780	from the other 19 games, so.
5449780	5452380	It's also on a arcade cabinet sitting right behind you.
5452380	5453380	Is it?
5453380	5454460	Is it really?
5454460	5458180	I gotta get my little booster thing that I was supposed to get this weekend and didn't,
5458180	5459180	so.
5459180	5462620	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, 1944, the loop master.
5462620	5464300	There you go.
5464300	5465300	You master the loops.
5465380	5471380	Just like you do at Cedar Point, apparently, there, in 1944.
5471380	5473140	Alright, we're gonna take a break.
5473140	5476820	When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come, including rapid fire
5476820	5483020	news, the FUGAL QUESTION OF THE WEEK, talk about Minecraft clones on some big consoles,
5483020	5489340	and it sounds like maybe League of Legends getting another Supernanny step for the very
5489340	5495180	naughty players, and, and, SCIENCE, when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5495180	5496660	Alright, after this.
5503140	5508500	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, September the
5508500	5516460	28th, 2014, our 569th show, already in progress, and we're gonna get to some rapid fire news.
5516460	5520260	But let me, let me ask this question of, of Dark Soccer and Loki and, and all the folks
5520260	5524880	that are listening live tonight, do I, do I need to get Orange Lounge Radio and Ello?
5524880	5527320	Is that, is that where the, is that where the internet's going?
5527320	5529320	Do I need, does, do we need an O-L-R-L-O?
5529320	5530320	No.
5530320	5532320	Why not?
5532320	5533320	Because we don't.
5533320	5536320	Wouldn't it be like an O-L-O-R?
5536320	5537320	O-L-O-R?
5537320	5540000	Oh, I like that one.
5540000	5541000	That's good.
5541000	5545000	Uh, but, no, I mean, I guess, I guess people have kind of had it with Facebook and, and
5545000	5548320	are talking to these other social networks, although I have an LO account.
5548320	5551320	If you want to follow me on LO, I'm Rob Roberts, it's not a video, you're not going to find
5551320	5552320	anything.
5552320	5553320	Mine's Dark Soccer.
5553320	5554560	Yeah, you're not going to find anything on there that exciting.
5555240	5556240	Maybe a selfie or two.
5556240	5561040	I, I, uh, submitted a request to get one, just, oh, fuck of it.
5561040	5563560	I'm sure her, I could get you an invite if you really want one.
5563560	5564560	I don't really care.
5564560	5566440	I just, you know, put myself on there.
5566440	5567440	I mean, whatever.
5567440	5572120	But here's, okay, so here's the thing with that is that, like, everybody's talking like,
5572120	5577360	oh, you know, Facebook's screwed because everybody's going to LO, but like, LO isn't Facebook.
5577360	5582800	LO is missing a lot that Facebook has, and not that I'm saying, you know, we should all
5582800	5586840	kneel and worship at the altar of Facebook, because believe me, there's a lot about Facebook
5586840	5588280	that pisses me off.
5588280	5592600	And that whole rabble rabble you're hearing with the drag queens about the real name policy,
5592600	5593600	guess what?
5593600	5595860	It doesn't just affect drag queens.
5595860	5598480	It affects roller derby girls.
5598480	5601320	It affects transgender individuals.
5601320	5604780	It affects people that are trying to hide from stalkers.
5604780	5610320	It affects sassy internet podcasters who don't feel like using their real name to keep their
5610320	5611920	online life separate, you know?
5611920	5614960	It affects the luchador industry.
5614960	5616440	It affects a lot of people.
5616440	5621100	And so I think people are, and what really pissed me off personally is when Zuckerberg
5621100	5626600	in some, some interview or something had the audacity to say, if you don't use your real
5626600	5629440	name, you don't have integrity or something like that.
5629440	5633320	And like, I don't have a middle finger big enough for that guy after hearing that because
5633320	5638480	it's like, okay, says the guy who literally wrote a business after, you know, using people's
5638480	5640800	personal information and profiting off that.
5640800	5641800	Wait a second.
5641800	5646800	I don't have integrity because I use the name that people know me by on my Facebook.
5646800	5649520	People are convinced this is my name, which I'm fine with.
5649520	5651280	I completely forgot this.
5651280	5654680	So the website's L O dot co or L loco.
5654680	5655680	Yeah, it is.
5655680	5656680	It is.
5656680	5657680	It's perfect for the luchadors.
5657680	5658680	It's perfect.
5658680	5659680	L loco.
5659680	5660880	I love it.
5660880	5662040	And then, uh, let's see.
5662040	5666940	So, uh, and then, uh, VXJ's next V links to one of those articles that talks about the
5666940	5671320	dark side of L O, which I always am going to anticipate whenever something starts to
5671320	5674600	grab momentum, there's always going to be that article about the dark side.
5674600	5676780	I'm calling it L loco from now on.
5676780	5684960	It's seriously, it's L loco and act, act deaf actually says he, it's a real thing.
5684960	5687620	Even though I was joking about it and he has luchador friends.
5687620	5688620	That's awesome.
5688620	5691920	And, uh, VXJ's next V says the food glow question of the week.
5691920	5693280	Uh, probably not.
5693280	5698720	I don't, unless L O really catches some more steam and fixes some of these other things
5698720	5699720	they've got going on.
5699720	5700780	I don't really see us.
5700780	5706880	My weekly O L R is on today post on L O. Did you see it?
5706880	5710480	I did, but I couldn't, I couldn't retweet it and I couldn't favorite it.
5710480	5715880	That's why I removed the retweet or repost or whatever, because whatevs.
5715880	5716880	Yeah.
5716880	5717880	All right.
5717880	5718920	So anyway, there you go.
5718920	5720520	A little, little L O talk.
5720520	5723240	I'll be curious to see how L O is doing in seven days.
5723240	5724240	We'll see.
5724240	5728520	In the meantime, let's talk about some other gaming news going on around the industry back
5728520	5729520	to games.
5729520	5732280	And I don't, I don't think I've seen any video game companies on L O yet.
5732280	5733280	So we'll see.
5733280	5734280	All right.
5734280	5735280	Let's move on now.
5735280	5736280	Loki.
5736280	5737280	Hey, what do you know?
5737280	5741200	There's an actual guitar game coming out for PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5741200	5742200	Yes.
5742200	5747000	They're porting Rocksmith 2014 to PlayStation four and Xbox one's going to be coming out
5747000	5749280	a little bit later this year.
5749280	5754200	And um, I guess this was outed through the ESRB listing for the game.
5754200	5756040	So cool.
5756040	5759760	And uh, maybe the DLC will transfer as well for that stuff.
5759760	5760760	So I'm pretty cool.
5760760	5765400	And I'm assuming that it comes with the, you know, the USB thing that plug into your guitar
5765400	5766400	too.
5766400	5768360	So rock on.
5768360	5774120	Um, so Xbox live games with gold for October, they've got a few games coming out, uh, for
5774120	5778920	Xbox three 60 members will get, uh, Darksiders two and battlefield bad company.
5778920	5783080	Of course, battlefield bad company being the first game, um, that's available from October
5783080	5788280	first through the 15th and Darksiders two from the 16th through the 31st.
5788280	5796520	Um, and then for Xbox one it, uh, for you, which, uh, chariots is going to be the game
5796520	5797960	that's going to be coming out.
5797960	5801680	And that was actually a, one of the, uh, ID at Xbox games.
5801680	5803920	So God love those indie games.
5803920	5809000	I'm surprised we haven't seen an actual retail Xbox one game yet, or maybe we're just not
5809000	5812240	at that point yet since the system hasn't even been out for a year yet to be fair.
5812240	5817400	We haven't had a retail PlayStation four game either on PlayStation plus yet.
5817400	5822600	So there's, nobody's kind of broken that barrier yet, although I don't know what's, what's
5822600	5828200	happening with drive club because they're going to get, it's like a, uh, stripped down
5828200	5834360	version, I guess like a demo, it's like a Ridge racer Vita version of the game, if you
5834360	5835360	will.
5835360	5839080	Um, you know where they're going to have a few cars, a few tracks, and you can purchase
5839080	5843000	the rest piecemeal, or you can purchase just an upgrade, the upgrade to the full version,
5843000	5846840	but it's not going to be as much as buying the full version of the game, I guess.
5846840	5847840	Interesting.
5847840	5854320	Um, I mean, it's cool that they have that kind of a demo out there, um, and, uh, battlefield
5854320	5858480	bad company too, and dark sires, you haven't played those yet, despite the fact that dark
5858480	5862600	sires two has been sitting in my steam library forever now, but I still haven't played it
5862600	5863600	shock.
5863600	5868640	Um, such as the way of the steam library and, and you know, me, you know, I've just like
5868680	5870960	every month that they have free stuff, we're going to download that.
5870960	5875920	I got download, I got download that I'm like, I'm not going to play these games on my X-Box
5875920	5876920	got up.
5876920	5877920	I got them all.
5877920	5878920	It's seriously.
5878920	5879920	It's like, Oh God, I get that.
5879920	5884480	Cause what, what if I want to play that one day then I'm going to, I need it, you know,
5884480	5885480	so seriously.
5885480	5889000	Um, but yeah, might as well, I mean, it's free, you know, and, and that's the thing
5889000	5892800	is like when I was, uh, you know, through my retail job and still not retail, but through
5892800	5898280	my job at work, um, I get Microsoft training and stuff that I do on my own.
5898280	5902880	And each year they have a accreditation program for X-Box and what's the reward for finishing
5902880	5903880	that?
5903880	5904880	You're alive.
5904880	5906720	So I'm always, you know, got live gold aside.
5906720	5912560	I wish they had that on Sony's end because I could use some PlayStation plus right now.
5912560	5913560	That's it.
5913560	5918680	Um, Oh, and then, um, last but not least, um, even though it's already been announced
5918680	5922360	that, you know, Amazon is purchasing twist, they have finished their acquisitions.
5922360	5929120	So money's changed hands or at least some of that and is now owned by Amazon.
5929120	5937980	So cool is officially part of the Amazon collective, which is, I like Amazon well enough.
5937980	5941200	So again, I'm curious to see if being a prime member is going to get me any perks.
5941200	5945640	I, you know, I don't know if they will do anything because Amazon does own other companies,
5945640	5949400	like for example, Zappos, and they really haven't done anything with that.
5949400	5952640	Aside from, you know, they own it, but nothing has really changed.
5952640	5953640	Very true.
5953640	5954640	Very true.
5954640	5955640	All right.
5955640	5958480	Well, moving on to some other news, uh, you know, Super Smash Brothers 3DS is coming out
5958480	5963560	here in the States soon, but it's been out in Japan for about a week now and, uh, there's
5963560	5966460	some glitches that are being found inside the game.
5966460	5970600	And one of them, uh, is apparently there's a glitch in the game where you will hear a
5970600	5978200	cheer, uh, a taunter, not really cheer, but like an audience, um, demand or chant an audience
5978200	5980000	chant for the ice climbers.
5980000	5984300	Well, as you know, the ice climbers are not in the new Smash Brothers game.
5984300	5986760	So, uh, that is very interesting.
5986760	5991120	Uh, we've heard that, you know, they were supposed to be in there, but that the 3DS
5991120	5994000	didn't really have the processing power to keep them in.
5994000	5995880	Maybe the Wii U will have it though.
5995880	5996880	Maybe the Wii U.
5996880	6000520	Although isn't it supposed to be cross, can you play like, uh, versus someone on the Wii
6000520	6001520	U?
6001520	6002520	No, I don't think so.
6002520	6008120	Although they wanted to really keep the games in parody, maybe DLC on, like, maybe DLC
6008120	6010120	that only works with the new 3DS or something.
6010120	6011120	I mean, I don't know.
6011120	6012120	I'm getting really crazy with that.
6012120	6017400	I just can't believe that that can't support, like, I don't even get that, that they can't...
6017400	6019120	I'm sorry, that character's too complex.
6019120	6020120	I mean, why?
6020120	6021120	It's just two characters.
6021120	6025280	Well, because the problem was with all four people playing ice climbers is when it was
6025280	6026280	a problem.
6026280	6027280	Oh.
6027280	6028280	Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
6028280	6029280	Yeah.
6029280	6030280	So, anyhow.
6030280	6032640	Uh, so yeah, you can, uh, hear that.
6032640	6033640	That's pretty cool.
6034160	6035160	Uh, anyhow.
6035160	6040560	Um, also on Super Smash Brothers, uh, this will probably surprise nobody, uh, some people
6040560	6046560	finding in the Japanese version there's a stage DLC content in the ROM dump.
6046560	6051040	So apparently, uh, there are some stages that will appear later on through DLC.
6051040	6054220	Well, I mean, that seems like a big duh, doesn't it?
6054220	6055960	Also a duh.
6055960	6057640	Content for LittleBigPlanet 3!
6057640	6063080	Uh, yes, LittleBigPlanet 3, of course, coming very soon to PlayStation 4, what, November
6063080	6064080	18th?
6064080	6065080	I believe is when the game's out.
6065080	6070460	And, uh, there will be some Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes Sackboy stuff.
6070460	6074280	So yeah, you can, uh, put a little eye patch on your Sackboy and you can have your little
6074280	6076480	Sackboy tank and all this other stuff.
6076480	6077480	So that's pretty cool.
6077480	6083080	Skull Face, Miller Outfits, uh, the game releases on November 18th, of course, LittleBigPlanet.
6083080	6087520	We don't know when these come out, but it will be soon.
6087520	6091800	Also, um, Order 1886 costume is supposed to be a part of that too.
6091800	6092800	That's pretty neat.
6093240	6098040	And lastly, what would you say if I said Suikoden 6?
6098040	6099040	Hmm.
6099040	6101080	I would say there's a lot of characters in it.
6101080	6102080	That's right.
6102080	6105200	Well, unfortunately, I'm not here to tell you that Suikoden 6 is happening.
6105200	6110120	Uh, what I'm telling you is that, uh, Yuichi Haga, who's the online content producer for
6110120	6114840	Konami Digital Entertainment, was doing a livestream for Suikoden 2, and of course there
6114840	6117640	was a ton of questions about Suikoden 6.
6117680	6124800	And no update, sadly, about this RPG being developed, but Japanese fans apparently associate
6124800	6130640	Suikoden with the Konami brand more than any other franchise, meaning Metal Gear, Pro Evo
6130640	6136480	Soccer, Castlevania, and yes, even DDR, uh, it gets, uh, not as associated as much as
6136480	6137480	Suikoden does.
6137480	6139760	They tried to forget about Silent Hill lately.
6139760	6140760	Apparently.
6140760	6141760	Until the PT.
6141760	6142760	Yeah, until PT.
6142760	6146080	And, uh, here in the US, I would think, oh my gosh, people have to think like Castlevania
6146080	6147080	before they would think of Suikoden.
6147520	6150040	Don't get me wrong, I love Suikoden, but, you know.
6150040	6152360	Castlevania and Gradius, maybe?
6152360	6153360	I don't know.
6153360	6156800	But nowadays, I guess they would think Metal Gear, I would imagine.
6156800	6158000	Metal Gear.
6158000	6163880	By the way, Suikoden 5, eight years ago on the PlayStation 2, was the last entry in the
6163880	6164880	series.
6164880	6167160	Uh, why was, why was Suikoden 2 being streamed?
6167160	6171560	Well, it was to show the head of honchos in Japan that fans are interested in the re-release
6171560	6176440	of the game as a digital offering on the Sony Entertainment Network store, because the game
6176440	6181720	was rated for PS3 and PlayStation Portable, but it never actually came out, which kinda
6181720	6182720	sucks.
6182720	6187560	And if Shane was in the studio, I'm sure he would be having a cry, because I know he loves
6187560	6188560	Suikoden 2.
6188560	6190840	But then he'd just be like, whatever, I can play my PSP version.
6190840	6196040	I can't imagine there would be that much work to put, like, any of those games on the PlayStation
6196040	6197040	store.
6197040	6198040	I mean...
6198040	6202360	I have heard that it is incredibly easy to get a game on PlayStation 3.
6202360	6203360	Just put everything.
6203360	6205040	Fuck, if it doesn't sell, who cares?
6205040	6208080	Not on PS, but like, what are those, like, PS1 is incredibly easy process.
6208080	6211240	Just like, yeah, just seriously put everything that you have.
6211240	6212560	Why hold yourself back?
6212560	6217480	That, that, that, I mean, I guess the only re- that, that kind of boils it down, like,
6217480	6221320	with, uh, you know, the e-sh, I guess the eShop and the Virtual Console releases.
6221320	6225600	Like, I never understood, I mean, they do a little bit more now, I guess, but I never
6225600	6229080	understood why, if it was so easy to put that stuff on there, why didn't you just dump a
6229080	6230080	whole bunch of stuff?
6230080	6234600	I guess maybe, you know, they'd lose stuff, but I, they don't really have regular releases.
6234600	6239160	It's like, maybe a couple games each week, if we're lucky, a few, a couple games each
6239160	6240160	month.
6240160	6241160	I don't know, I just don't...
6241160	6245240	And now with PlayStation Now, but, I mean, I, I understand that PlayStation Now is supposed
6245240	6249360	to bring trophy support to old games and things like that, I mean, we're not seeing it yet.
6249360	6250360	That would be a little bit more complicated.
6250360	6254600	That would be a little more complicated, but, um, hopefully some games will do it.
6254600	6257760	Maybe that's something they're holding Suikoden for, who knows?
6257760	6262000	I mean, if they announce that Suikoden was, like, one of the first PS2 games on PlayStation
6262000	6266640	Now, it would definitely give that service a big kick in the butt, like, in the up direction,
6266640	6267640	I think.
6267640	6270540	Whereas a lot of people are bitching about the price now and all that stuff, I mean,
6270540	6274680	if they sold Suikoden 2 at a flat fee with, like, trophy support and shit on PlayStation
6274680	6277580	Now, that's a huge boost for the service, I think.
6277580	6281840	But of course, I'm being very tinfoil-hat with that, but, you know, could be a thing,
6281840	6282840	could be a thing.
6282840	6283840	Uh, DarkSakura.
6283840	6291280	Well, uh, Sega 3D Classics was, uh, released, well, announced in Japan for a retail release,
6291280	6296360	which will include, uh, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Outrun, Streets of Rage, Shinobi II,
6296360	6302480	Echo the Dolphin, um, Space Harrier, I already said Space Harrier, um, Outrun, uh, I already
6302480	6304480	said Outrun, too, didn't I?
6304480	6305480	Yeah.
6305480	6306480	Whatever.
6306480	6308240	Um, anyway, um, thank you, List, for being redundant.
6308240	6314480	Um, but anyway, it will be, uh, 3980 yen, um, and will be out December 18th for the
6314480	6318520	Nintendo 3DS, and hopefully we will hear about a US release before too long.
6318520	6322800	But I can tell you, if it's the same one as the Sega Ages release that came out, um,
6322800	6326360	those 3D versions of Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone are really good.
6326360	6330680	A bunch of fans have said, you know what, not having Mother 4 is shit, so they're making
6330680	6331680	it themselves.
6331680	6336960	Um, there's a fan-made project that's going to be out on PC, Mac, and Linux for free,
6336960	6342160	and it will basically be faithful to the story and art style of the last Mother games.
6342160	6348600	And last but not least, the bundle I just bought was the Humble Bundle weekly, uh, female
6348600	6349960	protagonist bundle.
6349960	6356720	It's called the Leading Ladies Bundle, and, um, so it has, uh, Ms. Splosion Man, uh, Lily
6356720	6364280	Looking Through, uh, RPG Defenders Quest, Valley of the Forgotten, um, and the Cat Lady,
6364280	6367280	which I kind of wanted for a while, so I just got it just to get Cat Lady.
6367280	6375000	Um, you can pay, uh, 6 bucks or more and get the Yogg and, or, uh, Long Live the Queen.
6375000	6381320	If you pay 10 bucks or more, you get, uh, the, uh, Valda's Story, Abyssal City.
6381320	6385800	So a good portion of the proceeds will go to Girls Make Games charity.
6385800	6386800	Go get it.
6386800	6388640	Buy lots of it.
6388640	6389640	I love the Humble Bundle.
6389640	6391480	They have a lot of good stuff on there.
6391480	6395760	Oh, it's a great way to contribute to my Steam library of games that I intend on playing
6395760	6396760	at some point.
6396760	6400200	Yeah, see, like, I wanted to buy the new Humble Bundle, but there's just too many repeats
6400200	6401840	for stuff that I have already.
6401840	6406960	Uh, SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, uh, responding to one of the other things
6406960	6411760	you talked about, DarkSakura, uh, SGA100Matt says, ETA to the shutdown order of that Mother
6411760	6412760	Project.
6412760	6413760	Yes.
6413760	6414760	Sadly, with Nintendo involved.
6414760	6416040	That's why you don't announce those things.
6416040	6417880	You just do it and release it.
6417880	6420600	When it's on the internet, it's done.
6420600	6421600	Exactly.
6421600	6424080	Maybe they're, maybe they're trying to recruit help.
6424080	6425480	That's probably part of the reason.
6425480	6428560	And so they have to kind of put it out there to recruit the help because, you know, you
6428560	6430200	got to work for free with stuff like that.
6430200	6434040	So that's why you use a project name and not, I don't know.
6434040	6435040	Yeah.
6435040	6436040	Might be hard though.
6436040	6437040	All right.
6437040	6438040	Uh, let's get to the foogle.
6438040	6439040	Sorry.
6439040	6442480	Not the fugello, but the foogle.
6442480	6443480	The foogle question.
6443480	6444480	Someday maybe.
6444480	6445480	I like that.
6445480	6448200	Foogle horn question of the week.
6448200	6455320	Did you ever play a foogle horn, DarkSakura?
6455320	6457840	I know you played a lot of instruments.
6457840	6458840	No.
6458840	6459840	I've eaten bugles though.
6459840	6460840	Does that count?
6460840	6461840	Delicious.
6461840	6462840	Not quite.
6462840	6464840	They're very corny, I guess.
6464840	6465840	Like your jokes.
6465840	6466840	All right.
6466840	6470440	Uh, you take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam those together, you get foogle plus
6470440	6473720	and the foogle question of the week.
6473720	6475080	Uh, let's get to it.
6475080	6479040	Every week we ask a question and this week is about PlayStation Home and we asked, will
6479040	6480040	you miss it?
6480040	6481040	Did you ever give it a try?
6481040	6482400	Are you sad to see it go?
6482400	6483400	Why or why not?
6483400	6487640	Uh, we'll start off over on Facebook with Burr who says, I always found it amusing when
6487640	6491760	people would compare Home to Second Life, only look at the graphics missing the point
6491760	6494080	late that the latter is all user created.
6494080	6497720	Make some tired joke about flying dongs and declare Home superior.
6497720	6502160	Meanwhile, Second Life is still alive and its graphics have improved to a point surpassing
6502160	6503160	Home.
6503160	6505680	KJ says, I won't miss PlayStation Home.
6505680	6509280	Well, maybe the 49 cents I paid for a ninja costume.
6509280	6511240	I miss my 49 cents frown.
6511240	6514220	Are you going to miss your Santa Claus outfit, Logie?
6514220	6519120	My guy seriously looks like a drunken, uh, like hobo Santa.
6519120	6522840	So it'll be, it'll make sense if I'm PlayStation homeless.
6522840	6524900	All right.
6524900	6527440	Let's go to Segg next who gave us two answers.
6527440	6532120	He gave us a TLDR version, but to be honest, I liked the long form answer, so I'm going
6532120	6533120	to read it.
6534080	6537960	In conversations about this in the past few weeks, the like dislike had a very interesting
6537960	6539600	gender overtone to it.
6539600	6543360	My friends who identify as male either liked it enough to enjoy what was there for free
6543360	6544780	or didn't care about it.
6544780	6546840	My female friends tried it out.
6546840	6551560	Get sexually harassed by men via the chat and character actions, never to return.
6551560	6553360	Home is best remembered by learning from the flaws.
6553360	6557880	The platform decisions you make in a game will directly affect the society it creates.
6557880	6560360	Playing with friends was hard if not impossible.
6560360	6563800	Even with all the premium housing, costumes, items, et cetera, there wasn't a good way
6563800	6565720	to show that off to people you know.
6565720	6567840	There was no way to make a better environment for yourself.
6567840	6569160	We all lived in public.
6569160	6572600	This leaves one with a sea of random people, abuse and all where flagging the behavior
6572600	6574320	was a journey in itself.
6574320	6576360	There were games that I enjoyed in the home platform.
6576360	6577360	Sure.
6577360	6580080	There were low level and basic, but some were fun, especially for free.
6580080	6584200	Ultimately, Sony didn't place their investments in the right way to make home better.
6584200	6588400	What we've left is what we're left with is a mediocre or less experience, which we can
6588400	6590080	learn lessons from in the future.
6590080	6593920	I think Destiny learned a bit of home's problems with the fire team functions.
6593920	6597600	Easy to add friends in a group, then everyone's always in the same instance of gameplay.
6597600	6601600	When you play with randoms, you don't see, you don't hear or see them speak.
6601600	6605160	Still, I'll take Uru missed online any day.
6605160	6607920	Note a friend of mine worked on home and is losing his job with his closure.
6607920	6611200	Thankfully, it's known with a timeline, so he's in a much better position to find his
6611200	6612560	next job.
6612560	6619400	So I know that was a long answer, but it definitely brought an interesting thing to light with
6619400	6621920	that whole gender issue.
6621920	6622920	It's not.
6622920	6623920	Yeah.
6623920	6625520	I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily a gender issue.
6625520	6629640	It's more of a people are anonymous on the Internet and they act like assholes issue.
6629640	6635520	And this has been something ever since voice chat on the Internet was not even voice chat.
6635520	6637520	Like chatting on the Internet was a thing.
6637520	6639360	Oh, my God, a girl.
6639360	6640360	Show me your boobs.
6640360	6643720	And it doesn't even be like it doesn't even have to be that you're a girl.
6643720	6647640	And I mean, if you're a nature of people, if your avatar is a girl in the game, you're
6647640	6651640	gonna get people acting like idiots because they can anonymously because there's no way
6651640	6653000	to get it tracked back to you.
6653000	6654000	Yeah.
6654000	6655000	We don't need feminism.
6655000	6657600	Just saying slash sarcasm.
6657600	6659280	But I like to play.
6659280	6661780	My character in Destiny's female.
6661780	6664960	Of course, I got punched in the face the other day, but I think that would have happened
6664960	6666160	no matter what.
6666160	6668680	But anyway, moving on.
6668680	6672520	Gaming nerd says I've never tried it myself and was always curious to check it out and
6672520	6673800	see what it was like.
6673800	6677400	Maybe some time before it shuts down for good, I'll have a look just to see what I've missed
6677400	6678760	out on.
6678760	6682320	And Chiggers says they should give everyone a store credit if they spent real money on
6682320	6684920	clothes or accessories since they're shutting it down.
6684920	6688720	See, Chiggers, I understand where that reaction comes from.
6688720	6694320	But the problem is this is something you have to understand when you buy gear in a virtual
6694320	6695320	game.
6695320	6696320	That game will go away.
6696320	6697320	And it doesn't matter what it is.
6697320	6699280	It's typically written into the terms of service as well.
6699280	6701600	So you agreed that they have the right to do this.
6701600	6702600	Exactly.
6702600	6706400	And I know it kind of like sucks in retrospect, but like literally any game you've bought
6706400	6710680	digital content for, that's another reason why I get nervous buying digital games.
6710680	6714840	I mean, sure, I can always redownload the game at a later date if I, you know, delete
6714840	6716180	the game off my system.
6716180	6721640	But what if one day Microsoft shuts off Xbox Live?
6721640	6723520	I mean, someday that's going to happen.
6723520	6726760	That's going to suck for being Titanfall.
6726760	6730520	So that's just I mean, these are all things you have to consider is that it is unlimited
6730520	6731520	time.
6731520	6737520	Anyway, just the thing that people need to realize, though, is that it's not they forced
6737520	6739480	you to do this or this, that, the other.
6739480	6740480	You agreed to it.
6740480	6741480	Yeah.
6741480	6743840	If you didn't agree to it, then you wouldn't be playing it right now.
6743840	6745540	It's also like a digital rental.
6745540	6747760	You know, you watch the movie and now it's gone.
6747760	6751600	Well, you don't get your money back, you know, because you got the value out of it for that
6751600	6755440	limited time that you agreed to, I guess, is the closest comparison I can think of.
6755440	6760600	Anyway, I don't mean to poo poo your opinion, Chiggers, but I just I kind of go, I see
6760600	6763760	that what you're saying is kind of like a real kind of like gut reaction.
6763760	6767360	But if you really kind of like look at the bigger picture, it's like, oh, anything digital
6767360	6769000	is going to have this problem.
6769000	6771680	And we hear this a lot with anything digital that shuts down.
6771680	6772680	All right.
6772680	6773680	I am the laziest.
6773680	6774680	I love.
6774680	6776400	No, I am the laziest.
6776400	6780160	No, I am the I am the laziest one.
6780160	6784560	I Dark Sakura just yawned.
6784560	6786040	She is the laziest.
6786040	6787680	All right.
6787680	6788680	Wow.
6788680	6794080	The man claiming to be the laziest says, I gave it a shot when I first got my PS3.
6794080	6797440	Then when I actually got games, I ignored it.
6797440	6801240	S2100 Matt says, I think home was a great idea ahead of its time.
6801240	6802280	That just didn't work out.
6802280	6807560	I think the next incarnation of it as possibly an onboard OS will be more useful and intuitive.
6807560	6810840	I was really hyped for it when it was announced because I saw the possibility of it being
6810840	6813460	a cool gaming social network.
6813460	6818900	And I finally played it when I got a PS3 many years later, and it looked totally deserted.
6818900	6822420	Over to Google Plus and getting some of our answers over there.
6822420	6826900	I think we had just a couple of answers on Google Plus, and I'm waiting on Google Plus
6826900	6828460	to load and show me those answers.
6828460	6829460	Here we go.
6829460	6830460	We have three comments tonight.
6830460	6832580	I'll start with DNL.
6832580	6833580	I love DNL.
6833580	6838420	DNL says, I used PlayStation Home and once upon a time was tapped to join the team.
6838420	6839540	I turned them down.
6839540	6844020	Ultimately, the execution of the system was not self-sustaining, monetization of the content
6844020	6848020	was non-existent, and integration into the home system was not seamless.
6848020	6852100	It was cumbersome to use at best, and I'm sad to say that the vision of the overall
6852100	6853540	product was shortchanged.
6853540	6856140	I'll be sad to see it go.
6856140	6860620	A very respectful but very accurate read that I have to agree with.
6860620	6865820	I mean, I think she hits the nail on the head when she says, where is it?
6865820	6867900	Integration into the home system was not seamless.
6867900	6869620	It was cumbersome to use at best.
6869620	6875420	I mean, that's my biggest issue with it, is that like on paper, I love the idea of home,
6875420	6881380	but like, here's me with my big finger pointing up saying this.
6881380	6888180	Anyhow, Reddertainment says, I remember spending a couple of hours fooling around in PlayStation
6888180	6889180	Home.
6889180	6892020	I played some of the games, wandered around in some of the spaces, and even took in the
6892020	6894940	uncharted area of home that Naughty Dog had set up.
6894940	6899740	In the end, I didn't find enough compelling inside of home to spend and substantive time
6899740	6903300	in it outside of the handful of times I briefly logged on.
6903300	6906560	Unfortunately, this is the experience that most people had with home.
6906560	6912020	Much like 1 versus 100, home had the promise of potential that was never actually realized.
6912020	6914460	Oh, kick me in the gut, why don't you?
6914460	6915980	But see, here's where I would argue.
6915980	6923500	One versus 100, I think was a little more realized in a way.
6923500	6928820	But anyway, I mean, can you imagine if they built something like 1 versus 100 into PlayStation
6928820	6929820	Home?
6929820	6934260	The biggest hurdle to that would have just been that seamlessness that we heard about
6934260	6935260	in the other comment.
6935260	6939980	But anyway, one more answer from ActDeft who says, PS Home wasn't something that appealed
6939980	6942500	to me or something that I had to get a PS3 for.
6942500	6945880	It had potential, but it lacked substance, so I can see why it failed and why it's getting
6945880	6946940	taken down.
6946940	6950420	Sucks for the people that actually enjoyed it and also had bought stuff for it, but in
6950420	6954160	this day and age of digital content, nothing lasts forever.
6954160	6955160	True facts.
6955160	6956160	Thanks for the answers.
6956160	6957160	Appreciate it, guys.
6957160	6964540	Again, you can friend us on Facebook and Google Plus and answer a future Google Question of
6964540	6965540	the Week.
6965540	6968220	Meanwhile, we get back into some long form news.
6968220	6971580	I usually ask for our perspectives on the question, but we kind of already talked about
6971580	6973420	that earlier in the show.
6973420	6976220	My perspective is...
6976220	6978220	Did you ever really get to try it?
6978220	6980100	I didn't care.
6980100	6982440	I read it because this is how I do about everything.
6982440	6985300	I read up on it, decide if I want to do it or not.
6985300	6986300	I read up on it.
6986300	6989780	It seemed like monumental waste of time to me.
6989780	6992200	I wouldn't call it a waste of time.
6992200	6993200	To me.
6993200	6994860	To me, it would have been a waste of time.
6994860	6997240	Some would say video games are a waste of time, but no, I understand everything's a
6997240	6998240	personal taste.
6998240	7001900	Keep in mind, I did try Second Life.
7001900	7002900	Did you?
7002900	7005420	And I stayed with it for two whole weeks.
7005420	7006420	Two whole weeks?
7006420	7008060	It was free.
7009060	7013100	It was when I was on my big Avatar kick.
7013100	7014100	Like the movie Avatar.
7014100	7015100	The movie Avatar.
7015100	7016100	Did people build pandorans?
7016100	7017100	Yeah, people did.
7017100	7018420	It was actually really cool.
7018420	7023260	It was really neat going around and seeing what other people created and just seeing
7023260	7027460	the different ways that people would try to interpret what they saw of their fandoms.
7027460	7029860	I saw some for various fantasy universes.
7029860	7037900	I kind of did avoid the sexy playground ones or whatever, but it was actually very robust.
7038460	7041700	Going to chat room, because we have Gossipy Dish in our chat room, and I love me some
7041700	7047460	Gossipy Dish over at live.vognetwork.com, and yet again, the SEG, who said earlier in
7047460	7049940	the show he should have driven up tonight, and I'm starting to agree, SEG.
7049940	7053140	You should have just been here tonight, because lots of great comments from SEG tonight.
7053140	7058180	SEG says, one versus 100 only failed because the ad team didn't do their job.
7058180	7061820	Talk to an engineer who worked on one versus 100 at GDC this year.
7061820	7063580	That literally was the reason.
7063580	7066820	Gold sales went up with one versus 100.
7066820	7069540	Is it that the ad team didn't or couldn't?
7069540	7072180	I mean, I'm just curious.
7072180	7075900	Not that I don't think you don't know the difference, but I'm wondering, was it that
7075900	7076900	people...
7076900	7080260	Yeah, now that I think about it, I only ever saw Sprint commercials on that thing.
7080260	7083500	That was the only company I ever saw back one versus 100.
7083500	7086860	Did no one else get it, maybe?
7086860	7087860	I don't know.
7087860	7092020	But SEG, if you haven't heard it, you got to hear last week's show because when we had
7092020	7096780	Jackbox Games on, they talked about how You Don't Know Jack was almost game number two
7096780	7100380	for that whole thing, and that was a huge...
7100380	7105100	I'm surprised more people aren't talking about what he said last week on the show, but there
7105100	7106100	you go.
7106100	7107100	I thought it was very interesting.
7107100	7110780	So anyway, let's move on.
7110780	7111780	More news.
7111780	7112780	Loki.
7112780	7117940	All right, I don't know how much news this really is, but apparently if you're digging,
7117940	7121340	you really, really want to play Minecraft on the Wii U, well, you're not going to be
7121340	7125940	able to play Minecraft on the Wii U right now, but don't worry because someone's there
7125940	7131660	to fill the void, and they're making their own Minecraft clone called U-Craft, and it's
7131660	7138220	by some anonymous developer, a licensed developer for the Wii U.
7138220	7139740	And it's a UND game.
7139740	7145320	I can totally tell, just screenshot, it's a UND game, but I don't know if you really
7145320	7151140	should be getting that excited about it because we've seen these kind of a dime a dozen on
7151140	7152140	the Xbox Indie game.
7152140	7156700	I was going to say, I was like, well, I don't think I've really seen studios do just straight
7156700	7160540	up Minecraft clones, and I'm like, wait a minute, no, Xbox Live Indie games, oh my God,
7160540	7162400	there was 100 million billion of them.
7162400	7168340	And even on mobile app stores, iTunes and Google Play, there's tons of them out there.
7168340	7171580	There are, and I'm going to tell you right now, I mean, once you get one on there, it's
7171580	7177260	not going to be the end of it, and especially now that the Wii U, you can export to the
7177260	7183700	Wii U using Unity, I'm sure you're going to see a lot more of these types of games.
7183700	7188260	But I just hope it's not like a literal, because a lot of these Minecraft clones, like I've
7188260	7194300	played, what was it, Castle Miner Z and stuff like that, and they're okay, I mean, they
7194300	7200100	were like a buck, and it had, you know, it's just like really terrible graphics, and it's
7200100	7204420	Minecraft with zombies and skeletons and shit, and you have guns.
7204420	7206740	I mean, that was kind of the difference.
7206740	7210100	And this right now, just in the screenshots, looks like it's very basic, I mean, they've
7210100	7217160	got the standard assets, you know, skybox in there, diffuse textures, it just looks
7217160	7223020	really basic, but they're claiming it's like an alpha, you know, the alpha images, but
7223020	7226700	I don't know, whatever, I mean, hey, cool, if it's cheap enough, you know what, it might
7226700	7230660	not be a bad thing to waste your time on, because there is a lot of those clones that
7230660	7236620	came out on Xbox Indie games that people really liked, so, cool, I hope that does come out
7236620	7241020	and maybe at least shows, you know, Mojang or Microsoft or whoever, that there might
7241020	7243060	be some interest on that platform.
7243060	7249300	Well, it's not gonna matter now, after Microsoft has no interest in building this on Nintendo,
7249300	7253540	well, I say that, but then I go back and think, oh yeah, there was a Viva Pinata 3DS game,
7253540	7258740	so I guess anything is fucking possible, but I just, I really don't see it happening.
7258740	7265820	I sort of think what needs to happen, if Nintendo really wants this to be a thing, then if this
7265820	7270580	hasn't already happened with whatever developer is making this, Nintendo needs to find the
7270580	7276180	developer capable of doing it and Pope Nintendo needs to bless the game by saying, you can
7276180	7281620	put Mario and Link in it, because if you can put Mario and Link in Minecraft or whatever,
7281620	7288280	then, then it'll sell, like, Mario goes mining, will sell 11 billion copies.
7288280	7293980	Think about it, if you could marry the Minecraft world with Mario, I mean, there it is.
7294020	7296740	Mario or what about, like, Rosetti?
7297620	7303060	Mr. Rosetti's Digging Adventure, and then he yells at you if you turn the game off too early.
7303060	7305300	I actually kind of love that idea.
7305300	7309260	Have you ever actually been in Mr. Rosetti's house in, uh...
7309260	7311860	Didn't it only show up, like, once in a blue moon type of thing?
7311860	7313300	I've managed to make it into his house.
7313300	7314300	Yeah, yeah.
7314300	7316860	He has a couple of toilets.
7316860	7317860	That's awesome.
7317860	7318860	Yeah.
7318860	7321420	What if the next Animal Crossing were to take elements of Minecraft?
7321420	7322420	I think they're actually...
7322420	7323420	It's not.
7323420	7324420	Yeah, I don't know.
7324420	7325420	I just...
7325420	7326420	Animal Crossing will never change.
7326420	7328060	Yeah, Animal Crossing does kind of have a forest.
7328060	7330540	The forest will always be the forest.
7330540	7333900	But man, I think about, like, what those games would look like if they could get married
7333900	7337100	a little bit, and it's kind of awesome, but, I don't know, maybe it's a bit much.
7337100	7342580	And I don't know, see, like, ironically enough, you know, for my game, I actually had to build
7342580	7347180	something that basically is like Minecraft, you know, for my editor, and, you know, what
7347180	7349500	they have on the screen is actually not that difficult to make.
7349500	7355140	I mean, there's tutorials out there that build that pretty easy, so, I don't know.
7355140	7358500	Hopefully it's fun, because that's really, when it comes down to the end of it, I mean,
7358500	7362180	it can look like shit, but if it's fun, it doesn't matter.
7362180	7366820	All right, well, this game's doing very well, because it's a lot of fun for a lot of people,
7366820	7370820	and that is League of Legends, but you know what makes this game not fun and really turns
7370820	7374060	some people off sometimes, like, you know, it's done with me and some other people I
7374060	7375060	know?
7375060	7376060	Assholes?
7376060	7377060	Assholes, that's right.
7377060	7378060	Toxic players.
7378060	7379060	People that are dicks.
7379060	7383460	Well, Riot Games has been doing, you know, to be fair, they've been trying to come up
7383460	7387980	with ways to sort of, you know, punish those toxic players and basically let them know
7387980	7391580	that they're not welcome inside League of Legends, and this is going to be interesting.
7391580	7396660	There is a patch coming to League of Legends, and if a player is voted down for negative
7396660	7402900	behavior, and they're already operating under a chat restriction, they will have to, I'm
7402900	7407860	sorry, what's happening in the game now, you are already operating under chat restriction
7407860	7410300	if you're voted down for negative behavior.
7410300	7414320	You have to play a certain number of games, and then you can speak in the game again.
7414320	7420860	So being able to speak in League of Legends is something you earn, essentially, if, you
7420860	7423220	know, you don't act like a jackass.
7423220	7426700	But here's another restriction that's coming with this patch.
7426700	7430180	You will not be able to play ranked play.
7430180	7431180	That's right.
7431180	7435500	Ranked restricted players will have a certain number of games that you have to play before
7435500	7441380	you can return to queuing for ranked matches, meaning, what's the only possible pool of
7441380	7442380	players?
7442380	7447120	They'll have to play with new players in the basic pool to work their way back up to the
7447120	7450700	ranked pool, and not only do they have to play with the basic players, they have to
7450700	7454660	act nice, because if they keep getting ranked down, they'll never get to see the ranked
7454660	7455840	matches again.
7455840	7457140	This is kind of awesome.
7457140	7458140	I love it.
7458140	7459820	I love it!
7459820	7462920	Good job, Riot Games.
7462960	7466920	If you are too deeply in negative territory and rank restricted at the end of a given
7466920	7472760	competitive season, you will be ineligible for receiving special rewards for ranked play.
7472760	7477660	So it's like, Riot Games is now written, you will not be a dick into the rules.
7477660	7480600	If you want to get rewards, you will not be a jerk.
7480600	7483240	Jerks do not get rewarded.
7483240	7486360	Super Nanny is at work over at Riot Games, and I love this.
7486360	7489320	What do you guys think in our chatroom over at live.volgnetwork.com?
7489320	7491480	I'm applauding it with my brain.
7491480	7496840	Let's see, Act F says, my brother plays League of Legends and just uses Skype instead
7496840	7498200	of the in-game chat.
7498200	7500680	When he's playing with friends, of course.
7500680	7502320	When he isn't, he just doesn't talk.
7502320	7508280	SSG100Matt says, hmm, I just wonder how people can abuse this, like an entire clan downvoting
7508280	7510360	one person just to be a jerk.
7510360	7517400	Ooh, I hope that isn't something that people can take advantage of.
7517400	7522040	The Segg says, I don't know if throwing the most toxic players to your new users is a
7522040	7523040	good idea.
7523040	7524040	Ah, but at the same time.
7524040	7525400	As long as they can't talk to them.
7525400	7529760	If they can't talk to them, remember, they already got their right to talk stripped away.
7529760	7533000	So if they don't shape up, they have to ship out.
7533000	7535120	Bojikawa says, to be honest, I like that a lot.
7535120	7539680	I never do ranked matches and usually just hush if someone wants to start talking out
7539680	7540840	of their butt.
7540840	7545520	And Fifth Dream says, that should be the first line in any end user license agreement.
7545520	7547840	You agree to not be a jerk.
7547840	7550040	That should be like the big font right at the top.
7550040	7552280	Loki, is the game you're making going to have online play?
7552280	7555920	Because I think your EULA should have that in like 24 point font right at the top.
7555920	7561320	I can put it on there anyways, but no, it's not, at least right now I'm not planning on
7561320	7563000	doing any sort of online stuff.
7563000	7564680	It could pop up with a question.
7564680	7566640	Like when you start the game, are you a jerk?
7566640	7567640	Yes or no.
7567640	7568640	And if they click yes, the game uninstalls.
7568640	7570640	It's kind of dumb.
7570640	7572640	No, I'm not going to do that.
7572640	7574640	Ah, you're no fun at all.
7574760	7576760	Alright, let's move on.
7576760	7578400	Dark Sakura.
7578400	7584160	This one actually, what gave me the decision to post this story was Becky's reaction to
7584160	7585160	it.
7585160	7588100	Because as you know, my best friend Becky has a seven year old.
7588100	7593680	It's a game called Galaxies, G-A-L-X-Y-Z.
7593680	7601520	And it's put out, it actually has affiliation with the New York Academy of Sciences.
7601600	7607560	The game is launching in 2015, and it's going to be an online educational game for children.
7607560	7612320	Basically it's kindergarteners through 12th graders.
7612320	7617880	It was created because a dad saw his kids getting bored playing science education games.
7617880	7621520	He wanted them to be challenging, which makes them more effective.
7621520	7628440	And so his name is Osman Rashid, and he's the CEO of Galaxies.
7628440	7635360	And this is a quote from him, students have more capacity to learn than we give them credit
7635360	7636360	for.
7636360	7639520	They are naturally perceptive and will easily see through the products that seek to fool
7639520	7642280	them into thinking they're fun.
7642280	7648320	So basically, the New York Academy of Sciences is going to be keeping an eye on students
7648320	7653040	as they play the game across the world that show more science aptitude.
7653040	7658960	And those that excel will be considered for free science education through an online talent
7658960	7661760	organization called the Junior Academy.
7661760	7666700	And so if they are let in, they will get mentoring, high-level online science courses, and opportunities
7666700	7669960	to participate on research teams.
7669960	7674600	So they're starting with an initial pool of 500 students and are hoping to increase into
7674600	7676760	the thousands as the project goes on.
7676760	7679840	So I think this is really awesome.
7679840	7681440	Hooray for science.
7681440	7684520	We don't talk enough about like edutainment games on the show, really.
7684520	7688840	So it's kind of neat to always see how they kind of bridge education and gaming together,
7688840	7689840	you know.
7689840	7693840	You can learn more about it at galaxies.com, g-a-l-y-x-z.com.
7693840	7695640	All right.
7695640	7698760	Do you think do you think lots of kids will learn about science thanks to this?
7698760	7699760	I hope so.
7699760	7704300	I'd really the thing is, this is not so much learning as seeing because I always think
7704300	7709760	that when it's something that you can be engaged in, that's what makes it fun and interesting
7709760	7710760	to keep up with it.
7710760	7716840	And when you start participating with it and finding a reason to keep participating, then
7716840	7718960	you're going to keep learning something.
7718960	7720520	It's going to be something new every time.
7720520	7724240	It'll keep bringing you back instead of making it seem like just something they're shoving
7724240	7727880	down your throat, like, you know, linear algebra.
7727880	7733880	Tiger Claw in chat says, now only if these games had people perform actual science experiments.
7733880	7737240	You mean like on Mr. Wizard's World, even though they would always have the disclaimer,
7737240	7738240	don't try this at home?
7738240	7740080	You know, you know, he hated children, right?
7740080	7741080	You know, you're going to do that at home.
7741080	7742080	I've always heard.
7742080	7747240	I always thought that was urban legend and not actually fact, but that's kind of like
7747240	7751780	one of those, like the same urban legend that Mr. Rogers was like a trained sharpshooter
7751780	7754440	in the military or something like that was completely not true.
7754440	7762640	He was a Methodist minister, but still just people love the imagery of Mr. Rogers, like
7762640	7767240	carrying around a sniper rifle, just, you know, won't you be my neighbor?
7767240	7768240	My dead neighbor.
7768240	7769240	All right.
7769240	7770240	Moving on.
7770240	7771240	Loki.
7771240	7772240	All right.
7772240	7775240	So there is a lawsuit against Activision.
7775240	7776920	I don't even really remember this.
7776920	7781680	I think this was from a while ago, but there was a lawsuit where there was a, I guess,
7781680	7788160	regarding a patent that a company called them, was it McRoe Inc had, which was automatic
7788160	7793120	animated lip synchronization and facial expressions of 3D characters.
7793120	7798840	So basically they took a, you see a lot of this with like patent trolls where they took
7798840	7804800	the process for, you know, lip syncing something like you would do in like a cartoon or something
7804800	7808040	and add on a computer to the end of the patent.
7808040	7814880	And so like there was a precedent set with, was it Alice Corp versus a CLS bank international,
7814880	7819320	where I think it was the same type of situation where they were like, okay, we have a patent
7819320	7825040	for banking, you know, like something banking related, but on a computer, you know?
7825040	7831880	And so because the precedent was set by that case in which they invalidated those patents,
7831880	7836680	the same thing kind of happened here where the case was dismissed and those patents that
7836680	7843160	were owned by McRoe were actually invalidated because you can't just add on a computer at
7843160	7846700	the end of a patent and hope to have something brand new.
7846700	7852020	So hopefully, hopefully they did this a lot more with different, you know, uh, patents
7852020	7853020	because there's a lot of them.
7853020	7854020	Yeah, like the podcasting patent.
7854020	7856780	That would be fantastic if that happened to this.
7856780	7861940	Well, that one's tough because people keep settling with them when they, you know, win
7861940	7862940	or lose.
7862940	7863940	I don't know.
7863940	7866780	I don't think they've won any of them, but they keep settling.
7866780	7868020	I think they keep settling.
7868020	7872300	I think they're going to go after the NBC or yeah, NBC, CBS.
7872300	7874920	They've basically said they're not going to go after like individual podcasters with these
7874920	7875920	big companies.
7875920	7880280	Anyway, I'm starting to digress, but it is, it is obviously an issue that raises all of
7880280	7882940	our eyebrows because it's a little ridiculous.
7882940	7889720	If you ask me, it's like claiming to invent the RSS feed, but anyway, anyway, all right.
7889720	7892120	Another week, another lawsuit here on the program.
7892120	7897360	Uh, let's talk about something that, uh, probably would be a lawsuit except it's a Chinese bootleg
7897360	7902120	and there's really not a lot he can do about that because this happens all the time.
7902120	7907760	But it has to do with a hearthstone bootleg in China, but it's not what you think.
7907760	7910960	It's not the computer version of hearthstone being bootlegged.
7910960	7914320	It's like an actual tangible version of hearthstone.
7914320	7915320	Yes.
7915320	7921960	Uh, in, in China, they have actually made a like paper version of hearthstone with like
7921960	7925840	printed cards and everything and counters to keep track of life's and all this stuff.
7925840	7929080	It's a physical version of hearthstone.
7929080	7936000	So, uh, yeah, um, you can apparently track this down in China for about $50, uh, even
7936000	7938920	though the original is free to play, but, uh, there it is.
7938920	7944120	Uh, you can read more about this if you want games in Asia.com has a full rundown on this,
7944120	7949280	uh, real life hearthstone cards, and you can even see what some of these like little counters
7949280	7952160	that count down the life and so forth look like.
7952160	7957280	Um, but there was a, uh, there's no coin to flip to start the match at the beginning.
7957320	7961240	They have a coin card itself though, which is part of the game.
7961240	7968440	So, uh, yeah, there it is hearthstone is available, um, tangibly overseas.
7968440	7969600	Interesting.
7969600	7972920	I wonder if there would be enough demand for this if Blizzard's interested at all in putting
7972920	7973920	out a physical version of this.
7973920	7977440	I would think probably not because they're making all their money off the, uh, you know,
7977440	7981120	the, the cards and the mystery packs, the open and all that stuff.
7981120	7985280	But, uh, interesting, uh, fifth dream in chat says, I assume they were going to make a real
7985280	7986280	one.
7986280	7991760	So, uh, Bochi Kawa says Wizards of the Coast needs to get on top of that market.
7991760	7993760	So there it is.
7993760	7995120	All right.
7995120	7997540	Um, let's get into the mailbag.
7997540	8002040	Every week you guys send us emails and, uh, we bootleg with your permission, your emails
8002040	8004040	and read them on the show.
8004040	8006920	Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send your emails.
8006920	8011800	Darsakha will dive into the mailbag and, uh, pull out whatever emails there are and, uh,
8011800	8017880	make sure that they are fit for user consumption, that, you know, it's not like a penis enlargement
8017880	8019880	email that somebody's sending the show.
8019880	8025720	Uh, she will read it for all of our, uh, listeners and for us here in studio to respond to.
8025720	8029640	So participate at orangelauntrader.com, Darsakha, what's in the mailbag tonight?
8029640	8030640	One mail.
8030640	8031640	One?
8031640	8032640	Hi, OLR.
8032640	8033880	Just a quick email for you guys.
8033880	8036080	Please know Kim Kardashian Music.
8036080	8040240	You mentioned last week something about who would name their company Skynet.
8040240	8045880	Funny story, the biggest telecom company in Belgium, Belgacom, calls their ISP Skynet.
8045880	8050640	According to Wikipedia, Skynet's operations are almost, uh, almost exclusively performed
8050640	8056520	by war machines, cyborg, usually a terminator, and, it gives a link, and other computer systems
8056520	8058600	with the goal of exterminating the human race.
8058600	8061720	This is fairly accurate as having to deal with their customer service will surely make
8061720	8065320	you want to kill the person on the other end of the phone, thus contributing to exterminating
8065320	8066320	the human race.
8066320	8071640	I hope you make it to episode 666, and thanks to Rob for posting the podcast promptly nowadays
8071640	8074560	so your overseas listeners can enjoy it on Monday morning.
8074560	8076720	All the best, Martin from Belgium.
8076720	8081120	Hooray, emails from overseas, and you're welcome, and, uh, yeah.
8081120	8082120	Semi-chocolate.
8082120	8085520	I've been a good boy about posting podcasts pretty promptly for a few years now.
8085520	8086520	Martin, semi-chocolate.
8086520	8088960	I haven't had good Belgian chocolate in ages.
8088960	8093920	No, seriously, Belgian chocolate is, like, the best chocolate in the world.
8094520	8095520	Here's what I want to know.
8095520	8099320	And, Darsakar, I know you weren't here last week, but in a nutshell, um, Square Enix is
8099320	8104320	going to be doing a cloud computing service called Shinra, which, you know, right?
8104320	8105920	Yeah, see?
8105920	8110160	And so I said, that would be like announcing a new computing service that you're calling
8110160	8111240	Skynet.
8111240	8112880	And so that's why he sent in this email.
8112880	8118060	So my question is, is the terminator, like, a big part of pop culture in Belgium like
8118060	8119060	it is here?
8119060	8122760	Or is it, like, not really a, like, people don't know what that is?
8123280	8124280	That would explain that.
8124280	8126280	I've actually never been to Belgium, Rob.
8126280	8127280	Me neither.
8127280	8128280	Let's go.
8128280	8129280	Let's go right now.
8129280	8130280	Martin, we're going to come stay in your living room.
8130280	8131280	That's right.
8131280	8132280	We're crashing.
8132280	8133280	Clean off the couch.
8133280	8135400	Have some chocolate waiting for me.
8135400	8137280	Have some fries waiting for me.
8137280	8140280	Loki, you want to come with?
8140280	8141280	We're going to Belgium.
8141280	8142600	What about fries in Belgium?
8142600	8143600	Waffles.
8143600	8144600	All right, waffles.
8144600	8145600	Waffles, fries, and chocolate.
8145600	8146600	Hey, Rob.
8146600	8147600	What?
8147600	8149560	Penguins in sweaters.
8149560	8150560	That's not in the mailbag.
8150560	8151560	No, it's not.
8151560	8153560	But I just scrolled past it and I thought of you.
8153560	8154560	All right.
8154560	8160800	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
8160800	8162480	And it can be from whatever country you want.
8162480	8165640	We'll even take emails from Ohio, of which I'm expecting a few this week.
8165640	8166640	All right.
8166640	8169360	I have no fucking problem with Ohio.
8169360	8172040	Stop it.
8172040	8177160	Every state has fucking boring shit in it.
8177160	8180040	Let's de- Especially New Jersey.
8180040	8181840	Let's detail them all right now.
8181840	8182840	All right.
8182840	8186440	You can hear Dark Soccer is starting to get agitated and there's no better time during
8186440	8204440	the show to do the FUs of the Week.
8204440	8206240	Fuck my headache.
8206240	8208760	Fuck my headache.
8208760	8213480	I'm so just tired all the time, so fuck being tired too.
8213480	8214480	I mean, okay.
8214480	8215480	I really love what I do.
8215480	8216480	Love it.
8216480	8221320	And no, I'm not telling any of you where I work, but I love it.
8221320	8227760	At the same time, holy shit, I just like to be home for an entire day, so.
8227760	8232680	I love what I do too, but I also really love sitting on the couch and playing video games
8232680	8233680	all day.
8233680	8236360	I love not wearing pants.
8236360	8239240	That's why you work from home, if you can.
8239240	8243640	I like- Well, there's just some days I'll be like, it's lunchtime.
8243640	8246280	I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.
8246280	8247280	It's my break.
8247280	8249080	I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.
8249080	8250080	No.
8250080	8251680	No, I really- I like what I do.
8251680	8256120	I am happy, happy, happy to dedicate the time that I do to it because this is the first
8256120	8261240	place I've worked at in ages that I have actually really felt like I'm contributing.
8261240	8265640	You know, like I'm a part of things and I really love it, but I'm really tired at the
8265640	8271320	same time and with just like a day where nobody asks me to draw something, I don't
8271320	8280000	have to do flyers, I don't have to talk to people, I don't have to look at people, I
8280000	8287840	don't have to wear actual clothes or makeup or- my hair could be a big poofy rat's nest.
8287840	8288840	Don't care.
8288840	8294880	It's just me and the cat eating ice cream, both of us out of the same bowl, watching
8294880	8295880	YouTube.
8295880	8298040	It'd be great.
8298040	8299040	Alright.
8299040	8306520	Look, I want to say something, but I can't talk about your job, so I'll say it off here.
8306520	8307520	Alright, Loki.
8307520	8312960	Fuck you, the farmer's insurance, mainly all the independent farmer's insurance agents
8312960	8314600	out there.
8314600	8318000	That seriously is such a pyramid scheme.
8318000	8322840	You're looking for work that happened to be dumb enough to post your resume online publicly,
8322840	8328100	you will get called by literally thousands of these people because for some reason there's
8328100	8330200	all these independent branches.
8330200	8334360	Can you imagine how the massive army of farmer's insurance people that are actually trying
8334360	8337520	to get people to buy insurance from them?
8337520	8340720	No thanks.
8340720	8345680	My FU of the week goes to my lack of motivation to really buckle down and lose some weight
8345680	8350680	because I really want to get on that and I just keep falling off the wagon continuously
8350680	8354560	over and over again and I know that the chips are so good.
8354560	8360420	I need to channel the strength of Richard Simmons, who by the way tweeted me this week
8360420	8366280	and I quit the internet because once you get Richard Simmons to tweet you, you win.
8366280	8368880	Are you going to glitter squat?
8368880	8371840	That's the only way I'm going to lose weight is to glitter squat and if you don't know
8371840	8374840	what I'm talking about, you need to go to Richard Simmons Facebook page and if you hate
8374840	8378560	Richard Simmons or you make fun of Richard Simmons, I'm coming for you.
8378560	8382960	Ain't nobody got time for a Richard Simmons hater because seriously, what negative thing
8382960	8384600	has that man ever done?
8384600	8385600	He does nothing but help people.
8385600	8386600	He's a good person.
8386600	8387600	I love him.
8387600	8394920	Platonically, don't take it to a weird place, but he tweeted me and I win the internet and
8394920	8395920	you lost.
8395920	8396920	Yeah.
8396920	8403480	All right, let's get to a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll open up the
8403480	8410440	Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8410440	8413280	Let's get to the last few news stories here.
8413280	8414280	Loki.
8414280	8415280	All right.
8415280	8420440	So Steam has hit a milestone surpassing a hundred million users.
8420440	8425560	With that also, of course, they've added the whole curation system now.
8425560	8430840	So now you can actually, I believe if you have a Steam group, you can add your own curation
8430840	8436360	page where you can recommend different games and give them reviews and that kind of stuff
8436360	8438720	and people can go visit that.
8438720	8441440	And you may have been seeing a lot of this on like social media where they're talking
8441440	8446560	about like, hey, go like our curation page or go join it or something like that.
8446560	8447560	So they have that.
8447560	8452640	And then of course, the Steam music player that was in beta for the longest time has
8452640	8455000	now been released.
8455000	8458880	So you can actually use the Steam music player.
8458880	8463320	It's integrated into Steam and use your own library with that.
8463320	8467800	So kind of one of the things that they're going to be using for the Steam OS and be
8467800	8472200	curious to see what other kind of non-gaming applications they have for Steam OS because
8472200	8476640	we don't really know too much about it yet.
8476640	8478680	Yeah.
8478680	8481240	What is the status of all that stuff with Steam?
8481240	8485680	I noticed though that Steam, like it looks a lot different now.
8485680	8490040	Like they did some weird, like it looks blue and they use some different fonts.
8490040	8491160	Like I like its look.
8491160	8496760	I like the blue look a lot because you know, blue is prettier than gray, but it definitely
8496760	8498660	looks like they're like ramping up to something.
8498660	8500520	But what was the last on this whole Steam OS?
8500520	8502100	I have no idea.
8502100	8506080	Another cool thing about the Steam music player, if you do happen to check it out, you'll notice
8506080	8509460	if you own some Valve games that you'll have the soundtracks for said games.
8509460	8517720	So like Half-Life, Portal, Portal 2, and also I guess was it they've got, I wonder if that's
8517720	8521100	how Humble Bundle is going to do the soundtracks in the future.
8521100	8522100	Possibly that'd be pretty cool.
8522100	8523100	I bet it is.
8523100	8525700	Have like a Steam code for the soundtrack.
8525700	8527660	Have you tried Steam in big picture mode lately?
8527660	8529380	It's a slick little interface.
8529380	8532060	I haven't tried it lately, but I've used it in the past.
8532060	8535740	I've looked at big picture mode, but you know, on my laptop, it's kind of useless.
8535740	8539380	Yeah, no, it's a, I was actually just using it last night cause I was feeling lazy and
8539380	8543060	I just kind of had the controller and I was like, well, it also, when you upgraded Steam,
8543060	8545980	and I don't know if this is just because I'm opted into the beta program, a little picture
8545980	8547700	of a controller now shows up in the upper right.
8547700	8548700	Yeah.
8548700	8549700	And I was like, what's this do?
8549700	8551340	And I clicked it and it was like, oh, it's in big picture mode.
8551340	8555880	And I was like, wow, this is like all splashy and blue and different from what I remember.
8555880	8562360	So yeah, it's, it feels very fluid and that that's what led me to playing things like
8562360	8565960	Crypt of the Necrodancer again and stuff that that's enabled for big picture mode.
8565960	8570680	It's like, it's like playing a, playing a Xbox or something.
8570680	8572320	It's great.
8572320	8577860	So fifth dream in chat says, how do I delete these valve albums from my Steam player?
8577860	8579720	It's not like they gave you, you too.
8579720	8584600	Come on, don't even start.
8584600	8585600	Let's see.
8585600	8587120	Uh, what else?
8587120	8591240	Act F says Steam is blue da ba dee ba da ba dee ba ba dee.
8591240	8592240	Oh boy.
8592720	8597520	Uh, and, uh, Causton says Humble doesn't do Steam codes anymore.
8597520	8598520	Unfortunately.
8598520	8600360	Why did they link them to your Steam account?
8600360	8601960	Oh yeah, that's right.
8601960	8603640	You link them to your account instead.
8603640	8604640	That's okay.
8604640	8605640	That's not, that's the same thing.
8605640	8612000	Not entirely true because I had to enter a Steam code in, I think for, um, road redemption.
8612000	8616800	It might, it might depend on what it is you're getting through the Humble store and just
8616800	8618880	like what, you know, Kickstarter might be a different thing.
8618880	8619880	Who knows?
8620520	8621520	Anyhow.
8621520	8626240	I kind of like that I don't have to enter in Steam code sometimes, so I'm all in with
8626240	8627240	that.
8627240	8630640	Bobby Black Wolf is toying with what I said earlier about big picture mode and Xbox saying,
8630640	8632720	you mean it's like playing a Steam box?
8632720	8636880	Well, yes, it is actually a lot like that, but it's cool that I can get the sense of
8636880	8639640	what that would really feel like, like on my PC.
8639640	8640640	I don't know.
8640640	8644000	It's just kind of, and that I didn't actually buy a damn Steam box.
8644000	8645560	I just am using my PC to do it.
8645560	8646840	It's still kind of neat.
8646840	8654800	So all right, let's move on with one more story here about speaking about consoles and
8654800	8657000	what they really do.
8657000	8662720	Game consoles are actually the most popular streaming device in most American homes.
8662720	8665760	And a lot of you guys are probably sitting here going, well, I probably could have told
8665760	8666760	you that.
8666760	8672080	But this is important because this is research from Parks Associates, which was reported
8672080	8677960	on in Home Media Magazine, 46% of American households with broadband have a video game
8677960	8683760	console connected, and 38% use said console as their primary means of streaming entertainment
8683760	8686640	like Netflix or Hulu.
8686640	8687840	But here's the thing.
8687840	8693040	A comment from Barbara Krauss, who's the director of research, says, quote, gaming consoles
8693040	8698200	are the most frequently used connected CE device because of their high adoption rates.
8698200	8703160	Of the broadband households that have only one connected CE device, nearly 60% have a
8703160	8704160	game console.
8704160	8708680	As the non-gaming capabilities of consoles have expanded, so too has the potential for
8708680	8713760	consoles to become an entertainment platform for online content such as video, music, and
8713760	8714760	apps.
8714760	8721080	So this means that right now consoles are bigger than Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Google
8721080	8724240	TV, Google Chromecast.
8724240	8728560	Only 9% use a Blu-ray disc player that has all that stuff built into it.
8728560	8733280	I mean, gaming consoles really are becoming that all-in-one box.
8733280	8738360	So even more so than, you know, when I, it wasn't really till I heard this is bigger
8738360	8742880	than Roku and Apple TV when I was like, oh shit, gaming consoles like really are kind
8742880	8745200	of a big deal with the streaming stuff.
8745200	8750760	So kind of neat to hear about, but also kind of shows you this is why sometimes Microsoft
8750760	8756320	walks out on stage and has a press conference that is TV, TV, TV, TV, and why Sony might
8756320	8762360	spend part of their E3 conference talking TV, TV, TV, because it is getting bigger.
8762360	8764480	That's what these things do.
8764480	8770600	And you know, another article I saw on this made the comparison to, oh, hey, remember
8770600	8774800	the PlayStation 2 and why it did so well because it played DVDs.
8774800	8781520	So game consoles being an all-in-one media box, definitely not a new thing.
8781520	8784040	So let's see.
8784040	8788440	Brad from Pod Culture says the biggest missing feature from Xbox One for me was the connection
8788440	8789760	to Media Center.
8789760	8796600	I comment from our chat over live.vognetwork.com along with Kane Shadow who says consoles is
8796600	8799800	for media centers, not video games.
8799800	8802280	Games are just the sideshow.
8802280	8803280	That's it.
8803480	8806440	This is a media box that happens to play games too.
8806440	8807440	That's where we're headed.
8807440	8808440	All right.
8808440	8812380	Anyhow, that does it for our stories tonight.
8812380	8816720	We are done with the stories, but that means now it's on to you guys and you can call us
8816720	8817720	right now.
8817720	8822760	Our Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio
8822760	8826320	if there's something you want to give your thoughts on that we've talked about tonight
8826320	8831840	or any other topic as well, maybe something we didn't get to, although I got to say just
8831840	8834800	in trying to put together this week's show and everything, I was like, boy, it was kind
8834800	8836240	of a slow news week.
8836240	8837240	So I don't know.
8837240	8838240	That's pretty slow.
8838240	8842120	I don't know what we might have missed, but maybe you guys are on something that, you
8842120	8847440	know, or maybe there's like a project we overlooked or a funny YouTube or something that you want
8847440	8850160	to talk about or something else.
8850160	8851160	Who knows?
8851160	8852160	Let's get to it though.
8852160	8853160	The phone is ringing.
8853160	8854160	Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.
8854160	8855160	Who's this?
8855160	8856160	Hey, guys.
8856160	8857160	It's Jason.
8857160	8858160	Hey, Jason, buddy.
8858160	8859160	How you doing?
8859160	8860160	I'm doing pretty good.
8860160	8863000	You are, but I understand you don't actually live in California.
8863000	8864000	Yeah.
8864000	8867400	Well, after being on the show for like three months straight, you might think otherwise.
8867400	8868400	Oh, come on.
8868400	8869400	We love to have you here.
8869400	8870600	What's on your mind, buddy?
8870600	8874840	So you made a comment earlier when we were talking about the esports arena.
8874840	8876800	I like the fact that I've adopted the royal we.
8876800	8879000	Well, that's the intro for you.
8879000	8883400	You made the comment when talking about the story about the esports arena, and you said
8883400	8888960	that you feel that that should be getting put to use for things besides just gaming.
8889800	8895480	I think you named us a couple of artists and actually like that kind of a performance.
8895480	8896920	It was a little bit of a...
8896920	8901960	Not a joke, but more of a, you know, just to kind of show like, you know, there are
8901960	8907800	performers that do big arena shows that, you know, or the circus or Disney on ice or whatever
8907800	8910520	else an arena is used for.
8910520	8915640	And so I guess the question that I wanted to ask you though is, do you know how many
8915640	8922000	like, as far as Korea is concerned and like the legitimate, for lack of a better word,
8922000	8926360	esports circuit, do you know how many gaming events take place?
8926360	8930160	Yes, but we're not on Korea's level yet.
8930160	8931680	We're nowhere close to that.
8931680	8934400	But when should we actually take those same steps?
8934400	8938800	Well, I'm not saying that the gaming arena is like a bad thing or anything.
8938800	8943960	I'm just surprised that they're not talking about a multipurpose arena, that this is like
8943960	8948560	a gaming dedicated thing, because I wouldn't think that these huge gaming events happen
8948560	8950000	365 days a year.
8950000	8951280	I mean, maybe I'm wrong.
8951280	8953940	I think it is already there.
8953940	8957920	And I think the fact that there is a dedicated venue for this, the problem is going to be
8957920	8963160	like when you go to branch out into different games, how many like game facilities do they
8963160	8964160	have?
8964160	8970000	But like WCS, if I remember correctly, they stopped doing it in America.
8970040	8975920	But there was some circuit that I was watching a Starcraft match in a New York tower that
8975920	8980800	the view on stream, just like watch the players and then just look behind them, look out the
8980800	8981800	window.
8981800	8982800	Gorgeous view.
8982800	8985800	They were like 50, 60 stories up in some New York tower.
8985800	8988040	Anyways, it was good.
8988040	8991600	You said something else about, you know, what would be, what's the problem or so forth.
8991600	8996160	And I'm said, the problem is, and I'm going to get haters with this comment and I'm sorry,
8996160	8999720	but the problem is it's in Ohio.
9000440	9004080	But the only people that need to be there are the players.
9004080	9007760	Like web streams are such that everybody can watch at home and it really doesn't matter
9007760	9018560	where they have to fill the arena to not necessarily, not except for the biggest like finals events.
9018560	9021400	So the, the point that I, the point that I was making about the New York tower thing
9021400	9026140	is that I was watching at like three or four in the morning local.
9026140	9032840	So it was what, 7am New York and it was a bunch of overseas players, which was even
9032840	9035580	crazier for like jet lag purposes and all that kind of stuff.
9035580	9039540	But it was like crack of dawn first thing in the morning in a New York tower and American
9039540	9041940	circuit Starcraft matches.
9041940	9048200	So the, my counterpoint is that there is already enough content that with a dedicated space,
9048200	9055160	they can put the facility to use for everything to be set up correctly and then just add concessions
9055160	9060800	and do everything else they need for the big grand arena, 16 player, semi-finals, quarter
9060800	9064160	finals, finals kind of thing.
9064160	9065160	I don't know.
9065160	9066520	I mean, I get, we'll see.
9066520	9071080	It's just an arena seems like such a big, big undertaking and I'm just, again, I'm just
9071080	9075440	surprised we're talking about it only for gaming and not more of a community thing.
9075440	9080720	But keep in mind too, here's where my perspective is that right now is that here in Sacramento,
9080720	9084440	they have been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena.
9084440	9086680	And this really doesn't have anything to do with gaming, but just to show you where
9086680	9091240	my perspective is that they've been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena
9091240	9096520	downtown and they threatened to move our only professional sports team, uh, ma major league,
9096520	9099280	I should say, uh, the Sacramento Kings, part of the NBA, right?
9099280	9104000	They threatened to move them to Seattle and they literally almost left because their current
9104000	9108160	arena Arco arena is so, or whatever the fuck they call it now, but it's always be Arco
9108160	9112080	arena to me, I guess they say is too damn old and falling apart or whatever.
9112080	9117800	So basically the NBA strong armed the town into building a new arena, but they had to
9117800	9123960	kind of be like, it's not just about basketball, it's going to be the downtown spot for all
9123960	9124960	these events.
9124960	9127840	So we're going to lure all these, you know, artists and concerts.
9127840	9131880	So I guess that's why Jason, and at the end of the day, my head is that, how did the community
9131880	9135680	let them build this fucking arena just for games?
9135680	9141960	But again, 15 minutes outside of major city, Ohio and downtown Sacramento, I suppose are
9142000	9146040	much different, but yeah, and there's a lot of other details like the fact that it may
9146040	9149960	not be quite as big as a multipurpose arena.
9149960	9154280	Um, and they may have to concede to do that in the future to let other events in and do
9154280	9156420	that kind of thing just because it does make sense.
9156420	9164080	But I, I, I don't follow esports, uh, esports games enough to say that I'm like gonna be
9164080	9165880	a fan and support this kind of stuff.
9165880	9169100	I'm hopeful for it for the people that do this kind of thing.
9169100	9175260	There is enough gaming variety, variety out there that things can be happening very perpetually.
9175260	9178660	Every first person shooter, every strategy game, special events.
9178660	9183400	I mean, they could eat not, not even just esports, but just gaming events in general,
9183400	9191220	like big, big debuts, uh, uh, uh, SDA speed run, uh, speed running events can take place
9191220	9192220	there.
9192220	9197120	Like the, the amount of content that's grown to such in the gaming world that a lot can
9197120	9202460	be done with a dedicated, well-stocked, wired up venue, and I'm looking forward to that.
9202460	9206360	You know, you won't really be seeing me getting on a plane to Ohio anytime soon to, to go
9206360	9210280	to one of these events in person, unless they, they asked me to host one.
9210280	9212040	Then I'd be, I'd be, I'd so be there.
9212040	9214720	I'll be, I'll, I'll go to the Rock and Roll Museum.
9214720	9216720	I will go to Cedar Point and take some selfies.
9216720	9220840	You'll be hosting this event with none other than Richard Simmons.
9220840	9222960	Oh my, I would die.
9222960	9223960	He's my hero.
9223960	9225360	I would, oh my God.
9225360	9231480	I just, just, I could drop dead the next day and I would have lived a full life anyway.
9231480	9237120	Why don't we have a Richard Simmons fitness video game?
9237120	9241200	There's I, I was, you know, what got me the tweet on Twitter from Richard Simmons was
9241200	9244320	I was asking, why doesn't Richard Simmons have a podcast?
9244320	9247240	Because I would listen every day to a Richard Simmons podcast.
9247240	9249880	And then my buddy Spike from Game Buoy said something to that.
9249880	9253960	And then I think I replied to that just with just something general that was like, um,
9253960	9258120	I just think Richard Simmons is motivated by what he really does for people and not
9258120	9259640	like by money.
9259640	9264320	And he, that's where Richard Simmons replied and said, thank you for your kind words, XO.
9264320	9267840	So because they haven't made a microphone, they could keep up with him.
9267840	9268840	Anyway.
9268840	9272360	Um, well, Jason, thank you very much for the call.
9272360	9275560	I'm going to let you go, but I just want to address one other thing you brought up, like
9275560	9278440	just way in passing at the very beginning of your call and you probably didn't even
9278440	9281920	mean to go here, but I just want to make sure I clear the air on something.
9281920	9287100	I am totally fine with our callers using we that's totally fine because this is the
9287100	9291400	show where every gamer has a voice and it is your show as well as our show.
9291400	9297160	So when you call in and talk about, we talked about this or we, we did so we is fine anytime.
9297160	9298160	We did.
9298160	9299160	We, the community, we, the vogue.
9299160	9300160	All right.
9300160	9301160	Well now we're going to hang up on you.
9301160	9302160	Absolutely.
9302160	9303160	All right.
9303160	9304160	Take care, buddy.
9304160	9305160	Bye.
9305160	9306160	One eight seven seven game OLR.
9306160	9308400	Our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
9308400	9311740	Uh, if you'd like to get through, I was going to read some tweets, but I wasn't really
9311740	9318460	seeing a whole lot on the Twitters this week, um, for questions or things like that.
9318460	9322300	There's a lot of activity, but it was mostly just like some talking back and forth.
9322300	9325380	That's how we got our guests for October 12th was through Twitter, but I'll talk more about
9325380	9326380	that next week.
9326380	9329340	Um, Oh, I did see one quick little tweet here.
9329340	9330740	There's the one I wanted to see, uh, from red.
9330740	9335420	The Hayes had tweeted us saying, uh, S sky and dark soccer and OLR.
9335420	9337740	This sounds like up y'all's alley.
9337740	9342780	F zero meets audio surf and it's a game called specter game.
9342780	9347460	The only issue I had with it is that it's like only available for like systems.
9347460	9353100	I don't have like Xbox one and windows phone, but I think it said it was coming to, um,
9353100	9355300	iOS at some point as well in Android.
9355300	9356300	So that's kind of cool.
9356300	9358080	And chip Zell does the music to it.
9358080	9361020	And you honestly sold me right there because, uh, she's great.
9361020	9364020	Like super hexagons, like one of the greatest soundtracks out there.
9364020	9366300	But anyway, we are getting other calls, so let's get to it.
9366300	9367300	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
9367860	9368860	Who is this?
9368860	9369860	Hey, it's Ron.
9369860	9370860	What's up everyone?
9370860	9371860	Hey, uh, not much.
9371860	9372860	How are you?
9372860	9373860	I am good.
9373860	9374860	Rob, get the coffee.
9374860	9375860	We got a dish.
9375860	9376860	We got a dish.
9376860	9377860	All right.
9377860	9378860	Well, we're going to dish more.
9378860	9379860	We've got to dish so much tonight.
9379860	9380860	I love it.
9380860	9381860	What are we dishing about?
9381860	9382860	Okay.
9382860	9387020	I don't know if you remember, but two years ago I called in and did my review of Otacon
9387020	9393000	and I talked about a particular fan game that was more or less based on the convention
9393000	9397080	itself called crisis heart brawlers.
9397080	9401720	I mean, you talk about a lot of cons on this show, but I do remember this whole talk about
9401720	9402720	like a game.
9402720	9403720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9403720	9404720	I sort of remember this.
9404720	9405720	Yeah.
9405720	9406720	Yeah.
9406720	9410840	Well, they had a Kickstarter to raise the funds and an article popped up recently.
9410840	9412120	Like where are they now?
9412120	9414320	Like what's going on?
9414320	9419740	Evidently, they, I think they hit their funds with the Kickstarter, but you know, as with
9419740	9426400	most Kickstarters, when it comes to independent games, it's not enough to fill what they need
9426400	9428520	to do.
9428520	9432640	So pretty much, I think you have a pretty good idea where this went.
9432640	9434160	Down the toilet?
9434160	9435160	More or less.
9435160	9438760	A couple of friends of mine who were voice acting in the game pretty much had to beg
9438760	9441600	the studio to pay them pretty much.
9441600	9442600	Wow.
9442600	9447560	And when I had discussed this, a friend of a friend messaged me and pretty much told
9447560	9456280	me before the Kickstarter, this guy who was behind the studio, he financially backed this
9456280	9458880	guy to get some of these projects off the ground.
9458880	9466400	Pretty much this guy, I like to call him a poor man Steve Jobs cross PT Barnum.
9466400	9467400	Wow.
9467400	9472840	Well, the good news is, good in quotes, is that these types of Kickstarters aren't really
9472840	9475920	going to work in the future because you know, Kickstarter changed their terms of service
9475920	9482660	like two weeks ago and it can't legally retroactively apply to old Kickstarters, but moving forward,
9482660	9487500	people that donate to Kickstarters that don't get anything as a result will have the rights
9487500	9491260	to take legal action against the people that do the Kickstarter.
9491260	9497140	So don't be going on Kickstarter planning to steal people's money because you're going
9497140	9498140	to be hurting.
9498140	9500780	Yeah, that's what it boils down to.
9500780	9505780	And I've dealt with a few Kickstarters in the past, you know, I've covered where it
9505780	9508160	gets quiet, nobody knows what's going on.
9508160	9512520	The people who backed it start raising hell and then the people behind the Kickstarter
9512520	9517840	just miraculously show up out of nowhere and just start, this is what we're going to do,
9517840	9518840	this is what we're going to do.
9518840	9522620	And they start sending out the gifts, the prizes and everything.
9522620	9528600	As for this one, he appeared to say the game is still in production, but that's the last
9528600	9529600	of it.
9529600	9532840	No gifts or anything have been passed out in between you and me.
9532840	9537440	If I had Kickstarted at $500 to this, I'd be ready to hang somebody.
9537440	9539880	But how's the convention doing in spite of all this?
9539880	9543640	I mean, did it have any type of official blessing of the convention or no?
9543640	9544640	They did.
9544640	9549560	But because there was no updates or changes or anything, they've pulled out of the project
9549560	9556800	so the game is now called Crisis Heart Brawlers instead of like Otakon or whatever, you know.
9556800	9561080	The Otakorp felt that they didn't want to be attached to it because there has been no
9561080	9563880	update and it kind of seems very unprofessional.
9563880	9564880	It's vaporware.
9564880	9565880	Yeah.
9566320	9571200	Actually the person that told me this information, he pretty much believes it's going to be vaporware
9571200	9576960	because the same issue I see with Kickstarter, when people Kickstart video games and other
9576960	9584020	projects and so forth, I tell people, start small and build your way up.
9584020	9588000	This guy started out big and wanted to keep going bigger.
9588000	9591400	He was trying to do something, he was trying to pretty much one-up Scott Pilgrim versus
9591400	9593160	the world of the game.
9593160	9598200	Well now, what about what Loki's doing because you know Loki refuses to build a Pong clone.
9598200	9602560	He's going big on his first project but of course, he hasn't taken a dime from anybody
9602560	9603560	either.
9603560	9606000	Well, that's okay because this is his own money, so hey.
9606000	9607000	That's right.
9607000	9608000	I would.
9608000	9611760	I mean, it will definitely help but no, I haven't done a Kickstarter yet.
9611760	9613160	I'm not saying that I wouldn't.
9613160	9614240	I probably would actually.
9614240	9617920	But you're waiting until you actually have something done and you want to Kickstart more
9617920	9619760	like the publishing of the title is what I'm getting right now.
9619760	9622360	Yeah, pretty much because I don't really need anything for the development because it's
9622360	9623360	just my time.
9623360	9626600	I'm not going to hire like people coders and stuff like that.
9626600	9631280	I would need just, it's basically just music and any software that I have to pay for the
9631280	9632280	licensing for.
9632280	9633840	You should get Marisa to do narration for you.
9633840	9634840	Well, yeah.
9634840	9638240	I was thinking her and I have another friend that does voice acting too, so I've got people
9638240	9639240	lined up.
9639240	9640240	I want to be in it.
9640240	9642280	I can use my wacky morning DJ voice.
9642280	9643280	That's fine.
9643280	9644280	You're playing the Loki game.
9644280	9646520	Hey, more talent the better, okay?
9646520	9647520	I'm down with that.
9647520	9649120	Otherwise, I don't want to tell the voice.
9649120	9654440	Marisa is true talent, but you know, I'll make your flyers.
9654440	9655440	Everybody excels in something.
9655440	9656440	We'll do video game posters.
9656440	9657440	Everybody excels in something.
9657440	9658440	We can all help.
9658440	9659440	I'll do cabinet art.
9659440	9660440	There you go.
9660440	9661440	All right.
9661440	9663680	That sounds pretty cool because that was one of the main problems with this.
9663680	9668200	This guy who wanted to make this, he has no software experience.
9668200	9669560	He was just a rep.
9669560	9674400	He was bringing people in to design this game based on his idea.
9674400	9675560	Yeah.
9675560	9679720	Well, it's going to be a lot harder to put those types of Kickstarters through in the
9679720	9680720	future.
9680720	9681720	That's for damn sure.
9681720	9682720	That's good.
9682720	9683720	All right.
9683720	9685960	Well, Rama, I'm out of coffee now, so.
9685960	9690360	Well, maybe Sailor Chibi Arthur can get you some.
9690360	9694200	That thing has been posted to my Facebook wall three times now, but it's great.
9694200	9695920	I believe in Sailor B.
9695920	9697280	Me too.
9697280	9701360	I would probably watch more Sailor Moon if it was the Golden Girls starring in it.
9701360	9702460	Let's be real.
9702460	9703460	Not that I'm hating.
9703460	9710980	I know you're not hating because once all the DVDs come out through Viz, you know Alan's
9710980	9715140	going to get them and he's going to sit you down and you're going to have a moon marathon.
9715140	9716140	No, he'll be too busy playing.
9716140	9717140	I was going to be on the left.
9717140	9718140	No.
9718140	9719140	Jamie's going to be on the right.
9719140	9720140	You're going to be stuck in the middle.
9720140	9721140	So enjoy.
9721140	9723140	He'll be too busy playing Final Fantasy XIV.
9723140	9726460	I'm still just going to kidnap Rob and sit him down with my Crunchyroll subscription.
9726460	9730860	Now, I'm talking about the original 200 episodes, the classic, not Crystal.
9730860	9732020	I like Crystal.
9732020	9735300	I know, but I'm just saying the DVDs, I already have mine pre-ordered, so.
9735300	9741020	I'm not bothering because I've actually still got my fan subs, if that says anything.
9741020	9743100	I still have my raw copies.
9743100	9749100	I still have my fan subs too, but I am really enjoying the dub so far, so I'm just-
9749100	9750700	Refusal, refusal, refusal, refusal.
9750700	9751900	All right, nerds.
9751900	9754540	I'm ending this talk so we can get more calls.
9754540	9755540	Pot Meets Kettle.
9755540	9756540	Rob?
9756540	9757540	Well, yeah.
9757540	9758540	Pot Meets Kettle?
9758540	9759540	I know, right?
9759540	9761540	Hey, did you go to the Hyrule Warriors thing at the Nintendo store?
9762420	9764260	I would have, but there was something stopping me.
9764260	9765260	It's called work.
9765260	9766260	Dope.
9766260	9767260	Yes.
9767260	9768740	Hate it when we get foiled by work.
9768740	9769740	Yes.
9769740	9770740	And one more thing before I get out of here.
9770740	9774500	I know people have given me shit for this on my own Facebook, but a deal is a deal.
9774500	9778420	Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, 40 bucks at Target.
9778420	9780700	You can't beat that.
9780700	9783540	I'm going to hold out and maybe the Steam version will be even cheaper.
9783540	9784540	That's-
9784540	9788220	I don't, like, the first one's like, what, 12 bucks on Steam right now?
9788260	9792740	I have all three for the PS3, and much as I know everyone enjoys Steam, but I'd rather
9792740	9796980	play a game like this in front of my 32-inch instead of my little inky dinky 21-inch.
9796980	9797980	I completely understand.
9797980	9802380	I like having my two monitors so that I can actually just jabber with people while I'm
9802380	9803380	playing my game.
9803380	9804620	Everybody's got their thing.
9804620	9805620	And not hurt my hand.
9805620	9806620	All right, Rom.
9806620	9807620	I'm going to let you go.
9807620	9808620	Take care, buddy.
9808620	9809620	You got it, bro.
9809620	9810620	All right.
9810620	9811620	Anime Jam Session.
9811620	9812620	Listen to it.
9812620	9813620	Or I'll kick you in the foot.
9813620	9814620	I want to be on it again.
9814620	9816820	Listen to the show or else Mako-chan will come after you, and that's not going to be
9816820	9817820	pretty.
9817820	9819820	Ron-chan, I want to be on again.
9819820	9820820	Working on it.
9820820	9821820	Kay.
9821820	9822820	All right.
9822820	9823820	Bye.
9823820	9824820	Bye.
9824820	9830500	1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9830500	9834540	How about any- I don't- I doubt there is any, but I'm going to check with Loki anyway.
9834540	9836060	Is there any last-minute stories?
9836060	9837060	No.
9837060	9838060	I had a feeling.
9838060	9840460	I have a last-minute statement.
9840460	9843020	There's cake waiting for me at Becky's house.
9843020	9844020	Where's my cake?
9844020	9845580	You can come with me.
9845580	9846660	I'm sure she'd give you cake.
9846660	9849100	I would, but I have to- It's pumpkin chocolate.
9849100	9854660	I have to go pick up Alan, and I have to edit the show, and I have to take this phone call
9854660	9857180	because we've got at least one more call coming in.
9857180	9858180	Let's get to it.
9858180	9859180	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9859180	9860180	Who's this?
9860180	9864100	A seg enters OrangeLoungeRadio audio broadcast.
9864100	9866460	I'll throw a pester ball.
9866460	9867460	Quick.
9867460	9868460	Get up defensive shields.
9868460	9869460	Red alert.
9869460	9872460	Shucks, how are y'all doing?
9872460	9873460	Great.
9873460	9874460	You know what?
9874460	9875460	I'll be here in person.
9875460	9877460	This is the next best thing, right?
9877460	9878460	Yeah.
9878460	9883180	I was even thinking this afternoon, like, you know, I wonder ... Nah, I shouldn't ... Oh,
9883180	9884180	well.
9884180	9885180	You're always welcome.
9885180	9887180	Just try to let me know in advance because- No, I know.
9887180	9889820	That's why I figured I didn't let you know in advance.
9889820	9890820	Like, that's too late.
9890820	9892180	Well, honestly- You've gone too far.
9892180	9894900	If you'd told me this afternoon, I would have been like, sure, I ain't got anything going
9894900	9895900	on tonight.
9895900	9900820	But anyway, seg, of all the many things you've commented on during the show tonight, I'm
9900820	9902420	dying to know which one you called in about.
9902420	9903420	What's up?
9903420	9912820	Well, you know, just to bring back on home a little bit and to expand on that, first
9912820	9917820	of all, I think it needs to be said that that was going on for five years?
9917820	9918820	How long?
9918820	9919820	It's been a while.
9919820	9925180	And I think that's really a credit that it ran so long.
9925180	9932140	Yes, because at least ... And I would credit Sony with that because Microsoft would have
9932140	9936260	pulled the plug on it in nine months if their track record is any indication.
9936260	9937260	Hello, game room.
9937260	9938260	Hello, one versus 100.
9938260	9940260	Hello, Kinect.
9940260	9946420	Anyway, so I actually credit Sony a little more for believing in that, and that's a good
9946420	9947420	thing.
9947420	9948420	That's a good thing.
9948420	9949420	Yeah, exactly.
9949420	9954580	And what I don't like to necessarily just go, oh, it's closing, therefore it was bad,
9954580	9957260	but try to learn from it.
9957260	9963660	And I think that's what we all should do is just celebrate what it was for all its good
9963660	9968100	and bad and expand from it.
9968100	9971620	And I don't think ... This is sort of something that was inevitable.
9971620	9976140	As PlayStation 3s come off of the living room shelves and get replaced with PlayStation
9976140	9983340	4s, the real question became not when is PlayStation Home going to disappear from PlayStation 3,
9983340	9986060	but are they going to continue it on PlayStation 4?
9986060	9990300	And unfortunately, it appears the answer is no if we're hearing about layoffs.
9990300	9993780	Yeah, which is sad.
9993780	10001940	But at least with this, they know it's coming and it's schedulable, and they have five years
10001940	10006660	to look, to point at, so ... Yes, and which you can't always do in the
10006660	10007660	games industry.
10007660	10014020	I mean, we hear all these stories every day about, oh, Microsoft just axed 8,000 people
10014020	10016940	today.
10016940	10020740	So at least there's that sort of dignity with it, so that's really good.
10020740	10026900	So the other pivot I want to make, and I know it's a little bit promotion-y, but there's
10026900	10033620	a, well, actually a street fair for video games coming up, again, in the LA area called
10033620	10034620	Indicade.
10034620	10036100	Oh, I want to go to this so bad.
10036100	10037100	Oh, please do.
10037100	10038100	I can't.
10038100	10040420	I'm literally in Vegas the very next week.
10040420	10042400	It's like this next weekend, right?
10042840	10047160	What if I were to give you and your listeners a discount code for Indicade?
10047160	10048440	Oh, you're killing me.
10048440	10049440	You're killing me.
10049440	10052440	Well, you can still get the listeners the code, because I know we have listeners in
10052440	10057360	the LA area who would have a lot more realistic chance of going.
10057360	10066040	So ICF14-FF-Love is the weird code.
10066040	10067040	I love that.
10067040	10068040	One more time.
10068040	10069040	Warren, get your pen and paper, people.
10069040	10070040	One more time.
10070040	10071040	Yeah, it is ICF14-FF-Love.
10071040	10079320	Love, I love it.
10079320	10084960	And the reason is that I'm going to be back there again, and I'm going to be professional
10084960	10092440	extrovert again for Squinky, because their follow-up, I don't know, it's not really a
10092440	10100200	follow-up piece, but the piece that they worked on after dominating Palpomus is up for awards.
10100200	10107760	It's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and thank you, chat, for typing in the code in
10107760	10109240	chat.
10109240	10114360	So it's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and it's an interactive performing arts piece
10114360	10123880	featuring the Performatron, because Squinky really is good at naming things.
10123880	10133600	And it's four people and whatever musicians decide to show up for it, and two people control
10133600	10139000	the dialogue tree of a play that two other people are acting, and everyone has mobile
10139000	10144220	devices that are picking the lines or reading the lines, and there's dynamic sheet music
10144220	10145220	to it.
10145220	10147460	Oh, wait a minute, so this is like a multiplayer game?
10147460	10148460	You could say that, yeah.
10148460	10153000	Oh, this sounds, and it's mobile, like, we were just, again, you really have to listen
10153000	10156160	to last week's show, because we talked about Fibbage with Jackbox Games, and they're doing
10156160	10161440	the whole mobile phone thing, and after having played that, I was like, oh my god, like,
10161440	10165040	why did it take this long for somebody to think to use a mobile phone as a controller?
10165040	10167880	And now you're talking about this is now happening in the indie scene, too.
10167880	10168880	Yep.
10168880	10169880	Amazing.
10169880	10175280	So, if you're going to pick one day, pick the Saturday, because of night games, which,
10175280	10181040	so IndieCade is a street festival for video games, I think it has a lot more heavy of
10181040	10184240	a film festival vibe as far as its structure.
10184240	10189640	There's no films being shown there, but it has this sort of structure of a film festival,
10189640	10193600	and that all the games there were selected to be there.
10193600	10199320	It's not, I mean, there are a few sponsor booths, but the games that are there in general
10199320	10200320	didn't pay to get in.
10200320	10203560	They were picked, they applied to and got picked to showcase.
10203560	10207740	Yeah, it's very similar to a film festival, because I'm involved with a horror, even though
10207740	10210280	I hate horror films, I'm still involved.
10210320	10214480	I love cult films, and they kind of bleed together a little bit, pun intended.
10214480	10219320	I'm involved with a horror film festival here in SAC, and it's a really big thing for NorCal,
10219320	10221600	and it's a very similar process.
10221600	10222600	Yes.
10222600	10228480	So, during the day, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they're showing the selection, but
10228480	10233280	on Saturday night, they close out those games, and out come the night games.
10233280	10238020	And I don't know what's going to be shown this year, except for one piece called Coffee
10238020	10246500	and Misunderstanding, but games that are very much heavy installation pieces, or just have
10246500	10250460	a lot of tech, or something strange and weird, get played.
10250460	10256140	So if you go the Saturday, make sure you're going afternoon to play the stuff that's shown
10256140	10263940	in the daytime, and then night games after, which starts, I want to say eight, but look
10263940	10267500	on the website for the full details.
10267500	10270420	If you see me there, please say hello.
10270420	10275100	I don't mind you pimping at all, because even though, sadly, it's not going to work out
10275100	10279100	for me to go to LA, because I'm literally taking a trip the very next week already,
10279100	10283380	I did go by the IndieCade booth at E3, they had a really big presence at E3 this year,
10283380	10287660	and it was one of my very favorites, because that was one of the only booths where I could
10287660	10290260	just walk right up and talk to the person that made the game.
10290260	10295980	You can't do that at any other booth at E3, and I don't care if your game is a triple
10295980	10301140	A, multi-billion dollar Destiny title, or if it's a small thing that was made in your
10301140	10304860	basement, you know, is it fun?
10304860	10309880	And when I can talk to the people that made them and really feel that enthusiasm, it raises
10309880	10313900	my enthusiasm tenfold.
10313900	10316700	That's the great thing about something like this, with the street festival and everything,
10316700	10320420	is that you'll be able to walk up and talk to people who are enthusiastic about the game,
10320420	10322740	like Sake says, he's a paid professional extrovert.
10323100	10330860	Yes, and it's also, at least for IndieCade, it's such a refreshing vibe than, what I'll
10330860	10336220	say, the conference, or the con scene, whether it be Comic-Con and all the various flavors,
10336220	10345900	or PAX, or because there's a lot more non-game people that show up that really makes it a
10345900	10350220	different tone of a place that you don't get anywhere else, so I highly recommend it if
10350220	10353980	you're in the area, say hello.
10353980	10359100	I hope Errol Flynn's always there.
10359100	10367300	Which think PlayStation Move controllers in a, I think it was an 8x8 grid hanging from
10367300	10369580	the ceiling.
10369580	10375580	And then it's four players, you hold two of the controllers at the corners, that's where
10375580	10381340	everyone starts, and your PlayStation Move controller will show a color of the ones that
10381340	10385580	you're holding, and everyone has one of four colors, and then one of them turns off, and
10385580	10389740	there's another one somewhere in the grid that you have to, quote unquote, swing over,
10389740	10395740	it's not like American Gladiators where you're actually swinging, but you find your color
10395740	10400980	and hold onto that one, and the moment you do, a few seconds later, the one that you
10400980	10407220	were always holding turns off, and you have to find another one that has your color, and
10407220	10408220	so on.
10408220	10414340	And then as the game progresses, the time in which to do that increases, and so eventually
10414340	10418380	people lose and get dropped out, and the last person standing wins.
10418380	10420900	That sounds crazy expensive with all those Move controllers.
10420900	10428380	Yeah, it's the same people who did, oh, I'm forgetting the name of it.
10428380	10429380	Sports Friends?
10429380	10430380	Is it Sports Friends?
10430780	10431780	Yeah, it's in Sports Friends.
10431780	10437780	Yeah, I know what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name of the game.
10437780	10441580	Yeah, the one with the fencing.
10441580	10444780	You'll think of it as soon as you hit the hang-up button, it's a way to go.
10444780	10445780	Will do.
10445780	10450340	All right, well, hey, so anybody in the LA area or even remotely close that's willing
10450340	10455420	to take the drive, check it out, indicate, and even though I can't go myself, just based
10455420	10459940	on what I've seen previously at E3 and so forth, your time will not be wasted, and you're
10459940	10463540	going to find games you haven't heard about before, and I think that's such a refreshing,
10463540	10464540	great thing.
10464540	10465540	Yes.
10465540	10472940	So, and if you see me there, say hello, try to not make it as creepy.
10472940	10474260	Say hi and don't be creepy.
10474260	10478060	All right, Seg, thanks so much for calling in, I got to let you go so we can wrap up
10478060	10479060	though.
10479060	10480060	Yep, great hearing from you guys.
10480060	10481060	It's John.
10481060	10484260	It was Johan Sebastian Joust.
10484260	10485860	Yes, that's it.
10485860	10487420	Oh, I've heard about that.
10487420	10488420	Okay.
10488420	10489420	Or maybe it's Johan.
10489900	10491900	That was the night games way back in the day too.
10491900	10492900	Nice.
10492900	10496300	All right, Seg, buddy, have fun and take lots of pictures because remember what they say,
10496300	10497300	pics or it didn't happen.
10497300	10498300	Yep, totally.
10498300	10499300	Take care of my friends.
10499300	10500300	Except for things that don't need to happen.
10500300	10504300	All right, take care, folks.
10504300	10506300	All right, that's awesome that Seg's going to be at IndieCade.
10506300	10509300	Well, I knew he was going to IndieCade, but I wish I could go.
10509300	10512740	It sounds like fun, but, you know, too many road trips.
10512740	10517660	I'm already going to LA in November for BlizzCon, which I know is really Anaheim, and the SoCal
10517900	10522580	people get pissed off when I call Orange County, LA, but you know what, when you're driving,
10522580	10523580	it's LA.
10523580	10524580	It's all just, it's one big blur.
10524580	10525580	It's LA.
10525580	10530500	Anyway, that is going to do it for the Skype line, and that is really going to just about
10530500	10531500	wrap up our show.
10531500	10534420	In fact, Dark Soccer, she had to head out, so she's already out of here.
10534420	10537780	So sadly, we will not get to hear her final thought, but I'm sure it has something to
10537780	10538780	do with cake.
10538780	10541140	I'm sure that's what her final thought was.
10541140	10542140	But we'll go around.
10542140	10543940	Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?
10543940	10547820	My final thought is, last week I work.
10547820	10548820	Wow.
10548820	10549820	The last two days.
10549820	10551540	Well, technically, I'm not working.
10551540	10557060	I'm just showing up at work to clean my desk and eat pizza and whatever breakfast donuts
10557060	10559860	that they bring in and then program in my game.
10559860	10561740	So I'm going to get lots of work done on my game.
10561740	10564900	Well, I'm going to apply for jobs too, but I'm also going to get lots of work done on
10564900	10572260	my game in this time that I have off because I'm going to be home with the baby for most
10572260	10575420	of the week, and then he's going to be going to daycare for the rest of it.
10575420	10579220	And so, yeah, I'm just going to...
10579220	10582660	But if you have a job lead for Loki, local people, if you have a job lead for Loki, let
10582660	10583660	us know.
10583660	10584660	Email the show.
10584660	10585660	Customer service!
10585660	10588520	As long as it's not fucking direct sales, because I've gotten contacted, I am not going
10588520	10591140	door to door or in a parking lot or something like that.
10591140	10595740	If your only experience with Loki is this show, you may not believe that he's great
10595740	10599660	with customer service, but think of this show as a release.
10599660	10601860	He really is good with the customer service stuff.
10602700	10605380	He had his job for a very long time and was very good at what he did.
10605380	10606380	Fourteen and a half years.
10606380	10607380	Oh my God.
10607380	10608380	Well, you know what?
10608380	10610460	In the distribution industry, what are you going to do?
10610460	10611460	You know what?
10611460	10612780	It'll lead to something better.
10612780	10613780	It really will.
10613780	10614780	Something with advancement.
10614780	10615780	All right.
10615780	10620020	And my final thought for tonight is, oh my gosh, I don't know.
10620020	10621440	I don't really have a final thought.
10621440	10626480	My final thought is I'm going to IKEA to get this thing a stand to sit on so I can take
10626480	10629740	pictures of it and put it online and everybody can oogle this arcade cabinet.
10629740	10630740	That'll be awesome.
10630740	10631740	Not yet.
10632620	10634620	In fact, the way I'm going to be working on it is a marquee.
10634620	10636900	I'll put my hand over the marquee so people can't see it.
10636900	10637900	I'll make a new marquee.
10637900	10639260	A new marquee looks awesome.
10639260	10642060	I just haven't figured out what else to put in the background because I have some DDR
10642060	10646740	arrows in there, but it's very much like a, was it a Street Fighter cross Tekken?
10646740	10649060	But it's minimalist is okay.
10649060	10650060	You don't have to go crazy.
10650060	10651060	I know.
10651060	10652060	I understand.
10652060	10655500	I may take the DDR arrows and just do a gradient and then print.
10655500	10656500	And then...
10656500	10657500	Talk to Cody.
10657500	10658500	That guy's great with graphics.
10658500	10659500	Jamie's good too.
10659500	10660500	They probably got a lot of...
10660500	10661500	Can I say something real quick?
10661500	10666700	Just to replace the, cause right now it says, you know, my company's name, was it a games
10666700	10669780	arcade in there and it has, it's got a really cool background.
10669780	10673420	I wish I'd saved it cause then I could just remove our company logo out of it and just
10673420	10674580	put this.
10674580	10676500	But the new one's pretty cool too.
10676500	10680300	And I was like, I was all, damn, do I have colored buttons that match that?
10680300	10684500	Because that would have been cool to do the orange and the purple buttons, but I don't.
10684500	10685500	Oh well.
10685500	10686500	Oh well.
