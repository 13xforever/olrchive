Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, rumors swirl of a possible acquisition of Minecraft developer Mojang as controversy unfolds involving the author of the mod Craftbucket.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
License and ownership accusations lie, as do fraudulent police reports.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The story goes much deeper than this, and we'll explain more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 14th, 2014 with episode number 567 of our show.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You numerology fans will be very happy with that tonight. 567 of our show.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all you guys listening live and via the podcast, as well as my co-hosts here in studio.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sup bitches?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey Jamie, how you doing?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm okay.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Today on VOGnetwork.com, you posted a review of Hatoful Boyfriend.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I posted a very basic preliminary review.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I see.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because as I told you offline, the game is more fucked up than you get just through the first story line.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Gotcha. How was it? I mean obviously-

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Pudding!

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We want people to go read the review, but overall-

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Pudding.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So it sounds like you're going to play more of it.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh yeah, I'm actually going to be livestreaming it.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was livestreaming my first playthrough.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I actually got the death ending first.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then, well most of the endings are-

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry, no spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh my god, you killed the damn bird? That's upsetting.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No! I got killed by the damn birds.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The birds kill you? Is this a Hitchcock film? What a fucked up game is this?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you don't pay the birds enough attention, then the secret bird society come and kills you.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My god, is my cat going to kill me? Is that why my cat's been trying to wake me up more and more at 4.30 in the morning?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, that's because cats are assholes.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, okay.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Also joining us in studio, say hello to tech master Loki.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I second that.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you Loki?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Cats are assholes.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, by the way, Loki, happy birthday from all of us here at OLR.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Happy birthdays.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You haven't told us what you want.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Loki had a birthday this week. He wants world peace and a new pair of glasses.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, fuck world peace.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What, two billion dollars?

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay, what would you reasonably like?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A new pair of glasses, apparently.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know. I don't know what I want.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Loki, what's up with- so you joined the glasses society this week?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm just wearing them to get used to them. I really don't need them.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Really?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't. I actively, literally take them off right now and be just fine.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're probably like me. Like, I have glasses, but I-

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I just think I look cooler with glasses on.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, me too.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I wear them.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Me too. I look smarter.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I wear glasses all the time because I need them.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I look older though, so that's the only problem.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You guys look like blurs.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My big thing is night driving. Like, driving at night, it's better if I have glasses on.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Like, I'm not being unsafe by doing it without, but, you know, instead of-

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Instead of, I see a red blob that looks like a stop sign, I can actually see clear-

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey kids! Look forward to this when you're over 35!

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, here's the thing, it's like, I don't really notice a difference wearing them.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not like, oh hey, that's a lot more clear. It's actually the same, except now, like, if I look far away, it's like, really annoying.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know. It's like, I can't- like, I can't read any of that text. Let's see.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, my eyes, see, they're blurry because I'm going-

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can't hear you, Lucky. Mic.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sorry. They're going back and forth between-

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why is my mic not working?

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyways, between, like, focusing with and without glasses, so I can't really tell, but, I mean, it looks about the same.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If there's any improvements, like, super small-

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Alright, well good to know you spent hundreds of dollars on those glasses.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't spend any money on it. My insurance spent money on it.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, that's good. That's good. Show them that.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, so, how did you spend the birthday? Did you have a good birthday?

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Um, I just stayed home and did nothing.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Gotcha. Well, you know, that's what I've been doing in my 30s.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's pretty much just, like, any night. We took care of the kids, that was about it.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How, let's see, you would be 32 this year?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Four.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
34? My god, why did I think you were way younger?

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
34.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're officially mid-30s. Welcome.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't wait till you guys get 37, so I can say it in a row. Like everyone did to me all last year.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yesterday, my sister had her wedding, so I went to that.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Did all that fun stuff.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There you go.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yep.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Alright, and your sister actually married, like, one of your best friends, right?

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, she married my best man at my wedding.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wow.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's neat.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, yeah, it worked out. And then, um, what else did I do this week? Yeah, that's pretty much it.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Had he caught the garter at your wedding?

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, no, the people that caught the garter in the bouquet at my wedding were actually my two cousins that were brother and sister.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So they had to dance with each other, which is kind of funny.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, but, um, it was kind of cool, though, because I got to see one of my cousins who I haven't seen in, like,

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
God, when I saw him, he was like eight last time, so now he's all grown up and stuff.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You know, I haven't seen most of my cousins since they were little, so I got to see them.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And, um, yeah.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think my cousin actually did catch the bouquet again, but she's getting married, so it's, you know.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know what garter I caught, whose wedding I caught the garter at, was Mel B.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For those of you DDR people back in the day, when Mel and Mel got married, I caught the garter.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, hasn't worked yet, but, you know.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, it was good times, good times.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Anyway, we're going to be talking about games with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern,

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Again, that's the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And folks in our chat talking about age.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Kaijuto in chat starting us off tonight saying,

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thirty-four, that's like the Atari 2600 demo.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Maybe I should have did a different song for the cookie today.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am, well, I think we have people of all ages really listen to our show.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know people in their 40s that listen to OLR and have a good time with it.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know people, we'll get emails.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, actually, I met a listener not that long ago.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It was like, yeah, I used to listen to you guys in high school.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And now I'm in my mid-20s.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Two of my coworkers listen to us in high school.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is that awkward at all?

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
One of them's true.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, okay. Well, that's, yeah.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Drew and Jay.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, okay.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, thankfully, nobody at my work, I don't think, listens to OLR.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think one person did once and then probably-

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They won't make that mistake again.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They won't make that mistake again, that's for sure.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I may actually have some of my coworkers from Locat listening tonight, so.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, howdy and hello to all of you that might be listening.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, I'm famous.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Or something.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm famous on the internet. What does that get me?

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Can I get a raise?

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I am not pushing my luck.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's see.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, yeah.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Kossin in our chat room says, I'm not the oldest one in the room.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I went to the movies today and didn't get carded.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That happens to me a lot. I don't get carded for booze or bars anymore.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They stopped carding me at the bars.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, Rob.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I know. That's done.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know what's funny? I'm older than you.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I got carded for my bottle of Beaujolais last week.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, but, you know, you don't have a beard and thinning hair.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No, I just have an alley on my chin.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Aww.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I fell.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Isn't that a big lie that you think you're supposed to be done with acne after your teens?

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It wasn't acne this time.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This was me falling and scraping my chin on the wall.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Ouch.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
On the wall texture.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I've fallen and I can't get up.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Was it cat related? Because that's a cat move right there, you know?

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's like, seriously, you're just walking through the hallway, minding your own business, and they dart out of the corner.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Excuse me while I run to the next room for no reason because I'm batshit insane and an asshole.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, just like this morning.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, that wasn't cat related. It was holding laundry related.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hey, 5.30, everybody's asleep. This never happens at 5.30. I won't wake everybody up because I'm an asshole.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's what Sanrio's resorted to doing lately is it's like, hey, it's 4.30 in the morning. Let's jump up on daddy's bed.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We've actually started locking Midna out of the bedroom at night.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because apparently she's like, starts pawing at Dan's face and getting cat hair in his eyes.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She's like, daddy, mama's making that noise again. Get up and feed me, daddy.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Alright, look, we could talk about cats all night long. In fact, as somebody said earlier, Fifth Dream in our chatroom said,

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
cat-iful, boyfriend. Maybe that'll be the sequel.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But we want to talk about games. And for our kickoff topic tonight, by the way, later in the show,

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
joining us later around the 7 o'clock hour, Jonas and Diego are going to be back tonight from T-Banger,

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
which if you were listening a couple weeks ago, the big anime game room, T-B-A-G-R, the big anime game room.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They're going to be back tonight. I want to talk to them about SacAnime, Dreamcast Birthday,

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and whatever else they might have on their mind. They might have some upcoming appearances to plug as well.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is YowieCon coming up? They're probably doing that.

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Probably.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's happening. And GamerX3.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
YowieCon's always been in October, I think.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
GamerX3 is going to happen next year, and I'm sure they're going to come back for that.

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm assuming the Kickstarter is going to be a success. If you don't know about the GamerX3 Kickstarter,

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
they're very, very close to their goal, so if you want to get your tickets for cheap, you should go.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And actually, I can say this on the show, myself, on behalf of VOG Network, kicked out the money,

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so VOG is actually going to be a sponsor of GamerX3.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So we will be there with the table, and very cool.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And just announced Jennifer Hale is going to be one of their guests.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The voice of FemShep, and what? She's what?

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Leah in Diablo. She's in lots and lots of games.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And she's Ms. Marvel.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And she's Ms. Marvel.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So anyway, that's very exciting stuff to look forward to.

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So we'll talk to them about conventions later on the show.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We will get into our gaming weeks here, but I always like to do a little bit of a kickoff.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Unfortunately, my co-hosts haven't played this yet this week, so I don't know how much of this we can talk about,

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but I want to talk about the big anticipation for Super Smash Bros.,

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
which, I got to admit, the worst titles in the franchise ever,

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
because it looks like they are really going with Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and for Wii U.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did they lay off the person that comes up with titles for anything, like for Nintendo a while back?

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because seriously, it's like, yeah, we're going to call that the new 3DS.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, we're just going to call that Smash Bros. for Wii U, because, you know...

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I guess it's one of those things where, I mean, it is what it is.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Nintendo is delivering what they want.

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They want Smash Bros. on Wii U.

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So here it is. Smash Bros. for Wii U.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like, at least it is what it is.

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not some crazy name like Wii U as a system, I don't know.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But anyway, I digress.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So, I'm sure you guys have all heard, if you're listening to this show,

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
it's all over Twitter and all over Facebook and all that,

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
but for whatever reason you missed the boat on this,

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Smash Bros. has a demo for the 3DS version coming out this Friday.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's going to be a demo playable for everybody to check out this Friday,

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
but Nintendo sent out emails to folks that were Platinum members

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
between certain dates of Club Nintendo for a period of time in about the past year

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
who get their email things,

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and Nintendo just basically said,

226
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
hey, we thought you'd want a sneak peek at the Smash demo, so here it is.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And here are three...

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So it was four codes all together because Smash Bros. is a four-player game, right?

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So here's four codes for you and some friends to enjoy Smash Bros. on 3DS,

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the demo, one week early.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's the Google effect where it's an invite-only thing

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and now everybody's got to have it.

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was something that the fans are crazy over, like Smash Bros.,

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because we all know Nintendo's got some hardcore fans, right?

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hardcore fans.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And then when you talk about Smash Bros. on Nintendo,

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
they love their Smash Bros., right?

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So people are foaming at the mouths insane for copies of this demo one week early.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Especially since the Japanese version's already out

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and all the rosters have already been leaked.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Right. Well, and there's another certain level of insanity

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
where you already own the Japanese 3DS and you just imported it from Japan.

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm looking at you, my pal Captain Spike from GamePooey.org,

244
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but that's why we love you.

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There's that level of foaming at the mouth crazy.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I did that for Brawl, so whatever.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
All right, fair enough. We've all been there,

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and I did it for BeatMania 2DX back in the day.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So some of us that have been able to do that in the past, we've all been there.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But then there's that next level where it's like, I've got to have this now.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And people are selling codes on eBay for 20, 30 bucks on eBay.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
People are scouting Twitter up and down.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And if you even say Smash Code on Twitter, people are like,

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
got any extra, bro? Hey, bro, got any extra? Hey, got some extra Smash?

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, it's insane how people will jump on that.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They just need to hit, man. They just need a little bit.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, and here's the thing. I was fully prepared to wait a week to play the demo

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because I'm like, sure, I want to check it out.

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But I'm like, I'm not going to pay 20 bucks to download the code.

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And to be fair, I'm not a platinum, foaming Nintendo member.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If I have to wait, okay.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But then I saw one of our listeners, ActDeft, wrote a tweet,

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and he was like, yay, I got my email.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I just thought, I'll just try asking.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I want to get in before the other guys, the Twitter brigade,

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
hits him up and tries to get all his codes.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So I just said, hi, I don't have a code. Do you have any extras?

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And he said, sure. So thank you, ActDeft.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He gave me a code, and I was able to check out the demo.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So that was very nice of him to do that.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I felt bad, though, for Shane because another listener contacted me

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the next day and was like, hey, Rob, did you get into the Smash demo

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
because I have an extra code?

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I said, you know, I didn't get in, but I know Shane is dying to get in

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
because Shane was playing my 3DS, and I knew he wanted to get his own

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
so we could play against each other.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So this guy just tweeted Shane a code.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He didn't use direct message, though,

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
because probably Shane wasn't following him at the time or whatever,

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
so he couldn't send a direct message, so he just tweeted Shane the code.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, you can guess what happened in the hour that it took Shane

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to get home from work and see that he had a code.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Somebody stole it, which, you know, I...

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's not selling if you put it on your front porch and say, get it.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, no, and to be fair, you know, but it sucks that the listener

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
had every good intention and probably had no idea that everybody

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
would see the code or whatever.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It just kind of sucks that people take advantage of that situation.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I understand it's like, well, you should have waited in DM,

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
but at the same time, you know, somebody's trying to do a good thing,

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and somebody took advantage of that, and that's really poopy, so...

292
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But thank you to everybody.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can't trust humans.

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know, it sucks, and it sucks, but anyway,

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
big thanks to everybody that's offered to help out with the Smash demo.

296
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I really appreciate that.

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Maybe if you're in chat right now at live.vognetwork.com

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and you happen to have an extra code or two,

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sure some listeners would be very, very thankful.

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The one thing that this early demo does have versus the Friday demo

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
is apparently the one that came out early has unlimited uses,

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and the one that's going to come out Friday has only 30 uses,

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
like a lot of the Nintendo demos do,

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
which I never really understood the point of that,

305
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but at the same time, I don't think I've ever played a demo past like maybe 25.

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think Bravely Default I got down to 25.

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I think I had to play it five times before I beat it, you know, or...

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, Saints Row I must have played until the game came out.

309
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Right, right.

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So what do you guys think about what Nintendo's doing with that

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to kind of drive the anticipation?

312
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll talk about my thoughts on the demo real quick.

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, by the way, if you didn't already know, the demo has five playable characters,

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Mario, Link, Mega Man, the Villager from Animal Crossing, and Pikachu,

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and only one stage, so that's essentially the demo.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
None of the other side modes are in there or anything like that,

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
but it's enough to give you a taste,

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and for me, it was very much about seeing how Smash Bros. runs on a 3DS,

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
because I have to admit, I'm kind of like,

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't know if I'm going to get Smash Bros. on the 3DS,

321
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
because that's a game you play on the TV with all the zoom-ins and outs and all that stuff.

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if I'm going to really get it on the 3DS,

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but at least the demo was able to help me see if I would get it,

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and I'm using my quotey fingers, get it or not.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But quickly, before I get to my thoughts on the demo,

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you guys and your thoughts about how Nintendo is doing this.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Is this a good thing for them to build buzz?

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is it a little ridiculous? What do you think?

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I mean, it's a good thing, I guess.

330
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There was already a lot of buzz as it was just because of all the leaked rosters and everything.

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It just gets people excited about it.

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But at the same time, though, demos aren't necessarily a good thing,

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and so there are a lot of people that may have picked it up at one time just to pick it up,

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and then they play it, and they're like,

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you know what, it doesn't really look that good on the 3DS.

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm just going to buy it on the Wii U or something like that.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So they may lose a little bit of sales from that,

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
but they'll gain a lot of buzz from it also.

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah. Let's see, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Kaijuto in chat says, if you buy a code, you deserve to be ripped off.

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, I wonder if that was a thing where people were selling fake codes.

342
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yikes.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Dark Tetsuya said, you should see the Mario Kart 8 community I'm on on Facebook.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This whole week you'd think it was a mislabeled Smash Brothers community.

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So yeah, and let's see, Bochikawa says, I'll just wait for the other demo,

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
or wait for Wii U, probably the later.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And S2100Matt says, I'm skeptical too, but I will end up getting it anyways.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm almost done with my 3DS games that I play on my commute.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Again, those comments from live.vognetwork.com.

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Jamie, any quick thoughts on how Nintendo's doing this?

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is this a good thing to build buzz,

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
or is this kind of annoying when they build this super special secret club

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
type of thing for a week?

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think that it's a good way to encourage people to make Platinum level.

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Other than that, honestly, it's been building the buzz.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
People are talking about it.

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think that's what their goal was.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What the rest of the populace does isn't their concern at that point.

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right.

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's interesting you talk about how it gives the value to the Platinum level

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
because I seem to remember that this year Nintendo got a lot of flak

362
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
because all of their rewards this year were digital only.

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Remember that?

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Their Platinum and Gold rewards were just virtual console games

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
like Wario, Game and Warrior, or whatever.

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A few other little games were available for Platinum and Gold.

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Nintendo got razzed for that a little bit,

368
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
but now we're finding that if you're a Platinum Nintendo person,

369
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
maybe you're going to get access to shit like this.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Can you imagine what's going to happen next year

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
if the Platinum people get the Zelda demo early?

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Maybe this is the start of something for Nintendo. Who knows?

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Even then, all of the people selling codes and this, that, and the other,

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
at that point that stops being Nintendo's concern.

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The buzz is there. That's what they want.

376
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Right. Exactly.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All right, so let me talk about the demo itself real quick.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Again, I don't like to base my impressions of the game off the demo,

379
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but it is very ironic that just the day before this all happened,

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I was kind of talking on Twitter, and I was getting into,

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know if you want to say it was a debate,

382
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
but just a discussion on why I wasn't really jazzed about Smash on 3DS,

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but why for other people it was a great thing.

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And in general, I have a hard time getting really thrilled about handhelds.

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And it could have been worse than that Smash Bros thing.

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They could have totally went the route of, oh, yeah, you can go get the demo.

387
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You have to beam it to your 3DS. You got to go visit the GameStop to do that.

388
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Bite your tongue. Bite your tongue. Anyway, let me finish.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No, that's fine.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So I was kind of talking about how, you know, I'm not really big on handhelds,

391
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and I find that I only seem to play them ever if I'm on a plane for a few hours,

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and I don't like having that tiny little screen.

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I feel like you have more real estate on a big screen.

394
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't really get the allure, quote, unquote, of handheld games.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But there were some other people that were talking back to me,

396
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and one of the comments that really resonated with me was from AkumaJP,

397
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and I don't, sorry, buddy, I forget exactly what you said,

398
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but it got me thinking about how, like in Japan, handhelds are a way bigger thing.

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why? Because there's that total commute culture, so to speak.

400
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Not that we don't have that here, but like in Japan,

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
you also have like that big subway and public transit are really big,

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and a lot of people play games on that, so like 3DS makes a lot of sense.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I thought you weren't allowed to use electronics on the trains.

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, maybe not. I don't know, but it got me thinking about like all that.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's probably the culture is probably more like, you know, friendly to the handhelds and so forth,

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and then like Captain Spike was talking about how he has this,

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and I know he takes the Bay Area train into work all the time,

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and he probably has like an hour every day where he's able to play 3DS.

409
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's not part of my lifestyle, so I see the 3DS as, you know,

410
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it's like the mini screen to play things on, because when I get home from work,

411
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I plop on the couch and I want to play something on the TV,

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so that's why I don't get as excited about handheld games.

413
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But anyway, so there's no right or wrong.

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think it's just your perception based on your lifestyle, what kind of speaks to you.

415
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So anyway, I was a little concerned about Smash on 3DS because, you know,

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the game has a tendency to zoom in and out. It's fast paced.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Was it going to be too blurry? Was it going to be too hard to see?

418
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And the answer is a little bit for me, but not game ruining bad, if that makes sense.

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Keep in mind, I'm playing on an XL.

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If I had a regular 3DS, and I know Bobby talked about this on his show tonight,

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
he had some frustrations playing on a regular 3DS,

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I could see where that's going to be pretty hard to do,

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
especially when you get into those four player matches and the screen zooms all the way out.

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's going to be really rough.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Did you mess with the outline options or whatever in there?

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Not really. I didn't really tinker with the... I don't even know if that was an option, so to speak, to play with.

427
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I didn't even really get in there and play with that.

428
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, you can adjust them.

429
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Can you? Well, you know, and that's probably help.

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But, you know, I didn't dislike it at all.

431
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In fact, you know, it was Smash Brothers. It was enjoyable enough.

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's kind of, you know, what I remember.

433
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm way more into the series than I do.

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can probably speak more as to, you know, the subtle differences and everything,

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but I just know I had a lot of fun playing as Mega Man,

436
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
because I've gotten to play a Mega Man game that wasn't like a virtual console

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
or revisit of an old game in a very long time.

438
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So getting to play as Mega Man in the demo was an awful lot of fun.

439
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So that was pretty cool to me.

440
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And, you know, I was able to win a couple matches and get a feel for the game

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that it will probably be worth buying on 3DS.

442
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It really depends on how long the wait is between 3DS and Wii U,

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
because they still haven't announced the date for Wii U, right?

444
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Even though...

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
21st November.

446
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Is that official or is that still the rumor based on the Fred Meyer leak?

447
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's been...

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's going to be the 21st of November, I'm sure.

449
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't doubt that. That's literally the last Friday before Black Friday, right?

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, that's when they have, was it, the new 3DS Pokemon games,

451
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I guess, coming out as well.

452
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So it's going to probably be around that time.

453
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Just like even, like, grant the thought of the rumor was it was going to be coming out on the 18th

454
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and it finally came out on the 18th, so...

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah.

456
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So whether I get the game or not I think is really going to depend on

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
do all my friends get it too?

458
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do I have people to play with?

459
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Is that hype thing going to be there?

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Is there going to be functionality with the 3DS and the Wii U

461
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that makes me want to buy the 3DS version?

462
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes, I've heard about the controller, right?

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Which, by the way, on an earlier show didn't I tinfoil hat and say

464
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the 3DS could be a Wii U controller someday.

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So...

466
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But anyway.

467
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know why the 3DS is a Wii U controller actually makes a lot of sense?

468
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because what other controllers are there?

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
There's the Pro Controller, right?

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But how many people have actually run out and bought those?

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Or you get those little Wiimotes from the old Nintendo Wii

472
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that don't really have very many buttons.

473
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So the 3DS makes a very obvious, easy, portable controller.

474
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Not everybody may like the way it feels, but it gives you the buttons

475
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and the D-pad and everything that you need.

476
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So it makes a lot of sense to me.

477
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But anyway.

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So that's ultimately going to be what I base it on.

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't feel like I have to have Smash on the 3DS

480
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
knowing that the Wii U version is imminent.

481
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But I'll probably get it.

482
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It'll just kind of depend on a few other factors.

483
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
All right.

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
ActDef says, whether on 3DS or Wii U, Smash is going to be the game of these holidays.

486
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Let's see.

487
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Kaijuto says they should have given me a demo.

488
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm an ambassador, dammit.

489
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let's see.

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
AkumaJP says you can do what you want on trains.

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So apparently it's fine to play 3DS and all that stuff on the trains there.

492
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Maybe I was just thinking more of the tucking on cell phones.

493
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Perhaps.

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And 5th Dream says you can't talk out loud on a phone on trains.

495
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's how I understood it anyway.

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Maybe that's that.

497
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And SH200Matt says I can see that.

498
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I mean, I commute three hours a day to and from work.

499
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I need to pass the time by playing a game or watching something on the trains

500
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
when I'm not sleeping, of course.

501
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

502
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And my commute to work is 20 minutes in my car.

503
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So I can't exactly.

504
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I like to listen to the radio.

505
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I can't play games or anything like that.

506
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So, yeah, I guess it's very dependent, I guess, on how you do your day and your culture.

507
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, I'm sure everybody else is going to be looking forward to that Smash demo on Friday,

508
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
those that aren't in yet.

509
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And lots of people are going to be giving their impressions.

510
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So I'm curious what you guys think throughout the week.

511
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You can always send us an e-mail with your thoughts if you want.

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Participate at orangelandradio.com.

513
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks

514
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and what other video games we have been playing this week

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
besides some of the things we've brought up in the show already.

516
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I dated birds.

518
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We already talked about that.

519
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah, I've played Hot to Fool Boyfriend.

520
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I've played a little bit of Mass Effect 3.

521
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I've played some Final Fantasy XIV today.

522
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This week has really been a lot of adjusting to my new work schedule

523
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
because now I work four days, ten hours.

524
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So most of this morning was spent sleeping.

525
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But, yeah, I'm actually going to be making it a point

526
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
to play more stuff that's on my list.

527
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So Hot to Fool Boyfriend is every Tuesday.

528
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm livestreaming it at twitch.tv forward slash dark sakura underscore olr.

529
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I'll probably be throwing in some other games too,

530
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but I'm working now on my dailies for Final Fantasy XIV

531
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and going to be getting back into Bravely Defart.

532
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Good times.

533
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

534
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I played nothing.

535
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Again? Because you've been programming.

536
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You've been playing your own game of secrets.

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I haven't really been playing my own game,

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
but yeah, I've been programming my own game.

539
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I had to rewrite my whole...

540
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's pretty much the whole way that everything's drawn in the game.

541
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So I finished that this week.

542
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I just now...

543
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The only thing I've left to do is rebuild my user interface for my editor.

544
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So I'm not using the crappy old Unity user interface.

545
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm actually going to use the nice ones.

546
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So I've got to have to look into doing that.

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There was a recommendation, because I watched this week

548
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
because my work's been really slow.

549
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
In fact, it's going to become pretty much non-existent at the end of this week

550
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
because they're going to shut off our current system.

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And so at that point, I will have literally nothing to do.

552
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Look for a new job, I guess.

553
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, yeah. So I've been at work.

554
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Hey, if anyone's hiring.

555
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah, exactly. Anyone's hiring, yeah.

556
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I've been just...

557
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I watched some tutorial series.

558
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They had Microsoft's Virtual Academy crap.

559
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So they had some stuff talking about Unity

560
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and talking about incorporating stuff into Microsoft Azure and that stuff.

561
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So I was watching that, but they were showing the new user interface.

562
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They did it in a certain way where the canvas was really large

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
so that the units on there equaled one pixel and stuff.

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So I kind of want to set mine up like that, because that looked pretty cool

565
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and made a lot of sense.

566
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So I just have to figure that out.

567
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Hopefully I'm getting close, because now that I've rewritten everything,

568
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I think it's going to be efficient enough.

569
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I mean, because, God, if this isn't efficient enough,

570
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
then I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

571
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't know. I'll figure something out.

572
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I think I've gotten it to the point now where it's as efficient as it's going to be.

573
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And so we'll just have to play with that.

574
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And yeah, so still shooting to have something playable soon, hopefully.

575
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Nice.

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But that's about it.

577
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, I thought about getting Destiny, but I was just like,

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
yeah, you know, I can spend the money now.

579
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But it would be on an Xbox version,

580
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and I don't really want to get an Xbox One version,

581
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
because God knows when I'm getting an Xbox One.

582
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm probably going to get PlayStation 4 at some point.

583
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But I don't know.

584
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I just didn't want to spend the money on it right now,

585
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because I don't have the time to play it.

586
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Or at least I just don't want to spend the time playing it right now.

587
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Although Grand Theft Auto coming out again right around the corner is like, uh-oh.

588
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That might get you, huh?

589
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
All right.

590
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, then let me start off my gaming week talking about one thing

591
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that I played briefly this week between everything else.

592
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I got my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U this week.

593
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Thank you very much.

594
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Thank you very much.

595
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Stop rolling your eyes over there, young lady.

596
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I did get my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U,

597
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
so I played it just a little bit,

598
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and I went right into multiplayer because I wanted to check out

599
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
how the multiplayer runs.

600
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
My only complaint is that loading times are a real pain in the butt,

601
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but I seem to remember they were pretty bad on 360 as well,

602
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
so I can't really haze it for that.

603
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And in multiplayer, you don't get the maps on the game pad.

604
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You get the score, so you don't have to pause the game.

605
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But I did not realize that that whole voice chat thing

606
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
that's in, like, Mario Kart 8 is in Mass Effect.

607
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I thought you had to have a separate headset in order to use voice chat.

608
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You don't. You can do talking through the Wii U game pad.

609
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So that was unexpected and kind of cool.

610
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So, yeah.

611
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Otherwise, yeah, I didn't play a whole lot of that.

612
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I just put it in and played it for a little bit.

613
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Is it in-game or just in lobbies?

614
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
In-game.

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do they have that in-game in Mario Kart 8?

616
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
No, only in the lobby.

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So, yeah, right?

618
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
There's this feature that doesn't seem to be in any other freaking game.

619
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's so stupid.

620
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No, protect the kids! Protect them!

621
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, come on!

622
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
They are on the internet, okay?

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
They've already been exposed to everything already.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's just...

625
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No, there's a big mic button on the thing so that you can push it and then talk.

626
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And it's like your push to talk is on the game pad.

627
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You know what?

628
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I hate encouraging this kind of behavior,

629
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but I would totally be fine with them

630
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
enabling parental settings from the get-go

631
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and paying 60 cents to unlock it

632
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
if all this bullshit would go away.

633
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Like, if they just made the friend codes thing a lot easier,

634
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
if they just allowed voice chat throughout the entire thing the entire time,

635
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I think it's worth it for that sacrifice.

636
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Otherwise, with my week, I've been continuing on Diablo 3 in all different forms.

637
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
PC, I have my hardcore character I'm playing on PC.

638
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I have a Crusader I'm playing on PC with a friend of mine.

639
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Those are both seasonal characters, so I'm working through the 2.1 stuff with that.

640
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And then I'm still playing on PS4.

641
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I have my Barbarian.

642
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I was playing a little bit with Extifer one night this week.

643
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I think I'm up to, like, Paragon 30, I think, on my Barbarian.

644
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And then I also have a hardcore Witch Doctor

645
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
because I'm trying to get the rest of those trophies.

646
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I really think I am going to take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy,

647
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
which might not happen this holiday with all the other games coming out,

648
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but I think eventually I will take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy.

649
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't think, maybe on a PSN game somewhere,

650
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
but I don't think I have a single Platinum Trophy on any PSN game,

651
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
but it's totally achievable for me with Diablo 3, so I think I'm going to do it.

652
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Alright, but then the other big thing this week that's been eating up an awful lot of my time,

653
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
as I'm sure many of you have had your time eaten up by this game,

654
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
except, of course, Loki didn't play it,

655
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and I know Dar Sakura's not really interested in this title,

656
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but I know a lot of you guys out there have been checking out Destiny.

657
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Destiny, of course, the hugely anticipated Bungie title that released on 9ix9ine,

658
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the makers of Halo, which, you know, I'm not huge on first-person shooters,

659
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
but I've always had a bit of a special place in my heart for Halo,

660
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and I've told this story on the show before.

661
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I got introduced to Halo 1 at a wedding at the reception.

662
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The bride and groom decided they wanted to have a Halo land party for their wedding reception

663
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
because, you know, it was an awesome wedding like that.

664
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So that's where I got introduced to Halo for the first time,

665
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and I loved playing the multiplayer. It was a lot of fun,

666
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and that rolled into playing Halo 2 with my buddies from college.

667
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So I've always had a good respect for the Halo series,

668
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and I really enjoyed Halo 4 as well, which I talked about on the show when that came out,

669
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and that's probably what's going to finally make me get a freaking Xbox One,

670
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
is this Halo collection or Halo 5 will probably finally do it

671
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
because I know 343 has got the series now and they're doing a good job with it,

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but I digress.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So Bungie's put out Destiny this week,

674
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and it was not totally what I think we were expecting from the makers of Halo,

675
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but, you know, you could say that based on the beta,

676
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and I talked before when I played the beta about how Destiny felt more influenced

677
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
by a game like Phantasy Star Online than it necessarily did a game like Halo,

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and I still believe that to be true with the full release of the game.

679
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let's talk about some of the good things about Destiny.

680
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I love the way that Destiny fosters a cooperative environment.

681
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You've heard the term mingle player out there apply to this game,

682
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and I think that that is actually a really neat thing.

683
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't think there's a whole lot of use out of random people on the planet while you're there.

684
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Once in a great while, you might find that you're fighting the same pack of mobs,

685
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
so you inadvertently help each other, and that's, I guess, kind of cool,

686
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
but I like way more how, oh, everybody's playing Destiny this week,

687
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and let's say Bobby sees that I'm online, which happened this week.

688
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Bobby sees that I'm online playing, doing missions on the moon,

689
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
so he just presses a couple buttons, joins my fire team,

690
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
warps to where I am on the moon, and now we're doing missions together,

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and that's kind of fun because we didn't have to set that up,

692
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and I know there's a lot of co-op games out there,

693
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
but you have to kind of set that up and, oh, we're going to play co-op in such and such time.

694
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The environment of Destiny is very drop-in, drop-out, and that's really cool,

695
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and I like what they've done for adventuring in that way.

696
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I love that as somebody who's not very good at first-person shooters,

697
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I can out-level things.

698
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I can take things at my own pace by doing these open-world missions on Earth

699
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or on the moon or on Venus or whatever

700
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and level myself to a point where then I can go back and play the story content,

701
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and it's not as difficult because some of the story content does get pretty difficult,

702
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and I don't know if I would be able to beat it

703
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
if I was necessarily at the same level that you're supposed to be.

704
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So there is no difficulty scale in Destiny,

705
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
but it's okay because you can sort of create your own destiny

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
with the difficulty in regards to how much are you willing to go back and grind and some of that.

707
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The music in Destiny is phenomenal,

708
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
which always makes that more surprising that the guy was let go from Bungie,

709
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
which we had that story a few months ago,

710
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
but neither here nor there.

711
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The music in Destiny is fantastic,

712
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
very good at setting the ambiance and building the tension

713
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
when you get into these moments when the enemies just show up,

714
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and it's not like a metal gear alarm goes off.

715
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The music really builds naturally and builds this anticipation.

716
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's so well done, and even though I have caught similar bits being reused in places in the game,

717
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
the music doesn't get repetitive at all,

718
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
which in most MMOs, I'm using my quotey fingers because I don't really consider Destiny an MMO,

719
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
but in most MMOs, the music gets very repetitive.

720
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That doesn't feel the case in Destiny, so that's very good.

721
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And last but not least in the good column, graphics are fantastic,

722
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and I'm playing on PS4, and I just got to the Venus level,

723
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and it's gorgeous, my god.

724
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I could just sit there and walk around.

725
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I was doing that on the moon. I was just walking around.

726
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Where's another pretty cave I can go in and look at pretty purple things?

727
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because that was a lot of fun.

728
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's talk about some of the not so good about Destiny,

729
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
because I haven't read reviews out there.

730
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't usually read a lot of reviews on games unless my friends write them.

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But my understanding is the Metacritic for Destiny is not above 90,

732
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
which for a game of this magnitude of anticipation means it's an absolute colossal failure.

733
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't really mean that. It's just the impression I'm getting from Twitter.

734
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So I don't remember what the Metacritic is for this game right now.

735
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's high 70s, low 80s, something like that, which is still good.

736
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And isn't 70 considered average? I don't know.

737
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Is 50 considered average? I don't even know what the hell is considered average on Metacritic.

738
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But it sounds like it's still at least above average, and that's probably where I'd place Destiny 2.

739
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I would not give this game an A+.

740
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In fact, I may review the game on VoG later once I've been able to complete my playthrough.

741
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But some of the things I can tell you that detract from the game a little bit.

742
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
For a game this caliber with this much anticipation, with this much of a budget that's gone into it,

743
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the story sucks. There's no easy way to say it.

744
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There's no nice sugar-coat-y way to say it.

745
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
The story's really uninteresting.

746
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't really fucking care why I'm blowing up all these aliens.

747
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
These cutscenes I'm forced to watch that I can't skip over that are really annoying.

748
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It just seems so generic. Ugh.

749
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's really not until I got to Venus and this first cutscene on Venus where I finally met a character

750
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
where I was like, okay, now this character is at least borderline interesting.

751
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But it's so badly voice-acted, too.

752
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We've talked about this during the beta.

753
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The Peter Dinklage ghost character. Not a good character.

754
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And your own avatar, whatever you tend to play as, either a female or a male,

755
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
like human or Awoken or robot, dude or dudette, I don't remember what they're called.

756
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Sometimes your character talks like they're there.

757
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Sometimes your character is that MMO character that doesn't do the talk and everybody else talks around.

758
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's so weird how your character is sometimes there and sometimes not, it seems like, in the way the story is told.

759
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So, yeah, not a good story.

760
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And for a game of this magnitude, especially coming from Bungie, I was really surprised and kind of disappointed.

761
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's flat. I'm not interested.

762
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Now, granted, I haven't beat it yet, so maybe it picks up a lot of steam,

763
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but it would still be a detractor that has taken this long to get interesting, if that's the case.

764
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
One of the detractors of Phantasy Star Online plays into this game as well,

765
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
is that you're killing the same things over and over and over again with the hope that some new loot will drop.

766
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And right in Phantasy Star Online, it was always the dudes with the claws and sometimes Arapi would come out in forest, right?

767
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You have to kill more, kill more, kill more.

768
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Or the other of the lizard-y things.

769
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yes, and the lizard-y things.

770
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And there's probably two or three different monster types on Earth and on the Moon.

771
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That variety is a little bit eh.

772
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They try to spice it up with this thing that reminds me of the fates in Final Fantasy XIV,

773
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
where this big world event will suddenly happen.

774
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It doesn't happen very often, but for instance, one time I was on Earth doing patrol missions

775
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and a giant spider boss showed up for everybody to kill.

776
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And you would get stuff if you participated in that.

777
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So that made it at least a little more interesting, but it is kind of a slog of the same stuff over and over.

778
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I get really excited when I see something new in the game. That helps out a lot.

779
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And the other big problem I have with the game, which again, coming from the makers of Halo,

780
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
really surprises me that this is kind of a weak point of the game.

781
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:41,000
PvP. It's gated, which means that you have to, if you want to play the PvP free-for-all deathmatch,

782
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
which was always my favorite thing to play in Halo, you have to play a 3v3 control map one time.

783
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Win or lose, you must play that map.

784
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Then you must play a team deathmatch map.

785
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Then you will unlock the free-for-all deathmatch.

786
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And by the way, you can't even get to the Crucible until you're like level 5 or 6 or something in the story.

787
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So if I want to buy Destiny and just hop in a brawl with my friends,

788
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
where we're all going to just blow the fuck out of each other with rocket launchers,

789
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
you can't do that in Destiny.

790
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You have to wait until you get to a certain point.

791
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You're going to have to play to unlock it.

792
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And then when you get there, I tried playing some of the PvP,

793
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and it didn't really thrill me the way that playing Halo did for the first time or playing any of that did.

794
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It really feels like the sideshow.

795
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So if you're looking at Destiny for PvP, I kind of worry that you're going to be a little bit disappointed.

796
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Now I know that Bungie plans to do these events where they're going to roll out special maps for a weekend.

797
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But again, that seems really weird to me too.

798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Why are you going to have that stuff only playable for like 3 days and then shut it off?

799
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I mean, it's one thing to roll it out slowly or whatever, but why have something that's not going to be there again?

800
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't know if I get the logic behind that.

801
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So PvP, not as fun as I was hoping.

802
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Alright, going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

803
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

804
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's literally the same fucking story as so many other things.

805
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We discovered alien technology and everything was awesome and we were in outer space being hella rad,

806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
but then aliens came and killed everybody and we're just trying to survive now.

807
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yep.

808
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
BlackWolf in chat says,

809
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't blame Peter Dinklage, I blame his director.

810
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Me too. Unfortunately, the blame is going to ultimately fall on Peter Dinklage, whether it's his fault or not.

811
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That sucks, but I agree that the direction of the story in general, it's a problem.

812
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And it's so frustrating because on one hand, the audio is so good.

813
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The music is so good that the story components and the narration, the talking doesn't match.

814
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And it's a glaring issue.

815
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't know how else to put it.

816
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I notice when these characters open their mouths, I'm just like, shut up, I want to hear the music.

817
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What you're saying is literally not important.

818
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Let's see.

819
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Tigerclaw says,

820
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I heard how this game is much like Halo.

821
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The ghost character is basically the guilty spark from Halo.

822
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Again, I think it's more Phantasy Star Online than Halo.

823
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I stand by that.

824
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Let's see.

825
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
SSG100Matt says,

826
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Sounds like a ton of hoops to jump through just to play PvP.

827
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yep.

828
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But there's a lot of people that don't give two shits about PvP,

829
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
so I can understand where that's like an asset to them, maybe.

830
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But for me, I was hoping to just play a little bit of it.

831
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But I'm glad that also one thing I noticed in PvP, I can't hear anybody.

832
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I don't know if that's just a PlayStation 4 thing,

833
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
or if they just flat out turn the voice chat off in PvP.

834
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And I kind of hope that's the case, honestly,

835
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
is that they just turn the damn voice chat off on PvP.

836
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Dungeonbuster says,

837
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I technically beat it, and then I'll just leave it at that.

838
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Destiny will sometimes mix encounters up with specials, too.

839
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Enemies with yellow names that are a bit tougher.

840
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And Dungeonbuster continues,

841
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
More stuff only opens up post level 20.

842
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Economy is also gated limited.

843
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You can only earn so many Vanguard Crucible Marks currency per week,

844
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and that's what's needed to buy legendary equipment

845
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
coupled with an appropriate faction rank.

846
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, that's where MMO is very much.

847
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Blackwool says,

848
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Marty O'Donnell must have hated the voice acting, so he was fired.

849
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, who knows? Who knows?

850
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So anyway, that's my thoughts on Destiny.

851
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And yeah, there you have it.

852
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So we are going to get into some housekeeping,

853
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and then we're going to get into tonight's news.

854
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And then I'm going to say hi to our guests tonight

855
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
who are just arriving here in studio.

856
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm going to get them miked up here while we have Loki start off the news.

857
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
First off, follow us on YouTube.

And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

863
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Curious to see what you guys think about Destiny.

864
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm going to try to beat the game,

865
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so I feel armed enough to do a review for vognetwork.com later in the week.

866
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And of course, should that happen,

867
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you guys will be able to leave your response reviews there at vognetwork.com.

868
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Tigerclaw says, sounds like Destiny was destined to fail.

869
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm going to leave it at this and then get into the news here.

870
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I don't think Destiny is a failure by any means.

871
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
In fact, I don't think it's a bad game.

872
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think it's an above average game.

873
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
There's a lot of great things to really like about Destiny.

874
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But is the game perfect?

875
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Nope, and I just told you why.

876
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So, all right, let's get into some news.

877
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Loki, start us off tonight.

878
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
All right, so the big news this week was that,

879
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
well first off, it started off as a rumor that

880
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Mojang was going to be purchased by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.

881
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Now, apparently, it is going to be official.

882
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's expected to be announced on Monday.

883
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And, yeah, so they're going to be merged with Microsoft.

884
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And so what exactly does this mean?

885
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No idea yet, but the thought is that

886
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Microsoft is using this acquisition as sort of a way to help

887
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
boost its presence in the PC and console market.

888
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Which is kind of weird because PC-wise, I think they have

889
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
pretty much the lion's share of operating systems,

890
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but maybe it'll convince people to buy stuff on the Windows Store?

891
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't know.

892
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But they're saying that they're going to try to use this to boost

893
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the sales of Windows Phone and Surface tablets.

894
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I think even if Microsoft made Minecraft exclusively for Windows Phone,

895
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
no one would still buy a Windows Phone.

896
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So I'm not really sure what they're thinking there.

897
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Well, what the hell is Microsoft hoping to gain from something like this?

898
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Like, is Microsoft trying to just get the Minecraft IP?

899
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Is this what it boils down to?

900
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because my understanding is Notch isn't coming with the deal.

901
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So, I mean, are they getting access to Scrolls,

902
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the new thing that Mojang's supposed to be working on?

903
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Or is it just we want to have Minecraft 2 exclusive to our shit?

904
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Is that what this all boils down to?

905
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe that's what it's all going to boil down to.

906
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But, I mean, it's like, shit, there's like so many Minecraft clones out there.

907
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's like a dime a dozen.

908
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm sure, you know, where the platforms that this is not on,

909
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
a new, you know, clone will rise up and take its place.

910
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I mean, hell, there's all these people that are behind like Spoutcraft

911
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and shit like that that have made all these mods.

912
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's going to be very easy for them to come around and do like almost like

913
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
an in the groove, if you will, of Minecraft, you know,

914
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
where it's going to be something that's sort of Minecraft,

915
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
but not quite Minecraft.

916
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's really weird to me, too, that didn't Notch take issue with the fact

917
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
that Facebook bought, I mean, this has to be said,

918
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that Facebook bought the Oculus Rift for $2 billion.

919
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, $2 billion changes your mind quite quickly.

920
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
How did that song go?

921
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Sell out with me tonight.

922
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Sell out.

923
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Everything's going to be all right.

924
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Doo, doo, doo.

925
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
90s? Anybody? 90s?

926
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
All right. Anyway.

927
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
All right, look, I know there's some guys here that want to comment

928
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
on the Minecraft situation and talk about a lot of different things going on.

929
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Joining us now in studio, welcome back to the show, Diego.

930
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Hello.

931
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And Jonas.

932
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Hello.

933
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
From the TeaBaggers, or the Big Anime Game Room.

934
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You know I can't stop calling it the TeaBaggers, sorry.

935
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The Big Anime Game Room.

936
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
How's it going, you guys?

937
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Great. How are you doing?

938
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Good. How did SAC Anime go?

939
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You guys took your rig over to SAC Anime, right?

940
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, this is probably the busiest show we've ever done.

941
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Is it really?

942
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes, for SAC Anime.

943
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
What were some of the hits that you guys had out on the floor

944
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
that people were just like, oh, my God, we got to play this

945
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and keep playing this, can't get enough of it?

946
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Well, I'd say like the biggest hit is when we did the Mario Kart 8 tournament

947
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
on the re-structured pre-registration when we made it into our main events hall,

948
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
which turned out really spectacular.

949
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We filled up that entire room.

950
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It was amazing.

951
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
There were so many people there.

952
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We got a big hype up with a lot of the people.

953
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
People were having fun, a lot of cheers, a lot of good emotions and everything.

954
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Nice, nice.

955
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Well, this is probably the first chance a lot of people have

956
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
to kind of show off their skills in Mario Kart 8, too,

957
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
since the game hasn't been out that long.

958
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So, awesome.

959
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, look, I saw you guys, I suppose I saw Jonas was trying to put his hand up

960
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
while Loki was talking about Minecraft.

961
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So, what's your guys' take on this Minecraft possibly being sold to Microsoft tomorrow?

962
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
With the whole trend of people buying, kind of like what Facebook did with Oculus Rift,

963
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I think a lot of these companies, just by the way, it's my opinion,

964
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
a lot of these companies are just trying to buy the IP so no one else will take it.

965
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's kind of like what everyone was fighting with Twitch.

966
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Interesting.

967
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So, it's more about, even though they're not going to pull Minecraft from PlayStation 4, necessarily,

968
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
if Microsoft were to buy it, Sony's not going to get anything else from Minecraft.

969
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I don't know that's the case, but if you think about it,

970
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I can see where if you buy the Oculus Rift, you're kind of investing in the Oculus,

971
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and you know that that's going to bring revenue down the line

972
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
because this could be the future of entertainment, of gaming, of the internet, whatever.

973
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Same with Twitch. Obviously, a service like that is going to evolve into something.

974
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It could be very much like the next YouTube, whereas Minecraft, shit, that's a game.

975
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean, look at even the big games like Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds and stuff on mobile.

976
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It blows me away how much those companies get bolstered up by that one breakaway title too.

977
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Look at Zynga.

978
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah, it's all this stuff. I mean, they have their height, and then eventually the interest kind of fades away.

979
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I think, first off, discontinuing support for Bucket.

980
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I mean, yeah, they're going to continue developing internally, but it's not where it was before.

981
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That's got to hurt.

982
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And the fact that I'm sure it's going to continue on PC, but say the next Minecraft comes out and stuff,

983
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't think people are going to... Minecraft is a good game, but I don't know if it's a system seller.

984
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I mean, people are excited about it, but it's just... I'm not going to buy the...

985
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Isn't Minecraft on the 360 still continuously top 10 every month since the game was released?

986
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That's true, yeah. It is a top title because it's cheap, and it's good for kids.

987
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's a family-friendly title. It's cheap.

988
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
There's not really anything that will dissuade you from playing it, I guess. I don't know.

989
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't want my kids being around no creatures.

990
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I'm all for them, though, coming out with a new Minecraft tier that has enhanced visuals, but still has the voxel stuff on there.

991
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
They can already do enhanced visuals in Minecraft.

992
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I know on PC they can do it with mods, but I would love to see that as the standard.

993
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
They have to sell the mods they sell you, too. I bought the PlayStation 4 version,

994
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and it's even in there where you can play with these skins, but you can't save your world.

995
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They have the new block skins and stuff like that.

996
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think it also... I think iOS also has Minecraft if I crawl in Android, I think.

997
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Pocket edition, yeah.

998
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Yeah, because I see my nephews and nieces play it a lot on the mobile devices,

999
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
so I think that's probably what Microsoft's trying to prevent people from doing.

1000
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Take it away from iOS and Android users and put it straight to Windows Phone.

1001
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's my assumption.

1002
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Why would you take it out completely, though, of the iOS?

1003
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Well, they'll just come out with something.

1004
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
If Microsoft was going to be very territorial with it and just block sales of it,

1005
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't think it's going to sell a lot of Windows Phones.

1006
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
People don't buy a phone, especially a terrible phone like Windows Phone.

1007
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm sorry, my wife has one. It's fucking terrible.

1008
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
They're not going to buy a phone that's terrible like that just to play Minecraft Pocket Edition.

1009
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I mean, you're fucking insane if you buy a phone for an app.

1010
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's like saying, oh, Angry Birds is exclusive to this phone.

1011
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Not Angry Birds, Flappy Birds is exclusive to this phone.

1012
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Are you really going to fucking buy a phone for that?

1013
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Bull's Advocate, you could say that there's probably some people that bought an iPhone for Siri.

1014
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That's stupid.

1015
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
No, seriously, it's stupid.

1016
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I tried. All right.

1017
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Live.vognetwork.com says,

1018
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And we all know how that relationship turned out in the end.

1019
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Now Bungie is giving all the secret stuff to Sony.

1020
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Here's hoping they learn from that and just leave Mojang alone.

1021
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Well, they could just purchase Mojang and it could just be Mojang,

1022
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and they'll make money from anything that they produce.

1023
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Two billion.

1024
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Go ahead, Jonas.

1025
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
That is true. Just buy the whole Mojang if they're going to do something like that.

1026
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Two billion just seems like so much money.

1027
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I doubt that Scrolls is going to be as big as Minecraft was,

1028
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and I don't even know what else they have in the pipeline,

1029
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
because obviously a lot of that stuff Notch is working on.

1030
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I don't know. I just can't see this being a very smart purchase,

1031
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
especially for that kind of money, but whatever.

1032
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I guess they can license the shit out of it.

1033
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Maybe Windows 9 will have it as a default game.

1034
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It'll just come prepackaged with like...

1035
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's like the new Solitaire or Minesweeper.

1036
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Dude, that would be... You want to talk about firing a torpedo into productivity, man.

1037
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
There you go.

1038
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay, over to our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com.

1039
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The seg says,

1040
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Siri has a lot more day-to-day functions than any game.

1041
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I don't know, dude.

1042
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I've got to say this very tongue-in-cheek,

1043
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
but Minecraft is a way of life for some people.

1044
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
People have made millions off of Minecraft.

1045
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm talking all those freaking YouTube channels,

1046
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and people have careers out of Minecraft.

1047
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's crazy.

1048
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But I don't know.

1049
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It's just... Wow, it's so huge.

1050
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Which, again, I go, but $2 billion for Minecraft,

1051
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but then I remember, but yes,

1052
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
people are making all this money off Minecraft.

1053
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Maybe Microsoft just wants to issue YouTube takedown claims

1054
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and get the money off all those videos.

1055
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That's what this is.

1056
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That's what this is.

1057
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Microsoft wants all this because they don't have a network anymore,

1058
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
so Minecraft TV, 24-7 on the Xbox One.

1059
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I don't think they can do that because they've already had it

1060
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
in their end-user license agreement that they're allowing them to do that.

1061
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I don't know if you can go back on that.

1062
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Maybe you can.

1063
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't know. $2 billion, you can do a lot.

1064
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Alright, moving on.

1065
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That $2 billion will buy a lot.

1066
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It could buy more, well, except now Microsoft's spending it,

1067
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
so I guess they'll not be able to use that money to get more patches.

1068
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, why couldn't they have spent $2 billion on,

1069
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't know, making Windows 8 not suck?

1070
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You know what I mean?

1071
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Why couldn't they have spent money on that?

1072
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Or, I don't know, making Windows phone not suck.

1073
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Can you imagine what $2.5 billion could do for research

1074
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
in a non-shitty operating system for their phones?

1075
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I mean, that would be fantastic.

1076
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Alright, well, one thing Microsoft...

1077
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Or Kinect. Holy fuck.

1078
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
One thing Microsoft...

1079
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah, I know.

1080
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Think of all the Kinect games that could have been made for $2 billion.

1081
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh my god, what a good point.

1082
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Like, $2 billion could have bought, like, a lot.

1083
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Like, you could have bought Harmonix to pump more Kinect exclusives.

1084
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You could have bought, like, oh my god, anyway.

1085
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Moving on.

1086
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Some more system updates with some of that money.

1087
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
A new Xbox One system update coming out in October.

1088
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It will be a firmware update that will make some changes to the Snap feature on Xbox One.

1089
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Easier access to the Snap without having to back all the way out to the Home menu.

1090
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You will be able to use Snap after October to show friendless messages

1091
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
and achievement progress in real time.

1092
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Get ready, Trophy Whores.

1093
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Achievement... Excuse me, Achievement Whores.

1094
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Trophies is the other system.

1095
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Also, there will be a button command that will record the last 30 seconds of gameplay.

1096
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So, a share button?

1097
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So, it replaces you yelling at the Kinect to record that,

1098
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
because, as we know, not everybody has a Kinect anymore.

1099
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And they're not selling systems with Kinect, really.

1100
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I mean, one out of the four, five excuses they have.

1101
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
More codecs will be built into the console's media player,

1102
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and there will be support for a digital TV tuner that is coming out in Europe at the end of October.

1103
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So, that is all coming to the Xbox One this next month ahead of the holidays.

1104
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Dark Soccer.

1105
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, you know, we've been talking about Bucket, right? The Craft Bucket?

1106
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You mean Mr. Bucket?

1107
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Uh, Mr. Bucket?

1108
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Hello? The... spits out the thing?

1109
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Ugh.

1110
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yes!

1111
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I hear he's a bucket of fun.

1112
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes, he's a bucket of fun.

1113
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Anyway, the guy who did Craft Bucket, basically Wesley Wolf, has been swatted.

1114
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
For anyone who doesn't know what swatting is,

1115
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
it's basically when someone calls in some sort of fake police report

1116
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that would be enough to cause a swat team to come to the scene.

1117
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
In this case, someone called and said that he had shot and killed his parents

1118
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and were going to kill more people.

1119
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:08,000
In response to, basically, Wolf having done the DMCA takedown for Craft Bucket.

1120
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah, the whole thing we talked about last week, right?

1121
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Exactly.

1122
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So, somebody is trying to prove a point by sending the police over to this guy's house,

1123
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
by committing a criminal act, because in California, this is happening to celebrities all the time.

1124
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
This happened in Texas.

1125
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
No, but still.

1126
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But I'm saying it actually, in Texas it's probably even just as big, if not a bigger deal.

1127
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But on top of that, the police said that they set up a perimeter around this house

1128
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and used a PA system to get the attention of the family.

1129
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And then they talked to Wolf and his parents and confirmed everyone was safe and sound.

1130
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Basically, the call came through Skype on an untraceable line.

1131
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't understand, in the year 2014, when we've placed a robot on Mars.

1132
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
We have a robot on Mars, yet we have untraceable lines on Skype. I don't understand.

1133
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And the NSA can spy on everybody, but yet that one call that was made on Skype is fucking impossible.

1134
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Well, what they know right now is that, okay, they said that they're working a little bit deeper on it.

1135
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That they know that the call was based in California.

1136
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So they are tracing it, but they said that the call itself, and my apologies, was unidentified.

1137
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, I hope they find this fucker, because this is not the way to prove your point.

1138
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I don't understand extremists when it comes to certain opinions in the gaming community.

1139
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
People go to these huge extremes, from swatting people to sending tweets that, you know,

1140
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm gonna kick your ass and rip off your head and shove my dick down your throat and all this stuff.

1141
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They learned it from Duke Nukem!

1142
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
All these hideous things people say on Twitter to try and prove a point.

1143
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What kind of point are you making with that? You are an asshole! That's the point you're making.

1144
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Anyway, sorry Diego, I just got on a rant.

1145
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
When she was talking about the whole swat thing, I think I was reading an article that popped up on Facebook,

1146
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
because someone had shared that about one person that was caught doing that,

1147
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and in the process of that they were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

1148
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I was reading up on that, that this one child was pretty much crying his eyes out,

1149
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and my friend who had posted up the feed was like, well, that's what you get, you so-and-so, so-and-so.

1150
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And I'm like, wow, and I read the article, I was shocked, and the kid pretty much on the pictures itself,

1151
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
he was just crying his eyes out, and I said, exactly, you shouldn't be doing that stuff.

1152
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Like, they actually caught someone in the act in that.

1153
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well, and then I'm thinking, as you're saying that, I'm also thinking of when,

1154
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
this just happened a couple weeks ago, was there was that guy, and he was the executive of some company,

1155
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
somebody in chat's got to fill in, but he was on that flight that was going from Texas or whatever,

1156
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and somebody tweeted a bomb threat at the airline, and they put his, they grounded his plane,

1157
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
and it was, I think this all had to do with that Gamergate fuckery, where they, I think, they grounded his-

1158
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I thought it was a Sony exec.

1159
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I think it was, but, you know, I think he made a comment that somebody didn't like,

1160
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
so they tweeted a bomb threat to the airline, and his plane got grounded, all the bags were searched,

1161
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and it's like, dude, in trying to prove your point, you have committed a federal offense.

1162
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
There are some things you don't do in a post-9-11 world.

1163
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Tweeting a bomb threat to an airline is one of them, you idiot. What point are you making with that?

1164
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The point is, you're an asshole. That's the only point that's coming out of that. Come on.

1165
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Debate is one thing. Discussion is another thing. Bomb threats, you're an asshole.

1166
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Exactly, like, I'm still kind of laughing at that right now, but exactly, it's as idiotic as that sounds as well.

1167
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You say it like this when you go towards the circumstances of talking about certain things, such as things like,

1168
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
you lied to the government, that's a felony, but if the government lies to you, that's politics.

1169
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That's a whole nother Oprah, as we say.

1170
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Do you want to hear Matt say that article that might have been fake?

1171
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But the thing is that they're going to give a kid, even just using this example, 25 to life,

1172
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
but yet they let rapists go after five years. I don't know.

1173
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, that is true. The judicial law is just corrupted as it is. Like we said, even though justice is blind, they just let people walk every day.

1174
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Justice is fueled by economy.

1175
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Not everybody's going to agree with me on this, and that's fine, we'll just have to have a political debate,

1176
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
but whoever called in this swatting thing, you know what they need to do?

1177
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:58,000
This is how MSNBC is going to get their ratings, because what they're going to do is they're going to turn MSNBC into a channel

1178
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
where they're going to take this kid who called in the threat, and they're going to walk him out,

1179
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and they're going to pull his pants down on TV, and they're going to spank him.

1180
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
They're going to spank him in front of the entire nation.

1181
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It was a hoax, by the way, a fake.

1182
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
What, the whole swatting thing on this guy?

1183
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The one that they caught.

1184
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Okay, well, whoever swatted this guy, you know who needs to do it? Supernanny.

1185
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
They should send him to Singapore.

1186
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
No, Supernanny's going to pull down his pants and say, you've been a very naughty boy.

1187
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You need to sit on the naughty step and think about what you've done. And that's it.

1188
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But you have to understand that she only puts them in timeouts. Spanking is not really something that they approve.

1189
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Well, then get somebody else.

1190
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That's why I said send him to Singapore.

1191
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Get Jamie. Jamie will spank him.

1192
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's why he has to sit on the noise.

1193
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
As long as Jamie has some hand sanitizer, she'll do it.

1194
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,000
No, that's okay, because not using hand sanitizer and anti-bacterials makes your immune system stronger.

1195
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Alright, anyway.

1196
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You don't need to use that shit unless you're a doctor.

1197
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Bochi Kawa says, fuck yeah, more spanking for children. Some of these kids need to learn.

1198
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This person's probably 23. I'm not talking about spanking children. If you act like a child, though, then you should be spanked.

1199
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
This 23-year-old or whoever did this.

1200
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And now I'm just making up who called this in.

1201
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I cannot believe that when we, again, can travel to space, when we have all this technology in the palm of our hand, we can't trace a fucking phone call.

1202
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Well, it is Microsoft. They could have used that $2.5 billion to invest in their Skype system to be able to trace that fucking call.

1203
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I just had a brilliant thought. You know what should be done for people who break certain laws?

1204
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
They need to have it tattooed on their face.

1205
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
No, no, no. Have it permanently marked on their bodies for the rest of their lives.

1206
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Didn't they write a book like that hundreds of years ago called The Scarlet Letter?

1207
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
No, that was sewn onto her shirt.

1208
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And that was because she was practicing the free rights that men had at the time.

1209
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Look, we started here. Now we're over here. Let's get back to the other video game news.

1210
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
All right. Loki, bring us back here with something else.

1211
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
All right. So, unfortunately, on Twitch, it's become a kind of a new haven for phishing scams.

1212
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It kind of goes to show you, don't click on links that you don't know what they fucking are.

1213
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Don't just click random links that appear in chat.

1214
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Apparently, they're saying that there's some sort of Counter Strike Go prize type links that are appearing.

1215
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And it pops up that, oh, you've won the weapon or something in the game.

1216
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And you have to log in to your Steam account to redeem it or something.

1217
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And so, when you log in, of course, it steals all your account information then goes through your stuff.

1218
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
If you happen to be a Counter Strike Go player and sells all your weapons and shit that you got for money.

1219
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
They steal that somehow.

1220
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
That's actually pretty fucking clever, which kind of sucks.

1221
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Don't hear me wrong here. These guys are assholes for stealing all this stuff that isn't theirs.

1222
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
But it just goes to show you, they'll go to pretty great lengths to do it.

1223
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And with Twitch becoming more and more mainstream as it is, they're going to come for you on there.

1224
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh my gosh. So be careful. Don't put your username and password in places where...

1225
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Always check the URL to make sure you're actually on Steam's website and all that.

1226
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Very important.

1227
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Or better off, just research all this stuff that goes on.

1228
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'll tell everything later about fixing so many computers because people accidentally clicked one thing and now they get all this crap happening on their computer.

1229
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Pornography? On my computer?

1230
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's more real than you think.

1231
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Anyhow, let's move on to something happy.

1232
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You know what, Jamie? I know you were a fan of this series, at least until the third game.

1233
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
But I know you liked at least the second one.

1234
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But I'm talking about Fable. Remember that series? Fable? You guys like that?

1235
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It started on the original Xbox, made its way to 360.

1236
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Fable 2 was the one you really got into, right?

1237
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
For about five minutes. Dan was really into the Fable series.

1238
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Well maybe this is something that might bring you back to it.

1239
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
The PC version of Fable Anniversary will be coming out shortly.

1240
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And it's going to have modding support, according to Lionhead.

1241
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Producer Craig Oman, in speaking to Eurogamer, mentioned that Fable Anniversary on PC will have a version of the Unreal Engine 3 editor, which will let you edit all of the existing art and animation in the game.

1242
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So, two weeks Telenude patch? Three weeks? Two weeks?

1243
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That means that, if I am right, they're going to be able to use some of the same modding tools that Mass Effect 2 and 3 use.

1244
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Perhaps. Perhaps. In fact, you know what's funny is they're actually talking about one of the statements that Craig Oman said.

1245
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Quote, personally, I just hope someone creates a sci-fi version of Fable.

1246
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So, you could get, like, your Garrus Cross Fable. I don't know.

1247
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I need that now.

1248
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
See? I knew you'd be interested in this eventually.

1249
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Only if somebody does that. And then I can have my Taurean dating sim.

1250
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
This is the internet, Jamie. Anything can happen.

1251
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
That'd be wonderful, though, just to have the whole sci-fi twist on it.

1252
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It already had a feel of having a Star Wars feel to it, of shooting lightning and thunder from your hands and doing other things and pushing people away. It felt like force powers as well.

1253
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It would be way more interesting than that Kinect Fable game, that's for sure.

1254
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It'd be way more interesting than any of the Fable games since 2, so I'm all down for that.

1255
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Fable Effect?

1256
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Possibly. That'd be great.

1257
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Let's see.

1258
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Going into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Kaijuto says, Fable 2 is the only Fable game you need.

1259
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It definitely was the peak of the series, that's for sure.

1260
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So, the game actually just came out in Europe, at least, on September 12th.

1261
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I don't know if that matches over here, because, again, I'm seeing this on Eurogamer, but I'm sure it's out very, very soon if it's not out already.

1262
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Also, in the game, there's a new heroic mode, if you are so inclined to play this super advanced mode, where there will be an increased line of sight for enemies and reduced damage on ranged weapons and reduced player armor levels.

1263
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So, you know, everything gets hard.

1264
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Very cool. So, for those of you that want to revisit the Fable and get all these patches, that'll be really neat.

1265
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Darsakura, one more story here before we get to the release dates.

1266
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Well, this is yet another reason to love Sega.

1267
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Sega is finally putting the crack down on assholes.

1268
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:15,000
They have a new policy for the Sega blogs, Sega forums, and any of their social media accounts that basically they're going to be knocking down anyone who posts derogatory and hateful comments, personal attacks on any real person.

1269
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So Sega's going to be having the message deleted, and their right to post future comments permanently pooped on, as in not exist.

1270
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
That's right. If you're going to make any hateful messages, it's better to read it to Sonic.

1271
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And his fucking weird ass long legs.

1272
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So you can still make all the fun you want of Sonic's friends. You just can't make fun of real people.

1273
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But if I want to say, you know, Tails sucks, I can do that.

1274
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Dude, seriously.

1275
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
What?

1276
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
They made Sonic have more fucking friends in the next game.

1277
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's like, hey, what does everyone hate? They hate his friends. Let's give them more friends.

1278
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's like, you fucking stupid.

1279
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And Sega just banned you.

1280
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And at any rate, what they've actually said is, therefore we're putting a new policy in place across all of Sega's community and social channels.

1281
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
If you make a personal attack or otherwise inappropriate comment, we will delete your comment and we will ban or block you from our page slash channel.

1282
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And they said that while their fans may not always agree with the company or each other, that's not an excuse to not show mutual respect on a human level.

1283
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Which also takes me, though, to something that we were seeing.

1284
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:37,000
A mini discussion that I was having with SSJ100 man in the chat room about removing anonymity from people to basically make them own up to how they treat other people.

1285
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That goes back and forth there. Removing anonymity can also damage people who need to use that anonymity to protect aspects of their personal life.

1286
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Exactly. See, then I think about when Battle.net was going to do the real ID thing.

1287
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And I was super against that because I was so not okay with my real name being out there.

1288
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And, you know, without getting too tangenty, we have this whole thing going on right now where Facebook is forcing all these people who are not using their real names.

1289
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And the most vocal right now of which is the drag queens of the world, that's where I'm seeing it happen a lot, is that they're all being forced to use their real names.

1290
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Which could put them in physical danger.

1291
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Right. Roller derby girls who use fake names. And I use a fake name and I've never made a secret about that.

1292
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
That's because I like to keep my professional life and what I do with everything online and all that separate.

1293
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And I realize some people are probably going to figure out my real name and whatever, whatever, and vice versa.

1294
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
But it's still that whole thing where it's like, respect the fact that I want to have these two separate personas.

1295
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Well, I put my real name out there because, you know, for a while I was really focusing on my design work.

1296
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But the stuff that I put there about my personal life, everything in my personal life pretty much except for Orange Lounge has a pseudonym or something that I've made up about it.

1297
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So no one knows where I work unless they happen to work with me or I've told them.

1298
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Or, you know, people don't really know where I live unless they know me and have been to my house or have sent me something.

1299
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And I'm fine. I'm fine now that battle net requires me to have a battle tag and everything can be traced back to that battle tag no matter what game I'm in.

1300
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And, you know, my account would be at risk if I was a total, you know, douche nozzle to somebody.

1301
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Then that, you know, and that's OK. I'd be accountable in that regard.

1302
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But, you know, again, when you go all the way to your full name, I don't think I'll say I think that there does need to be a different way to have accountability.

1303
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Like, it's really hard to have a happy medium between something that's either real or it's fake.

1304
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:52,000
In that case, I think I do rather like what they have on Tumblr where you can block an anonymous commenter completely.

1305
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You won't see who that anonymous person is, so it will, quote, protect them.

1306
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But you can still block them. And sometimes trial and error, you can find out who they are.

1307
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I do think one idea Sega should have experimented with, though, is instead of like silencing these bullies completely,

1308
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:14,000
they could have taken the Disney approach where, you know, the bullies would have to select and communicate only with a preselected list of phrases.

1309
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
In this case, I think they should only be able to post quotes from Shenmue.

1310
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That would be all these people would be able to use in the future.

1311
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So it's like, you know, you want to comment on something? Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

1312
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's all they could do. All they could do.

1313
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:36,000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some games that are gonna, no doubt, cause some people to say some very naughty things on the internet somewhere. Loki.

1314
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Well, I hope not, because Cookie Mama 5, bon appetit, is coming out on 3DS.

1315
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah, Cookie Mama, she's a bitch.

1316
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Thetrithym, Final Fantasy Curtain Call, coming out on 3DS as well.

1317
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Psh, Final Fantasy sucks.

1318
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Fairy Fencer F for PlayStation 3.

1319
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Fairy Fencer.

1320
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1321
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Naruto's not a real ninja.

1322
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And finally, Air Conflicts Vietnam, they're doing a port of it for PlayStation 4. And that's it.

1323
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:19,000
All right, let's go back, let's go over to Japan at some point and get the releases. I guess I'm flying over there right now, it's very slow.

1324
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Checking out the releases in Japan this week. Nothing really on the newer consoles, the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One.

1325
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:35,000
On the PlayStation 3, there's nothing this week either. It's a pretty slow week over there in Japan. Nothing on the Xbox 360 either.

1326
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:42,000
How about the handhelds? This is because Smash Brothers just came out, I bet. Cause Smash Brothers just came out this week on the 3DS.

1327
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Where's my Smash Code?

1328
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
We already talked about that earlier in the show.

1329
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Did you guys get your Smash Codes and all that stuff?

1330
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
No, I didn't get it, but everyone's been talking about it.

1331
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
If you reach behind you, there's a gold 3DS if you want to check out the demo. If you want.

1332
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
All right, and let's see...

1333
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I think I'll wait, cause I already played it in E3, so...

1334
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Yeah, I can understand that too.

1335
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
On the Wii U, oh here's one release this week I'm finding. This is a pretty big one. This is a very Nintendo week.

1336
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Bayonetta 2 on September 20th in Japan. I know a lot of people looking forward to that, so there's something.

1337
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Boing boing.

1338
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And on the Vita, there's a couple games on the Vita this week.

1339
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Gundam Breaker and Fate Stay Night are both getting price reductions.

1340
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So they're not new games, but you can get them at an all new low price in the best collection.

1341
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So there you go, Bayonetta or nuttin'.

1342
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
All right, let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1343
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I would move on to the UK if the UK list would load. I think we're all in the middle of our transportation.

1344
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So on the 16th we have Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. I'm getting super tired of all things Naruto.

1345
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:59,000
On the 17th we have Anomaly 2, the 18th Endless Legend for PC and Train Simulator 2015.

1346
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
On the 19th, Damn Near Everything Else comes out.

1347
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Flockers for PC, PS4, Xbox One, Hyrule Warriors for Wii U.

1348
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Natural Doctrine on PlayStation 3, Vita, and PS4.

1349
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Theater of the Final Fantasy, Curtain Call and 3DS.

1350
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And Wasteland 2 for Mac and PC.

1351
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Dance Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BABY.

1352
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.

1353
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So apparently there is a brand new patent for some device from the Pokemon company.

1354
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And honestly it looks just like they're having some sort of near field communication thing with Pokemon figures.

1355
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I was really worried for a minute there it was going to be a Fleshlight add-on for Pokemon figurines.

1356
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So I was getting a little nervous there, but woo!

1357
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
There's still time.

1358
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
That won't stop some people from trying.

1359
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Apparently the device would be an information processing apparatus. Well that's very vague of you.

1360
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Basically able to read NFC and RFID chips like those front end Amiibo figures.

1361
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So yes, you can imagine that I'm guessing this is going to lead to some sort of thing where they sell every single Pokemon character as a figurine for Amiibo.

1362
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen.

1363
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And you know what? You gotta catch them all.

1364
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Because that's the only way.

1365
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Like some people in venereal diseases.

1366
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It's the only way you're gonna get like super shinies or some shit they're gonna come up with where, you know.

1367
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And then they're gonna start selling like real life burn heals for your wallet is the next logical step for this thing.

1368
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It burns.

1369
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
That joke burns too.

1370
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Alright, moving on.

1371
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Talking about Pikmin, another Nintendo product.

1372
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Pikmin is gonna get a movie of sorts. Of sorts.

1373
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah, this is a report from Variety.

1374
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Pikmin Short Movies.

1375
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's animated shorts that are produced by Shigeru Miyamoto.

1376
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
They're gonna be debuting at the Tokyo International Film Festival.

1377
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And this is gonna be at the end of October.

1378
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And so Miyamoto will be having a presentation where there's gonna be these Pikmin Short Movies and there'll be three animated shorts.

1379
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
One is called The Night Juicer.

1380
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Where Captain Olimar wants to blend up Pikmin.

1381
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
What is this? A fucking horror movie?

1382
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
The name of that again? Can you say the name of that one?

1383
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Keep in mind this is October 25th to the 31st.

1384
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
The Night Juicer.

1385
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You know what? I'm sorry.

1386
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Isn't that the attachment for the Pokemon?

1387
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The Night Juicer.

1388
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
The Night Juicer, all that reminds me of is the fruit fucker from the Penny Arcade comic.

1389
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I see that now.

1390
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
The fruit fucker movie. The Night Juicer.

1391
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That sounds pretty splashing.

1392
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Night juicer. Night juicer.

1393
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Night juicer.

1394
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Let's see, also Pikmin Short Movies.

1395
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Olimar blending up Pikmin? That's gross.

1396
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Whoa.

1397
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
That's the concept. Night juicer. He's gonna blend up the Pikmin.

1398
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Listen, you guys are really fucking annoying me now.

1399
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So I'm gonna juice you.

1400
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I can see where this is all leading to. The juicing to the blending.

1401
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It's all making sense now.

1402
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
They're onto something.

1403
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Will it blend?

1404
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I can't wait for the third episode where he rolls them up into a joint and smokes them.

1405
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Is that why there's no green Pikmin?

1406
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Alright, anyway.

1407
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Treasures in a Bottle, which will involve an odd treasure. That's all they say.

1408
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It's treasure in a bottle.

1409
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Surprise, it's fucking nothing.

1410
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And Occupational Hazards is the third one, which plays out at a construction site.

1411
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Sounds like a fucking...

1412
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It's like Happy Tree Friends.

1413
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Doesn't it?

1414
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's Happy Tree Friends.

1415
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Or like Wile E. Coyote in Roadrunner.

1416
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
No, it's Happy Tree Friends.

1417
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It looks like the future of Pikmin will now be blended together into one.

1418
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I guess.

1419
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Or it's becoming a horror franchise.

1420
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The one drink to rule them all.

1421
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You would say that at the exact moment Loki knocks a soda on the floor.

1422
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's empty.

1423
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Speaking of a horror film, apparently Diego has the powers of persuasion.

1424
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Let's go back to a time when things were a little simpler.

1425
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You know, we didn't try to stick our video game characters in a blender.

1426
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That was something reserved for like goldfish.

1427
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1428
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
PETA, don't harass me.

1429
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
What kind of sick person are you, Rob?

1430
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
That you would think of that.

1431
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I never wanted to do that.

1432
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I knew some fucked up kids growing up.

1433
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Didn't we all know some fucked up kids growing up?

1434
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I would just chant at my brother's fish until they died.

1435
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Because I hated them.

1436
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Oh, so I'm weird trying to get out blenders.

1437
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yet you would perform a satanic ritual on your boy.

1438
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
No, no, no. You would murder them.

1439
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I would just wish them to die.

1440
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You would curse them in eternal damnation.

1441
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But I didn't murder them.

1442
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
You fish murderer.

1443
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But then, you know, the quick murdering or the, you know,

1444
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
very methodical ritual that you had.

1445
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It wasn't a ritual. I'd just be like, God, I hate you fish.

1446
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Why are we talking about murder? The happy music is playing.

1447
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm going to feed you to the cat.

1448
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Time for the classic game of the week,

1449
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault

1450
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
and find, you know, next to her, you know, guns

1451
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
and various tools of mass destruction.

1452
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Just for that, I'm going to put up puzzle and dragons

1453
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and then a week.

1454
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, you're such a...

1455
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So mean to me. All right.

1456
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Here it is, your classic game of the week.

1457
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I gave you candy corn.

1458
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That's true. You did give me.

1459
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And it was apple pie and I ate them.

1460
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Just my fat.

1461
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
All right.

1462
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1463
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
The classic game of the week is, again, sticking with the CPS-2 theme.

1464
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I went for Armored Warriors, which in Japan it was called

1465
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Powered Gear Strategic Variant Armor Equipment.

1466
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It came out in 1994.

1467
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It was a beat-em-up.

1468
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Like I said, it was CPS CP System 2.

1469
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And there's no home version of this ever.

1470
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
However, the mecha in the game were later used

1471
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
for Cyberbots Fill Metal Madness.

1472
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Which, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game,

1473
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
according to Devilot and Puzzle Fighter.

1474
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Anyway, Armored Warriors was basically

1475
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
as a multiplayer beat-em-up.

1476
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
You go around in robots and you basically beat up other robots.

1477
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Robots!

1478
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And then you can use different type of input commands

1479
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
with the joystick and you get team-up change,

1480
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
which lets you do tandem attacks with whoever you're playing with.

1481
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So basically, it's just a big robot war

1482
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and you are trying to get to the end

1483
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and beat the perfect warrior cyborg robot.

1484
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And Blodia's in it.

1485
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That just makes me happy because Blodia was awesome.

1486
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, Janna?

1487
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yep.

1488
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So the characters that you play as,

1489
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you have First Lieutenant Jeff Perkins, who pilots Blodia.

1490
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
You have Captain Ray Turner, who is the pilot of Reptos.

1491
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You have Glenn Reed, who pilots Golden.

1492
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And Sarah White, who has Forty.

1493
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So basically, I mean, really, there's not a lot of special to it,

1494
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
but the notable thing about this game is that this is what led to us having Cyberbots.

1495
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Which, Cyberbots is fucking awesome.

1496
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So, thank you, Capcom for Armored Warriors, which gave us Cyberbots.

1497
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
That's it.

1498
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It has no home release.

1499
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
No home release.

1500
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
So, really, the only way you're going to play this is...

1501
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Get yourself a super gun.

1502
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
That's right.

1503
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You're going to have to go to an arcade that might still have this game somewhere.

1504
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Armored Warriors.

1505
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Or, you know, they do make a CPS2 emulator.

1506
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I would never endorse using emulators and downloading the ROM illegally, but...

1507
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
For an outdated system that has no...

1508
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Yeah, get a super gun.

1509
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
All right.

1510
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Armored Warriors.

1511
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

1512
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1513
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
In part B, we're going to talk to our friends from the big anime game room a little more

1514
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and talk about what's coming up next for them

1515
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and what their plans for the future might be.

1516
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And then we're going to get into some rapid-fire news.

1517
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
The Fugu Question of the Week, your emails, and plenty more

1518
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1519
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this September the 14th, 2014

1520
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
with the 567th episode of our show already in progress.

1521
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And you know what's very important and very special about this day

1522
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
as was brought to my attention via Facebook.

1523
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
September 14th, 1985, was the debut of the Golden Girls on television.

1524
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So, a very important day in television history.

1525
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
My God, that was all...

1526
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Thank you for being a friend.

1527
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That was 29 years ago. 29 years ago.

1528
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
No wonder they are all almost dead.

1529
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I mean, what's...

1530
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And woe to the poor children who were not alive when there were Golden Girls.

1531
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Yes, I know, I know.

1532
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Praise be to Betty White and she can't die ever, ever, ever, ever.

1533
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
All right, let's see.

1534
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Moving on, before we get into some rapid-fire news,

1535
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
let's talk to our friends Jonas and Diego a little more from the big anime game room.

1536
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
What's next on you guys' agenda?

1537
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
What big cons are coming up in the future?

1538
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
What's your next big show?

1539
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Well, the bigger one that's coming up next is our one that's coming up in...

1540
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Oh, it's semi-big, but it's big enough.

1541
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It's the one coming up in Reno, Nevada.

1542
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's known as a snafu that's abbreviated as Sierra Nevada Anime Fans United.

1543
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I've never heard of that one, but Reno's a fun town.

1544
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Where do they have that up there?

1545
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
They have it at the Grand Sierra Hotel.

1546
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Oh, okay. So they do use some of the hotel space up there.

1547
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
That's the one that used to be the Hilton years ago, right?

1548
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I believe so.

1549
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I think it was.

1550
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I believe so, yeah.

1551
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It's a beautiful place.

1552
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I think it's been going on for about four years now.

1553
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Nice.

1554
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Three to four years now.

1555
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
What weekend is that?

1556
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I might have to go up there and check it out.

1557
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
That's the second to last weekend of October.

1558
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I think that's 25th, 26th, and 27th.

1559
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Actually 24, 25, 26.

1560
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's Friday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1561
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Maybe tied down with rehearsals for a performance I got going on.

1562
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
But that still sounds like it'll be a lot of fun.

1563
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Yeah, definitely.

1564
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Well, I won't say most of our group, but some of our group will be there since some can't really attend.

1565
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But we'll pretty much bring our armory with us of games.

1566
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
And united with our Nevada friends and people who also staff our other cons.

1567
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Because some of them put their effort into staffing and are part-chair to this as well.

1568
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Because some of them helped start this convention at Reno.

1569
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Nice.

1570
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That's always kind of neat.

1571
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Have you guys kind of been at the ground level of a convention like that and really kind of seen it grow over the years?

1572
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Well, I guess GamerX, we talked about last time you guys were here.

1573
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It might be an example.

1574
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Are there a lot of cons you guys are kind of following since the first year that have really grown?

1575
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah, Snapagon we saw grow from the ground up.

1576
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah, Snapagon?

1577
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
There's one called KrakenCon, which I got invited to, but I'm not sure if I'm able to go.

1578
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But I'll keep in tabs for it.

1579
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I think KrakenCon is in Oakland.

1580
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I believe it's the first or second week of October.

1581
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Wow, all these cons I've never even heard of. That's awesome though.

1582
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I know YaweCon is this weekend, but we aren't able to make it.

1583
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Oh, you guys aren't doing YaweCon?

1584
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We're not doing YaweCon because one, it's under new ownership.

1585
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
YaweCon in 2011 got purchased by a manga company.

1586
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I didn't know that.

1587
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And then whatever direction they have, if they want game room, that's fine.

1588
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
If not, then unfortunately they haven't made the decision to put a game room in there at the moment.

1589
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
You know, I've never been to YaweCon, but I have heard that what happens at YaweCon stays at YaweCon.

1590
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I have heard that much.

1591
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
It is quite an experience.

1592
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,000
When it was under the original ownership back in the day, when it was in San Mateo and around the Bay Area, around San Francisco-ish?

1593
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
San Mateo and San Francisco is the only one.

1594
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
San Mateo and San Francisco. And when we first got in there, yeah, it was quite an experience, definitely.

1595
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And I was like, they have a game room?

1596
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I said, oh, game room. I get it.

1597
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But it was actually quite amazing. Really nice people there. Nothing practically went wrong.

1598
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It was good vibes over there, definitely.

1599
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Good. Awesome.

1600
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Last week we spent a little bit of time celebrating the 15th anniversary of the US launch of the Dreamcast.

1601
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And since you guys do a lot with classic games, I know you got something to say about the Dreamcast.

1602
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
What are some Dreamcast memories that you see living on today in the game room?

1603
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
What are some Dreamcast things that still live on today in the game room?

1604
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
A favorite would be definitely Power Stone. Power Stone 2, to be exact.

1605
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Oh my gosh, you have the Dreamcast boot-up noise on your phone.

1606
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah, it's what I do for my email.

1607
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That's awesome.

1608
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Towards that, what else did we have?

1609
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Choo-Choo Rocket.

1610
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Choo-Choo Rocket. Very underrated Sonic Team game, oh my lord.

1611
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
When I first played that, that thing is on steroids, but it's fun steroids.

1612
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Not in that sense, but in the sense of gaming, that is.

1613
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
It's so ridiculously fun that all you have to do is just fill up your rockets full of mice,

1614
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and there's so many things that change the game around and flip you around.

1615
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's so chaotic, but it's chaotic fun.

1616
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Choo-Choo Rocket, I want to say they released that for iPad and all that stuff, too.

1617
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So at least there's a way to experience it if you don't have a Dreamcast to hook up.

1618
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah, definitely.

1619
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Other things such as, I remember, Cannon Spike.

1620
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Cannon Spike was pretty popular for a while, definitely.

1621
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
When I first found out about that game, I was like, wow, there's Kami in here and Mega Man,

1622
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,000
and it's pretty much a bird's eye view shooter game that goes around,

1623
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and then just constantly shooting and going through the entire level.

1624
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
It's actually quite amazing.

1625
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Any other ones?

1626
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Let's see.

1627
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Good ones.

1628
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
The original Soul Calibur for the Dreamcast.

1629
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
That was a big one at the time.

1630
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Sonic Adventure 2, because the newer generation like Sonic Adventure,

1631
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
for those who did not grow up on the 2D Sonics.

1632
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2, because people still prefer that as the console to play Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

1633
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I bet.

1634
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Because I believe people are saying that if you play it on any other console, there's lag.

1635
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

1636
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Not to mention, of course, the Dreamcast is based off the NAOMI board,

1637
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
which Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the arcade was based off of.

1638
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Right.

1639
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Also, the game Jet Set Radio.

1640
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah, that was another favorite right there.

1641
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:51,000
You know what? Okay, if you guys have a Planet Harriers, I would be at every event ever.

1642
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Well, they'll have to find one.

1643
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Planet Harriers never had a home release.

1644
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
It's almost impossible to emulate.

1645
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Wow.

1646
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
So, I mean, you can emulate it, people have.

1647
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I couldn't get it working.

1648
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Planet Harriers.

1649
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Planet Harriers.

1650
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1651
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It sounds like Diego is not the only one who has made the Dreamcast boot-up noise a way of life.

1652
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
ActDef says, I used to have the Dreamcast starting sound on my phone, too.

1653
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And let's see. Fifth Dream says, I made my Windows PC boot-up sound.

1654
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
The Dreamcast boot-up sound.

1655
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Definitely. I mean, it was thinking and it.

1656
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Well, I want to say it's still thinking now because people still use the.

1657
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
We bring that back in our game room at least.

1658
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Yeah.

1659
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Yeah, we still have those things.

1660
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And Dreamcast, I want to say it was a great system.

1661
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Obviously, I wasn't there to pay for the full price and I kind of feel sorry for those who stood in line.

1662
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I had a roommate who stood in line at Florin Mall here in Sacramento to actually do that.

1663
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Which is now a Walmart.

1664
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Which is now a Walmart, yes.

1665
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
They still have the Sears, though. The original Sears.

1666
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh, I didn't realize.

1667
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It still stands. Every brick.

1668
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Oh, wow.

1669
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
That was. I think the Florin Mall was the first place I ever played Pump It Up.

1670
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And that was probably the last time you ever caught me at Florin Mall.

1671
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Right at the Tilt, right?

1672
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah.

1673
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Oh, my goodness, the Tilt.

1674
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
All right, the Tilt.

1675
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Local drama here in Sacramento, California, where our lovely show is based.

1676
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Skies of Arcadia. I almost forgot about that.

1677
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, good memories. Good memories.

1678
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's great to see that through these game rooms that you guys do, you can still celebrate all those classic games.

1679
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And I'm sure until the end of time, there will always be a Dreamcast so somebody can play MVC, too.

1680
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Actually, we still do it because our most common game in a game with a Dreamcast is actually Typing of the Dead.

1681
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Of course. Oh, my God.

1682
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Yeah, that game is amazing.

1683
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Yeah, I was excited when they brought back. They put a version of it on PC not that long ago where they have a newer version of Typing of the Dead.

1684
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know what's more amazing, watching the actual footage.

1685
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Just watching people have their faces change as they type the words out almost fiercely or something.

1686
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
They really get into the game as they type those words out.

1687
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Well, then sometimes the words get really awkward.

1688
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And so then your face is kind of like, what?

1689
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Right. And as their hands are moving as well, they're like, oh, my goodness, I can't believe this is happening.

1690
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I can't believe I'm typing these naughty things.

1691
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
What is this game forcing me to do?

1692
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:19,000
All right. Well, look, we could reminisce about the Dreamcast all night long, but we're going to get into some rapid-fire news and talk about quickly what else is going on in the gaming world.

1693
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And you guys, please feel free to pipe up if there's anything you want to comment on as we move on throughout the rest of the show.

1694
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So let's start off with some rapid-fire news. Loki.

1695
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So this is kind of strange. They're kind of going the route of, what is it, the Disney Infinity with Little Big Planet.

1696
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:43,000
They're re-releasing the Vita version of Little Big Planet, but they're dubbing it the Little Big Planet PlayStation Vita Marvel Superhero Edition.

1697
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Because the version of Little Big Planet that they're releasing is going to also include all the content of the original release as well as a host of Marvel Comics characters and skins and that kind of stuff.

1698
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:06,000
So yeah. So that's kind of cool. And that's going to be coming out on, looks like around November 18th, November 19th.

1699
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Is that the same time that Little Big Planet 3 comes out in PlayStation 4?

1700
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Little Big Planet 3 is actually coming out in two weeks.

1701
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Oh, wow.

1702
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I'm sorry. No, not Little Big Planet 3. I'm sorry. Little Big Planet 3, yeah, actually that is around the exact same time.

1703
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:28,000
So that'll be right, probably the same date actually. That'll be coming out. No, I'm sorry. I was thinking Disney Infinity for some reason. Disney Infinity is in two weeks.

1704
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Gotcha.

1705
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But yeah. This is kind of cool. The next Final Fantasy spinoff they're saying is going to be a text input battle RPG.

1706
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So, typing of the Final Fantasy, I guess. It's Final Fantasy Worldwide Words.

1707
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter. H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter.

1708
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,000
No, no, no, no. That was Ragnarok Online or Port Pront.

1709
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh, sorry. C-U-R-E space P-L-Z, enter.

1710
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Port G-H. Port G-H.

1711
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah, so apparently in order to defeat enemies in the game, you know, you can cast spells and stuff like that, but it requires you to type in words.

1712
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Could two things I love be blended together any better? Like Final Fantasy and typing of the dead? That sounds amazing.

1713
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
It will be out on the Japanese Android, I guess.

1714
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Android? I don't want to type on a phone.

1715
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
September 16th. An iOS version is supposed to be released soon.

1716
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
What if the bonus rounds, though, force people to type with proper grammar?

1717
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I think I would need new underwear.

1718
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
For the final boss, you must properly use your, your, and your.

1719
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Or their, their, and their.

1720
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:47,000
And last but not least, the date has finally been confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 4 on, uh, or 4 or 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1721
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,000
November 18th in North America, and then the PC version is coming out on the 27th of January.

1722
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Um, they were talking about some of the new additions to the game.

1723
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Of course, new weapons, vehicles, activities, more wildlife. They even have like an orca whale in there.

1724
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And cats. Cats are in there.

1725
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Which, by the way, when Loki and I were tweeting each other this week, I think the cat thing might have sold me on this.

1726
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Just, just, just to be clear.

1727
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So, um, yeah, uh, new foliage system and enhanced damage and weather effects.

1728
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And then, of course, 100 new songs added to the radio and 30 players in online.

1729
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Jeez. At a time instead of 16.

1730
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So, that's pretty awesome. And you'll be able to transfer your safety.

1731
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Loki might finally, he might buy himself like a PlayStation 4 as a, I just got laid off present.

1732
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And I don't think I, I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.

1733
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I would like to do that, but I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.

1734
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Bummer.

1735
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Yeah.

1736
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Alright, get that game done. Sell it. 50 bucks a pop.

1737
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Alright.

1738
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Uh, let's see. Checking out some other quick news here.

1739
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Uh, I'm surprised, uh, Loki doesn't have a lot to say about this, so maybe he does. I don't know.

1740
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
But apparently there's an Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara crossover.

1741
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
What?

1742
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
What?

1743
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The fuck?

1744
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Okay, hold on, hold on. Before y'all get too excited, this is a Japanese retailer specific pre-order bonus for a pale wing costume in Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos.

1745
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That went from interest high to interest...

1746
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Jonas, she sounded like a big fan over there. Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara. Are you here for that?

1747
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I don't know if I can comment on this.

1748
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
No comment. No comment. No comment for the tea baggers. Alright.

1749
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Ultimate NES Remix, you know, because NES Remix on the Wii U is not enough, they're gonna bring it to the 3DS as well.

1750
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So Ultimate NES Remix not only will offer, you know, the same similar types of things that you saw on the Wii U versions,

1751
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:01,000
but obviously they have to give something new to make you want to buy it all over again, and that will be a full version of Speed Mario Bros.

1752
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
It's a very fast version of the original Super Mario Bros.

1753
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
So yeah, there you go. Mario's fast, the music is fast, you're gonna speed run this shit whether you want to or not.

1754
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That's what's gonna happen in Ultimate NES Remix with that.

1755
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And lastly, speaking of Nintendo products, if you are a Wii U Deluxe owner, don't forget you are getting 10% back from any e-purchase shop you make.

1756
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Meaning if you buy virtual console games, which I might be a sucker for those and I bought a lot of those,

1757
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,000
but also if you got your free game with Mario Kart 8, that was an eShop game, so if you have a Wii U Deluxe,

1758
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
you probably have like a $5 card sitting in your account right now.

1759
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Don't forget, this promotion ends December 2014, and you will have until March 2015 to spend those points.

1760
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
So this is just a friendly reminder circulating the blogs.

1761
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Check that balance, because you would probably kick yourself if you missed out on some free games.

1762
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Interesting, I didn't get my free $5.

1763
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Make sure you log in, you connect everything on the Nintendo site.

1764
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I've done it before, I've gotten like $10 or $15 worth of cards, which says a lot about how much fucking shit I bought on the Nintendo Wii U.

1765
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Not because I recently went to the eShop just to buy the new DLCs from Mario Kart 8.

1766
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I didn't see any new transactions.

1767
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I got the free game, I got the free Pikmin 3.

1768
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:32,000
You're not gonna see it in the store, you have to go to a website where you then redeem for the codes that you put in the store.

1769
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Okay, I have to check that out.

1770
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Yeah, check that out. What the hell's the website?

1771
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
We're just taking a message.

1772
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Let me see if I can remember where the website is. I think it's like nintendo.net slash deluxe, or it's like deluxe.nintendo or something like that.

1773
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Nintendo.com slash deluxe.

1774
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Somebody in chat will help us out here over at live.vognetwork.com.

1775
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
While we wait for that though, let's go to the next story from DarkSakura.

1776
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Next story or stories?

1777
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Stories!

1778
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Stuff!

1779
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Oh wait, first, actdeft. ddp.nintendo.com, thank you.

1780
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Dang it, actdeft, stop interrupting my shit.

1781
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Well hey, it was for free shit. I'm sorry DarkSakura, are you gonna give us free shit tonight?

1782
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Uh, I haven't been to gym boys.

1783
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
As opposed to, just think, it's not TTP that we talk about on the show sometimes, it's DDP.

1784
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So, Ubisoft confirmed that Watch Dogs Wii U will be out November 18th.

1785
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Good for all of those people who are getting it.

1786
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Also, it will be out in Europe on November 21st.

1787
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Sorry guys, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait.

1788
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Are they doing anything extra in this version, or is it like just a straight up port?

1789
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I think it's a port?

1790
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Boy, it's another game that's been out forever coming out on the Wii U, this is sure to not fail at all.

1791
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Why should anyone have, oh I'm sorry mister, I just bought Mass Effect 3 for Wii U.

1792
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Yeah, and then you all called me crazy, so clearly I'm the exception to the rule.

1793
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I'm not gonna buy Watch Dogs on five different systems, I didn't like it that much, jeez.

1794
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Rob.

1795
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
What?

1796
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Hearts.

1797
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
So how about some Octodad?

1798
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It's also gonna be on the Wii U, well at least they're thinking about it.

1799
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:27,000
The developers Young Horses are saying that they're in the deciding process, meaning, deciding process, why call it deciding process?

1800
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
You're just deciding.

1801
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
When you have-

1802
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
With these big companies it can be a process.

1803
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
When you're done, you have decided, you have a decision.

1804
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Process my ass, it's like boarding process.

1805
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Boarding process.

1806
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
You're not boarding process, you're just boarding.

1807
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Now they're just deciding.

1808
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I'm sorry George Carlin said it best.

1809
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Anyway.

1810
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
It said, this is the quote, we're not working on whether or not we want to bring the game to Wii U.

1811
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's not a no, but it's also not a yes.

1812
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Trust us, we'll be quite loud about it if we do decide to happen to do the port.

1813
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Sorry for the non-answer, but that's all we've got right now, so sorry not sorry.

1814
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And he put a smiley face after it too.

1815
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
So this is pretty good.

1816
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:29,000
The TIGA basically has a proposal calling on the British government to create a new creative content fund for video games to the tune of 3 million pounds annually, which is about 4.9 million dollars.

1817
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:39,000
They finalized the tax breaks for video game production so that companies can basically have their games pass a cultural test.

1818
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,000
So looks like we've got a lot of big stuff going on with that too.

1819
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:52,000
They're saying basically that the CCF could recoup investments from game sales once a developer has generated a certain amount of revenue.

1820
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So it has to pass a cultural test?

1821
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Yes.

1822
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:03,000
So if somebody decides to make some of the OLR dream games such as Puzzle Sluts, that's probably not going to pass the cultural sensitivity test.

1823
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I think it's like the cultural thing like along the signs they say, is this porn?

1824
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Does it have cultural significance?

1825
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I see.

1826
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
They could be sluts and not naked.

1827
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
That's right, it's true.

1828
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
All of those guys are sluts.

1829
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Which guys? Just everybody in general? Everybody's a slut?

1830
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
For every woman that sleeps around, every man that sleeps around is a slut as well.

1831
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Yeah, that's fair.

1832
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Not a player. A slut.

1833
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
What's that have to do with puzzles?

1834
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Moving on. Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.

1835
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Yes. The seg in our chat room says, I should think about making puzzle sluts.

1836
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Yes.

1837
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
We have a wiki that has all the OLR dream games on it.

1838
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
We need, we need though, if there are going to be puzzle sluts, there must also be man sluts in it.

1839
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
No, we talked about that a long time ago when we first proposed the game. It would be equal opportunity slutting.

1840
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And, and, and, and.

1841
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I want like, I want alien sluts.

1842
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Gay sluts, straight sluts, every kind of sluts, just not like weird shit like dead people's sluts.

1843
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
The slut machine?

1844
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Pigeon sluts.

1845
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And most importantly, consensual sluts.

1846
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Pigeon sluts.

1847
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yes, pigeon sluts are fine. That's unlocked.

1848
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
All right. Anyhow.

1849
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
That's DLC. Pigeon sluts.

1850
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I do want to point out though, remember an OLR dream game did become a reality.

1851
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Give this a cheap plug.

1852
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
We have bungee ferret tossing.

1853
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
That's right. Bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360. That is a, it's a fucking real thing.

1854
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yes.

1855
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Show to game bungee ferret tossing. You should consider taking that to the next game room.

1856
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Just say it'll be a big hit.

1857
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Bungee, bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360.

1858
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Yeah, we already did something with like Food Ninja and people actually got a hype on that at the conventions.

1859
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Right?

1860
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
They, they just went hysterical on that thing. They just loved it.

1861
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
And they were screaming at the top of their lungs just because someone sliced like five watermelons and a banana at the same time.

1862
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I could do that in real life.

1863
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Act-a-dusted puzzle sluts two super slut edition.

1864
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
All right.

1865
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I want super, super, I want super puzzle sluts DX for matching service.

1866
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
All right. Look, we've got our Fugu question.

1867
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
The Fugu music is still playing and here we are talking about sluts.

1868
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
All right.

1869
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

1870
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:35,000
We take our Facebook and our Google plus communities and we ask a question of the communities and we read some of our favorite answers.

1871
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
By the way, I just want to, well, hold on, stop the happy music for a minute.

1872
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Fucking Facebook.

1873
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Okay.

1874
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So Facebook today, after staring for months and months and months of this thing on our page at facebook.com slash orange launch radio that says you should finally put a fucking cover image on your page.

1875
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So I finally clicked the button and I'm like, gee, I have this old promo shot from like 2007.

1876
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So I put it on our, our, our Facebook page, right?

1877
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Because we haven't taken promo shots since like 2007 because look how much hair I have here.

1878
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
But anyway, uh, so, so still in my hair was hot pink.

1879
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
You guys, you guys look the same.

1880
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
But anyway, uh, I don't like the same.

1881
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:28,000
The thing is though, I put up that picture as the cover photo on Facebook and you can see how many times something has been viewed and the cover picture.

1882
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Facebook has shown to more people than the Fugu question of the week got seen this week.

1883
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So that'll teach me to listen to Facebook when it says to update things.

1884
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I thought it was going to say, Hey, you know, you should update your Facebook cover image or something like that.

1885
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Like right after you put it up there.

1886
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Hey, it's been up there for a little bit.

1887
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Leave it to me.

1888
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'll make one like it new.

1889
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Like, isn't this your Justin TV image from back in the day?

1890
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
And it's like, don't worry.

1891
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Mama will fix it.

1892
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Yes.

1893
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Yes.

1894
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
This, this, this, this image on our Facebook was for the Justin TV channel.

1895
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Just to give you how old that is.

1896
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Anyway, back to the happy music.

1897
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Fugu question of the week.

1898
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
It's about the Sega story.

1899
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
The dark soccer talked about earlier.

1900
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It is, uh, uh, you know, Sega dealing with rudities on their site.

1901
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:21,000
So we asked our readers and listeners, how much do you believe a gaming site should regulate the comments of their readers?

1902
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Should everyone get to have a say, even when that is what said is nasty or should everything be approved by a moderator before it's visible for all to see

1903
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
or something in between.

1904
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So let's start with some of our Facebook answers here.

1905
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Uh, fifth dream says even negative comments can be made without calling names, cursing like crazy or being snotty and rude.

1906
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I think most sites should have a three strikes policy, be a jerk a few times and you get banned.

1907
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Uh, Guillermo R replied and said, I think every site should be moderated against trolling and harassment.

1908
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Not go as far as having to approve every comment, but definitely have a big ban hammer for people that don't know how to play nice.

1909
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I applaud Sega for their stance.

1910
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Andy R says, I'm fine with moderation in places like that, especially seeing as these communities often contain younger children.

1911
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Gaming needs to be more welcoming these days, not less.

1912
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Uh, Duchok, I hope I said that right, says, I feel like whichever approach you take, it needs to be consistent.

1913
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
There will always be trolls, but you need to set and reinforce expectations.

1914
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
That is the exact same thing that Supernanny says, set and reinforce expectations.

1915
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I didn't mean to make her a theme tonight, but I'm just saying.

1916
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I watched a lot of Supernanny when that was on.

1917
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Alright, uh, Jenner Johnny says, I'm all for free speech on company websites, but only if it's used in a constructive and or mature manner.

1918
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:47,000
People who use their anonymity to post unintelligent and destructive comments should be subject to moderators and or removal of said comment.

1919
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Uh, Keoki replies and says, in a world where so many people enjoy being rude and troll everyone,

1920
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
simply because they are hidden behind the anonymity of the internet, sites should moderate and approve comments,

1921
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
even if it's just to stop people from getting their enjoyment that way.

1922
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And lastly, Morning Wolf says, some moderation is in order, but as someone who moderates a set of fora.

1923
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Is that the plural for forums? A fora? I've never heard that before.

1924
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I don't know, but anyway.

1925
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I thought the plural of forum was...

1926
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Forums, yeah, right? A set of forums.

1927
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
A set of forums, well, whatever.

1928
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I just researched this.

1929
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
As who moderates a set of fora.

1930
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
What if it's multiple forums, though? Anyway, forget it.

1931
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Alright, a set of fora. I'm interested to know how...

1932
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
That could just be autocorrect, for all I know.

1933
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I'm interested to know how they'll define inappropriate and personal attack.

1934
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Too many people see criticism of any kind as personal.

1935
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
A very interesting comment from someone who has a little more experience with this,

1936
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and that is, you know, this might all sound fine and good, but where exactly are they drawing the line?

1937
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Okay. The plural of forum is forums.

1938
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:59,000
The plural fora, as in the original Latin, is chiefly used when talking about a public square in an ancient Roman city.

1939
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So therefore, for the internet sense, forums is correct.

1940
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Fora only refers to the physical location of a public forum.

1941
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Interesting. Well, I still think that was a teaching moment here on OLR, so there you go.

1942
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
The more you know.

1943
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Solved by the resident grammar nerd.

1944
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Alright. Anyway, going over to Google Plus in our foogle, which is a completely made-up word.

1945
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Is that in the dictionary? Alright.

1946
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Redertainment saying, not long ago, Jezebel, as well as other sites across the Gawker network,

1947
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
changed the way they handle comments in order to address what they perceived as a growing and pervasive problem against their commenters.

1948
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
If such a problem exists, the people who run any website should be able to take steps to address the problem,

1949
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and if that includes requiring moderator approval for comments, so be it.

1950
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Sure, we'd like to be free to say what we want in response to an article with nothing to act as a hindrance,

1951
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
but, as we all know, the anonymity of the internet has led to a high population of unrepentant jackasses online.

1952
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
That's going to be my next rock band. Unrepentant jackasses.

1953
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
The problems those jackasses cause cannot be ignored and must be addressed,

1954
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,000
even if it causes problems among those who do not engage in such jackassery.

1955
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Is that a fair use of the word, jackassery?

1956
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Yes, jackassery.

1957
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
ActDeaf says, I think that encouraging discussion should be allowed, but when things get out of hand,

1958
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
a moderator should definitely step in.

1959
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Not sure if I totally approve of screened messages, but it's their site, so they can handle it how they please.

1960
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I'm not sure if this is Brozime or Brozime, and I've probably asked this like a million times before.

1961
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm going to think it's Brozime.

1962
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Alright, well it's one of the two.

1963
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Repisant says, it unfortunately needs to stay the way it is.

1964
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Human moderators can be paid to take down unwanted opinions and can't possibly work fast enough to keep up on popular pages.

1965
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Inhuman moderation has the problem of misfiring like copyright claims on YouTube, so that could potentially be worse as well.

1966
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
That's a very good point. Don't let a fucking robot moderate your forum.

1967
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Ronnie B. last but not least on Google says, I think it's okay to censor personal attacks at least.

1968
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
In general, people should treat others how they would want to be treated.

1969
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Companies should also be expected to allow respectable criticisms as feedback from their consumers, perhaps to better their product.

1970
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I like ending on that comment because it reinforces the golden rule which nobody follows on the internet these days.

1971
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Treat people like you would want to be treated. Dang it.

1972
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I'll just open it up to comment in the room. What do you guys think is appropriate?

1973
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I'd say treat people better than you would like to be treated.

1974
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Honestly, freedom of speech, at least in the United States, only applies to speaking about the government in approved forums.

1975
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Therefore, a private organization can limit the speech of whoever is using their services.

1976
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:58,000
If it is a public forum, like for example, Sega can't go on Twitter. Twitter could regulate that speech, but Sega could not.

1977
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And Twitter also, since you brought that up, they kind of need to do a better job of it too, because there's a lot of real nasty shit on Twitter.

1978
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
And I know Twitter does have a report abuse feature, but it's not working.

1979
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
It's also being abused too, by the way.

1980
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Yeah, so Twitter kind of needs to fix their shit. And I love Twitter. I've embraced that since the beginning.

1981
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I think it's very smart where you basically make people speak in text messages, which I know doesn't sound smart, but it's been a great concept.

1982
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
But Twitter really, really needs some type of overhaul in regards to some of their policies.

1983
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
You know what Twitter needs?

1984
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
A mother.

1985
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
No, a button simply called expose.

1986
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Hmm. I could see some people using that for naughty purposes. What does the expose button do?

1987
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Reveals their identity for a solid hour.

1988
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
But then we go back to the whole, not everybody should necessarily have to have their identities online.

1989
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Did you hear though about the, it was a paper printed, I want to say, in one of the big psychological publications.

1990
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It was between a couple psychologists and a few sociologists who actually revealed that by classic definition, people who go behind anonymous names and tell people to kill themselves or do hate like that are criminally insane.

1991
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
They're labeled as true sociopaths.

1992
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:30,000
That given the chance for them to go around and cause harm to people physically in real life and remain anonymous, they would most likely do it.

1993
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And that's the kind of shit that Twitter needs to like, we need to be able to respond faster to that.

1994
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
But anyway.

1995
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Those are the kind of people I wish wouldn't breed.

1996
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
All right.

1997
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
All right. Well, if there's no other comments on that, let's move in back to our-

1998
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I do have one comment.

1999
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Sure, please Jonas.

2000
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:51,000
With the way Sega's moderation thing, will it be similar to the way that like me versus moderating things or just-

2001
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:57,000
No, it just sounds like the Sega is going to be pretty swiftly acting against people that attack people.

2002
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
You can go on there and say, all of Sonic's friends are shitty.

2003
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
You can say that because it's not real people.

2004
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:14,000
But when they say things like, let's say they post one of the developers at Sega, you know, hard at work and somebody's going to go, wow, he looks like a fugly slut.

2005
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Then that's not okay because that's a real person.

2006
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:26,000
So Sega is going to take a stance against, you know, moderate errors, taking a stance where they're going to moderate that shit and, you know, we ban you for a very long time.

2007
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:33,000
All right. Let's get back into some news and we'll get to the mailbag and your calls very soon.

2008
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

2009
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:45,000
So there's a rumor now that Microsoft is testing the ability to stream Xbox games to a browser.

2010
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
So that's kind of neat.

2011
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:56,000
According to, I guess, a tech blog, Neowin, they're saying that they're currently testing the ability to play Xbox games via the web browser.

2012
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I guess that would be for use on, like, I don't know, their tablets and stuff or whatever.

2013
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Or hey, maybe even, you know, the Xbox One since, you know, it does have Internet Explorer built into it.

2014
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Apparently it's saying, you know, Xbox 360 titles, the 360 dashboard both run in browser and with the games outputting at about 60 frames per second.

2015
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I'll believe that when I see it.

2016
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:33,000
But, I mean, I guess if it's possible to do something similar with, you know, similar technologies that they have right now at Sony.

2017
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Cool. I hope that's the case because I'd love to play my Xbox 360 games from work.

2018
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,000
So this could be a very different kind of streaming thing than what maybe Sony's doing.

2019
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
You know, obviously there's PlayStation Now. They're trying to build into everything.

2020
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But that would be very interesting because Microsoft would have the capability to kind of build that into Windows in a way.

2021
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Yeah.

2022
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And through their browser.

2023
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
That would be cool even with just, like, laptops.

2024
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Like, that would get me to use Internet Explorer specifically for that.

2025
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
But that's, you know, it's a small win, I guess.

2026
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Yeah. Interesting.

2027
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But think about how much better that would be if they spent 2.5 billion dollars investing in that technology and not buying Minecraft.

2028
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
The seg in our chatroom says, and all on Silverlight.

2029
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Oh, you better believe it. You'll have to have that installed in order to do it.

2030
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Whatever.

2031
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I already have it installed for God knows what other websites I have to visit with their stupid Silverlight in there.

2032
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Could they, maybe they could just bring one versus a hundred back as a browser game.

2033
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Just do HTML5 or something.

2034
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I mean, I thought that was the whole thing with, or was all that, like, crap with Internet Explorer.

2035
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Was it beyond 10 now or something?

2036
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Was, like, oh, because remember they had it where you can run games directly from the browser and stuff.

2037
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Like, specific IE pages or something.

2038
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Is that all running on Silverlight or was that, you know, HTML5?

2039
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I can't remember which that was.

2040
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I think it's, like, I don't, if you're using Internet Explorer on the Xbox and stuff, like, I don't think it has Silverlight.

2041
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
But I think it will do HTML5. I think.

2042
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Don't quote me on that, though. It's not like I browse the Internet from my Xbox very often.

2043
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
All right. Well, let's move on.

2044
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
If it does support HTML5, let's say just hypothetically that I was using that.

2045
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Could I stream an Xbox 360 game to my 3DS or, sorry, new 3DS?

2046
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
That'd be pretty cool.

2047
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:33,000
All right. Moving on. Speaking of Xbox One, the console was released in Japan.

2048
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I don't know if you guys heard, but the console did release in Japan.

2049
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
And I'm not sure a lot of people in Japan actually heard the Xbox One was launching there either.

2050
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Or they didn't care because the sales figures are in.

2051
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:52,000
And in four days in Japan of the console launch, 23,562 units were sold.

2052
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
That's kind of low, just so you guys know.

2053
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
That is way less than what the Xbox 360 sold in the region when it first went on sale there.

2054
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Which was 60,000 units in two days.

2055
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:10,000
The original Xbox was 123,000 units in three days back in 2002.

2056
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So the Xbox One sold like a sixth of that.

2057
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
The best-selling game on the system in Japan, Titanfall, which was bundled with the console apparently.

2058
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I didn't know that they sold like a Titanfall bundle over there, but there you go.

2059
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Connect Sports Rivals sold just over 14K copies.

2060
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Dead Rising 3, 7,330 units.

2061
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Just to compare this, Act Def says kind of low. Those are almost rock bottom.

2062
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Yeah, to put this in perspective, Xbox One sold 23,500 units in Japan, right?

2063
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
The Wii U sold 308,000 units in two days.

2064
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
The PlayStation 4, 322,000 units in two days.

2065
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So, Xbox One kind of went over like a poop in Japan.

2066
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
But this surprises nobody, I think.

2067
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
It was a very weak fart.

2068
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
They didn't do much to try.

2069
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Microsoft's not exactly trying to get Japan at this point.

2070
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
If they want the games for Japan, just release the sequel to Galgun for the Xbox One.

2071
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
No, but seriously, they didn't honestly do anything.

2072
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
We were kind of waiting to see what they were going to announce.

2073
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It was going to be kind of like, ooh, this is the must-have thing for the Xbox One in Japan.

2074
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
There's that one thing from Platinum Games they alluded to at E3.

2075
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
The one trailer they had.

2076
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Yeah, but that's it.

2077
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
And there was really nothing besides the concept thing.

2078
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
They announced the new Monster Hunter game on Xbox One. Maybe then.

2079
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
There you go. That might get people a little more excited.

2080
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
SSG100Matt says,

2081
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Those are the type of numbers you cross your legs in pain to.

2082
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Those are the type of numbers that a good independent app on...

2083
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Just a random app out there might sell.

2084
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
A good one.

2085
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Well, there you go.

2086
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
So apparently Microsoft is not really going to try to push the Xbox One in Japan any further.

2087
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
At least not that we're seeing.

2088
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Anything's possible, but not really expecting anything huge.

2089
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
But hey, to be pleasantly surprised would be great.

2090
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
If they come out and say, Lost Odyssey sequel.

2091
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I'm going to be like, God damn it, because now I'm going to have to buy an Xbox One.

2092
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Speaking of that, whatever happened to Miss Walker?

2093
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
That is a good question. This came up on a previous show.

2094
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
They were making 3DS games.

2095
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:38,000
The last thing I remember them doing was Last Remnant on the Wii, which was a very late Wii.

2096
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
You mean Last Story or Last Remnant?

2097
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Sorry, Last Story. Thank you, Last Story, not Last Remnant. Thank you.

2098
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I was going to say Last Remnant, that was on PS2 or PS3.

2099
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Shit, I have that in my Steam library and I haven't even played it yet.

2100
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
That was Square's first Unreal game, I think.

2101
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yes, it was.

2102
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Let's see, other games by Miss Walker.

2103
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Terra Battle is Android and iOS.

2104
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
That's a terrible name for it. Terra Battle.

2105
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I mean, it's Terra Battle. I mean, it sounds like terrible.

2106
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
But that's an Android and iOS game.

2107
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
The last console game they made was The Last Story on the Nintendo Wii,

2108
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
and before that was Blue Dragon on the Nintendo DS, the Awakened Shadow.

2109
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
So things have been kind of quiet on the Miss Walker front.

2110
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I think they're still going.

2111
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I don't think they have folded, but they must be focusing.

2112
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Yeah, their website's still up and going.

2113
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
They've got a little thing for Terra Battle, and party with Terra Battle's artists.

2114
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
So I guess that's their big thing right now.

2115
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
A lot of stuff I see on here is about Terra Battle.

2116
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Is it Terra Bad-al?

2117
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I don't know. I have not played it.

2118
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Are you checking it out on your phone right now?

2119
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
No, I'm sending Grandpa an email.

2120
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Hi, Grandpa.

2121
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, Dark Soccer, you might have to put a break in your email here and do the next story.

2122
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Well, this is actually really, really awesome stuff.

2123
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,000
The 2014 Women in Games Hall of Fame inductees have been announced.

2124
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
We have King.com's...

2125
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I'm going to mispronounce her name.

2126
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Katharina Lavers-Mallet and Marie-Claire Aissaman from the Norwich University of Arts

2127
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
are the latest inductees that were included.

2128
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,000
This basically was put into effect in 2011, sponsored by EA,

2129
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
and it's part of the European Women in Games Conference that took place yesterday.

2130
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
So they're definitely giving some more recognition to some very deserving ladies.

2131
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I don't know if you know this, but is there actually a physical hall of fame,

2132
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
or is this more a spiritual thing as part of this convention?

2133
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I don't know if it's a spiritual thing or not. I would think that it is.

2134
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
But you can get more information at womeningamesjobs.com.

2135
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
It made me think about at the Sony Metreon back when it was the big place to be for PlayStation,

2136
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
they started a gaming walk of fame there, and they were trying to make it like...

2137
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
It was supposed to be the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it would be in San Francisco,

2138
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
and then two years later is when the PlayStation Store closed and all that stuff.

2139
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I don't even know if it's still there, the Walk of Fame. I doubt it.

2140
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
The Gaming Walk of Fame. I don't know.

2141
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
But anyway, sorry. You talking about not to hijack your story, Darcyro.

2142
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
It just kind of made me think, like, oh, I wonder if it's maybe a physical place I can go and learn more.

2143
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
But a lot of times these things are kind of more spiritual.

2144
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I don't think so much. Yeah, but go check out the site.

2145
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Okay.

2146
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Learn more.

2147
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Sounds good.

2148
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
We need more, I would say, women not just in the development arena,

2149
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,000
but definitely in the reporting and the coverage analysis, the business behind it,

2150
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,000
without having someone wiggle their finger at them and accuse them of doing things.

2151
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Mm-hmm.

2152
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
A little bit more respect, guys.

2153
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
All right. Loki.

2154
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
All right.

2155
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Oh, sorry. Sorry. The SAG has a report. Sorry, Loki. The SAG has a report.

2156
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Oh, man. The Walk of Game.

2157
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
No, it's now a Target. All of Target.

2158
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Oh, there it is.

2159
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:10,000
So the Walk of Game is now Women's Lingerie Department.

2160
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I thought that I read that they were going to bring that to, like, a convention or something like that.

2161
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Maybe.

2162
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
They were doing something with that or something.

2163
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Because that confused me. I'm like, how do you move that?

2164
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Well, you move the slabs somewhere. You don't have to have the whole sidewalk move.

2165
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Anyway.

2166
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Anyways, moving on.

2167
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
So, Oculus Rift.

2168
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Apparently, the Oculus Rift consumer version will be out by summer of 2015.

2169
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Cool.

2170
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
And priced somewhere between $200 and $400.

2171
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:49,000
They're saying it's also going to have a high resolution and a 90 hertz or a higher refresh rate.

2172
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:58,000
So, yeah. I'm excited to see what comes of that and what they're going to do with it once it actually launches.

2173
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Next year's going to be a big VR year because I bet Morpheus will be what we're going to talk about for PlayStation 4 holiday as well.

2174
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:11,000
So this is going to be very curious to see what the pricing looks like on those and, you know, what the games are looking like.

2175
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
And very, very interesting.

2176
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
And I fully anticipate a Virtual Boy 2 coming out of Nintendo.

2177
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And with the same type of graphics, too, because you know how Nintendo just doesn't quite get it right away.

2178
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
So it's going to be, you know...

2179
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Well, to be fair, the 3DS was kind of ahead of the time a little bit.

2180
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I mean, 3DS gaming kind of came and went, but now it's kind of a thing again with all this Oculus stuff.

2181
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I mean, it's different, but...

2182
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Diego, comment?

2183
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I remember when Game Gear was ahead of its time.

2184
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
That thing lit up the entire room, that light.

2185
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Yeah, and it also single-handedly kept Energizer, EnduraCell, and business for all the batteries that thing ate through.

2186
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yes, it did.

2187
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I think it was like a power generator. It could probably light up the entire house.

2188
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I think the person that invented rechargeable batteries owned a Game Gear.

2189
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I think that's the only plausible explanation.

2190
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
There's got to be a better way.

2191
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
There's got to be a better way.

2192
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Too much power.

2193
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Well, now it's just that Nintendo, was it their Wii Remotes, I think, do that.

2194
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Unless they improve that in the Wii Remote Plus.

2195
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I don't own one of those, but the original Wii Remotes, man, they'll just nom on those batteries even while you're not using it.

2196
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
That's Nintendo for you.

2197
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Well, speaking of all these VR things, you know, we talked a little bit last week about the Samsung Gear VR that has the Oculus built into it, right?

2198
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And it's going to be, you know, one type of, like, you know, kind of baseline Oculus, if you will.

2199
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Well, Harmonix is actually going to be creating a VR experience for the device.

2200
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:50,000
And I think this makes most of us in the room kind of perk up, because I know a lot of us are music game fans, and Harmonix does a very good job with their music games.

2201
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So, Harmonix Music VR, it's a music listening, dream-like experience that uses the company's music analysis engine to generate VR world elements.

2202
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It's a visualizer that you can basically be in with VR. That's kind of neat.

2203
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
A comment here from Steve Janiak, the CEO of Harmonix.

2204
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Harmonix has always been interested in creating fundamentally new ways for people to interact with music.

2205
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:22,000
There's an incredible amount of potential for this with virtual reality, and Harmonix Music VR is just one way we can deliver on these types of innovative experiences.

2206
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,000
We can't wait to hear what people think about this new way to experience the music they love.

2207
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,000
That's totally, like, one-ups the beats thing. That totally one-ups that. We'll see.

2208
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I think it would be cool if they brought their first person shooter over. I think that would be good.

2209
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Chroma?

2210
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Yeah, Chroma would be a good thing.

2211
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Did they kill it off?

2212
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
It was Alpha, so they're still working on it.

2213
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
It's on hold for a little while.

2214
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Maybe they'll put frequency on this. Who knows? No, I guess they can't, because the whole Sony tie-in.

2215
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Yeah, Morpheus.

2216
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Or Amplitude. No, it's not Amplitude. They're bringing it back.

2217
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Same thing. Same thing. Yeah, maybe they can put that on Morpheus. Who knows?

2218
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.

2219
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Mailbag at Orange, excuse me, participate at Orangelaunchradio.com. This place is in his emails.

2220
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place where our mailbag is located, and Dark Soccer is going to dive in to the mailbag.

2221
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
It's all sticky.

2222
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Well, I thought it was really empty when I looked. It was very dusty in there.

2223
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
It was, and it's making me log in again, so hold on.

2224
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So Dark Soccer is going to get her can of compressed air.

2225
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I'm going to get some bleach.

2226
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Dusty out the mailbag there, and read some of your emails. Or email, as the case may be.

2227
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Two.

2228
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Oh, two emails. There was only one when I looked earlier.

2229
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Well, that's what you get for only looking once.

2230
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Hi, OLR. It's the Nasty Canasta.

2231
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I just wanted to inform everyone about the Binding of Isaac Rebirth finally getting a release date.

2232
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
November 4th for Steam, PS4, and Vita.

2233
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
The date was announced through a trailer so surreal it was too hot for Steam.

2234
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Seriously, it's about as weird as P.T.

2235
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,000
If you can spare 90 seconds to watch and creep out your listeners at the same time, here's the link.

2236
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Which we're probably not going to do.

2237
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Yeah, I'm going to skip over that just because I don't know if it's an audio-visual thing. I'll have to check that out later.

2238
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Here's what I will do though.

2239
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Google it, people.

2240
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I am copying the link, and I will paste it in the chatroom in a moment.

2241
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
There you go.

2242
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Nicholas is being quite generous with the release of Rebirth.

2243
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,000
The game will be given away to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

2244
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And if you own the original Isaac on Steam, you can take advantage of a 33% loyalty discount toward Rebirth before it's out.

2245
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Have a great night, the Nasty Canasta.

2246
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
And I'm going to go post that link in the chatroom real quick.

2247
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Sounds good.

2248
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I don't have a whole lot else to say on this except, you know, Binding of Isaac, it's a really weird game.

2249
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Like, it's kind of scary, odd, disturbing.

2250
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
And Smash TV-like.

2251
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:01,000
But, yeah, you make the mistake of thinking it's Zelda when you first see the interface, but yeah, it's way more like a Smash TV or a twin-stick shooter type of thing.

2252
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yeah.

2253
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
But it's fun.

2254
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Makes me wish I had a way to hook up my twin sticks to it. I have Dreamcast 2 and 6.

2255
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
But I'll check out the expansion because it probably won't be very much because, you know, Isaac was very reasonably priced game.

2256
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And showed up in all these Humble bundles and things like that.

2257
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Is the Binding of Isaac Rebirth?

2258
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:30,000
But, you know, now that I think about it, though, if I have a way to hook up my Dreamcast keyboard to my computer, chances are I might be able to hook up my twin sticks to my computer.

2259
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Somebody's written a driver for it, I'm sure.

2260
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I have to play this with my twin sticks for Virtual On. Oh my god, it must happen.

2261
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Hey, OLR, it's Brozime.

2262
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Which I'm going to stick with Brozime.

2263
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:52,000
As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?

2264
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Please use punctuation.

2265
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Have you... I'm going to restart this and imagine proper capitalization.

2266
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Imagine a world where people don't write emails on their mobile phones.

2267
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Because I'm trying to phrase it properly and I can't... I'm phrasing it the way that it's written.

2268
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So I have to stop.

2269
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Breathe in, breathe in.

2270
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Okay.

2271
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:24,000
As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?

2272
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Have you played any of the games and do you like them?

2273
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I haven't played a single one. I have a lot of friends that are into them. I might play one. That's it.

2274
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Oh, I thought that was the email saying that.

2275
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Actually, yeah, I must admit Persona's a series I kind of have missed out on. I haven't really played a lot of the games.

2276
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I think Shane's super into it and I know other people out there too that are really into it. I haven't played an awful lot of it.

2277
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,000
My understanding is the last one was on the Vita and I didn't really get into that.

2278
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I keep seeing Persona 4 really cheap.

2279
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I know it was on PS2 and it was on PS3. I just, for whatever reason, never got around to the series.

2280
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I never really got into it, but I have a lot of friends that are into it who have been trying to get me hooked and no.

2281
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
How about our anime game room guys? Are you guys big on Persona at all?

2282
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
No? Blank Stayers? Not really?

2283
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Exactly, no.

2284
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Mike Jonas, please.

2285
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Not really, though. We have shown Persona 4 arena the fighting game for one of the tournaments.

2286
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Ah, okay.

2287
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
There you go.

2288
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Alright, yeah, sadly, you know what? We've kind of missed out on it too, but I'm keeping tabs on it. Something I'll catch up on eventually.

2289
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
And by the way, correcting your grammar is how I show love.

2290
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Also, Rob, last week you said you've been playing Dragon's Crown on Vita. Period.

2291
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Are you looking for anyone to play with?

2292
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Probably not on the Vita. I'm going to see if I can still grab it for free on the PlayStation 3.

2293
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I don't know if there's cross-play or whatever, but yeah, sure, I'd play that. I thought the game was pretty rad.

2294
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I've got the game on both PS3 and Vita, and wouldn't mind an excuse to play more.

2295
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Well, there you go.

2296
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I'm going to play some more for Dragon's Crown.

2297
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Yes, I own the game.

2298
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
You do? Yeah, that's nice. Good artwork.

2299
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Yeah, artwork.

2300
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Remember, grammar correction is love. I correct your grammar because I care.

2301
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,000
I know.

2302
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
That and bad punctuation really makes emails hard to read.

2303
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Alright. Well, there it is. Is that it for the emails tonight?

2304
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
All two of them.

2305
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2306
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Only if you're going to write from your mobile phone, please take your time.

2307
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Alright.

2308
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It really is not that hard to switch over to using the period. Just saying.

2309
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, appropriately enough.

2310
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

2311
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
This is fucked up.

2312
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I don't know.

2313
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:12,000
FU to adjusting to my new schedule.

2314
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It's not all that great working on Saturday, but I also don't mind having my weekdays off.

2315
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And FU to situations on behalf of my friend who just lost her children.

2316
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Oh, no.

2317
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I have them taken home.

2318
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Oh.

2319
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,000
That's... Sorry, my mind went to, like, lost, lost.

2320
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
No.

2321
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
But still, I mean, that's still very unfortunate.

2322
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I'm not going to name names or anything. It's a private thing.

2323
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Sure, sure, sure. Of course.

2324
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:53,000
But I'm sending out my love to my friend because I think that it was a misguided and incorrect accusation I led to it.

2325
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Oh, boy.

2326
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
So I am thinking very positive thoughts for her and her family.

2327
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Okay. Complicated.

2328
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Alright. Well, you know what, Jonas? I know you love the FU segments. Why don't you go next, buddy?

2329
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:14,000
FU to those who keep posting misinformation and hashtagging important information and stuff.

2330
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Or, like, important news that posted on Facebook or whatever.

2331
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Again, people, if you want to educate people about your opinion, please get your sources right.

2332
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I don't want to hear another Ferguson where people are posting videos that are, like, one year old or videos that actually have...

2333
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
that took place outside the state of the... where the locations are.

2334
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
That just... It doesn't educate people. It just adds more ignorance.

2335
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
People love to be ignorant on Facebook.

2336
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Or just in general, though, because then...

2337
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Yeah, but I see more of it on Facebook. Like, the proportion of ignorance, like, outside the computer and what I see on Facebook, it's not the same. Anyway.

2338
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Anyways, I don't want to deal with people getting angry over the wrong information.

2339
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Another big fuck you to everyone spamming smash codes advice.

2340
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I have smashed codes. Here's a code. Burger.

2341
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
What?

2342
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
What?

2343
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Smashburger.

2344
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Oh, God.

2345
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Not everybody has that chain is going to get the joke. Oh, my God.

2346
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Let's see.

2347
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Another F you to...

2348
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Pretty much anybody who tries to just kill George just any conversation whatsoever.

2349
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:38,000
It's, like, it could be the happiest and people just completely killed you with complaining and moaning and whining and bitching.

2350
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Oh, like Debbie Downer?

2351
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
You seen that Saturday Night Live sketch, Debbie Downer?

2352
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I haven't seen that. I actually haven't seen that.

2353
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Oh, you got to look it up. It's hilarious.

2354
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:52,000
But in general, it's like, if people are that miserable, get some help. Just seriously, get some help.

2355
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
All right, Jonas, I got to cut you off on a three hour show. All right, Loki.

2356
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:03,000
F you to Microsoft and their stupid Windows update auto restart.

2357
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:14,000
If you don't turn it off and you get a nice 15 minute countdown and that's basically saying, listen, you have 15 minutes to save your shit and I'm just going to restart your computer.

2358
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
There's no way to click that off. You know, like I'm in the middle of a podcast or something and I need to not have that happen.

2359
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:28,000
So I had to actually jump in and stop the service from running twice because the first time it decided, hey, I'm going to do it again.

2360
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:37,000
So that's really annoying and they really should have a way to stop that from happening because I don't need to be granny through Windows updates.

2361
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:45,000
In fact, the fact that they have as many updates for Windows anyways is just annoying. So I got to manually shut that off now.

2362
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Diego, you want to go?

2363
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Right now, I actually F you to my carrier right now because Sprint likes to do what it wants to do.

2364
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Yeah, it seems to go on and off and I don't know, I can never have a connection and I do have a fast connection.

2365
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:07,000
And whenever I go to Fanime, which is another convention that we do, it seems to just completely shut down.

2366
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I'm completely useless at that point that I can't even talk to anyone. I might as well be dead.

2367
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
It's amazing how much we rely on mobile phones too. Like that's just, I mean, we have to have that.

2368
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Oh, right. And when you have so many people in, especially conventions, especially conventions anyway.

2369
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yeah, especially when you're in there and people are using all the phone, all their phones at the same time, spamming up the air with all these waves. It's just crazy.

2370
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Also, F you to some people at the con who just don't realize that they should take a shower.

2371
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Welcome to Confunk.

2372
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Especially that, especially just the sound or the motion of just seeing sweaty bodies go around and not just having the correct personal hygiene.

2373
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:01,000
At least not even using the proper amount of soap for a proper amount of cleaning of itself. After that it just gets into more nastier, creamy details.

2374
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Let me, let me ask this as, cause you guys do the, the game room and stuff. Are there certain people where like after they touch the controllers and things you like, as soon as they turn around, you go for breeze.

2375
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Like, is there, is that like a thing?

2376
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:18,000
It's like degreaser. I mean, sometimes that pretty much becomes our new cologne. If you think about it.

2377
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I mean, after the whole incident with Jonas's a we string that looked like someone just, I'd be like, fuck it to the guy who pretty much floss his ass with it.

2378
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Sorry. That's a little too much there, but that's what happened. That's what it seems like happened.

2379
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Wow. All right. I'm cutting you off too. All right. Uh, let's see my, a few of the week, my a few of the week goes to the fact that, um, I, I, I'm trying this lifestyle adjustment where I'm eating a little differently, which has been good because I've lost a whole four pounds this week.

2380
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Sorry about the candy corn. Not sorry.

2381
02:21:49,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Yeah, but I ate that bag of candy corn anyway. But also as a result of this eating change that I'm clearly not doing very well on, uh, I haven't had a taco all week.

2382
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Like F you to the lack of tacos in my life. It's, it's depressing. And like Jamie had to go and say Jim boys earlier.

2383
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Ah, he's the one who brought it.

2384
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Jerk.

2385
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:24,000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on past the FUs of the week. Let's get to a few more stories for you guys. And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. But first, Loki.

2386
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:37,000
If you have a PSP and no other system, you're going to be in trouble if you're in Europe or Asia because you're going to lose access to the PlayStation network starting tomorrow. Too bad.

2387
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I mean right now then probably.

2388
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So apparently, you know, of course they, um, halted the production of the PSP, um, back in June of this year in Japan. Wow. That's been going that long in, I guess January, um, for North America.

2389
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:05,000
But I don't know. Hopefully most of you have like a, you know, a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 and you can download stuff with that.

2390
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I was going to say, those of you that have a PSP Go are really fucked at this point, aren't you?

2391
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Oh shit, yeah.

2392
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Cause you can't even use discs.

2393
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Oh wow, yeah.

2394
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
That's, uh, life sucks for you.

2395
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen that, like, you know, that headline, you know, on, I guess no one's realized it because everyone forgot about the PSP Go.

2396
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I didn't forget, Loki.

2397
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I didn't forget.

2398
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Never forget.

2399
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Never forget.

2400
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I got overshadowed by PS Vita.

2401
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Yeah. I just, yeah.

2402
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Completely.

2403
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:54,000
My recommendation would be, um, if you really, really want to use your PSP and, I guess, get a Vita. I mean, you can transfer all your digital purchases over that way and, uh, shit, they've got to be coming down in price at some point soon since, uh, you know, PlayStation TV is going to be dirt cheap, so, you know.

2404
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Right.

2405
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Or get a PlayStation TV if you play at home all the time.

2406
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
There you go.

2407
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Alright, and, uh, lastly, uh, kind of a sad note to end the show on, but, uh, you know, when there's a passing in the game community, we like to take a minute to acknowledge their contributions to the community and this is, uh, this is really strange timing because, um, I did this as a Classic Game of the Week just a couple months ago.

2408
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I don't remember the episode number off the top of my head, but it was a week that Dark Soccer wasn't here because, you know, when she's not here is when I, myself or Loki, end up doing the Classic Game of the Week and just a couple times ago, I picked Lode Runner, that's L-O-D-E Runner, as the Classic Game of the Week.

2409
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Uh, 1983 was when this game came out and the creator was a man named Douglas E. Smith, who unfortunately passed away this past week.

2410
02:24:38,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Um, so, Tozai Games, who currently holds the license, which I'm sure is developing probably like mobile phone, because, you know, they are still making Lode Runner, uh, but, you know, even when Sierra was doing it, it just wasn't the same as the, uh, classic, classic game, which was not only a platformer run and use ladders and get the gold bars and everything, but it was also, uh, had a level editor, which at that time, you know, 1983 was practically unheard of in games to have, like, a full-on level editor.

2411
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
So, uh, very, very tragic to hear about this.

2412
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Um, so, uh, yep, just a reminder, Lode Runner began being developed by Douglas Smith during his time at the University of Washington.

2413
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:30,000
The prototype was originally called Kong, and then the finished version was called Miner, but Broderbund finally distributed it as Lode Runner for the Apple II, the Atari 8-bit, the MSX, and the Commodore 64.

2414
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Uh, Lode Runner Classic was released in 2012.

2415
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:42,000
That was, uh, on the Xbox Live and all that stuff, I believe, and had some features in the original version that Broderbund Software distributed.

2416
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
So, uh, rest in peace, Doug Smith, who passed away this week.

2417
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Very sad to hear. Somebody made a level with his initials, D.E. Smith.

2418
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I guess it's a memorum type of thing.

2419
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Alright, uh, that is going to do it for Stories here, but that means the Skype line's open if you want to call and talk about anything we've discussed tonight.

2420
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:08,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

2421
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
And some folks in chat reminiscing a bit about Lode Runner.

2422
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
SSJ100Matt says, I've been kicked out of the computer lab in school because of Lode Runner many a time.

2423
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:24,000
We never played Lode Runner in the computer lab at school. The thing that we always played the shit out of was Scorched Earth.

2424
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Scorched Earth and... What was the other tank game before that? Like, VGA tank or something like that?

2425
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I don't remember.

2426
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Tank VGA? We need to livestream some Scorched Earth sometime. That would be...

2427
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
That would be awesome.

2428
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
That would be fun, wouldn't it? Think we can still get the shareware version of that somewhere? I don't know.

2429
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Alright, well, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2430
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Local residential convention whore DJ Rama S.

2431
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Hey, Rama. How you doing?

2432
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I'm doing pretty good. How about everybody in that studio?

2433
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
We are doing fantastic.

2434
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Doing good. Hello, DJ Rama S.

2435
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Better now that you're here.

2436
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Hello.

2437
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Awesome.

2438
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
What's up, buddy?

2439
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Alright, there's a couple of things I want to talk about, then I'm going to get the heck up one out of here.

2440
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Now, you mentioned Con Funk earlier in the show.

2441
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I didn't mention it. I didn't mention it. Diego, our guest. That's Diego from the big anime game room.

2442
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Hi, there. I sure did bring it up.

2443
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,000
So Diego understands the struggle, because I've been doing anime cons for God knows how long,

2444
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and if there's an arcade room with a DDR machine, you go in there early in the morning or late at night.

2445
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Other than that, yeah, you're going to need to change your clothes when you get out of that game room.

2446
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Oh, you better believe it.

2447
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Yes, because check this out.

2448
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:42,000
In a few weeks, New York Comic Con is going to be upon us, and everybody's going to be there, except for me because I got issues.

2449
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Wait, I'm not going to be there. Do I have issues?

2450
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
No, you're on the West Coast. You're exempt.

2451
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Okay, cool. Good.

2452
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I'm 45 minutes away from this convention, so...

2453
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
And you're not going because you have issues?

2454
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Issues are the fact that I'm not losing a day's pay to stand in a line for 8 to 12 hours for a badge,

2455
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:12,000
and if you don't believe me, Google New York Comic Con badge lines.

2456
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
You'll see people standing in front of comic book shops for hours just to get badges.

2457
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I made a typo, and I typed Anime Expo badge line, and it got the same thing. Imagine that.

2458
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
No, no, he's on the right track.

2459
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Actually, it's more or less the same damn thing.

2460
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:29,000
No, this guy's on the right track, I concur, because the same thing happened at Fanime.

2461
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It was something called Line Con.

2462
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
2013.

2463
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,000
2013, hence the word 13. Unlucky number right there. It was really bad.

2464
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,000
People were in line for 7 to 8 hours. They were just so mad.

2465
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
They were coming into the game room they were running, and they were like,

2466
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
So, did I make it to this? So, did I make it to that?

2467
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I'm so sorry, but this just passed about an hour ago, and they were so pissed off

2468
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,000
that it created more tension and more sweaty bodies that made much more odor than there should be.

2469
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
It's like a fucking skunk.

2470
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Exactly. Made my level...

2471
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Did you get sprayed?

2472
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I think I drenched myself in an entire bottle of Febreze.

2473
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:10,000
It was just a big bathtub. I just had to get out of that room after a while.

2474
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:14,000
You know how they have those spray bottles with water and a fan on it?

2475
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
You just put Febreze in there instead.

2476
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
See, but here's the thing.

2477
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
You can't do the Febreze because there are people that are actually literally allergic to some of those chemicals.

2478
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
You have a problem and a lawsuit on your hands.

2479
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
That is true.

2480
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
The list of line cons. Anime Boston 2008.

2481
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I was there for that!

2482
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Oh, there you go.

2483
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
But here's the thing. Here's the thing, though.

2484
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I was working the dealer's room, so I had no idea what was going on.

2485
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
So I came out there, and I was like, Holy shit.

2486
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And if you go to Anime Boston's forums for 2008, someone wrote a parody of Still Alive to Anime Boston Still In Line.

2487
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Well, it's okay if they sue you anyways.

2488
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:03,000
You can always settle for just an extra hour in the ball pit, so it's okay.

2489
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Oh yeah, my convention is getting a ball pit just for that.

2490
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:12,000
We've kind of fell off the beaten path here, but here's the thing.

2491
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
There are a bunch of volunteers, and I salute them.

2492
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:24,000
They are handing out free deodorant at New York Comic Con that says New York Comic Con on it.

2493
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Sponsored by deodorant.

2494
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
As long as it's not Axe.

2495
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:34,000
It looks like it's actually, you know, the dry roll ain't no spray.

2496
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Wow.

2497
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:42,000
And you know someone's gonna be offended by this, and to that I say, well that person must stink the holy high hell.

2498
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Oh yes, I had my fair share of smelly. Oh gosh.

2499
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Oh my gosh, it's just like, just stand under some hot water at least, if nothing else.

2500
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Okay, well, geez Rama, thank you for stinking up the show, I appreciate it.

2501
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I stunk it up in a positive way, at least I'm not as bad as some of those people who are selling Smash Brothers codes for 50 bucks a week.

2502
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Oh no.

2503
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Now that stinks.

2504
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:18,000
It does stink, but you know what, I wouldn't do it because not for nothing, like almost everybody here in the chat room and in the studio, we all got bills to pay.

2505
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
That's right, we got bills to pay, we got, you know, things to buy from the store, like deodorant.

2506
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2507
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Are you kidding me? Those people won't even think about buying that, they're too busy spending all their money in the dealer's room.

2508
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Alright, I gotta let you go buddy so we can get more calls.

2509
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Alright.

2510
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Alright, later, bye.

2511
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
For the record, my husband uses Axe, so.

2512
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I do too, and you've never said anything about it, so you know what.

2513
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
You just need the GameCube and the...

2514
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
It's the guys who bathe themselves in the spray.

2515
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I don't bathe myself in it.

2516
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
That's just gross.

2517
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Alright, let's get to another call.

2518
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio, who's this?

2519
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Legend of Zaku here.

2520
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Hey Zaku, how you doing?

2521
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Oh, not much, just recovering from any possible jet lag incurred as a result of coming back from Tokyo after spending ten days there the past couple of weeks.

2522
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Welcome back!

2523
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Okay, Nasai.

2524
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Did anybody smell on the plane?

2525
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I mean, it was just like, all I know is that aside from a minor bout of motion sickness heading there from Vancouver, the flight back was a lot easier for me to sleep on.

2526
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,000
I freaking love Vancouver, but we'll get into that another time.

2527
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
How was Tokyo? What'd you see there?

2528
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Pretty much the usual spiel of stuff, and not to mention all the arcades in and around the areas, even close to where we were staying.

2529
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Since let's just say that, in a nutshell, it's just vending machines, packed subway cars, fancy arcades, UFO catcher spoils.

2530
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Case in point, one of these that I managed to win at the UFO catcher.

2531
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
What is that? A model initial D car or something like that?

2532
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Oh, it's an actual RC.

2533
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Oh my god.

2534
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Yup, an actual RC car that I wanted the UFO catcher.

2535
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Wow, they give away some pretty nice stuff in those things.

2536
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Now, how much did you have to burn to get that? Alright, don't answer that.

2537
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
It was only a hundred, it was on my first try, a hundred yen.

2538
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Wow, alright.

2539
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:23,000
So, tell us about, okay, so you've been big into arcades over here in the US and you've kind of seen them rise and fall.

2540
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,000
What kind of struck you as different with the Japanese arcades versus US arcades?

2541
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Holy hell, just the fact that the rhythm gaming scene is still thriving there.

2542
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And not to mention the fact that even other types of arcade games, like the Gundam Pod one,

2543
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:51,000
where you sit in this huge pod-like cabinet where you open the door and you sit on a cockpit and you move controls just to play around.

2544
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
And more importantly, 2DX machines are just like at least more than one in every single arcade.

2545
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
And it's all ordered and you can smoke in the arcades.

2546
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
What? Oh my god, that can't be...

2547
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Yes, there are smoking sections in the arcades in Tokyo.

2548
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
That's like casino status right there.

2549
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I know, I haven't seen smoke in the arcades.

2550
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Yeah, it's exactly like casino status. Same thing with the pachinko parlors.

2551
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Oh yeah, the pachinko machines, that's right. I was going to ask about that.

2552
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Yeah, I tried, but it's like...

2553
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Where I was staying at, it was really hard to understand how to actually put money to get the actual balls.

2554
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I mean, I played it before in the past, but it was too much of a hassle, so I just like bailed and went to the nearest adores,

2555
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:40,000
which is one of the arcades, chain of arcades there, aside from Taito Game Station or the Sega Club.

2556
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,000
So yeah, I was pretty much in and about all the major places, including but not limited to Akihabara.

2557
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Were you there for the Xbox One launch then?

2558
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I think I actually, yeah, I was there during that time, like the day of the launch,

2559
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:59,000
I was actually in Shinjuku, me and my girlfriend were in Shinjuku and Big Camera,

2560
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:05,000
one of the big malls, you know, one of the big chain stores there.

2561
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And yes, they were like Xbox One folks handing out flyers.

2562
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:16,000
It was pretty depressing because there was only like one or two people playing demos in there.

2563
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Yeah, it was that bad. I mean, everything else like PS4s and whatnot were selling pretty well,

2564
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:28,000
especially the PS3 games that I managed to grab. Oh shit, it's all the way.

2565
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Wait, were you there for the launch of Smash Brothers then?

2566
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Because that just launched on what, Friday?

2567
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:40,000
No, no, no, I actually came actually flew back on Friday. So I was actually, I wasn't there.

2568
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I was close. I was seeing those ads on the subways heading there, you know, when I was,

2569
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:51,000
you know, when I was out there, I was seeing all those subway ads for Smash Brothers all over the place.

2570
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:56,000
But no, it was by the time I left, it pretty much launched.

2571
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
So other than that, it's just the usual, the usual stuff.

2572
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,000
The Gundam statue, the Imperial Palace, Mount Fuji.

2573
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Oh, one of these days, one of these days I need to get over there.

2574
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Did you do like a touristy tour type of thing or were you there visiting like some of these relatives?

2575
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:22,000
No, we stayed in a hotel, but most of it was just me and my girl kicking around in the subways.

2576
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Except for the one day that we did like a tour up to the Ghibli Museum

2577
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:33,000
and then a full day tour to Mount Fuji, Hokone, the big area, the mountainous areas.

2578
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Sounds like fun.

2579
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I know, it was, well, yeah, it was definitely fun, not to mention cheap food, cheap liquor,

2580
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:47,000
UFO catchers everywhere, convenience stores, as far as the eye can see, vending machines,

2581
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:53,000
especially the same thing they used to get into the subway you can use to get stuff from vending machines

2582
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:59,000
and UFO catchers, it's ridiculous. It makes New York look like Atlantic City.

2583
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Yeah, I heard you can get pretty crazy things in those UFO catchers.

2584
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Yeah, I mean there were plenty of things, I mean some of them are, like the really good ones with the good prizes are kind of rigged.

2585
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Like there was one in Shijuku that had like tablets and PS Vita's and 3DS's, but I knew they were rigged.

2586
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Well, Dave Busters rigs it too, come on.

2587
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Yeah, but that depends on the actual chain, like most of them, the way you actually win at the UFO catchers,

2588
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:32,000
you have to play the foreigner's stick. In other words, if an attendant sees you playing the UFO catchers

2589
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and you try to, you know, you do your best to try to get the prize out of the, you know, try to get the prize into the chute,

2590
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:47,000
and you fail, what they will do is they will try to reset the prize, but they will try to set it up so that way

2591
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
it's very easy for you to just grab it and push it into the chute.

2592
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Because that, in their minds, that pretty much, you know, that translates into word of mouth.

2593
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Because then you'll have a good experience and then you'll tell your other friends that you won big at those UFO catchers

2594
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
and they'll multiply.

2595
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Just like you told us and bragged about your little RC car that you got.

2596
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
No, my girl made out with even more stuff. I was trying to get like the portable battery chargers

2597
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:23,000
and all the other, all the other like high-end items, but yeah, I think we spent like one or two hundred,

2598
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:30,000
we spent almost the equivalent of one fifty to almost two hundred bucks on UFO catchers alone throughout the entire trip.

2599
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,000
That sounds like our soccer and crane machines back in the day, but anyway.

2600
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I didn't spend that much and I got like eight things out of that one at Walmart.

2601
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Alright. Zaku, I gotta let you go because you're making me jealous more and more by the minute because I've never been to Japan.

2602
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
But take care buddy. Glad you had a good time.

2603
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Yep.

2604
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Alright.

2605
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Yep, I definitely did.

2606
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Alright, take care.

2607
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Yeah, like a bandit.

2608
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Bye.

2609
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I want to go to Japan.

2610
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,000
So do I.

2611
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
You never been either?

2612
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
No, never been there.

2613
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
It's not just me.

2614
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Only in a dream.

2615
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Only in a dream.

2616
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:03,000
I don't know, the culture shock would be so hard though. Like I don't speak a lick of Japanese.

2617
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I mean, you've heard me do Japanese release dates on this show. I don't speak a lick of it.

2618
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Oh yeah, mine's horrible too. It's just...

2619
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Like if a Kumbu JP isn't there to help me out.

2620
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
You'll have too hard of a time finding people who speak English.

2621
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
I guess that's true.

2622
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
But, anyway.

2623
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Alright, 187...

2624
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Oh, I shouldn't even bother saying that because it's already lighting up all over again.

2625
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Let's get back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

2626
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.

2627
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Hey, Kaijuto. What's up to you, my buddy?

2628
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
I'm going to keep this real quick.

2629
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Alright.

2630
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I can't hear anybody. Can you say something again?

2631
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Yeah, hi. Hello.

2632
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Alright, there you go.

2633
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Alright, yeah, I'm going to make this real quick.

2634
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Sure.

2635
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:40,000
The thing about Smash Brothers and the 3DS, I'm getting it for the 3DS and I'm only getting it for the 3DS.

2636
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I don't know what people are complaining about with the little screen.

2637
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:50,000
I've been playing Jump Ultimate Stars for god knows how long and that was basically Smash Brothers before we got Smash Brothers.

2638
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,000
It was for the original DS and I still play it to this day.

2639
02:39:54,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I remember back in the day when the DS came out, everybody was crying for a Smash Brothers port.

2640
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Now we got it and now you have people complaining about something as lousy as a screen.

2641
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Every week, Nintendo is surprising me with the stuff that they're doing.

2642
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Like I said last week, it sounds like they're listening to the fans and they're giving us what we asked for and I appreciate that.

2643
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
That's all I have to say.

2644
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I didn't play any of that stuff.

2645
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Here's the thing, I didn't think the Smash demo was terrible by any means.

2646
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:29,000
It does get a little crazy when things zoom out.

2647
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:35,000
All that crap aside, there really isn't a lot of differentiation between the 3DS and the Wii U version.

2648
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
I'm not seeing the urgency to get both.

2649
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I'm kind of like, I'll just get the Wii U version that better fits my lifestyle.

2650
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I happen to own a Wii U anyway for other stuff.

2651
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Unless I have a bunch of friends that are going to have the 3DS version, I'm not really feeling that urgency.

2652
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I can wait for the Wii U version. It's only going to be another 6 weeks.

2653
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
For me, if I did have a Wii U, I don't have a Wii U.

2654
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,000
If I did, I would actually get two copies of the game.

2655
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
The main reason why is because I do like to play multiplayer with friends.

2656
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:14,000
From what I know from past experiences with Nintendo handhelds, that can get very expensive.

2657
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:20,000
If you actually have friends who don't actually have the system, you would need to let them borrow one of your 3DSes.

2658
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
You would also have to buy an extra cartridge, which I've done before in the past.

2659
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I've actually had multiple cartridges so that if I had someone over, we could play multiplayer on a 3DS game that you can't play anywhere else.

2660
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Just for that reason alone, I would get it for the Wii U.

2661
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I know that I can just play local multiplayer and everybody around the television, and that's about it.

2662
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,000
But it's not for screen size. It's just basically so I'm not broke.

2663
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Will Smash Brothers not have the whole, you can beam a limited copy of the game to somebody else?

2664
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Yeah, but that's always crap. You're probably going to be playing as, what was the thing with the Mario Kart?

2665
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,000
You play like a little ghost dude, who's that guy?

2666
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

2667
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,000
It wasn't that bad though, considering the other person...

2668
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
No, it sucked.

2669
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:09,000
That was fun because it was like, you could still join in the game and such.

2670
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Yeah, but your cars always sucked. Everything was default. You're just like a default character.

2671
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:23,000
The DS version was kind of broken, because once you figure out snaking, it's impossible to catch up on anybody.

2672
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,000
True.

2673
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:31,000
I played someone on DS, and they had the robot. What is it, Robbie the Robot? And they did that snake crapping.

2674
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

2675
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Yeah, but I gotta go.

2676
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Alright, I appreciate the perspective, Kaijuto. Enjoy the game.

2677
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Alright, later.

2678
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,000
I should have asked if you had the demo.

2679
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Okay, if you guys want to code this one, but I was more like, if he's already had a chance to kind of sample it and see if it's what he's hoping for.

2680
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
But yeah, I mean, I forgot about that Jump Ultimate Stars, which I actually have played.

2681
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,000
But for me, it was one of those things where I was just like, hee hee, this is funny.

2682
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:02,000
I wasn't feeling the urgency to buy it or whatever, but that's cool.

2683
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I've been getting some of the feedback on the new Smash Brothers, since some people have been testing out the combinations and so forth to try and get better at the game.

2684
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:17,000
And people, of course, I can understand what he was saying, Kaijuto was saying about the critics and stuff, but him just focusing on this game.

2685
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And saying because people have done this from the past since the first game and ground up.

2686
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,000
And just experimenting on them and all that stuff to see how the differences are.

2687
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Because some say it's toned down or it's gotten to a point where it felt like it went back to the first game, it's felt.

2688
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
That's what some people say that it feels.

2689
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Interesting.

2690
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Alright, we have one more call coming in. I guess this will probably be it for tonight and then we'll wrap up.

2691
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio. Who's this?

2692
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Hey, this is Agdeft.

2693
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Hey, Agdeft. Thanks again for that code. You rock.

2694
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Well, I feel like a dealer now because last week, there was a factory and now the Smash Brothers code.

2695
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Wow, Agdeft, you're literally ruining my life. Well, I gotta let you go. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, buddy?

2696
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Well, I just wanted to add to Caillou's call right now.

2697
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Especially because the string complaints people are having are pretty legit complaints.

2698
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:16,000
I have played the demo, of course.

2699
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:23,000
And I don't have that problem that much, but it's still a problem. I can see it.

2700
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:36,000
And I was talking to Bobby on this earlier on his show that with all the action, what's happening on the screen, especially with four players, even with three players, it gets a real frenetic.

2701
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:44,000
And it's kind of hard to follow where you are or to locate where your character is.

2702
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Do you have an XL or do you have an original DS?

2703
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I have an XL.

2704
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:59,000
See, Bobby's rocking the original 3DS and I can't imagine how that's gotta look. I mean, I kind of want to see it now. I don't even know anybody that has an original 3DS.

2705
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:08,000
But I can imagine it's gotta get tricky when it's three and four people all zoomed out. I can see where that gets really annoying.

2706
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Yeah, and I have played on a normal DS. Not the Smash Brothers demo, but I have played other games on a normal DS, like the other of them.

2707
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:31,000
And I look at the screen and I'm like, oh my god, this is really small. Even looking at the original DS screen that's even smaller, I really don't know how people are gonna play at least comfortably with multiple people.

2708
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Maybe one person or another person. Yeah, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay. But playing with four or three, yeah, it's gonna be really hard to see.

2709
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Bobby actually chimes in on that too in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying the screen size complaints are definitely a personal problem.

2710
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:54,000
For some people, it's okay. For others, like me, it's not. So, you know, a lot of it is personal preference. Diego wanted to jump in with something too here.

2711
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Yeah, I believe they were also discussing about making a new XL with the C-Stick on it. I think specifically for this game as well, I believe.

2712
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Well, is that that new 3DS? That's a whole other thing because, you know, now they're talking about games that will only be playable on that.

2713
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:22,000
And then I guess the thing with Smash Brothers, the thing I was hearing is that you can't post to Miiverse in Smash Brothers because the system can't freaking handle it unless you have a new 3DS which does have the processing power to be able to do it.

2714
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Yeah, that's right. Interesting, huh?

2715
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Yeah, and speaking of the new 3DS, it seems like it's going to be released for Smash Brothers especially because it definitely serves a lot of the people's complaints about the C-Stick, maybe the screen.

2716
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:53,000
But I don't think that much because if I remember correctly, the screen is going to be the same size for both bottles, the normal and the XL.

2717
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,000
I'll remember.

2718
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:03,000
I'm wondering how that C-Stick actually feels because it looks really tiny and it doesn't look like, remember with the little analog sticks they have on the PSP and everyone fucking hated them?

2719
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:11,000
It's still so weird to me that Nintendo, like, you know, Nintendo's got to know how rabid their fanbase is and it's like, it's no freaking secret.

2720
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Japan's getting a new 3DS. Like, why won't they comment more about, like, are they going to do it or not for America?

2721
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Like, even if they're just kind of like, oh, well, we're evaluating the market. At least I'd like to hear something like that.

2722
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:31,000
They're keeping, they're definitely their fanbase because they don't want to, fans do not want to see that controller change, especially for the Wii U.

2723
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
That's why they put in the adaption for the GameCube controller.

2724
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Not only that, I was going to say, not only that, but they also, you know, they just put out or announced a bunch of exclusive new 3DS systems that they're going to have available that they obviously want to sell.

2725
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Oh, right.

2726
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Also, they're not going to say, oh, hey, save your money because a new 3DS is coming. They don't want to tell anybody that.

2727
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,000
They want you to buy that system and they go, oh, I want that system, too.

2728
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
And I really want the NES one, but GameStop's exclusive.

2729
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Oh, yeah, I saw that one, too.

2730
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:08,000
It's a picture of a Nintendo controller on the top part of the DS. Like, when they did that Game Boy, it was, what, the Advance SP?

2731
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Yeah, the Advance SP.

2732
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
That one was rad because you opened it up and it looked like an NES one.

2733
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Yeah, the flip one.

2734
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Yeah, that one was cool, but this one doesn't look that inspiring, but I don't know.

2735
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Yeah, and he was going off the one about the NES one coming out next month as well.

2736
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
That's pretty cool as well. Like, really retro.

2737
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Anyway.

2738
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,000
All right, well, Act F, any other thoughts before I let you go?

2739
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:34,000
And did you talk about how the 3DS is going to function as a control for Snatch Brothers?

2740
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:39,000
It came up briefly when we were talking about the demo, but what are your thoughts on all that?

2741
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:52,000
I think it's pretty cool. Using a 3DS controller, especially, it's something that should be done more frequently for especially games that aren't on both consoles.

2742
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:59,000
It's almost like I suggested that on this show a few months ago. Who knew?

2743
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:10,000
It's almost like it should be something that's just built into the fucking system that should be just a controller that can be used for any game and not just, you know, this one particular game.

2744
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:14,000
All right, Act F, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call, buddy.

2745
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2746
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,000
All right, have fun smashing. All right, later.

2747
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:25,000
All right, and I don't think I really asked him how he liked the demo, but I guess there's always next week.

2748
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:38,000
All right, I am going to close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through, please feel free to tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, or you can always send us an e-mail as well, participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

2749
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Speaking of Twitter, I didn't see it light up a whole lot this week, although I did get a little bit more taunting about the whole Mass Effect on Wii U thing.

2750
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Just so you guys know, I bought my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3 last week live during the show because I now own it on four different platforms, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and now Wii U.

2751
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:05,000
And so, of course, everybody's giving me shit about it because it's like, dude, you bought the same game four times, and I'm just like, you know what, you don't know me or my life.

2752
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Pika Uno tweeted saying, just wanted to chime in with the support. I, too, would buy Mass Effect Trilogy if I had the money, the Wii U, and less cents.

2753
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:22,000
I'm not sure that was totally a support, but thank you.

2754
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Let's see, Dartitsuya said, I want to give a plug to Construct 2. It's a game programming tool for those that can't get the hang of Unity. Great for 2D retro games.

2755
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Oh, well, programming for dummies sounds right up my alley, so I'll have to check that out. Construct 2, I'll check that out.

2756
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Loki, any last minute stories for us tonight?

2757
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Uh, no.

2758
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,000
No? Alright.

2759
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
I don't have anything important.

2760
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Dartitsuya, how you doing?

2761
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
I'm talking to Marissa.

2762
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Hi, Marissa!

2763
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Marissa's in chat, and I love her to death.

2764
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I love her to death, too. Well, I mean, I wouldn't want her to die. I just love her a lot.

2765
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:06,000
I love her with the crushing force of a thousand black holes.

2766
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Wow, you should write, like, Hallmark greeting cards.

2767
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:16,000
I love you with the force of a thousand crushing black holes.

2768
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
And then I'll put the formula inside.

2769
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Then there's a picture of a kitten. Alright.

2770
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Anyhow, that is going to do it, then, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2771
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Hey, guys, thanks so much for visiting the show again this week. I appreciate you guys stopping by. Feel free to come by anytime.

2772
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Definitely. Our pleasure.

2773
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Be sure to throw out the plugs. How do we find out more? If I'm in the Northern California, Northern Nevada region, probably Portland at some point, region where you guys travel, how can I keep tabs on you guys?

2774
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:55,000
We have Facebook, Twitter, official website, obviously.

2775
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
And where would that website be?

2776
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:01,000
tbagger.org.

2777
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Alright, sounds good. Thank you guys very much for being here. Diego, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2778
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Actually, not exactly. No, not really. Nothing coming to mind at the moment.

2779
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Just a very, very zen...

2780
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Well, besides going back to the Congo, just try and keep clean.

2781
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Yeah, wash your ass, for God's sake.

2782
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Please do. And don't floss it with things that need to be played on.

2783
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Alright. Jonas, your final thought for our listeners tonight?

2784
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Oh, yeah, I have a couple of Smash codes, but not for Smash Brothers game.

2785
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Shut up. Alright.

2786
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,000
You're not welcome here anymore, you tease. Alright, I'm just kidding.

2787
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2788
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:56,000
You just need to make a video that says Smash codes, and you write down codes, like, you know, the Konami code, and you take a hammer and smash it.

2789
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:05,000
My final thought is, you are all super dumb right now. Just saying, I don't often feel like the smartest person in the room, but right now, I'm getting close.

2790
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Alright, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2791
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Good riddance to bad rubbish on my Facebook page.

2792
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Oh, Snapples. This sounds like some drums. Some drums.

2793
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I just have a particular issue with people who only pick and choose, quote, facts to believe, and don't accept that, yes, there may be good, but there are also bad.

2794
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Understanding both sides of this is what makes an intelligent person.

2795
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Wait, people think differently than I do?

2796
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Exactly, that's why one version of the soundtrack for Sonic is better than the other version, I'm telling you.

2797
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Oh no, did you drop Bobby as a friend, are things gonna get awkward?

2798
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:47,000
No, I don't give a shit which version he likes.

2799
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
He can be wrong if he wants.

2800
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:59,000
And isn't that how we should all get along? If you want to like the wrong version of Sonic, then you know what, you go right on ahead, that's your right, but you are wrong in that right.

2801
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I'll just play some Sonic 3D World.

2802
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I'm just gonna put it this way, if you can't see the flaws in the thing that you are supporting, then you can't be a true supporter of it. You have to know the flaws to be able to know what to make changes in.

2803
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:15,000
So what are the flaws in Orange Lounge Radio?

2804
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Me not having a taco.

2805
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I eat all the tacos.

2806
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:24,000
And on that note, that's gonna do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2807
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the program and spending time with us. Hey, if you like the show, you know what we ask, please tell a friend or three or fifteen about our little program and help spread the word, because we don't have like a million dollar magazine or website backing us.

2808
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:42,000
All we have are our big ass mouths, and your big ass mouths, helping spread the word of the show.

2809
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Thanks a lot. Be nice to each other when you're playing games online. Remember, there are human beings on the other side, and for the love of God, do not swat people, or Supernanny will spank you in the town square.

2810
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Think on that for a little while. Until next week, good night.

2811
