Labor Day weekend is over and during the break, Nintendo revealed its brand new 3DS via Nintendo Direct. At least they didn't call it the 3DS You or Me. And that's just one headline from another BusyCon weekend. Stay tuned for more, including your comments, calls, and emails on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 566, September the 7th of 2014. My gosh, we're already in September. The year's gonna be done before we know it.

00:47.000 --> 00:59.000
Here comes the holiday season of gaming with the Destiny release this week and oh my gosh, it's gonna be a busy few months. Thanks for joining us for it to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours and in studio joining me as always are my incredible co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hi.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Hi, welcome back.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You too. Welcome back to your house.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Thank you. Yes. Well, I wasn't here last week. I was, I was in it. Where was I?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I wasn't here either.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
Where was I? Because I, you know, I had that moment, you know, I don't know if you guys do this. Let me say, let me also just go ahead and introduce Techmaster Loki here tonight as well.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Hi.

01:28.000 --> 01:42.000
So I can ask a question of all of you. I don't know if you do this because whenever I have a week that we don't have a show, I kind of find myself sitting somewhere going and then I notice I look at my clock or look at my watch and it's six o'clock or in the case of being at Dragon Con, it's nine o'clock Eastern.

01:42.000 --> 01:54.000
And I'm looking going, I should be setting up for, I should be on the call with Bobby right now and we should be doing OLR, but I'm not. Do you do that too? Or is that just me who's kind of like, I should be doing this, but I'm not.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I had a moment of wondering what to do with my time.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
And then Dan and I decided that it was the day before our anniversary, so we would watch Divergent, which the book was better, of course.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Of course.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The movie wasn't bad. It was just very, you know, teen angsty. It felt teen angsty. You're watching it on the screen as opposed to reading the book.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
I could have watched that on the flight, but they wanted six bucks. No, thank you. Was Divergent worth six bucks?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It was worth six bucks.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh well.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
But.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I watched four hours of Shark Tank instead.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Dan got me a bottle of Hypnotic for our anniversary and I drank a lot of it.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Awesome. Yes, Loki?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I was going to say, yeah, I wouldn't pay six dollars for that either.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, did you see Divergent?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
No.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
What did you do with the week off?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I think I watched the kids.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
You've had two weeks off, actually, because I know you had family obligations a couple of weeks ago.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, and I watched the kids again.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That's pretty much all we did.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Do you remember how to do a radio show?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
What did you watch them do?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Of course I do.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
It's like sitting here going, Hannah, I hate this. This is so boring.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
What did you watch them do? What do children do in the wild?

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, I remember Winston's actually scooting around now, so I'm watching him not, or at least trying not to get him to chew on, you know, computer cords and stuff like that.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I told you toddlers are cats.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
He wants to put everything in his mouth, so he wants to put, like, if it's something on the floor, he's going to grab it and taste it, because that's what toddlers do.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
They taste everything.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Same like with dogs. Dogs taste everything, too.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And cats.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So I remember what I was doing a week ago at nine o'clock Eastern.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
So we had just finished presenting at the Parsec Awards, which is, that was a great honor, we got to present.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
And someone got to sit by Felicia Day, and I'm jealous.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
It wasn't me. Is that that picture of Brad?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
That's from a few years ago. Sadly, Brad wasn't there this year.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
But I would have only wanted to be there to see Felicia Day.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't think she was there this year.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
There was no reason for me to be there.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
That's not true, because there was a lot of things that Dark Soccer would have fun with.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
I don't know, there were other Buffy celebrities there, like Emma Caulfield.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
There was a cast of Mythbusters there.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
The cast of Mythbusters was there, including some of the guys that are no longer on the cast of Mythbusters.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Anyway, so we just finished presenting at the Parsecs, which was awesome, because I got to literally brush elbows with Lord British.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Who, if you don't know who he is, I didn't really get a chance to meet him.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I had a great admiration for him prior to the stupid Ready Player One contest.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I still, in spite of, everybody has their hit and misses.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Look, we've had bad episodes of OLR, and people forgive us for that.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So we can forgive him for a bad face.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
No, I can't.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I need to air my grievances with him, and then we'll be done.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
He's the creator of Ultima, for God's sake.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
Ultima's won through Ultima Online, which is like an epic, epic MMO.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Something I would have rather played instead of this fucking stupid garage sale collector game thing that I was forced to play.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
If it was like, hey, let's play some Ultima Online, I'd be like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
But no, it was garage sale, the game, I don't know.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Were you going to say it, Arsyra?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I was just reading what Bobby said in chat.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
He said, I shook his hand because I made a joke about him and he liked it.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
He actually wanted to shake my hand.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
That's right, Lord British wanted to meet me.

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
That comment from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Although-

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Apparently he's a giant effing celeb.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
I've got to say, because I saw, I don't remember what it was, some documentary or something, his house is fucking awesome.

05:31.000 --> 05:46.000
Okay, so I went to the Lord British panel at Dragon Con where we got to hear, oh, this was awesome, the confirmation that yes, the evil spheres in Ultima 7 were based off the Electronic Arts logo at the time.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And EA knew that, which they were ECA back in the day.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
If you go back and look at your kind of computing history, they actually used to be like a cube and if you see their old logo.

05:57.000 --> 06:12.000
So yes, EA knew that when they bought Origin and Lord British was basically talking about like, you know, I kind of had to sell Origin because we were getting bumped off the shelves for these other bigger distributors.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
We had to merge with somebody else to get the shelf space basically.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But then he talked a lot about his house, which sounds amazing.

06:17.000 --> 06:29.000
And I didn't realize he was super into geocaching, but apparently he set up this geocache at his house that you have to actually like go through a forest and answer riddles to open doors.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Like it's just like, what an egomaniac, but I love him for it.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
But then you talked about when his house got broken into by some crazy guy and how he protected himself with the secret passageways in the house.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Like it's just like, this is crazy. I love listening to him talk. I wanted to stay longer.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
He went longer than the hour that was allotted to him, but unfortunately he was right before the VOG Network presents panel over the podcasting track.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So I had to leave to get to the other panel, but I want to invite him on OLR sometime.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know if he would ever come on a little piddly show like this, but I'll give him three hours to talk and it would be it would be amazing.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
I think we all could listen to Lord British for three hours. He's an amazing guy.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
So anyway, quickly, let me also just kind of wrap up Dragon Con real quick.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
There's not a lot of gaming content at Dragon Con because it is more of a geek convention.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
So since it is the voice of geeks network here, we kind of dabble in all that stuff.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You know, Dragon Con is a great fit for us.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
But as far as gaming content, like we didn't really get any game announcements or anything like that.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
You know, that's all happening at PAX, which we'll get into a little bit on in the show.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
But, you know, did see some good gaming fandom and, you know, saw like the Darkmoon Faire party for World of Warcraft.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I saw an EverQuest landmark panel where we really didn't learn anything about the game.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
But those that were into the game sure seemed to enjoy it. So, you know, props to them.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
And there was a few things here and there. Like, you know, again, the Lord British panel was a personal favorite of mine.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
But I did want to say a big, big thank you to those that came out to see some of the things we did on the podcasting track.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Some of you guys actually got up early Monday morning to come see that participating not just listening panel, which was a lot of fun.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
And I just want to thank you guys for, you know, coming up and introducing yourselves, saying hello, and being there. It was great.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
And I'm trying to work on Dark Soccer and Loki, guys, someday. But we might have to wait for Loki's kids to turn 18.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Someday. Someday we'll get you all to Dragon Con. Had a good time.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
The one I'm really working on for next year is Grandpa from Hoard House and who also hosts the Starboard power coupling.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
Because I'm like, Grandpa, this year the Trek track hosted a dilithium crystal ball.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
You don't want to go to the dilithium crystal ball, Grandpa. So I think I'm working on him for next year. We might be able to make that happen.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So, yeah. So thanks to everybody that showed up at Dragon Con and I'll see you guys in 2015.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
And big shout-outs to Travis, obviously, who I spent a big chunk of the weekend with.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
And Brian from British Invaders, who I got to meet for the first time.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
All the guys from Critical Myth met each other for the first time at Dragon Con.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
So it was amazing, in person, meaning. So it was amazing to kind of get to witness that.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
And just everybody, all the VOG and non-VOG and people on the podcast track.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Just thank you, thank you. I had an amazing convention and can't wait until next year.

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
I was promised exclusive loot for registering my participation for listening to that panel.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
And I'm checking my account. I just don't have any.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
I think he's going to retcon it in. I think he was in a hurry to get that podcast up.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm just giving him crap.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I know, I know. It's always fun to give Bobby Black Wolf crap. It's even more fun to give it to him in person.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
So there you go.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Let's see, look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Tigerclaw asks, did Lord British talk about the time he went to space?

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
Actually, that didn't really come up. That topic did. I mean, he had talked about putting a geocache or what do they call them?

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
The treasures or whatever. He did put one on the International Space Station.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And it has been checked more times than the one he put at the bottom of the ocean.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Like, I remember that that that whole topic had come up, but he didn't talk really explicitly about his travels.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
A lot of it was focused on like the making of Ultima one and two and then kind of talking about the house.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
So, you know, there's there was a lot.

10:09.000 --> 10:18.000
That's what I did like during my two weeks that I was on the show is like I was watching a lot of these postmortem things that they have.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
Like, like Gamasutra has like links to the GDC stuff, the postmortems where they talk about, you know,

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
its developers talking about the creations of the games and all the like thought processes and stuff and, you know, trouble and stuff that they did.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
You know, putting these things out like Maniac Mansion and what other ones that I watch. I watched a bunch of them.

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
Great shit. I love watching that stuff. It's very fascinating. That would have been I bet they've got one for Ultima on there somewhere, but good stuff.

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah. Speaking of postmortems, something I did get to do at Dragon Con this year that I didn't do last year is I actually got to go to the very last podcasting panel where they have like the wrap up.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
Like, you know, in every track at Dragon Con has this, whether you're doing, you know, Tolkien track or, you know, video game track or whatever, they always do like a wrap up panel at the very end.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
So I actually went to the one for podcasting and it was, it was really great, informal, got to meet a lot of other people that do podcasts of all shapes and sizes.

11:11.000 --> 11:20.000
And I just got to say, I walked out of that very motivated, which is always a really good feeling. So don't be surprised if you see me taking on more projects.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Just what I need to be doing more projects in podcasting. What? What? What? What?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I think you and I should do a new project.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Now is a great time to pitch me new projects. I'm just saying.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I have ideas.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Yes. All right. Ideas, you has them. All right. We'll talk on air about that.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I have evil ideas.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Or off air about that.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Evil ideas.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, I have been playing a lot of Diablo, but we'll get into our gaming weeks in a minute.

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
One thing I wanted to talk about for a kickoff topic here, not just Dragon Con, but this week, you know, we're coming up on September 9th, which is nine nine, right?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And already going to be a big day. We know Destiny's coming out that day.

11:54.000 --> 12:03.000
Apple's going to announce inevitably a new iPhone, possibly a new watch is the rumors and what have you.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
So we'll see. We'll see. So that's all possibly have a nine nine. But you know what?

12:09.000 --> 12:19.000
Screw both those things because nine nine twenty fourteen also marks the fifteenth birthday birthday of the Sega Dreamcast launching in the United States.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
That's right. Nine nine ninety nine was the day for the Sega Dreamcast.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
I remember sitting on my butt reading a five dollar book I picked up at Barnes and Noble.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, perfect. I wanted to reminisce a little bit here.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
One thing, my friend Melissa, who is getting married in two months.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, so you guys you guys camped out for the Dreamcast.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
We did.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
What did you get? What did you pick up at launch for Dreamcast?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Do you remember?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
What didn't we get?

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, we we got, you know, all the crazy taxi and what else didn't come with Sonic Adventure, did it?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't remember because I know we had it.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't know. Well, did they not? I don't know if it came with games, did it?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Because they have like a base system then because I know the one I got didn't have any games.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
And we got like a couple other things. But keep in mind, we already had a Dreamcast and a bunch of games.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
So we didn't really feel the need to buy more games, except we wanted to hear the English cast of Sonic Adventure.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Right. So I was going through a little bit of a rough patch in ninety nine.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So I was kind of I kind of wasn't gaming a lot.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Probably the period between like ninety nine and about two thousand two thousand one right before our started and I got into DDR and all that.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I kind of wasn't gaming as much. So I didn't pick up the Dreamcast when it first came out.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I bought the Dreamcast when it was on sale for forty dollars.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Like I think Game Stops really were selling them for like forty dollars used or something.

13:31.000 --> 13:41.000
So I remember picking up a Dreamcast and I played the ever living crap at a fantasy star online, which probably leads into my addiction to various online games and other MMOs today.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I mean, fantasy star online really set the stage for a lot of that.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
And so it's kind of ironic that Destiny comes out this week, which I compared to PSO in some ways, in some ways on a previous show.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
So it's kind of fun to see that come full circle.

13:55.000 --> 14:04.000
But it should be stated, it is not the 15th birthday of the Dreamcast period because it was out in Japan for darn near a whole year before it was out here.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Right. Like they had it for a while.

14:05.000 --> 14:15.000
I think it came out in, I want to say like January or February because I had one for my, we had one when I got DDR second mix for my birthday.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
I was doing, that wasn't the system that they launched. No, that was the Saturn that they did that where it's like, it's out now, you know, that type of thing.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah. I want to say I was doing research earlier when I did the Fugu question, which is about this topic as well tonight.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
And it was November of 98, but that probably, you probably just took a couple months for you to get on board and get one.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I won mine.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Huh?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I won mine.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
You won yours. How'd you win your Dreamcast?

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter and won it in a raffle because I didn't even want one.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
I didn't want to, you know, that system because I was like, I don't want it.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And then I got him like, sweet.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
That's awesome.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm like, well, at least I'm not going to pay for it, but I'm going to buy games for this now.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
So what did you end up getting for?

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
I got, I don't remember, see, I don't remember what year I got it because it wasn't 99.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm pretty sure. I think it was like 2000, 2001.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
And it was, I got Power Stone.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
I was going to say, you strike me as the type that would have played a shit ton of Power Stone.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We did because I played a shit ton of Power Stone in the arcade.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
So yes, I had to get Power Stone and I got Tony Hawk Pro Skater and I think I had Crazy Taxi.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
I know I had Fancy Star Online and what else did I have?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Did you get Quake 3?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
No, no.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
Dancing was Quake 3 for the longest time and we were so pissed that we couldn't use our, we got the Ethernet adapter.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
We couldn't play PSO on it.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Very, very, very irritated me.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
I think I only played PSO online once because I only had the modem for it.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So, I don't know, it was okay.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I didn't do a lot of online playing on that until the Xbox.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And then, what other game did I get? I got something else too.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Because I still have all the same games.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Like that initial first batch of games I bought was it.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And then I never bought any more games for it.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
I remember getting really excited when we picked up Grandia 2 because I had already been playing my friends Japanese version.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And my save file worked.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
From a Japanese game.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And Power Stone was one of the other games that did that.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
Power Stone's awesome. I should have gotten Power Stone 2 but I never did.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Aw, it was fun.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I have it on my arcade cabinet.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
My other favorite thing to do on the Dreamcast, even though I realize y'all this is of a questionable legality.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
But I've supported the crap out of Virtual Console and the like ever since.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But burning CDs full of emulators and ROMs.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Sorry, not sorry. That was a lot of fun.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Remember the Para Para thing?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh my god, that thing was horrible.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The purple biscuits?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Green biscuits.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
It's green because you know how I know it's green?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because I fucking have it.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I have it. It's in my closet.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
No, it was another knockoff that had the purple ones.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Or maybe it was just the controller or something.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
Let me ask this question because I want to get to the new news, not just reminiscing.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
But let me ask one more question about the Dreamcast and I'll read some comments from chat.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I want to know your guys' thoughts on this too over at live.vognetwork.com.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
Why do we remember the Dreamcast so fondly when it didn't really do so well?

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
I mean, it kind of failed as a system, I hate to say it, but it didn't.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
But why do we remember something so fondly that didn't really do so well?

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
I think for me it's a lot of it kind of brings it back to how the early consoles were

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
and the early home video game consoles where they were basically

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
hey, we're going to take all these cool arcade games and port them to console.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And so with the Dreamcast you had a lot of that.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Like with Power Stone and all the different Sega games that they had.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
A lot of the CPS2 games as well.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah, those were all in there.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And just a lot like Ikaruga, like all these big shmups and stuff.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
And plus, I think the other thing, the reason I think so fondly of it is it supported so long.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
There's still people making games out there for it right now.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And it was maybe because it was so easy to pirate for,

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
it allowed you to expose yourself to a lot of things that you might not have been able to play otherwise.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I think it's the pirating thing that might have led to the big factor in this downfall,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
though I don't really think so much as marketing.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Because our marketing in the US was really clever.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
I would say I think the PlayStation 2 was able to really kind of kick it in the butt.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
With the mere fact that the PlayStation 2 played, and I realize it was a couple years later,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
but the PlayStation 2 played DVDs.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And that was a huge thing for people.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You know, the fact that it could play DVDs.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
A lot of people made the decision, oh, I'll get one of these for the living room.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
So the Dreamcast really got a kick in the butt when that happened, I think.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
So I think that was a huge factor.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
But it still surprises me that it didn't somehow pull it out.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
I kind of wish that someday that Sega would go back to manufacturing consoles.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Right?

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Because fuck, man, the games that they're putting out just alone, you know, just the Sonic games,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
it's just kind of crap.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
I wish they would just go back and recapture the magic that they used to have.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vogniteware.com says,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It came at a weird time in gaming for me, though.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
PC gaming was strong and the PlayStation was dominating the charts,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
but lots of love for the Sega-specific titles that came out for it.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Tigerclaw says,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Dreamcast also had a built-in modem.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
When you dial into your ISP and you download some stuff from a game,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I remember Sonic Adventure has some cosmetic stuff that you can download from it.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh, yeah, I remember that because I used to play the hell out of PSO.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Blackwool said,

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
I had a friend who loved his Dreamcast and pulled out his spindle of burned games to show me how much he loved it

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
and then sighed and said it's a shame it wasn't a financial success.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Blackwolf also points out PlayStation 2 also had EA exclusives.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
So, yeah.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Kaijuto disagrees with me, saying,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
No, PlayStation 2 didn't kill the Dreamcast.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
The Sega Saturn and the PlayStation 1 killed it.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
And, and,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Bleemcast.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Remember?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Bleemcast was kind of awesome.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I do remember that.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
That's like, that's unheard of.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Imagine, like, if they had a PlayStation 3 disc or something that let you play Xbox 360 games.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh my God.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
It would be fucking ridiculous.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
That's crazy.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
You don't see that kind of shit anymore.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You really don't.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
It's amazing, though.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
You really don't.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
All right, thanks for those comments.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Again, over at live.vognetware.com.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
We will get into a little more Dreamcast reminiscing with the FUGL question of the week.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
But for now, let's fast-forward to the present.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
We have a couple weeks off to catch up on, so let's try to quickly get through.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
How is your...

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Wait, wait, hold on.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Blackwool says,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Fuck yeah, Qsar.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Top Gun.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
You guys have Qsar in Atlanta because seriously, that might help me get out there to Atlanta.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
I mean, just saying.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
We'll find out.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I didn't even know Qsar still existed.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Oh, we still got one in Concord.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
There's still one in Concord.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Still one in Vacaville.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Vacaville one sucks.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But the Concord one apparently is still pretty good.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's just it's all the way in Concord.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
I want to say our pals Spike and Jon over at Game Buoy did a Qsar thing for Spike's birthday or something.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I've played at all of the arenas in this area.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I mean, even like Bascom, which is in San Jose.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That is crap.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
But like, man, that's the problem, man.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
It's like over an hour away to go play Qsar.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
And it's just you go down there and there's no one playing except for like little kids.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
That's why I wish they had the arena back in Citrus Heights.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It sucks.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Move to Citrus Heights.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
You know, it's like, oh, sweet.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
It's like like two minutes away.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I can even play so much Qsar.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
And then it closes.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
It's so funny, too, that I used to play at that same one all the time.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Yet we didn't know each other at the time.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
You probably kicked my ass because I was terrible at Qsar.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Black Wolf in chat says we don't have any Qsars anymore, but there might be one in Atlanta.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
Keep in mind, Black Wolf lives in a suburb and says, nope, the last Qsar in Atlanta closed last year.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
A lot of them.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
All right, let's let's fast forward to the present and talk about what types of games we have been playing this week.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Or the past two weeks.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
What have you been doing?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
How was your gaming week?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I played some Final Fantasy 14.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I actually did that today.

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
My 3DS has been kind of just being used for puzzles.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
What do we do?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh, yeah, we were playing Kingdom Hearts.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
I guess not really a whole bunch of stuff.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Oh, yeah, I started Another Shepherd on Mass Effect 3.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I might have mentioned that before, but I actually played some more of it.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
And some more Sims 2.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
That's about it.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm not going to get Sims 4 until there's an expansion.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Which there will be thousands of them.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I mean, since all the content's not in the game.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I played nothing, sadly.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Two weeks off I really played nothing.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Dark Sakura?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I did remember something else I played.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Go ahead.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I started Fractal again.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Because that game's awesome.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Okay, I'm done. Sorry.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So nothing for two weeks, Logie?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah, I've been programming.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Are you qualified to talk about video games?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I am.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh, you've been programming your own game instead of playing others.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
That works.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
I got done with my editor thing and then I realized it's not going to work.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Because, yeah.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
The way I did it, it was just not going to work at all.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
So I had to go completely from scratch and redo it again.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
So actually I'm almost done with it again.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Back to where I was.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
It's just my complex math equation or whatever to rotate these vectors around a point.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
It just didn't work.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I guess the math was wrong or something.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
That's what you get for when you copy stuff off the internet without actually knowing how it works.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
So I'm actually going to go back and do it the way I was originally going to do it.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
And I think that'll work a lot better.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So I have to write that up.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
But it's pretty complex and hopefully this way works.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Because if it doesn't work this way, then I have no idea what I'm going to do.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But I think this way should be a lot more efficient.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
And then once I get this done, I can start making the game again.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Because it's just like engine, engine, engine, engine, engine stuff.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I want something that I can see.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
It's really interesting hearing you go through these growing pains though.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
It's going to be fun to go back and listen to old episodes of R.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Well, it's like anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to do it the right way anyway.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to go back and redo it.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
I rewrote my shader this weekend because it was too complex for what I needed it to do.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And it's like, ooh, I want to put all the bells and whistles in.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I didn't really need it.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
For what I'm doing with it, I just stripped out everything I didn't need out of it and redid it.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And so now I have that again.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
But, I don't know, it should be...

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Because now everything is being procedurally created.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
It's almost like I'm making Minecraft in a way.

24:58.000 --> 25:06.000
Because the way you would make a voxel game like Minecraft is pretty much the same way I'm generating the objects that you make in this editor.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Did Loki just claim to be making Minecraft? I think he did.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
I'm not making Minecraft. It's just like...

25:12.000 --> 25:19.000
It's because it's similar to the way voxel games work, so it's not exactly the same way.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Some folks in chat are going...

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
BlackWolf says, Loki's making vaporware.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Act F says, Loki nuke him forever.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
SSG100Matt says, I hope he doesn't get burned out.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Dungeon Buster says, half Loki 3.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
Okay. It's only been like six months. It hasn't even been that long yet.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
But give yourself a break once in a while. Play some games. Get some inspiration.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I'm burnt out at all though. I think it's interesting.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Good. Good.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
If it's not fun, then why would you do it?

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
Exactly. If I don't want to do it, then I won't do it. I'll take a break for a day or something.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Because there's a lot of games I have to play.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
If they put out a new expansion in Grand Theft Auto 5 or something, maybe that'd give me an excuse to play some games or something.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Or when Call of Duty Advanced Warfare comes out, I might have to play that for a bit.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, because it's not on our show roll tonight, what's up with the release date for that?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Did it get bumped again? I thought I heard it was getting bumped.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It hasn't gotten bumped yet.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
There was a rumor that one of the versions got bumped, but they're still saying it's fourth quarter.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
They'll say it's fourth quarter until it's not fourth quarter.

26:24.000 --> 26:33.000
Right now, they don't have a date nailed down yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if it got bumped.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
If anything, just because there's so much stuff coming out in November, the day that it comes out now,

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
if it came out any day in November, it's going to be really packed.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know. I hope it comes out in November.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
It'd give me an excuse to buy a next-gen system, I guess.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
I'd need a job for that, though.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Let me talk quickly about my gaming week, because I didn't play a lot a lot.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Obviously, I was away at the convention, but I did play a few things.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
On the flight, I played on the PlayStation Vita quite a bit of Dragon's Crown,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
which is a game that's on the PlayStation Vita, of course.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
It's also on PlayStation 3. It was part of the PlayStation Plus package, I think, last month or the month before.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I finally got around to playing it.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed that game, and I want to continue playing more of it.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.000
I'll probably get it for my PlayStation 3, because that's a game that I would like to play on a bigger screen,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
maybe more than the Vita, but for the flight, it worked great.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
If you don't know what this game is, it's kind of like a mash-up between something like Golden Axe,

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
like an arcade game, like Golden Axe type of thing, mixed with an RPG.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
You have a town, and you do these quests, and you go out, and you'll go to the field,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
and you go a particular path through here.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, it's neat. I enjoyed that game. It was a great way to kill a little time on the flight.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
There was that. I've been playing probably an unhealthy amount of Diablo III.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
That's really the one game I've been playing more than anything else.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
I've been playing Diablo III on not only PS4, but PC as well.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm playing both concurrently, because the PlayStation 4 one obviously just came out last week,

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
so I wanted to get a character to 70 and get my trophies and all that, right?

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
So what else happens last week? Well, not only do they release Diablo III on the PlayStation 4,

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
but they release the 2.1 patch on PC, which is not on consoles.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
So if I want to play the newest content, like some of the new maps, and most importantly,

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
a seasonal character and the seasons that are going on Diablo, I've got to play on PC.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
So even though I might have quit World of Warcraft six months ago,

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
Blizzard sure sucked me back into their universe and playing a lot of their games with Diablo III.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
So job well done.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
I bet you haven't been playing The Three Vikings.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
I have not been playing The Three Vikings, unless they have a cameo that I'm not aware of.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Only in a while.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Only in a while.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
So nothing about the new expansion or anything that they've revealed so far,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
making you interested in jumping back into WoW again?

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
I'm going to make this short. I'm actually in the beta for Warlords of Draenor on World of Warcraft,

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
and I am not enthused about what I'm seeing. I hate to say that.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
I hate to say it about a beta, something that's still in progress,

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
but I'm just not seeing enough to really kind of get me interested in the game again.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
When are we going to see an expansion for Final Fantasy XIV?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
They're still patching it pretty rarely.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
They're talking about the 2.4 patch that's going to actually bring out a new class.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
The Rogue and the Ninja are going to be in XIV.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
My next class.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
That's in a patch, and then the Shiva fight is coming,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
and they just confirmed this week that Shiva will have a move where she does a snap,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
and all the ice shatters.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And her boobs.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Yes, and boobs.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I thought that was in XIV.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
They're trying to put all the primals in XIV. They just did Ramuh in the last patch.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
They have Ifrit and Garuda, so now the last one is Shiva.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
I did make another character, by the way, so I could have it be solely a ninja.

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
I'm kind of in a lull on XIV right now. I'm just sucked into Diablo right now more than XIV.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
I kind of log into XIV, and I'm like, I don't really want to craft.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
But I know Alan's really enjoying it. Alan plays XIV all the time.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That's it, Rob. We make noobs together.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
We'll see. I'll just make a noob in Diablo.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
You make a noob in XIV, and I'll make a noob in Diablo on PC.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
We have to livestream it.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yes.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Now I'm down.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
That's our new project.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
If we're doing Diablo, we're going to do a hardcore.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
Because more people will watch if it's hardcore, because they're all waiting for the moment you die.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Because you know, in hardcore, once you die, you die. It's done. Game over.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Literally game over, start from the beginning.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Yeah, right?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Doesn't that sound like fun, Jamie?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
No.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
That might be fun.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
That sounds like piss.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I don't know if my PC would be able to run Diablo.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
By the way, I apologize to any of my coworkers who are listening to this for the first time.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
You told your folks over at the land of cubes and tech.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Locat.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
A couple.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Shout out.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Trusted people.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Where else was I? I was going to say...

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh, one other thing I checked out briefly this week.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Minecraft on the PlayStation 4 came out this week.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And so I downloaded that and checked it out.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
I only played about 30 minutes, but it is the same thing I played on 360.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
Just was slightly crisper graphics, which I know is ironic because it's Minecraft and the graphics aren't exactly at selling point.

31:35.000 --> 31:46.000
I wanted to know since, you know, because this is not this week, but it was last week since I'm assuming you got a chance to check out some more stuff on the DK2 on the Oculus.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I did. Thank you for bringing it up.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Yes, Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus to Dragon Con.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
And so I did play the DevKit 2 and the game I actually played was Vanguard V, which you've talked about previously on the show.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
So I didn't know really anything about this game.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
I don't really own an Oculus.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I don't follow it nearly as much as Bobby does.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
But every time he said, here, put this on and I'm going to press a few buttons and you're going to play a game.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Every time he's done that, I've really enjoyed the experience.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
So I'm eagerly awaiting the consumer level.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Because you have to remember, Oculus is not really for consumers right now, but it'll get there.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Just like Project Morpheus is going to get there at some point, right?

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
So I played Vanguard V, which is a game you can control completely with your head.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And it plays a lot like Rez.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Like imagine you're playing Rez.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
That's what it felt like to me.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Imagine you're playing Rez, but it's where you look that fires the little red kill.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That fires the bullets and everything.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
It was actually really fun.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
And the music is really good because I think it was Vert.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
One of those big Chiptune guys does it, yeah.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
So the music was really good too.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
The stuff that they have for the title theme, I've been playing that in my car for weeks now.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
But it's just so unlike him.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
It's like an orchestral space opera track.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
It's just fucking amazing.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
But yeah, he does music in the game.

33:03.000 --> 33:10.000
And actually they're kind of doing the external crowdfunding now.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
They have their own Vanguard V website now you can go to.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Which I didn't, just to clarify, the full game is not out.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I played, I think it's like the first level as a Kickstarter thing.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Yeah, the Kickstarter demo.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
But it was enough of a taste of the game for me.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
Where I was like, alright, if I could buy one of these devices for $250,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
although I imagine it's going to be more like $300 probably,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I'd be into a game like this.

33:35.000 --> 33:42.000
I like that it was third person, but the way that they justified that is the queue or whatever that follows.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
It's like Rez.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It's very similar to that.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It didn't take me out of the element at all.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
I definitely had that moment when I kind of took the thing off and I'm like, whoa.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Cool stuff.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah, I had a good time with that.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Let's see, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Rama says, what's Project Morpheus?

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
Did I call it the wrong thing or is he just being silly?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, I think he's just being silly.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Oh, Act F says, to be fair, the only demo is 83.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Oh, I see, because hardly anybody's been able to touch one of those things because it's only 83.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
And for the record, that game, Vanguard V, is supposed to be for the Morpheus too.

34:16.000 --> 34:25.000
He's got the dev kit stuff, so when they do get it funded, they're going to be developing it for both platforms.

34:25.000 --> 34:33.000
I did notice too that with this new kit, they have something similar to what Morpheus has with the whole fact that the camera can track your head motions.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
And I guess they do something like that now with the new Oculus too that I don't recall being there before.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
No, I wasn't there before.

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, so that was, I don't know how it played into the game I was playing, but yeah, so that was a feature.

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
Alright, so there you go, that was my gaming week. Thank you, Loki, for reminding me of one other game to give a shout out there for Vanguard V.

34:55.000 --> 35:04.000
Let's get into housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com.

35:05.000 --> 35:19.000
Also, be sure to follow us on YouTube, where the show is also posted, for you to listen to our vast archives quickly and easily on a variety of devices, because they got YouTube on everything, right?

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
So we are YouTube username OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Be sure to subscribe there.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
And a big shout out to Jason, who runs things over at the YouTube channel and makes sure things get posted in a timely manner.

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
Although they do intentionally lag one week behind. We do want to push people to the podcast first. That's kind of our bread and butter.

35:36.000 --> 35:46.000
But for those that are interested in checking out old episodes or an archive or going directly to like 1 hour 17 minutes in a previous episode, you know, YouTube is a great way to be able to do that.

35:46.000 --> 35:59.000
Alright, let's get into the news. We're going to start tonight. I'm not going to do last week's news set to Holic, because there's really one big thing that everybody's talking about from last week, and Loki's going to get into that right now.

35:59.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah, so Nintendo, they announced a brand new 3DS hardware SKU called the New 3DS, because apparently they've fired whoever comes up with clever names for their, you know, hardware.

36:14.000 --> 36:33.000
And this should, no one should be confused what the New 3DS is versus the old 3DS. I mean, I'm sure consumers, especially in, you know, North America and stuff that confuse the Wii and Wii U will have no trouble discerning 3DS and New 3DS.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah. So what is the...

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Alright, I have to say this though. Didn't Apple kind of do this, and it was fine for them?

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
No, I actually bought a new iPad.

36:44.000 --> 36:52.000
I think it's stupid. And I understand that, you know, that they have the new iPad and stuff, but it's just spec-wise it's a little bit different, but...

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
For...

36:54.000 --> 37:09.000
Plus, for me, on the iPad, the big thing that finally made me buy an iPad when I did was the retina display. Like, the retina display was such a huge jump from the prior iPad for me, and I realize everybody looks for different features, but for me, I was like, okay, I'm going to invest in one of these new iPads now.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
So, but the 3DS, this new 3DS, doesn't seem to have that big of a jump.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
It does, actually.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Does it really?

37:18.000 --> 37:31.000
Well, here's the thing. It's got quite a few additional features to it. First off, they're going to have both the XL, or LL version that's called in Japan, and the regular 3DS size.

37:32.000 --> 37:50.000
It has different buttons. It's got apparently better 3D, so the way 3D's a little bit better is the camera tracks where your face is and adjusts the 3D projection to hit your eyes so that you're not, like, losing it if you're not straight on with it.

37:50.000 --> 38:00.000
It's got this weird second, like, C-Stick nub thing that's on the right-hand side, so they're comparing it to the C-Stick that was on, like, the GameCube and stuff.

38:00.000 --> 38:13.000
It's got NFC built in. Also, the ZR and ZL buttons that were in that Circle Pad Pro, so I guess with the nub and those extra buttons, it's almost like the Circle Pad Pro's built into it now.

38:13.000 --> 38:23.000
They've got, like I said, the buttons now are colored kind of like how they were on the Famicom, or I should say the Super Famicom.

38:24.000 --> 38:34.000
Better battery. It's compatible with micro SD cards now instead of the standard SD card. You can back up your data wirelessly.

38:34.000 --> 38:41.000
One of the things I think is really cool about it is they've fucking fixed the web browser in it now, so now it supports HTML5, which...

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
Would they be able to stream this show through that? Are we doing HTML5, or is that, you know, Flash still?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You've got to ask Bobby, because I don't know.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
No, we're doing HTML5 so that it can be run on iOS.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Oh yeah, it runs on iOS, so it's HTML5.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
So yes, you would be able to listen to our show through the web browser.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Okay, well now I'm a fan.

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
So I think that's pretty cool. I mean, I'm just glad that they improved the web browser, because I mean, that's pretty sweet.

39:06.000 --> 39:14.000
And of course, the CPU's improved, and now I think it's also got more RAM or something in it.

39:14.000 --> 39:23.000
And you can also clip on different covers for it, so if you want to like, you know, put like a Pokemon cover on it or something, you can do that.

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
And it'll snap on, and then say later on you decide, oh I want, you know, a Smash Brothers cover, you can snap on a Smash Brothers one.

39:30.000 --> 39:38.000
Here's the problem though. Like with everything, you know, if it was just this cool hardware upgrade and stuff, that would be cool.

39:38.000 --> 39:50.000
But, they're going to make games that only run on the new 3DS, because it's a slightly improved CPU and stuff that these games will not run on the regular 3DS.

39:50.000 --> 39:59.000
So can you imagine, say you're buying, you know, a new game or something, a new Zelda game that runs only on the new 3DS for your 3DS.

39:59.000 --> 40:13.000
You know, I want Zelda for the 3DS, you know, I think that you're going to get confusion again, because it's just, you know, it's not like the iPad, the new iPad, where if I go on, you know, the iOS store, I know all that shit works with my iPad.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
You know, whether I have one iPad or the other iPad, it's going to just work.

40:19.000 --> 40:31.000
Technically you could run into issues with things that you use, because at some point you aren't able to use the old iOS systems anymore on old devices.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
Very, very early ones are the only ones excluded.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Right. In the iPad world right now, right. But the phones, certainly, I don't think the 3G.

40:41.000 --> 40:51.000
I don't know if you've actually read up on the iOS 8 stuff, the stuff that came out of the developers conference. It's supposed to go, I think, as low as the 4S.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Okay.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
And that's, we're looking three years back, four years.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
I don't have an iPad touch and they stopped supporting it.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
No.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Or iPad touch, I'm sorry.

41:03.000 --> 41:12.000
There's a lot I want to say about this 3DS thing. Okay. A, did they announce this for the US yet? Or were they going off the Japanese announcement?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
We're just going off the Japanese announcements right now.

41:14.000 --> 41:23.000
So they could change the name for the US. They could. It could still be a 3DSi or something. They might still change the name here, right?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I don't think that they will.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
But you don't know that they won't either.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
I would be very surprised if they changed the name. I don't think that they will.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
They've never changed system names except for Famicon.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
The only difference you're going to see is it's going to be new. The only difference you're going to see is a new 3DS XL and not LL.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
The only difference is a descriptive term.

41:44.000 --> 41:51.000
Yep. DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS. I mean, they have been naming them differently every time, so I don't see why they wouldn't.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
But to be fair, they did it in Japan too.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
But I'm talking about from Japan to the US.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Right.

41:56.000 --> 42:02.000
Where there have been very minor changes as far as what comes out of there versus what comes out of here.

42:02.000 --> 42:15.000
Aside from the Famicon and Super Famicon and the Super Nintendo and Nintendo, the only difference we've had naming-wise would probably be the XL and LL. That's really the only differences we've seen.

42:16.000 --> 42:23.000
And now the only game that they've announced so far that will only work on new 3DS that will not work on old 3DS is Xenoblade.

42:23.000 --> 42:31.000
But it's simply a port of the Wii game that Nintendo gimped the sales up from the beginning by only selling it through two retailers, one of them being themselves, right?

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
And that they waited far too long to release.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
So essentially they're giving Xenoblade a second go because they realized they fucked up the first time. My opinion.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
But that's the only game. It's a port of a game that's been out for a while. So I'm not convinced I need one still.

42:49.000 --> 42:58.000
This would be great if maybe I didn't have a 3DS yet or I didn't have a 3DS XL or whatever. I would be like, okay, I can get this new one.

42:58.000 --> 43:07.000
But since I just bought that Zelda 3DS XL not that long ago, I'm not really interested in this until maybe they announce a few more of these must-have games that will only work on the new.

43:07.000 --> 43:17.000
Well, I'm trying to understand this. Why the hardware refresh again? I mean, I don't think 3DS sales are tanking. I mean, they're doing really well.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
I don't understand why they need to refresh the hardware again.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
A lot of handheld companies do it. Apple does it every year. Samsung does it every year. They all do it every year.

43:26.000 --> 43:35.000
I mean, they're definitely not feeling the pressure to compete against Vita. If they were feeling the pressure to compete against Vita, they would probably support Unity or something.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
I think they're competing against the iPhone way before they're competing against the Vita.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
In my opinion. I don't know. It's just kind of...

43:45.000 --> 43:51.000
Okay, and then here's my tinfoil hat thing. Loki, feel free to shoot a hole through this theory, but it's something I've been stewing on a little bit.

43:51.000 --> 43:58.000
Because I know in prior weeks on this program we had the whole speculation about the trademarks that were filed about the...

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
And I don't remember what they called it, but it was basically the Nintendo Synergy or something where...

44:04.000 --> 44:11.000
And I don't remember what the hell it was called, but it was basically that they were trying to bring the Wii U and the 3DS more in parity.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Or it was Nintendo's next console maybe, not even just the Wii U, but whatever Nintendo's planning next.

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
And the 3DS a little bit more in line with each other. That they're trying to maybe develop one game for both things and that whole thing.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
Could it be that this new 3DS is being launched with the souped up things and the new buttons because...

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
Okay, here's Crazy Rob talking. It will function as a Wii U gamepad.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I don't think so.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Why not?

44:38.000 --> 44:50.000
Why not? Because first off, the controls on it aren't going to be close enough to the way they have on the Wii U.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I mean, I guess they could do that.

44:52.000 --> 45:02.000
But I've always been thinking that it's not going to necessarily function as a Wii U gamepad, but that the Wii U would support 3DS titles instead.

45:02.000 --> 45:09.000
That you would see 3DS titles on the Wii U since the gamepad could function as the bottom screen and the TV would function as the top screen.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
So I don't know if they're going to do that.

45:11.000 --> 45:18.000
Honestly though, if it can support Wii looking Xenoblade or something like that.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
If it can support that, that's kind of a Wii level game.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
That's kind of cool if they could...

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
It is a Wii level game.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Yeah, it is a Wii level game, but I don't know.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
It would make more sense if this was along the lines of the Wii or something.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Whether, oh, okay, we're developing a game or making games for both systems.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
The handheld doesn't have to process all the data.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
It only has to read the feed coming in from the near broadcast field thing that comes in from the Wii U.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
It doesn't have to actually process the data.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
Well, the NFC stuff is for the fucking Amiibo figures. That's all that's for.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
That's not for anything else. That's just that shit.

45:54.000 --> 46:03.000
Okay, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Kazuto says they have a new 3DS because everyone cried for two thumbsticks and more console-like. That's why.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
But what games really support that?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, exactly.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
It's not like we have this barrage of...

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
I don't even know where to get one of those 3DS control pad pros anymore.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Those control pad...

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
There's Kid Icarus and some Resident Evil games.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, it was Resident Evil Revelations, Kid Icarus, and Monster Hunter were the only games.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Is Smash Brothers going to use it?

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
Smash Brothers will use the C-Stick, yes.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Maybe that's why.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Or it can as an option.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Alright.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
actdeft agrees with you, Loki. He doesn't think so either as far as what I was suggesting.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
But Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob, actually.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
So, some folks thinking there might be something there.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Dark Tetsuya says, we won't get the new 3DS until 2015, I heard.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Of course. You're not going to get it this year.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
I imagine this is a holiday 2015 thing, maybe?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I don't know if it would be holiday.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
That does seem far out, doesn't it?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
It could be like March.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
It could be March. Maybe just before the end of the financials or something.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
I just...

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
Well, maybe that's why they're doing it, to try and pad the financials a little bit.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
I would think that they would need a game that really shows the system off.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Once again, though, I still don't understand.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
They're literally throwing out SKUs left and right.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
It's like they're just throwing everything out there to see what sticks.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Like, oh, seriously.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
They're like, oh, people don't want 3D graphics, so we got the 2DS.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
Unless that 2DS was just because, oh, people think they're going to go blind with 3D.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
These 3D displays are going to make you go blind or something.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
Yes, because the 3D outside of those displays make me go blind, too.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The 2DS was a Pokemon system, plain and simple.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
I mean, I still don't understand what the point is, but it's like, okay, we don't want 3D.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
We do want 3D.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
It's like they have so many SKUs out there now, but at the same time, it's like this isn't the system that needs help.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
The Wii U needs help.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Help the Wii U.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
3DS is fine.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
You're doing great with the 3DS already.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Are they?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I think they are, yes.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
I don't think that they're having a problem selling these systems.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
There's plenty of games coming out for it.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
Most of the publishers out there support the system because it's rocking.

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
It's just, I don't know, like are they trying to go more hardcore with this?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I mean, they're trying to like get the hardcore crowd.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Are they thinking that's what's happening is that the hardcore crowd's buying Vita's?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Because I can tell you what's happening with the Vita's.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Nobody's buying the Vita's.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
You know what's happening with the hardcore crowd?

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
They have too much time playing hardcore games on consoles and PCs.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
That's why they're not buying a 3DS.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
That's why I wouldn't buy a 3DS, because I don't have enough time to play a 3DS and console and PC.

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
I agree to a point that I would rather see a Xenoblade reimagining or reconfiguring on the Wii U,

48:43.000 --> 48:49.000
but then again, there is a game coming from the same developers in 2015, so we know that.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
I'm going to our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
Kaijuto says Monster Hunter is a huge game, which I believe was in response to what the other circle pad used for.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
It's a huge game in Japan.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
Well, but the Japanese market is important, and where has this 3DS only been announced so far? In Japan.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
So he could be onto something there, because this is upgrading for a Monster Hunter.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Because the last Monster Hunter game didn't sell systems.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Not here.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
No, not here. It did not sell systems.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
And any Monster Hunter game that's come out here hasn't really sold systems.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So I just...

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I don't think that's really...

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
I mean, yeah, it's a good game, but it's just not as big over in North America.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
It's just, in Japan it does really well.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
And it's too bad, because it looks like a fun game.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
It's just, you know, it's not something that's super mainstream, I guess.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
All right. Well, we could go on and on with this topic.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I'll just quickly say this.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
AkumaJP in chat says, not true, Loki.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Vita is not selling well there, because no good game there.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
There's a ton of games coming out in Japan.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
You know, the Vita, the interesting thing about the Vita...

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Didn't he say good games?

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Well, I just talked about one that I thought was pretty good at the top of the show, Dragon's Crown.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I thought that was a good game, and it's available on the Vita.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
However, it's also available on the PlayStation 3.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
And a lot of the Vita stuff is ports of PS3 and 4 stuff.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
It's really to have Sony-branded crap with you wherever you go.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
It's kind of where the Vita's at right now.

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
But, to their credit, at least that stuff, the cross saves work just fine, which is fantastic.

50:24.000 --> 50:35.000
And Nintendo, come on, that would be fantastic if you put out Mario Kart 8 on the 3DS and Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U and had the saves go back and forth.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That would be fantastic.

50:37.000 --> 50:45.000
I would love to see something like that, but honestly, I think they're just going to need a new console to come out.

50:45.000 --> 50:52.000
And unfortunately, I don't think that whatever new console does come out is still going to be up to the specs of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
I just wish that they would put something out that was equal to that.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Then we can start talking about, you know, it wouldn't be so hard developing games for them.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
It would be pretty easy to port shit over.

51:05.000 --> 51:15.000
And if they're going to do that, they need to do it soon, because the problem with the Wii U is that, great, you launch something that has Xbox 360 specs a year before you're already dwarfed.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
You know what I mean?

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
So if they're going to bring something out in parity with Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it has to happen sooner rather than later.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Because they wanted to keep the price down because they thought they were going to win on price.

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
And unfortunately, yeah, you could win on price, but you also have specs of the system from last generation.

51:32.000 --> 51:42.000
And so now, you know, people are just going to buy that system that has a ton of games for it versus your new system that clearly doesn't have a ton of games for it.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
All right. Well, good discussion, you guys.

51:44.000 --> 51:53.000
But just in the interest of time and the fact that it's already 7 o'clock, I want to just table the other new 3DS discussion to our mailbag or possibly phone calls later in the show.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Again, you can always email us with your thoughts.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Meanwhile, I want to move into other news, though, from this week.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
Sony did a little press conference over in Japan where they announced some upcoming features for the PlayStation 4.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
A PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.0, one of the big things they're going to unveil with that is themes.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
So you know how the PlayStation 3 had a theme in the operating system?

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
Well, now if you are sick of the Sony Blue that is on the PlayStation 4, you can change that to a variety of different themes that will be available.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
And I'm sure they'll sell some and some will be free with PlayStation Plus and, you know, so on and so on.

52:29.000 --> 52:38.000
Toro and Kuro were featured, these Japanese characters, a little more famous for PlayStation Japan, were featured in one particular theme that was demoed during the presentation.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
So that's pretty cool that that's going to be happening.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
I would like to see more of being able to rearrange some of the shit on the crossbar.

52:47.000 --> 52:59.000
Like, I need to be able to arrange my games differently because I have so much crap on PlayStation 4 now thanks to all the PlayStation Plus and the fact that anything you put a disc in for becomes an icon on your bar.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Like, I could scroll to the right forever for things.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Weren't they doing folders or something like that?

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
If that was announced that I missed it, I would love that, though.

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
I don't remember if that was a hopeful feature or if that was, I thought, I'm going to check this out.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
I thought they had folders coming, like, in an update or something like that.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
That would be fantastic.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Oh, that's what it was.

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
It was a new, it was a PlayStation 4 user interface design. They apparently leaked.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
It says users will get folders to organize games and apps.

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
But I don't remember if that was faked or not. I can't remember if that was the case or if it was real.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
But that'd be cool if you had folders.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, floor.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
Some other big game announcements coming out of this news announcement that Sony did over in Japan.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
Disgaea 5 will be hitting the PlayStation 4 in 2015 in Japan.

54:01.000 --> 54:09.000
Again, this isn't confirmed for the US. I would imagine it's likely here, but who knows if that means holiday 2015 or later or who knows what.

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
So that is pretty cool that that's happening. A lot of people will be throwing printies.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
Persona 5 also going to be coming to the PlayStation 4.

54:18.000 --> 54:25.000
Now, Persona 5, I believe, had already been announced for PS3, but they will be bringing a version out on PlayStation 4 as well.

54:25.000 --> 54:31.000
Because PlayStation 4 has been selling pretty well. A lot of people have upgraded. It makes sense for them to release on PlayStation 4.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
So Persona fans, I'm sure, are very happy about that.

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
And Dark Sakura, I know you're a fan of this series. Not everybody has necessarily played these games.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
But over in Japan, there will be a new game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in the Ys series.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Ys.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Not to be confused with wise.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Ys.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
But a lot of people say wise.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
And they're wrong. It's Ys.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
So that will be happening. This all, again, coming out of the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2014 press event.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
It will be coming out in the 2015 window for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Again, that's Japan.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Tokyo Game Shows this week, right?

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
This week or next week. I don't remember. I thought it was one more week.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I think it's this week.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
It could be. Akuma's in chat. He should know.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
I'm just curious to see if The Last Guardian's gonna be there.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Ah, don't hold your breath.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
It might be this week because I know Square Enix unveiled their lineup for Tokyo Game Show and Final Fantasy XV is not there.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
There's supposed to be a Konami panel where they're showing off...

55:30.000 --> 55:35.000
Well, it said more PT stuff, but I don't think they would show that same demo that's been out forever.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
I mean, hopefully that means we're gonna see more Silent Hill stuff.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
AkumaJP says next week for Tokyo Game Show.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Okay.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
So there you go.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

55:47.000 --> 55:53.000
Well, we've been focusing on the other two. How about a little bit of attention for Microsoft?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Why not?

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
Well, they are tweaking the Xbox Live reward program to add some different features.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.000
And one of this right now is ways to earn credits for what you buy or what you've done.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
This is for Xbox One and Xbox 360.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
They have a star system that will give you rebates on your purchases.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
You have to spend a lot of money there to get it to work.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
To get one star, you have to spend $150 annually.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
And then that gives you a 1% rebate.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
And you can get up to 5% through earning stars.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
You do this through your Live Gold.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
You do this, you know, like I said, through buying stuff.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
But Live Gold members will have that doubled.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
The typical way, like I said, is making purchases.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
There will be different promotions open that, like, you buy certain things.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
You get a certain amount of credit.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
And then there will also be surveys monthly and referring friends to the program.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.000
Gold members will earn 1,000 credits by just downloading and playing one of the free games with Gold.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
Releases for 10 hours. That's an example.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
There's a lot of information on it.

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
Actually, through the Xbox Live rewards website at rewards.xbox.com.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
$150 sure seems like a lot to spend in a year.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
But at the same time...

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
In a year? That's three games?

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah, that's where I'm having trouble.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I'm sure there's people sitting there going, Rob, you're an idiot.

57:19.000 --> 57:25.000
But it's because I don't buy a lot of my disc-based games, for lack of a better term, digitally.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
But I can see where they're trying to give incentive now for people to do that.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
Like, the Wii U had done this too with the whole Premium Bundle that they had.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Unless you get a registration code for buying physical copies.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
That would be cool, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
And the reason why, and we've talked about this on the show before,

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
is that you've got to give value to the digital games for the equity you lose in the physical games.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Of being able to sell the game back.

57:50.000 --> 57:56.000
And Steam does this very well by bargain basementing the digital price.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
And so they say, hey, it's ten bucks over here.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Exactly, that's my thing.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
A lot of these new release games that come out digitally are the same damn price as...

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And there's nothing extra with it.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
Here's what's... Well, and I know we'll get into it a little later in the show,

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
but I think Destiny in some ways, and I know we're going to get into it later,

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
but one thing they're doing with the collector's edition, they're trying to sell that digitally too.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
You know, they're really pushing the digital angle.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And I think this is why, is because they're trying...

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
This is the creative way to get out the resale market.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
My problem with digital distribution in general is that, I mean, you think about it this way.

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
You have very little in the cost of advertising, packaging, shipping.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
The companies are saving a lot of money, but they're not cutting the prices on the content.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Exactly.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
And I don't even think that adding incentive like this for buying the content at full price is going to be enough.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
There has to be another incentive, and that's where Steam is succeeding with that.

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
Because they are making just enough overhead, I think, that they're turning an okay profit for their end of things.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
But they're also, I think, being, they get their revenue in other ways as well.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
Packaging though, packaging for games is so damn cheap.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
It's not, it's just really cheap.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
But it's still money.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
It's a couple bucks, but seriously though, like marketing funds, yeah, that's expensive.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
They spend several million dollars.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
I think it's a hundred million dollars they're spending on just marketing Destiny.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
What we heard about that was, it's a half billion dollar game, isn't it?

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
Probably with marketing, yeah, throwing in there, it's probably, yeah, that's about right.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Yeah, I mean, again with the whole digital.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
You know where they're doing well with digital, it seems though.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
You know what they're doing smartly, and what Sony and Microsoft have both done, and I believe Nintendo has done this as well,

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
very smart to push the games digitally, is the whole pre-download and be able to play the game at 12.01 AM.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Pre-load or whatever they call it, you know what I mean?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I'm just trying to make my, so basically you get to download it and it activates right at release.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Right, and this is a big thing Destiny's doing, is that if you download the game,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
they are really buying into the instant gratification needs of the gaming community, which be real,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
there's a lot of people in the gaming community that need that instant gratification.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I want to play it now.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They want it.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Right.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And they're too used to getting their way.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And you know what would help doing that is pre-order DLC.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Stop doing this fucking retailer exclusive pre-order DLC and make that digital pre-order DLC.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
No, don't encourage them.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I would like to tell the entire gaming community right now,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
game makers are not, you're not entitled to your game now. End of story.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But at the same time, well, I, but I know people who really love the digital thing.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Good for them. Let them take advantage of it and let them read through whatever benefits there are from it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You know, but if you want to push that, you need to make it more attractive.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And I don't think having the game O release, like when I'm going to be awake for an hour to play it,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
or the average person is going to be awake for an hour to play it before they have to go to work the next day.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You know, that's nothing that that's, that's bread, you know, little, here's a few crumbs.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Thank you, sir. May I have another, whatever.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
All I know is I've got money I got to spend on my Xbox account.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So I'm probably gonna end up buying destiny just because I've got to spend that money.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So it doesn't expire.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You can run the VoG network crew on the Microsoft platforms because Bobby me.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
No, no. Travis is on Microsoft as well.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So you and Travis will be on the Microsoft site.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I do want the PlayStation version.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, I mean, that's what it's like me and Diablo.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
If only I had a way to transfer my Xbox money onto my PlayStation account, it would just be fantastic.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Let's talk about my sick problem with Mass Effect.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
So should we remind everybody that I own the trilogy for Mass Effect on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
The only thing I don't have is Mass Effect three on the Wii U and the minute that sick puppy.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Well, I'll probably when it's $20 in a bargain bin, I'll probably have that too.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Let's be real.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I had zero need for it on another system.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We'll also have it on PlayStation four whenever they do an HD or remix.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Bring it the fuck on.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I want multiplayer Mass Effect on PlayStation four so fucking bad.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Did you hear about the Dragon Age Inquisition multiplayer supposed to be similar to Mass Effect?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yes.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And I am excited.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I was not really like foaming at the mouth over Dragon Age like Alan and Shane were.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But now that like I'm hearing about all this other stuff, I'm like, now I'm going to fucking play Dragon Age two.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Rob, I put in my order for it already for the deluxe edition.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Of course you did.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Was there any ever any doubt?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's except Shane and I were having a chat because we're both at low cat about like romance options.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And everybody that I wanted to romance is not an option.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Namely, very Vivian and Morgan.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yeah, but you'll be on the PC hackers going to hack.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You'll be able to romance whoever you want within months.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
OK, then tell me why you can't.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You'll be able to romance Paris.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm going to put Garris in my team and then I'll reinvent my hawk on Dragon Age.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
That would be awesome.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
They can put Thomas the Train in Skyrim.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
They can put Garris in Dragon Age.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Go romance yourself.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
All right.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Let's move on.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Loki, what do you got?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
This is kind of cool.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
This is a brand new kind of VR headset powered by Oculus.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It's the Samsung Gear VR headset.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And what's kind of cool about this is that it actually uses the Galaxy Note 4.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And it's this thing that it plugs into basically that makes it into almost like an Oculus Rift.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
More like the dev kit one, though, because it doesn't have the actual spatial tracking.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But still pretty cool.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And they've got a lot of people already making games for it, including they even showed off like a VR version of Temple Run.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So I'm kind of on it.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But yeah, I can't afford a new phone right now, but looks cool.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And of course, it would be separate on top of the phone, which I'm guessing would be kind of expensive on top.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But it's supposed to be out later this year.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So we'll see.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
They haven't announced pricing or when exactly we're going to see it yet.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
But I don't know.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It's kind of exciting that we're seeing a lot of stuff out now.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And it's actually a consumer piece.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So looking forward to it.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Bobby talked about this a lot on his show tonight.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The Bobby Blackwell show, which is on before us at vognetwork.com.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And he had been talking about, and I kind of agree with this, that it's going to be good that this is going to establish like a baseline kind of product.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Where things can be optimized for this.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Does that make sense?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So that's kind of exciting.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's kind of interesting to see VR on cell phones, I guess.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
If that makes sense.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Because this is going to be running on like a cell phone platform.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So the thing that I like that's kind of cool about it is it is wireless.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And one of the things I always worry with with the Oculus Rift is I have a laptop.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It's a gaming laptop, I guess, if you will.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But gaming laptops aren't exactly the same as a gaming PC.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It's not spec-wise the most powerful thing on earth.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And a lot of the games I can't run in high.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's kind of a medium settings based PC, if you will.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So I don't know how well the Oculus Rift would run on my laptop.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But something like this that uses the phone to power it might be kind of cool.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Or something like Project Morpheus, which is supposed to have something externally,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
doing a lot of the computation for it would be fantastic.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I hope that when the Oculus Rift does come out that we have something like that.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Like Project Morpheus where it has something doing some extra computation

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
so that people like me that don't have the most powerful system ever

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
can still run it rather well.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
All right. Can we go back to a previous topic real quick here before we get into the next story?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Because you bought it.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Let's get into I need to play something here before we do the next segment here.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I know this is a little early.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I need to give an F.U. of the week to act deft in chat.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Don't let him act deft for your weakness.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Act deft during Loki reading that last article there linked me on Amazon.com

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
to Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U for 13 bucks. 13 bucks.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It'll be here on Wednesday.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Rob. Rob. Stand up.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I'm standing.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Come here.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I'm coming over.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Hand.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Here's my hand.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Why did you slap my hand?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Bad Rob.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
No. No.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Bad.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Says the lady who bought a video.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Bad consumer whore.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No. Says the lady who bought a video game with a fucking dish.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
No. I will not have this fuckery.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Technically Dan bought it. For me.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I will not have this fuckery because guess what?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It also had a clock.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Guess what?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Come Wednesday I own every release of Mass Effect there has been.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You're still naughty.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
BioWare just put your cock in my mouth.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Seriously.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Rob. Rob is a bottom for Mass Effect.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That's not true. Whatever you read on the bathroom stall is not true.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Oh my god. I cannot believe I just fucking bought it.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I can.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Or.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Alex in chat going are you fucking serious right now?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Rob is a consumer whore.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You know you probably could have gotten that used somewhere like for a lot less than 13 dollars.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Yeah.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
On top of that it's actually supposed to be not like very great.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Because it like cuts out so many of the different options.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
That like you have no option to save the council.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You like.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's just all kinds of missing stuff.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It was really strange when they gave you the option to romance Mario.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I just didn't understand why they had to throw that into that version of the game.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
But there it was.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
No. Rob doesn't do the Garris romance right?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You always romance Caden.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I always romance Caden.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Okay. Then you have to make me a promise in this one.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Oh god. What?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You're going to romance Steve.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't want to be some dude's rebound.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You're. It won't be the rebound.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But you have to do this for me.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Alright. Fine. Fine. I'll do it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Your first play through you romance Steve.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
For Dark Sakura I will romance Cortez.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Cortez.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Corteshep. I don't know. I don't know how you.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Sheptez.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Alright.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I will call it Sheptez.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Now. Now Alan is. Alan is giving me a mini lecture in chat right now.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And the story simulator to set up your career is missing hella shit.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Like Dark Sakura said.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Don't sit there and tell me you are not morbidly curious.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
That you don't have an ounce of morbid curiosity.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I've seen it.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
The one cool thing is that whole map thing on the thing.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's fun.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You know what?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
What?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I did that with my PC by calling it the internet.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And I want to play multiplayer.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Is anybody playing Mass Effect 3 on Wii U multiplayer?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Echo. Echo.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Mass Effect. Mass Effect. Mass Effect.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Wii. Wii. Wii.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Rob.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Rob.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I can't believe. It was 13 bucks.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Rob.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Give me a break. What?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
You know what else you can get for 13 bucks?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Uh. Lunch.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Really bad heroin.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
But you don't see people going out and getting really bad heroin.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
This is really bad heroin for him.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I can't. Is there anybody out there?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Is there anybody out there who says, you know what, Rob?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Good job.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Is there anybody out there who says, Rob?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Rob, the entire internet at this moment is judging you.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And just think of how much more judgment will go during the podcast.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
But you brought the Wii version.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I'm gonna say something.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It's a special edition.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Like as in special bus.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Dark Sakura could be a lot worse.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Cause I'm not a woman.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Right now in gaming.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Alright. You know what?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Seriously. Enough with you.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I am so tired of hearing about like, you know.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Yes. Guess what?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
There's dicks on the internet.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Both physically, you know, literally and metaphorically.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Okay.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Did we just start playing games on the internet?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Do we not know that there's people out there that will do crazy, stupid shit when they're anonymous?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Really?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Are you at all surprised that this is happening?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Because I'm not at all surprised at all that this is happening.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
There actually is a study out about mental illness and anonymous bashing of other people.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
That they are technically sociopaths.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
For the record, it's all straight up fuckery.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
But that's why I had to have a laugh at its expense.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
So.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
By the way.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
What?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Bitch.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Let's see.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, good job Rob. Thank you.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And no one can call me a whore for it because I do not have the Garris moe pillow.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
There you go.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Alright. There we go.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Thank god.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Alright.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I want to know where Shane is during all of this.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Sleeping.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Alright.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I need some judgement in here.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Alright.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Alright.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Well, here's a console I will not be able to buy Mass Effect on because it doesn't exist.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
On the Ouya.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yes, the Ouya is still out there selling systems.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Actually, you know when the Ouya came to GamerX, they were showing off some pretty interesting

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
looking things on the Ouya.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
The rabbit game.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
A lot of that stuff looked really cool.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I know the guys over at GamerX and gals and everybody over at GamerX are really pushing

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
the read only memories thing and that's an Ouya thing.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
But maybe the Ouya is going to become something a little different because the Ouya, apparently,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
looking to be acquired.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Currently in talks with Google, Amazon, and some Chinese companies including Tencent,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
who owns Riot Games, by the way.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
This comes from some sources.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
The ever present sources with ReCode.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
No formal offers on the table yet, but we know YouTube's got a billion dollars to spend.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So, who knows?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Anything's possible.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That'll be interesting if the Ouya does get acquired by somebody else.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That'd be very interesting if somebody like Google or Amazon got it.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I mean, I know Amazon just spent a lot of money with Twitch, so maybe they're a little

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
bit, and they're trying to do their whole thing with Amazon Fire and all that too, so

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
maybe they're a little bit less of a contender.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But Google, it'd be very interesting if Google walked out of this whole thing with the Ouya.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Could be interesting.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Really?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Why would they do that?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Because of the brand recognition that Ouya brings?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I mean, because I'm just thinking like, you know, a company like Google that seems to

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
be pretty innovative, that they could probably whip out their own fucking console in like

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
two seconds without needing the purchase.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Funny you say that, because didn't they put out the Google TV thing?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
That little USB stick or that thingy that you just plug in the TV and it's supposed

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
to do all the streaming and all that?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah, the Chromecast.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Okay, thank you, the Chromecast.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
That's what I'm trying to think of.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
What sold more?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Ouya's or Chromecast?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I have a Chromecast.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Do you really?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yes, I do.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I don't even have one.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What sold more?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Actually, it's super awesome.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Well, considering that the Chromecast came out way after the Ouya.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It was 30 bucks.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I probably think the Chromecast sold more.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there as a question, because maybe you're asking

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
like, what could Google do with Ouya, and maybe something similar to a more robust type of

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Chromecast.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
They've got those, though.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
They've got like, the GameStick was supposed to be very similar to that, and they've got

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
so many of these, you know, device, Android device on HDMI stick things.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I just don't see them wanting to buy this.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I mean, you want to hear something funny?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I could imagine, you know, what if GameStop bought this?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Because, you know, they're looking, they want a gaming platform.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Can you imagine?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I could see them doing that.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Don't say that, don't say that.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a code man jumping into

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
the Mass Effect 3 debate a little late, but says, had to come into chat real quick to

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
tell Rob I bought it this morning.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
High five, bro.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
High five.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And as you're, you know, you're high fives echo the vast nothingness that is the people

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
playing on Mass Effect 3 online on the Nintendo network.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It's like, dude, I'm getting my party cool because you're the only one playing.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Hey, I will play, Cody and I will be the two people playing on Wii U.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
It's fine.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I don't know, maybe you could, you know, beg George to play too.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
There you go.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
We'll have it, the old stuff's going to be cool again.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Let's see, folks in chat seem to think the Chromecast probably sold better.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Mega Man X 400, our buddy from Video Game Realness.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Yeah, thank you, that's right.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Chromecast sold more hands down.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I completely forgot about Android TV, yes, so there.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Don't need fucking, you know, Ouya.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
This whole, this is all speculation and tinfoil happening.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
If Google buys it, could they call it the Ouya?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I'm making a great marketing campaign.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Ouya!

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
What's it going to do?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
It's going to Ouya.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And this is why Rob is not a marketing...

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Download porn, it's a Ouya.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You know what we use our Chromecast for, by the way?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Porn?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Watching, no, watching endless, endless streams of video game playthroughs.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Oh, oh, I almost forgot, going way back to the new 3DS.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
The new 3DS, parental locked, unless you pay money to unlock it.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Shut the fuck up, where did you hear that?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's parental locked, it's not a lot of money, it requires about 60 cents to unlock it.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But it's parental locked when you get it, you have to pay money in order to unlock it.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Is that like just a credit card check or something?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Well, they charge you 60 cents and then they don't give you that money back.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
So I would, I guess if you want to call that a credit card check, I'd call that as a micro transaction.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But that was something that they did, yeah.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Because, you know, those HTML5 web browsers, those are all compatible with all those porn sites out there.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Soccer, one more story before release dates.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Well, okay, you know how we have been going on and on about the Nut Neutrality thing going on,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and how it's a load of bullshit, and how different companies are going to be able to throttle our connection.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Well, on September 10th, there's actually a big protest going on by a group called Fight for the Future.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And a lot of other major sites and companies will be included on this one.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000
What they're going to do is they're going to show people what the internet might look like

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
if the FCC makes the changes that it wants to make.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Basically, Tom Wheeler, who's the chairman of the FCC, proposed changes that would make it okay

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
for the service providers to charge content for, you know, charge for faster and better access.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
The fast lanes. So basically, there is, there's going to be, now it's not going to change the speed or anything,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
they're not going to try to throttle their own websites.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000
But what they're going to do is start popping up things that look like rainbow wheels, or loading symbols,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
or, you know, make, just basically give you an idea of what the web's going to look like,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
how inconvenient and messy things are going to be.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It's also including Etsy, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Wordpress, Vimeo, Reddit, Mozilla, Imgur,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
is it Imgur or Imgur? Anyway.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Meetup, Cheeseburger, Namecheap, BitTorrent, Gandhi.net, Startpage, Boing Boing, and Dowola.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Some of them I haven't heard of.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000
We'll be also with 35 advocacy organizations and other activists to show what this is going to be looking at.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
They're going to basically put messages on there with an infinitely spinning site loading icon,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000
or the wheel of death, to symbolize what the web would look like without net neutrality.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Just alert, basically, it's basically like the equivalent of standing out on the street holding signs.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's going to be on the sites that you look at.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
This is a good way to kind of bring awareness to this.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I think a lot of plugged in people I like to think already know about this,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
but hopefully some of the sites participating are things that maybe are sites that people check

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
that aren't necessarily going to be advocacy sort of things like, I don't know, like news websites,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
things that people, like CNN and things like that, but I don't know.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But it being on Etsy and Kickstarter, right there, though, those are pretty good.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Yeah, those are pretty good. How about Pinterest? Can we get on Pinterest?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You know what would be funny is that if Pinterest actually changed their little pinnet icon temporarily

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
to just a spinning wheel or an X, you know.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Well, just a reminder, guys, if you do not like the idea of net neutrality, write some letters,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
call Congress people, vote, vote, vote, vote.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Actually, if you do like the idea of net neutrality, then you would probably do.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Did I say it backwards?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I did say it backwards, so thank you, Loki.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
If you support me buying a dictionary, vote, vote, vote.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000
If you support a free and equal internet for all people who are basically all on the same type of connection

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
unless you're one of those poor people in the mountains who has dial-up, they exist.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Yeah, sure. Alaska is a state.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Write Congress, write your local representatives,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and make sure that you continue adding to the millions of others who have written into the FCC protesting this.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Make your voice heard, and I'd say hit them where it hurts.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
If, you know, I'd say, hey, especially if you're a campaign contributor,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
say I'm going to withdraw all of my campaign support until you turn this around.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Because the reason why FCC is letting this through is because they're being paid.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
They're plain and simple.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Campaign donations coming from Comcast, Time Warner, any of these companies,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
so that they will get the reaction out of the government that they need to lend their pockets.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
All right.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
End of story.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Before we get to the release dates, I just want to point this out because I just got a picture from Brad.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's a picture of Ouya. This is our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It's a picture of his Ouya sitting on the desk, and he replied to me and he said,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
hey, don't knock the Ouya. This is my desk right now.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
So I replied, hot Ouya shot.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out in a store near you.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
This week we have Destiny coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And if you're not into, you know, massive space, you know, epic shooter games, then there's hockey for you.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
NHL 15 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Also an ultimate edition of those as well if you want the extra credits for building your ultimate team.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
That's it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
All right. I guess not a lot of people want to go up against Destiny, eh?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Nope.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Nope.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Hey, guess what?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Destiny is a thing in Japan as well.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
September 11th is the release out over there because they get games on different days.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Also the DualShock 4 in white is also coming out in Japan to kind of celebrate that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So check that out on the PlayStation 4.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
The Xbox One is now out in Japan.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That happened while we were out.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But no releases to note right now for the Xbox One in Japan for this week because they just obviously released it out there.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So they kind of did all the launch games already.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
PlayStation 3 will get Destiny this week as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo with Power Up Kit.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
That is a price reduction actually.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
That's going into the best series along with Sangokushi 12.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
New games on the PlayStation 3 include Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Midstorm Revolution.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Because, you know, you got to have a Naruto game.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It is a day of the week ending in Y.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Eiyu Densetsu Sen no Kiseke 2 comes out in regular and limited drama CD bundle set.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Oops.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
That's the 25th.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Sorry, I got ahead of myself.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Well, there you go.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
A little preview of what's to come in two weeks.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
On the Xbox 360, Naruto Shippuden is out this week as well.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
On the Wii U, nothing until the 20th, but the 20th is Bayonetta 2.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So that's a really big release for the Wii U.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:30.000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, on the 11th, Chain Chronicle 5, Criminal Girls Invitation and Sangokushi 12 gets a price reduction there.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Those last two games, price reduction games on the Vita.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Lastly but not leastly, the Nintendo 3DS.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Dairanto Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, September 13th.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Oh my God, I did not realize it was that soon.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
No wonder, my people that, my friends that own Japanese 3DSes, because you know the whole stupid thing is region locked, right?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
No wonder they're so excited.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
That is coming out, like, this week.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Holy crap.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
We're going to know a lot more about this game this week.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
We'll find out if it's true that the Duck Hunt dogs in the game are not.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It's pretty cool.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'm looking forward to that being released over here.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Alright, last but not leastly, the UK, Dar Sakura.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
On the 9th, Destiny.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And on the 11th, Train Fever for Mac.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That's it.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
They're essentially the same game.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Destiny and Train Fever.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before the classic game of the week.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Alright, speaking of Destiny.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
If you are inclined, you can purchase that digitally and guess what?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
You'll get a free upgrade to the next gen version.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
That is of course if you buy a Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 version digitally.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You will get a free upgrade when, you know, for people like me that don't have a Playstation 4 or Xbox One yet.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
You'll get a free upgrade to the Xbox One or Playstation 4 version depending on which platform you purchase that on.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So, absolutely free.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
For a limited time though. They haven't said how long that's going to last but it is for a limited time.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
On top of that you also get of course the Guardian, was it?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It also includes I guess the standard or guardian editions of the game as well as expansion passes.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So if you buy those on one platform you get them on the other one.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Cool.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And we kind of got into this a little bit earlier about the whole fact that, you know, they're really giving incentives for people to buy digitally.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
This is a huge one for people that are still on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
In fact, it almost sounds like, Loki, this might have swayed your decision big time.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Well, I just, I don't know what the hell it's been, Mike.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I have like $70 in like fucking Xbox money, so.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Wow.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yeah, it.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Must be nice just to have that money lying around.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Long story there, but yeah.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I've got that stuck in my account and I'm like, what the fuck am I going to buy this?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So, got to pick something soon before it expires.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And then that'll be an Xbox One game if you ever get an Xbox One.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Exactly.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Alright.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Alright, lastly before we get to the classic game of the week, some updates on Mighty No. 9.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Mighty No. 9, if you were a Kickstarter backer of a certain level, you got a Mighty No. 9 beta that was available for those backers.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
A lot of this came out of PAX, so it might be just over a week old, but with a big game like Mighty No. 9, I wanted to bring this up anyway.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I've heard good things about it from people who are playing it.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Yeah, I actually watched a Twitch stream of somebody who was kind of playing it and it looked like it was.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Our intern Drew has it.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Oh really?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yes.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So fun.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Yeah, it looks like it's pretty challenging, like one of the old Mega Man games that you are going to have to kind of have that muscle memory of jump now, shoot now.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
You know, just having to get all those little patterns down, so.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You had to donate more than $80 to this in order to get this beta, but it is available and out there, so if you haven't seen this, it's all over YouTube now.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Some folks doing that.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:57.000
By the way, also coming to Mighty No. 9 multiplayer, that's pretty cool, online race battle through, and a little video posted of that earlier this week.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So this Mighty No. 9 sounds like it's going to be a pretty hot release. I'm excited about it.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Alright.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Let's go back to a simpler time.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Let's go back to a time when this game could have just been like Mega Man 11 or something.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking out this game this week.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yeah.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Not your freaking Destinies and your Diablos and whatever other crapola you're all playing this week.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yeah.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Well, I'm sticking with my CPS2 theme that I'd like to do for a couple months.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So I picked Mars Matrix Hyper Solid Shooting, which, yes, it was a CPS2 era game.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:55.000
This was a scrolling shooter game that came out, it was actually a vertical scrolling shooting game that was developed by Takumi in 2000 and published by Capcom for their CPS2 arcade board.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:09.000
It came on the Dreamcast later on in 2001, and the arcade version actually used a horizontally aligned monitor like Giga Wink did, which is pretty rare for a shooter game.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
So basically, yeah, it is a shooter game.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It's got an amazing soundtrack.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Rob, can we play a little bit of this?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That's just the splash screen.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
But I liked it when you get to the pickle ship, so it's going to pop up in a second.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
All right, tell us a little- oh, here we go.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That's really good.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh yeah, this is a club song right here.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Well, the whole soundtrack was just like really just on top of it.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:50.000
It was pretty clubby, you know, but it fit the game because the game was like a kind of a rendered look to it.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It was actually really well done.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So anyway, the game only uses one button, but you have to use a different action along with the timing of how you do it.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So a normal shot is just pressing the A button.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Your shot power increases with each level up to level 8, depending on your experience points.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You have a piercing cannon, so by not pressing the A button for at least one second, you press A.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And the attack is basically close range that hits multiple targets.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It's stronger than the normal shot, and the strength also increases in proximity to the target.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
It also, though, does not change based on level.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:41.000
There's also the mosquito, where if you have like a bar up at the top that if it's full, you can hold the A button for a quarter to half a second.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.000
The barrier gets activated, which damages any enemy that touches it until the GHB gauge is drained.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Enemy bullets are attracted towards the fighter as well.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:00.000
When you release the A button while the GHB is not empty, it causes those bullets to fire in any direction away from your fighter when the A button is released.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And repelled bullets can hit the enemy when it hits the enemy and is converted to a cube.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:12.000
You have the gravity hull bomb, that's the GHB by the way, where you hold the A button until the GHB gauge is emptied.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
When activated, an explosion damages all on-screen enemies and destroys all the bullets.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Each of your fighters is a little different. The Mosquito 1 is the normal speed with a wide blaster and lower shot damage.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Mosquito 2 is higher speed with a laser shot and higher shot damage.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:37.000
So you also get, of course, your 1-up and you get cubes, as I mentioned earlier, which increase your experience and recharge your combo meter.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Bigger cubes give you larger recharge time.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Rob, did you ever play this?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Actually, no I didn't. I didn't even realize this was one of the CPS2 era games.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
This one just wasn't on my radar.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Did they release this in any of the repackagings they did?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
When they did the, what, the Playstation 2?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Well, we'll be getting to that.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Excuse me.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
There's a little bit about the experience system though.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I was curious if you had ever played it since the big Dreamcast of Fran.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I haven't.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
What about you, Loki?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
No, I've never played this.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Anyway, with the experience system, you basically capture a cube, you get EXP, and your combo meter fills up.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I do like those bullet patterns though. Those are pretty sweet.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Yeah, it's a really gorgeous game.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So basically you can deplete your combo meter if you fail to capture a cube for a prolonged period of time or if you're destroyed.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:38.000
The cubes can be found by destroying enemies or parts of enemies or hitting an enemy with a repelled bullet like the charge meter we shared before.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.000
When your experience is high, your level is increased and then you can have more powerful shots.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So as far as, yeah, the other versions that were released, there was the Dreamcast version which had arcade mode.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.000
It says that it was a perfect conversion, but the scores for the enemies are different.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:07.000
There's elite mode, which is also called a range mode, where you can adjust certain options like your combo time, ship speed, and the GHB charge speed.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.000
In elite mode A, enemy ships and formations are changed. In elite B, the stages are the same as arcade mode.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You have score challenge mode or score attack mode where basically you kill an enemy with a piercing cannon that causes a bunch of cubes to appear and each of the cubes will increase the capacity value by one.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
You have a shop system, strategy mode, a movie, and a gallery.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And then there's a bug where your score cannot go beyond 999,999,999,990.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And they basically, that was the bug in the arcade version and they fixed it by adding two extra digits in the score table.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
This has only been released on the Dreamcast and arcade.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
So basically, nope.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version of this a 31 out of 40, which is a decent score.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
The game also from IGN got a rating of 8.5, which was great.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And there's also in the demo sequence for the arcade version, there's a voice clip that says, I'm not programmed to give you that information.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.000
It was taken from Season 1 Episode 16 of Star Trek The Next Generation.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Oh really?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yes.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So it's Roddenberry's wife?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Who did, because she did all those, the computer voices and stuff.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I don't think it was the computer.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Oh.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And anyway.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Nevermind.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But also you can get the soundtrack as I have went out on a limb looking for it.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Because yeah, anyone who has it on, like for example, it was on Amazon for 85 bucks.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
But it's the Mars Matrix and GigaWing 2 soundtrack box.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And that's it.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Pretty, pretty rad game.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000
That's a clever way to, I don't know if it was intentional, but it was a clever way to tie the Dreamcast birthday and the CPS2 theme together.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So there you go.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
It was intentional.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Alright.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Mars Matrix, classic game of the week.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
If you like your shmups, like I know Dark Sakura does, I am terrible at them.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
If you would like to try this game, I would be happy to lend you my copy.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Hooray, I gotta dust off my Dreamcast though.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I don't even know where the damn thing is.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I just love the music in it, it's so good.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Yeah, it sounds like the soundtrack is pretty good. I like that.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including rapid fire news, our Fugu question of the week about more Dreamcast.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:42.000
We also have some news with games like Elder Scrolls Online, Dragon Quest 7, yes, news on 7, and League of Legends.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
We got plenty of that news.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Your e-mails are FUs of the Week, your phone calls are 1-877-GAMO-LR and plenty more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on September the 7th, 2014 with the 566th episode of our show.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Which means we're only 100 away from 666th since apparently a Thufferin' Thuckattach. I can't say that number.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
So there it is.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
We are going to have the year of evil.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Did you think like years ago, I think we joked about episode 666, probably back during episode 66 we probably joked about it.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And to think we might actually hit that number is kind of mind blowing.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I want to say that I am spiteful enough that we should just be spiteful against reality and make it. Make it so.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Make it so. Well what is the old saying, everything I do is motivated by spite and porn?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And porn.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Is that true Loki? Is everything you do motivated by spite and porn?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I don't know about everything. Most of the things I guess.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I would have to add to that. Spite, porn and pumpkin flavored everything in the fall.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
By the way.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Because it is that time of year everybody.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I had my one and only pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Did you? Your one and only?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It tasted like cancer, it was fantastic.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
What? How did some?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
The whole allegation about the stuff that's in the pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Yeah, no I read the Snopes article.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Well at any rate, at any rate, because I am really back on my fitness kick.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I had my one and only and that's it.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It's delicious.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
You know what would make it better actually?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
What?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Chocolate.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I want a pumpkin mocha frappuccino.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
You could probably ask for that and get that.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Don't give me ideas.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Now she's thinking.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But pumpkin flavored everything comes in this time of year.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Because I have the pumpkin spice Keurig coffee maker cups.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Which you know the straight up coffee is not quite as bad for you as the frappuccinos.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So that's something.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And then you know I just got the email from Noah's bagels.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Pumpkin bagel with pumpkin cream cheese spread.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Good.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Pumpkin coffee.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I love it. I love it.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000
And then I think Rama posted on my wall earlier a joke that was a pumpkin direct condom.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I'm thinking.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Yeah I've seen that on Tumblr.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
That's a little much people.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Put down the Photoshop.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Maybe if I can make it through my first week without killing people.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I will reward myself with a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
With a pumpkin condom?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Oh a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Yes yes.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
There you go.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Ew.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Rob.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Okay so you know the thing we don't have here in California.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Actually we just finally got like two weeks ago an hour and a half away.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
That they have in Atlanta that I had to have was Dunkin Donuts.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000
And yes if you are somewhere outside of California we do not have Dunkin Donuts here.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Although well we just got our first one in Modesto of all fucking places.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I know right.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Like which is a two hour drive away.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I think there's some Modesto.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I don't know.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
People that.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I usually know people that.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Are getting out of there quickly.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Modesto.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Actually you want to hear a funny story.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
My parents met at Modesto Junior College.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Aww.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
So actually every time I make fun of Modesto I really shouldn't.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
You know that movie American Graffiti is about Modesto California.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yes.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It was an early George Lucas movie.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
My mother went to high school with George Lucas.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Crazy right?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Huh?

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000
My aunt went to school with Jimmy Buffett.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
One of my friends went to school with Britney Spears.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Oh my gosh.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
How privileged to be in her light.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Whatever.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I'm sure she was probably pretty awful actually.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Alright so the reason why I brought up Dunkin Donuts while I was out in Atlanta.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I had to go to Dunkin Donuts which thankfully in the SunTrust Plaza which is right next

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
to the hotel where Dragon Con is at.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
They had a Dunkin Donuts.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
It's only open during the week though.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I couldn't go Saturday to Sunday but on Friday I went and bless their hearts.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
They had pumpkin donuts.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And it was so good.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Rama.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I want you to go to a Dunkin Donuts.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Vacuum wrap me a couple of those.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
You know where I live.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Ship me some.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Jamie.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Jamie.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Let's.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And I can't believe I'm actually going to suggest this.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Are we going to Modesto?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Let's go to Modesto.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Oh my god.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Okay.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Okay.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Okay.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Yes.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I don't.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Call in.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I'm not going to call in.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Yes you are.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Co-workers enlisted at the show that will tattle on me.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Co-workers do rob a solid.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
We will buy you donuts and bring them to you.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Guys.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I seriously have a problem.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
What about next Sunday before OLR?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
We'll go in the morning.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Go get donuts with the church crowd and then bring them to OLR.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And Loki, who's sitting here criticizing us, can benefit from the rewards.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Look at Rama.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Look at Rama.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Look at Rama.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Rama, I love you.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I do not want anything pumpkin spice.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I fucking hate everything.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
More for us.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Everything pumpkin spice.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Fine.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
You can have a fucking plain glazed.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
No, no, no.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I don't even want plain glazed.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
You keep your own fucking donuts.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Plain glazed.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Don't look like a savage.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Rob.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
You don't want sprinkles or something?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
No.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Fuck that.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I don't want anything from Dunkin' Donuts.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Fine.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
We'll eat it in front of you.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Oh, and I won't care.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
We need to like have donuts.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Nothing but donuts all day.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.320
And there's people on the East Coast that are sitting there going, those stupid Californians

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.000
freaking the fuck out over Dunkin' Donuts is not even a big ass deal.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.640
You know what I would freak out more over though?

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.800
To which I say, now you know how I feel every time you people talk about In-N-Out Burger.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.000
It is not that big of a fucking deal.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.520
You know what I would freak out more over though?

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.520
What?

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520
If we got a Tim Hortons.

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.520
I'd be like, oh my God, Tim Hortons.

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.660
I've had a Tim Hortons donut twice.

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:42.120
Burger Hortons or Tim King might become a reality.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.120
Whatever.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.120
Burger King, you suck.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.120
All right.

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.480
Look, it is a, it is a video game podcast.

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.200
You cannot have video games without donuts.

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.640
Damn it.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.640
I have no idea.

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.640
Keep in mind, I was raised with Krispy Kreme, so when I had donuts that weren't Krispy Kreme,

01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.560
I was like, why are they cakey?

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.760
Loki may beg to differ.

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.480
Can you have video games without donuts?

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.760
Yeah.

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.960
What can't you have video games without pizza, right?

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.160
You can't play video games without anything, but I like pizza.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.400
Tim Hortons is yummy.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.400
What happened to Loki?

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.400
You know what is good though?

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.400
You guys have seen Loki.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.640
I'm putting his, I'm putting his, uh, picture on a book card.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.800
You know what's good though that I finally had going to SoCal was Winchell's.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.800
Yeah.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800
We used to have Winchell's here.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.400
There was one in Roseville when I was growing up and they closed it.

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.400
Anyway.

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.400
All right.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.800
Look, by the way, our friend, uh, Mega Man X 400 from a video game realness from Canada

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.640
says Tim Hortons is not that big of a deal coming from Toronto.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640
See if you live there.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.040
It's a big deal when it's different.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.040
Exactly.

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.040
It's a big deal when it's different.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.040
Well, remember, okay.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.360
Remember when we had the big boom of Krispy Kremes here, Rob?

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360
Yes.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360
What was my reaction?

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360
Really?

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360
It's fucking Krispy Kreme.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.480
My reaction was buy a dozen of those and eat them during work.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.480
I'm not sharing.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.520
I'm eating them all myself.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.520
And then second reaction going inside.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.840
This doesn't look like a fucking Krispy Kreme.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.020
What I do want over here is I want all the fucking cool shit that's on those like Chinese

01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:14.880
and Japanese menus at their fast food places, you know, where they build like, they build

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.600
the ridiculous burgers and stuff that would kill ordinary people.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600
No, not the shrimp burgers.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600
I'm talking like this.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.760
Like, you know, the burger pizzas and you know, just the ridiculous stuff they have.

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.340
I want the Kuro burger that was at Burger King in Japan.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:33.360
I want the Pizza Hut commercials from Japan where all the workers are cats.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360
That's what I want.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.080
Did you ever see the Kuro burger though?

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.720
No, but quickly.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:45.200
It was a black bun, like, flung with the squid ink and like black cheese and I want the goth

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200
burger.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.200
All right, rapid fire news time, guys.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.160
Let's talk quickly about some video game topics.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.600
We just, it's a busy week.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.800
We have to get these out quickly.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:01.560
So Mortal Kombat X is finally nailed down the release date, tentatively, as April 14th,

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.560
2015.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:09.600
It'll be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, and Windows PC.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.560
So yeah, hopefully they will be actually coming out that day.

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.560
They do have, I guess, a pre-order incentive to, you know, unlock Goro as a playable character.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:26.040
So that's kind of lame that they lock a really cool character behind a pre-order wall.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.080
But what else is new?

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.040
If you're not in the mood for Madden but you want to play some football, guess what?

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:42.160
There is a ROM hack for Tecmo Bowl 2 updated to Tecmo Bowl 2000, or Tecmo Super Bowl 2015.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:50.440
It's basically a roster update to give everybody the, I guess, modern rosters, offensive schemes,

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:54.160
and all 32 current NFL teams.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:01.720
And so if you have an NES emulator, you can go download that, TecmoBowl.org.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.880
And they've got, I think it's in their forums, you can check that out.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:13.040
And last but not least, this is kind of surprising, but maybe after, you know, their presentation

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.160
at either Gamescom or E3, I can't remember where they're talking about VibRib in a lot,

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.760
but Sony has filed a trademark for VibRib in Europe.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.760
What?

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760
What?

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760
Yes.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:31.040
So they're going to be possibly either re-releasing the old game or putting out a new one.

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.180
I hope it's a new one.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.220
Let's all join hands and pray.

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:41.700
Oh Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, wait, bless this thy donut that with it we might

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:45.820
be blessed with VibRib in.

01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:50.220
Whatever it is you believe in, God, Buddha, Flying Speedy Monster, whatever it is you

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:55.940
believe in, join hands with me in prayer that VibRib in is making some type of comeback.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:01.060
I mean, I don't care if it's like just a freaking like PS1 now game or something.

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:06.900
What if we get the ribbon box with VibRib in emoji ribbon and like ribbon all the things.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.660
Don't fuck with my emotions.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.100
That's what confused me so much is was that they have the guy that created VibRib in talking

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:17.540
about VibRib in for like a very long time during like GDC, it was E3, they fucking whipped

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.540
out VibRib in E3.

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:19.540
Oh my God.

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.540
Agdef said it.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.540
What?

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:22.540
VibRib in with MP3 support.

01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:25.660
For the love of Vibri, please.

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:30.940
Knowing Sony, if it were to happen, it would be VibRib in with Sony Entertainment Network

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:31.940
support.

01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:32.940
I just thought of something.

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.940
What?

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.500
How to cosplay Vibri.

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:39.700
All right, anyway, quickly, it's a three hour show, not seven.

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:45.820
So, yes, that's all we know so far aside from the filing that, yeah, VibRib in is possibly

01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:48.780
going to come back.

01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:52.980
Fifth Dream in chat says, fuck yes, please, VibRib in, I will suck some people off for

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.460
VibRib in to exist.

01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:58.140
I'm right there with you, Fifth Dream.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.620
Rob says, Fifth Dream, TMI, dude.

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:07.100
I already said something about BioWare earlier this evening, so tonight, all the cocks.

01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:13.980
I remember that day, we went to network video RIP, and I got VibRib in, and you got Kitty

01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:15.460
the Cool.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:18.860
The Hello Kitty game.

01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.860
Yeah, you kind of made out better, didn't you?

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.540
All right, let's see.

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:26.580
And Rama says in chat, I pray to Joe Pesci.

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.220
Well, I said whatever you believe in, whatever you believe in.

01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:38.540
All right, MegamanX400, uh oh, uh oh, asks, what is VibRib in?

01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:39.540
Get out.

01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:40.540
No, I'm just kidding.

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:41.540
VibRib in.

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:42.540
We shall educate you now.

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:46.060
I've already done it as a classic game, but maybe I need to just do it again.

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.140
Just quickly, give a 60 second speech.

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:54.260
VibRib is an all kind of victory 3D game, where you're a rabbit, whose name is Vibri,

01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:57.980
and you walk along the line, and you get different obstacles in your way, and you have to do

01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.780
certain button mashes to pass said obstacles.

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.940
It's got its own little soundtrack, but the great thing is that you can put in your own

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.560
CDs, and use different music, and the tracks will change based on the music that you play.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.980
And he turns into different things as he goes into this halo creature, and it's absolutely

01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:14.980
awesome.

01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:17.860
And he sings the demo, how to play the game.

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:20.020
He sings how you play the game.

01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:21.220
And it's adorable.

01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.260
And he's got this little cute little voice, kind of digitally sounding, and oh my god,

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:28.060
Vibri is adorable!

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:34.260
It's like, it's like a endless runner, but, you know, it's not, yeah, kind of.

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:38.700
And if you want, actually if you want a good idea of what the game looks like, it's got,

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:43.820
it's you know, it's a, what's the group that does it, a Weebles game.

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:48.940
But Weebles did something kind of based off of, it plays exactly like Vibribin for iOS,

01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:52.140
called Dancing Russian Men, and that will give you an idea of how the game looks.

01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:55.700
I mean, not how it looks, but how it plays, so.

01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:03.980
And Mega Man X400 in true Canadian fashion apologizing, lol, sorry, sorry, I don't know.

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:04.980
That's okay.

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.980
You know what?

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.980
We're here, but now you do know, and knowing is half the battle.

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:13.140
Just go look up the intro to Vibribin.

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.140
It's cute game.

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.140
It's adorbs.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.140
Cute game.

01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.140
Alright, let's move on.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.580
We've got more news we've got to talk about, including with Sony.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:24.380
Maybe if Vibribin does come out on PlayStation 4 in one form or another, people will be streaming

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:29.340
it on the PlayStation Vita, because there's going to be an app that will allow the PlayStation

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:35.380
Vita access to the PlayStation Live network that's all over the PlayStation 4.

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.420
So yes, you too can watch the Ustreams and Twitch channels of people sitting in their

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:45.920
living room saying racist, sexist, horrible things to each other, because that's a lot

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.020
of what's broadcast on there.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.020
But you know what?

01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:49.620
Amongst all that, there is a lot of good streams, too.

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:53.460
A lot of Diablo 3 streams lately, and of course, of course, I knew this would happen the day

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:54.780
the game came out.

01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:57.940
Guess what game is dominating PlayStation Live right now?

01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:59.220
Minecraft.

01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.980
Dominating PlayStation Live right now.

01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:05.440
So you can watch more Minecraft feeds on the PlayStation Vita very soon, which makes sense

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.380
because they brought it to mobile phones as well, although I think it's just a link.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:11.580
News on Bravely Second.

01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:15.740
I know that a lot of you guys were fans of Bravely Default, Dark Soccer and myself included.

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.740
De-fart.

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.740
Bravely De-fart.

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:24.340
Well, in Bravely Second, which I guess Dark Soccer would call Bravely Second fart, I don't

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:25.340
know.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.620
There's some information that's come out about Bravely Second.

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.900
Bravely Suck It.

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.420
Bravely Suck It.

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.140
I don't know.

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:37.580
The Wind Vestal Agnus will be back in Bravely Suck It.

01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:45.940
There will also be some new characters, including Magnolia Arch in the roles of Valkyrie, Performer,

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.980
Red Mage and Time Major.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.420
Some of the screenshots we see.

01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:54.300
Magnolia Arch in the screenshots.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.340
Also another new character revealed this week, Yu.

01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:00.100
That's YU.

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:06.220
YU is another new character that is the Falcon of the Gale who will be joining Magnolia as

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.620
a party member during the game.

01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.620
Some other characters.

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:14.500
Jean, the Wolf of the Inferno and Nikolai, the Bison of Solidity.

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.700
So more information on Bravely Suck It.

01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.820
Okay, Dungeon Buster wins.

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:23.980
Bravely Second win.

01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:25.180
We're like seven years old.

01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.180
All right.

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:27.180
I love you guys.

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:28.180
I love you guys.

01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:30.860
Lastly, some news on the Retron 5.

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.100
Remember this console?

01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.100
That thing.

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.100
The aluminum box.

01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:38.340
I'd seen this at E3 and I got to play Zombies Ate My Neighbors and High Def, which was kind

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:39.340
of awesome.

01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:42.380
Which reminds me, I need to get a Retron 5.

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:47.300
I did not know that they were doing firmware updates to the Retron consoles, but they are.

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:51.940
A new firmware update, firmware 2.0 Beta 1 came out for the Retron.

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:58.740
It includes IPS patch support, meaning you take an imported game cartridge.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:02.980
You take a little, I guess, USB stick with the IPS file.

01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:06.460
You can patch the cartridge to play fan translations.

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:07.460
That is fucking amazing.

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.460
Right?

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.460
That's awesome.

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:12.420
And the Seiken fan translation is like the best.

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.420
Seiken Densetsu.

01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:14.420
Right?

01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.420
So that's really cool.

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:17.260
Some other firmware support.

01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:21.300
Support for S&S SPC 7110 cartridges.

01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:24.140
I don't know what games that included.

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.020
Screen shaking and some GBA games fixed.

01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:31.860
Yeah, there was actually a test video out that was showing that it wasn't working with

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:34.300
some of the add-on games.

01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:37.940
So I'd like to, yeah, hopefully they've addressed that.

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.060
That's really cool.

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:44.540
Some game compatibility fixes, meaning Sky Kid, Yokai Club, and Dark Soccer, you can

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:45.540
rest easy.

01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.260
Fantasy Zone will now work.

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:53.700
Can you imagine if Dark Soccer had bought one of these things and Fantasy Zone didn't

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:54.700
work?

01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:55.700
Oh my god, the thing would be in pieces.

01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:59.540
Do you know that I have almost every home version of Fantasy Zone?

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.820
Oh really, says the woman who made fun of me over Mass Effect 3 earlier.

01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.820
Yeah, guess what?

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:04.820
They're all different games.

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.540
Yeah, guess what?

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.540
Suck it.

01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:11.620
Technically, they are different games for, you know, different consoles.

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620
Yeah.

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:16.020
It's just, you know, the Wii U window in place.

01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.620
But it does support the tablet.

01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:23.540
Rolling my eyes so hard that it just, I think I might have strained my ocular joints.

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:26.820
Roll them back so you can do the next story.

01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.700
Girl.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.280
So well, the next three stories then, to be accurate.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:38.220
So there are instructions out there on how to upgrade the next gen Minecraft, you know,

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:42.500
with the new versions on Xbone and Playstation 4.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:47.860
There actually is a blog post out there about how to do the upgrade, of which I will give

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:50.140
you the URL as soon as it loads.

01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:53.820
But there's also videos out there, so you can also check it out on various tubes of

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:56.880
you that you might be able to find.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:03.040
So by the way, I almost got it to load, never mind.

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:11.440
It's actually on a post by Brian Silva on the Playstation 4 blog, blog.US.PlayStation.com.

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:17.520
And I will link that into the chat room, because it's a really long URL for the regular URL.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:22.680
So that being said, I'm sure you are all going to be super happy with having instructions.

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:30.000
So also, there are details out now, at least for the European release of Bayonetta 2.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.640
Which will of course be a Wii U exclusive, and probably one of the few reasons to own

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:34.640
one.

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.640
What?

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.640
So?

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.640
So?

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.640
So?

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:39.640
So?

01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:46.440
Nintendo said that the first print edition, which is exclusive to Europe, will have the

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:53.480
discs of Bayonetta 2, Wii U Bayonetta remake, the Art of Bayonetta 2 art book, and a 3D

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:58.420
embossed leather effect packaging that recreates the Hierarchy of Laguna.

01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:04.240
The book of angels that were all the enemies that you have to kill with your gun shoes

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.240
from.

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:08.200
So yeah, pretty cool.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.640
Lots of details on Bayonetta 2 this week, by the way, because of the Nintendo Direct.

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.520
So if you didn't see it, go watch it, because Dark Sakura is just touching the tip of the

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:17.800
iceberg with this.

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.640
Well, it is rapid fire, is it not?

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.640
I know, I understand.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:29.200
And then, last but not least, there is a release list that came out from the Direct, actually,

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:33.560
that has a list of games coming out in 2015.

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:38.160
One of those games listed is Star Fox.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:44.720
There is also another Zelda game listed in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X, I guess it is,

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.960
or X, I guess X, since there wasn't two through nine.

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.800
Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, Act Deft, just letting you know.

01:54:53.800 --> 01:55:00.880
Mario Maker, Yoshi's Woolly World, Splatoon, Captain Toad, bunch of stuff.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:06.000
So Star Fox, something else called Project Guard.

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:12.480
Yeah, so a good thing that a lot of those E3 titles we saw, because Star Fox and Zelda,

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.720
we got little tastes of at E3 this year, but nice to see that they are still targeting

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.400
2015 for that, because I don't know, the way Nintendo rolls sometimes, I would not have

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.480
been shocked if you told me that Zelda game wasn't happening until 2016.

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.920
Act Deft, I said Star Fox, not Star Fucks.

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.920
There's a difference.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.880
And maybe my little bit of a southern accent plays into that, but no.

01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.720
I usually emphasize when I say the word fuck.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.120
Alright, well let's go to the fucking FUGL question of the week right now.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.120
It's Radio Koopaloo.

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.240
You take Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together, you get FUGL, and it's the

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.440
FUGL question of the week, where we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook

01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.440
and Google Plus.

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:06.000
That's Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google.com slash Plus, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
This is all about the Dreamcast we talked about earlier in the show.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.360
Were you a Dreamcast owner?

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:11.360
Why or why not?

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.160
Looking back, do you have a favorite Dreamcast title?

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.080
We'll start with the Googlers tonight.

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:21.520
Act Deft saying, I got my Dreamcast on a Black Friday for $50 US, like 12 years ago or so.

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:25.160
I played with it a lot, and it was my go-to console for fighting games, though I think

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.360
my favorite game for the Dreamcast was either Jet Grind or Jet Set Radio or Sonic Adventure

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:31.360
2.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:32.680
Crazy Taxi in a close second.

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.000
God, I miss crazy taxi.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.320
Renee, Renee Y replies and says, we had a Dreamcast because we were a hardcore Sega

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:47.160
family, as a good strong family should be, right?

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.240
My favorite game to play was Phantasy Star Online, one of my first MMOs.

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.040
It was a truly unique experience being able to play a game with my cousin who lived all

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:56.320
the way across the country.

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:59.400
Eventually, we ended up giving the console away to a friend who didn't have enough money

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:00.400
to buy a console.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.400
This was in 2005.

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.600
I can't believe it's been almost 10 years since I've given away my Dreamcast, let alone

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:07.560
15 years from when I owned one.

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.680
That's really sweet that Renee gave the console away to somebody who, you know, over here

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:15.160
you had no console, so that's really cool.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.600
Good job.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:19.680
Reddertainment replied and said, no.

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:21.560
That's it, no.

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.640
Not a Dreamcast fan, I imagine.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.840
Flaco Jones replied and said, never had a Dreamcast, but a friend of mine did.

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:29.000
He also had every game pirated to discs.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.360
I think I only played Tony Hawk on it, but it was good.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.960
And Collin M says, bought one shortly after it came out.

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.480
Phantasy Star Online and Space Channel 5 were my favorite games on the system.

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.920
Choo, choo.

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:46.320
A few comments over here on Facebook, Fabrice A says, I'm a hardcore Sega fan and of course

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.320
I own a Dreamcast.

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:50.720
I think it's still the best console ever because of the numerous, excellent arcade games they

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.720
had on it.

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:55.320
Crazy Taxi is an all-time favorite game for me and I still play it from time to time.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:59.600
Occasionally I go out and look for sailors too, but not before I have a hot dog at Tom's.

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:02.560
Dreamcast, it's still thinking.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.760
Tonic Vision replied and said, I actually bought a Dreamcast in college after it had

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.920
been out for a little over a year.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.960
I got it for $99 on Amazon and what amazed, Amazon was a thing back then?

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.960
I guess it was.

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.900
I guess it was kind of in its early days.

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.960
What amazed me the most is how easily it ran pirated CDs.

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.640
A couple of floors up for me, a guy knew how to do it and made me about 10 discs packed

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:22.640
with games.

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.280
I fell in love with Code Veronica and stayed up many weekends playing Marvel versus Capcom

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.600
2 with friends.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.320
Having never owned a Genesis, I thought it was a solid system overall, but I must admit

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.600
that when PlayStation 2 came out, it started collecting dust immediately.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.400
The surprising amount of people admitting to open piracy here.

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:39.360
I think you were onto something earlier when you said that.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.360
Part of the problem.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.760
Yeah, part of the problem.

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:46.520
KingSnee replied and said, one of my favorite memories with the Dreamcast was when I first

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:49.960
came in contact with it and Sonic running from a killer whale.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.920
I thought that was the coolest thing I'd seen in a game at that point and that's one

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:54.840
of the many reasons why I got a Dreamcast.

01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.160
I still think about playing my first RPG, Grandia 2.

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:03.720
Guillermo R. replies and says I was in college and skipped classes on 9999 to go pick up

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:06.720
my Dreamcast, Sonic Adventure, and Soul Calibur.

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.440
What an amazing system at the time.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.840
I still have it plugged on my TV and fire it up every now and then.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.760
While the games haven't aged as well as I like to remember them, Crazy Taxi with the

01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:19.200
original soundtrack, Soul Calibur, Power Stone, and Soul Reaver are still a fun ride down

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.800
memory lane.

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:26.000
Awesome Unicorn says I never owned a Dreamcast but I did have Space Channel 5 lunchbox and

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.040
that's what really matters.

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.040
That's a fair answer.

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040
That's a fair answer.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.080
Dr. Sunya says I still have mine.

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.240
Maybe if there's one thing I've loved about the Dreamcast, it was the arcade ports.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:41.660
Marvel vs. Capcom, Crazy Taxi, and Soul Calibur all had ports from the arcade that were not

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:45.080
only near perfect but had tons of extras to boot.

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.780
Several people calling that out.

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.460
Ragenator says I never got a Dreamcast even though it did appeal to me.

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:53.740
At the time I already had some systems in use like Super Nintendo, N64, and PS1 with

01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:58.820
plenty of games for each so trying to afford a four system plus games was a no go.

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:03.780
Haseo Sumeruagawa says I never owned a Dreamcast mostly because I was seven and not the richest

02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:07.780
family but I always wanted one to play Sonic Adventure 2 because Shadow was awesome hands

02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.780
down.

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:09.780
Well, go to a flea market.

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:12.400
You might be able to get one still.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:16.820
And lastly, Curlykirk replied and says I didn't get a Dreamcast when it first came out but

02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:21.000
I eventually got one probably soon before it stopped being made but I still have one

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.760
now and love the sports games like the 2K series and Virtua Tennis.

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.320
Great answers and I heard some new names in there as well so thank you guys so much for

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.000
applying and participating with our question this week.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.840
I'm going to go ahead and get back into news since the hosts here in studio kind of already

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.320
took on this question earlier in the show but yeah, now's a good reminder to friend

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.960
us on Facebook and on Google Plus so you can answer for next week.

02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.960
Let's go back into some news.

02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:44.960
Loki.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:52.160
Alright, so I'm not surprised by this news considering how all the reviews and kind of

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:57.880
impressions seem to be of this game but apparently the Elder Scrolls Online, not doing so hot

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:03.680
and ZeniMax Online apparently has been hit with some layoffs but they're still seeing

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.760
they're continuing to invest heavily in the game and says now that we're nearly six months

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:15.360
post launch, we have a thriving online community in a game that runs smoothly and says that

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.120
we remain strongly committed to the Elder Scrolls Online and continue to invest heavily

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.920
to develop new content for PC players, prepare the game for its console launch and handle

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.680
our planned expansion into important international territories.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.000
As for customer service, we continue to operate large support centers in Hunt Valley, Maryland

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:41.400
and Galway, Ireland but basically saying the reason why they're having layoffs as normal

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:46.280
for games of this type, we had ramped up a large workforce to develop a game of vast

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:52.760
scale and the ramped up customer service to handle expected questions and community needs

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:58.520
for Elder Scrolls Online launch and of course now that they don't need that so I don't know.

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.560
Maybe it is still doing okay, I'm still, I don't know, it doesn't seem like a lot of

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:10.120
people I know are interested in it so I have to wonder how well it's doing.

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:13.320
We talked about this a little bit on Hoard House this week which is, you know, a cheap

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:19.520
plug Wednesday nights at seven here at VOG or has its own podcast feed as well and one

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.020
thing I mentioned on Hoard House I want to mention here is that this news is really surprising

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.640
considering this is supposed to be a big console release.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.200
This game is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and I believe the Xbox One as

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.200
well.

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.400
I remember this whole thing and so it's weird that people are being laid off in advance

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.400
of that happening.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.240
Now, I do realize that in the cycle and development of games sometimes, you know, development

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.340
is finished before the game comes out so that people, you know, are laid off as the project

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.680
closes or whatever.

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:47.700
But you would think that they would, yeah, they were saying that they ramped up their

02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:52.400
customer service and stuff for the launch of that game.

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.280
When they need that same type of thing for the launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One or their

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.240
expectations that much lower now.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:02:59.240
Exactly.

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:03.640
That's the same thing that concerns me about this is that it doesn't kind of add up and,

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.120
you know, you don't hear about companies like, you know, Blizzard and Square Enix laying

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.400
people off, you know, when the development's done because they continue to develop the

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.120
game with enhanced, you know, patches and other things.

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.560
Now, granted, those two companies I just mentioned are really big and probably have other projects

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:23.400
that people can be assigned to whereas ZeniMax was kind of made to make Elder Scrolls so

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.520
maybe the situation is a little different.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:29.440
But it doesn't get my hopes up about the game's longevity.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.240
They could also be just like, ah, fuck it, we'll just do it with what we got and, you

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.480
know, if it's a little bit rough, well, people are kind of expecting that.

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.480
I don't know.

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:41.160
Maybe that's their thought.

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.560
Maybe they just, they figure at this point that they're not making enough money back

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.600
from it that they have to kind of cut their losses.

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:53.640
They can't afford to ramp up employees for that launch.

02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.240
And who knows when that launch is coming, you know?

02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:01.380
Why keep all those employees around for, you know, it's supposed to be this year.

02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:02.380
Supposed to be.

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:05.680
I mean, it's, I thought it was, I thought the beta was supposed to be first quarter

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:06.680
this year.

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.320
Like, I mean, like that thing got really delayed.

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:10.320
I could be wrong.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.120
I could be mixing it up with another MMO, but I could have sworn that the Elder Scrolls

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.400
online was supposed to happen a lot faster than it has been.

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.480
EKMA JP was just adding in that Square Enix has almost all contracts and no layoffs.

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.480
Oh, interesting.

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:26.200
That's a clever way to do it so you don't have to, you know, announce all these layoffs

02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:27.200
or whatever.

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.200
Interesting.

02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:29.200
Um, let's see.

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:35.720
Kane shadow is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying ESO hype is done and over with thankfully.

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.640
And um, you know, I, I don't know, but I also know people that still kind of really like

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640
this.

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.200
Like I have some friends that actually do a podcast about ESOs.

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.600
I almost feel bad sitting here like poo pooing on it, especially when I haven't played an

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:52.160
awful lot of it, but you can't help but look at a lot of this going, I, I, I would have

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.240
bought it if it even used like the Guild Wars model where you buy the game and then

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.240
the online craze.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:01.000
If they did it like they're doing destiny where you buy the game and you play it online,

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.640
that'd be fucking amazing.

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.160
But no, it's not like that.

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:12.160
And so yeah, unfortunately I, I just can't dedicate myself to paying for a game that

02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:13.160
I'm not going to play.

02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:17.440
You know, especially if it's a monthly fee, I'm, I can't see myself paying for something

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:18.440
that I'm not gonna play.

02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:22.160
Do for the Minecraft server for now.

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:23.560
But yeah, I don't know.

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:28.840
I can't do that for an MMO because I just, it's just throwing money away.

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.840
Yeah.

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:35.080
Um, I, I, I don't know, I, I, I would hope that maybe they go to that model cause I still

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:39.040
would like to see this come out on consoles just because I love the idea of MMOs on, on

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.040
console.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.040
Yeah, they did it well.

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.040
They did what?

02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:43.040
They went free to play with DC universe.

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:46.920
I mean, I think that helped that, but I don't know if they're going to do that with Elder

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.800
Scrolls online.

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:49.800
It's a big property.

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.800
I don't know.

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:51.800
We'll see.

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:52.800
We'll see.

02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.360
Well, moving on for now, cause we're just hypothesizing here, uh, moving on to something

02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.840
else that Square Enix related.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.440
This has to do a dragon quest seven.

02:05:58.440 --> 02:05:59.440
Yes, I seven.

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:00.440
I know.

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:04.000
I know that, you know, we should be talking about 10 or even potentially 11, but uh, here's

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.920
the thing about dragon quest seven is that Square Enix has talked about this week.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:13.040
Uh, Noriyoshi Fujimoto, who's the dragon quest mobile producer for Square Enix, talked to

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:17.880
Silicon era, uh, about the company doing more dragon quest games and that they would

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:21.920
like to bring the remastered version of dragon quest seven for the Nintendo three D S to

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.040
the west, but they don't think sales of the game will be high enough.

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:30.280
The quote here in terms of dragon quest seven, it has a lot of texts to go through and translate,

02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:34.040
and we've received so many requests and so much positive feedback about the game, but

02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:37.360
unfortunately we have to consider the cost and the manpower needed to handle the sheer

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:39.960
load of text in terms of scenario and script.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.040
The game is probably one of the largest in the DQ franchise.

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:47.720
If a lot of people can buy it and support it, well, we can't promise anything, uh, from

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:51.560
dragon quest seven and B, excuse me, from dragon quest eight and beyond, we've revamped

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:52.560
the translation.

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.160
For example, we've added regional twangs like those from Baltic region sounding Russian

02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.340
and things like that.

02:06:57.340 --> 02:06:59.140
We've also updated the spells and monster names.

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:02.240
So any classic titles we revisit, we want to stay consistent.

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.260
That being said, when we go back and update the classic titles, we make these changes.

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:07.260
That's another step in the process.

02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:12.180
Well, as you can imagine, after this quote happened, now you have Twitter lighting up

02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:16.880
with a lot of people sending messages to Square Enix, like I'll buy it, make it happen, do

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:17.980
it, do it.

02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:19.700
So maybe you want to lend your own voice.

02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:23.460
I'm surprised there's not a change.org petition already, although there probably is one out

02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:26.860
there, but, um, I'm sure some of you out there may be listening to this.

02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.380
Maybe you want to go lend your support for this game as well.

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:32.020
If you think this is something that would interest you, I would check it out on, on

02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:33.020
3DS.

02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:34.020
Heck yeah.

02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:35.020
That'd be great.

02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:41.420
Uh, I'd almost like to see it more like on PlayStation now or something where I can play

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:45.420
it on the TV, but I'll take the 3DS, it's better than nothing.

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:47.140
All right.

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:49.540
So let's move on Dark Sakura.

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.380
Well, uh, for, I know that we've got a lot of listeners who are League of Legends fans,

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:58.180
so there is actually something going on with League of Legends.

02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:01.060
Riot is re-imagining the lore.

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:07.460
Um, yeah, basically they've had so many different releases and different contents added on that

02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:12.420
the lore has just been all kinds of fubar, so they're just wiping it and redoing it.

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:19.020
Um, there is a quote out there actually from Tommy Knox, um, who said that we look back

02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:22.380
at the original decision, at the decisions that made perfect sense when we originally

02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:27.160
made them, but are now at odds with our design values and ultimately limit our ability to

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.720
continually improve League of Legends.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.720
That's unacceptable.

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:35.560
In such situations, we seek to aggressively re-imagine content in a way that realizes

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.960
its full potential.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.920
So basically we done fucked up the lore.

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:40.120
We're going to redo it.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:41.280
We're pulling the Star Wars.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.280
Lucas sold it.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:43.840
I was just going to say the same thing.

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:49.640
Is this, is this akin to Disney saying, well, now that we own Star Wars, books invalid.

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:52.880
We're actually doing this, doing this right.

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:53.880
Yeah.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:54.880
Yeah.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:59.360
Although many would argue the books were plenty fine, but I understand the need to be like,

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:04.360
because if they do episode seven and they hadn't invalidated all the extended universe,

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:08.720
there was going to be so much stuff where people would be like, that can't happen because

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:14.080
in such and such book on page 140, uh, this character has printing.

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.080
Yeah, exactly.

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.080
Right.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:17.080
Yeah.

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.400
So no disrespect to those that are fans of the extended Star Wars universe, but I kind

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.780
of understand why they had to do it for that reason that if it's like, okay, if we really

02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:29.000
are going to kind of take control of this and you may not agree with me, but I fully

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:35.360
believe that control needed to be taken away from Lucas because the prequels were awful.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:39.600
And the way that they're handling this is more like how the Tomb Raider reboot went

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:44.520
or, you know, re-imagining how Battlestar Galactica went as mentioned here in the article.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:48.120
Um, so they're just trying to make it, I guess, a more cohesive story.

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.120
That makes sense.

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.120
That's fair.

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:51.120
All right.

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.160
Uh, I do like what fifth dream said.

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.160
Yeah.

02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.160
Retcons for everyone.

02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:58.160
You get a retcon and you get a retcon.

02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:59.320
All right.

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:03.320
Uh, let's move on with some more stories then we're going to get to the mailbag.

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.320
Loki.

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320
All right.

02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:08.400
So I don't know.

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:15.480
It's Google is I guess jumping on board with, I think, um, Apple to do something very similar,

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:21.600
but they've refunded $19 million worth of in-app purchases or if you would call it a

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:29.400
guess accidental in-app purchases made by our children because you know, I gave them

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:35.400
my tablet and they didn't have any sort of parental controls or way, you know, gave them

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.080
my parental controls and they bought a bunch of Smurf money or whatever the fuck it is

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.080
that they're buying.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:47.120
Um, but apparently, yeah, because of the, um, complaint, I guess filed with the FTC,

02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:54.000
they've agreed to pay $19 million in refunds made, um, I guess for purchases made without

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.280
the account holders explicit consent.

02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:01.840
So that sucks, but Google has a ton of money.

02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.840
So you know what?

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:04.640
Uh, I don't know.

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.600
And that's why they, they couldn't afford Twitch anymore.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.040
It's just like, it's, that's, that's pennies, you know, I got 19 million in my wallet right

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.040
now.

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:18.120
But I don't know, at the same time, I think that it is a responsibility of parents to

02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:21.200
be monitoring what their children are allowed to buy.

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:27.040
But at the same time, I could see that maybe some people that develop apps make that stuff

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:31.160
a little bit too easy to purchase or confusing that kind of sense.

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.220
So I don't know.

02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:37.120
It's interesting to see how both the, you know, Google play and the, you know, iTunes

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:43.440
store are kind of starting to insert the language to make the not truly free games

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.720
sound like what they are.

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:45.720
Not truly free.

02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.440
It's interesting to see that evolution, you know, especially since, you know, gaming is

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.680
getting bigger and bigger on these platforms.

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:55.280
And sometimes us, us gamers that tend to tilt a little more hardcore kind of forget that.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:59.100
But um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting to see that evolution.

02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:04.200
I guess it's just something they have to do right now and you know, but at the same time,

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.280
yeah, they really need to have something in place where it's just like, yeah, come

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:09.280
on.

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.040
Your parents take responsibility or we're going to get stuck in the situation.

02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:13.040
You know what?

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.480
They should just enable parental controls from the start and then you have to pay 60

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.480
cents to unlock it.

02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:18.480
How's that sound?

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:24.120
Lucky fucking tend to seriously that it's absolutely lame.

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.120
All right.

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.160
Well speaking of Nintendo, let's not forget that back in the day they made some arcade

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:30.160
classics.

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:38.000
One of those all time classics is donkey Kong and donkey Kong, danky, danky Kang for his

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
oldest.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.960
This game is, it still ends up in, in our video game news all the time.

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:45.720
And a lot of this is the war over the high score, right?

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:48.540
We had a whole movie about this King of Kong, right?

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:53.680
And then this new guy, Hank Chen showed up and was like, Hey, I'm the new kid in school

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.480
and I'm going to smash all these records.

02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:56.480
And he did.

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.600
But guess what happened this past week, Robbie Lakeman.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:01.600
That's right.

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.100
A new guy has now taken the throne in donkey Kong competition.

02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:12.040
His high score is the new world record, 1,141,800 points.

02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:19.440
That is pretty small victory over a Hank Chen score, which was only about 3000 less.

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:25.360
This is kind of neat too, is that Robbie Lakeman would actually stream his attempts.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:29.920
And for whatever reason, the one where he actually broke the record was not streamed,

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:31.920
but he did upload it after the fact.

02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.640
So you can actually watch an entire four hour stream or not, sorry, not stream, but four

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:37.640
hour video.

02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:41.460
Cause that's the era we live in of this dude breaking the record and you could learn a

02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:45.180
tip or two on this 30 year old game if you would like.

02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:46.920
So there you go.

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:50.520
But that's kind of neat though, that we live in that era now of like, you know, we can

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.440
watch people shatter high scores live.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:56.800
Like it used to be, you know, you had to have a copy of the tape.

02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:00.720
Somebody would have a VHS tape that they were recording to send to Twin Galaxies or you

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.320
know, whatever magazine or whatever was to keep track of the high scores.

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.320
Twin Galaxies isn't around anymore.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.600
They relaunched as like a new thing.

02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:11.280
It's like a 24 hour streaming channel now or something.

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.960
So do you still do all that bullshit where you got to like tape everything?

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.440
I have no idea to be honest.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:23.080
I sort of think live streaming kind of negates that, but I know because they still, they

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.360
had to like, for a member back when like I was going to do, make the attempt that, you

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:35.960
know, trying to break the arcade world record thing for that stupid Ready Player One contest,

02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:42.080
Twin Galaxies, like you had to record like video of the board that you're using and stuff

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.280
like that.

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:46.400
And it has to be like, there's no breaks in it whatsoever.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.840
And the way you have to film it is very specific.

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.840
So I don't know.

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.560
It'd be interesting to see.

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:54.160
I don't know if like that would count.

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.480
Tiger Claw links the website so you can find out twingalaxies.com so you can check that

02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.480
out.

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.920
Yeah, I'm too lazy to look at that.

02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:05.440
William Murderface suggests that we need the King of Kong 2 electric boogaloo.

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.440
I agree.

02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.880
Or the Donkey Kong Jr. race.

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:09.880
Donkey Kong 3?

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:10.880
Anybody?

02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.320
Anybody play Donkey Kong 3?

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.320
Which was...

02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.320
I did.

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320
I tried to forget that.

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:17.880
When they, when they tried to turn a platformer into a shooter.

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:18.880
Anybody?

02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:24.880
Alright, anyway, um, let's see, uh, we are going to, yes, Sjoan Undermat says Twin Galaxies

02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:26.840
is under totally new management, I believe.

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:27.840
That is, that is true.

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.080
Alright, um, let's, let's go into the mailbag.

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:36.720
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com and Dark Soccer dives

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.600
in the mailbag and pulls out some emails that she thinks are worth reading on the program.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.600
Yep.

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.200
We've got two weeks to build up some emails.

02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:45.200
All four of them.

02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:46.480
Alright, well, they better be good.

02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:49.920
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:53.860
I hear you all talking about Porter Robinson on the last podcast and how his music on his

02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:57.040
latest album was inspired by various video games.

02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:00.080
I thought it'd be interesting for you guys to know that Porter actually got his start

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.120
in electronic music because he was turned on to the genre while playing DDR and other

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:07.840
Bimani games with his brothers when they were kids in North Carolina.

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.200
They are huge rhythm game nerds and Porter frequently answers interviewers asking why

02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.300
he got into making music by saying he played DDR.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:19.900
In fact, I actually met his brother Nick, who now produces video content for Revision3

02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:24.260
at California Extreme a few years ago while playing DDR Extreme reminiscing about the

02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:26.020
good old days of DDR.

02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:29.940
Just thought you guys would find that fact interesting considering the roots of the show.

02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:30.940
Yours truly, AZHP.

02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:32.900
Pretty fun to have on the show then.

02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:33.900
Yeah, right?

02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:34.900
P.S.

02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:35.900
Open invite.

02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:40.260
P.S. Porter says his favorite city in the country he's visited during his tours is San

02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:43.300
Francisco and he wants to settle down there at some point so we must be doing something

02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.300
right.

02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:48.420
But 573 is coming up, hello.

02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:54.540
But in all seriousness, it is really fascinating that we're at this point where this, you know,

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:58.740
DDR is kind of an old, DDR qualifies as a classic game of the week.

02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:01.780
You know, it's that old and this show has been around for 12 years.

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:03.140
I did play something.

02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:04.580
Now I remember why I was out.

02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:05.580
I'm sorry.

02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:07.420
I do remember something now.

02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:08.420
Oh, alright.

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:09.660
Here's why I was out.

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:10.660
Now I remember.

02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:16.740
Because I went to, I went to my brother-in-law's, well soon to be brother-in-law's bachelor

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:17.740
party.

02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.740
Wasn't anything great.

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:19.740
We went to Dave & Buster's.

02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:27.600
But I played DDR X2, I don't know, so I played a little bit of that.

02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.940
But that's why I was out.

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.780
You realized you were old and out of shape.

02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:32.300
Oh, I already knew that.

02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:33.300
We weren't going into it.

02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:37.860
Like I played, I didn't play, I played one game with doubles and I was just all singles,

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:39.100
you know, from there on out.

02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:43.100
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but a friend of mine wanted to play some music

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:46.740
games on Xbox with Kinect yesterday, so we played Just Dance.

02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:52.180
And I also had that whole like, wow, I'm old and out of shape moment after like three songs.

02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:58.380
That's why, because she had to watch the kids, so I had to take the night off because it

02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:02.620
wouldn't be fair that she had to watch the kids for two nights.

02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:03.620
That's what it was.

02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:04.620
Now I remember.

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:09.740
Well, anyway, but the fact that DDR is so old that like it's an influential game like

02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:10.740
that.

02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:14.820
I mean, it influenced this show, but it's interesting that, you know, you have this

02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:19.020
generation that DDR influenced from a musical perspective.

02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:21.580
That's so fascinating to me.

02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:23.140
Anyway, very cool email.

02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:24.140
Thank you.

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:25.140
We didn't have DDR.

02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:28.140
We wouldn't have Just Dance or Dance Central or any of that.

02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.140
Yeah.

02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:30.140
None of it.

02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:32.460
Hello, escorts in the realm of Podtopia.

02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:33.700
Hi.

02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:37.660
With all the recent talk of PT Silent Hills and the upcoming yearly Rocktober holiday

02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:43.220
of Halloween, I'm curious what you would say is the most scary game you've ever played.

02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:47.820
Not the best game that is scary, but the game that scared the ever living fuck out of you.

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:48.820
Mine is Nintendogs.

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:51.100
Curse you, Sinophobia.

02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:52.340
Stay black, redertainment.

02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:56.540
This message has been brought to you by PT on Xbox One and other things that may never

02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:57.540
happen.

02:18:57.540 --> 02:18:59.180
Trainer.

02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:03.940
I remember playing Resident Evil when the dogs burst through or yeah, when the dogs

02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:06.060
was it Resident Evil or Resident Evil 2?

02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.060
Yeah.

02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:10.460
When the dogs burst through the window, I'm like, holy crap.

02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:11.460
And then that was it.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:16.660
Because, but you saw, you've, I squealed during the PT that actually kind of, it wasn't like

02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:22.540
a scare as much as the things that actually frightened me are like games that features

02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:26.540
clowns and that's why I will not play Five Nights at Freddy's because whenever, if I

02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:31.900
see an animatronic that isn't working, it freaks the ever living fuck out of me.

02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:33.940
That is definitely a game on my list to stream.

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:37.420
I have a little growing list of things I want to do YouTubes and streams out of.

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:44.860
I will not be able to play that just because it hits like an old phobia of mine.

02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:48.580
I mean, I might, and then I might go barf for an hour.

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:51.140
Don't watch commercials for the next American Horror Story either.

02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:53.340
Do I watch TV?

02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:55.820
They show up on Facebook, so careful.

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:56.820
I have adblock.

02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:59.500
Loki, is there a game that super scared you?

02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:03.100
No, I don't really play any of these like super scary games.

02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:04.660
I just not interested in them.

02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:05.980
I do have Among the Sleep.

02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:06.980
I should play that.

02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:10.700
That's supposed to be pretty creepy, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that on my

02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.220
Steam backlog right now.

02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:16.940
Loki and I were roommates when Silent Hill 4 The Room came out and I was playing through

02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:21.700
that and I was like screaming and Loki was like, shut up.

02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:22.700
I don't remember that.

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:27.100
I was so scared in that game that just made me nauseous and that's when you find the giant

02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:28.100
head.

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:29.100
Yes.

02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:30.100
Oh my God.

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:31.100
That scared the hell out of me.

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:33.380
But it was more, it's more when you, there's this one place where you like kind of fall

02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:36.900
down and you land on the bottom and then all of a sudden these two headed little baby monster

02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:39.500
start going and they like start running at you.

02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:44.180
And I started like screaming and Loki's like, what the hell's going on over there?

02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.420
Like a concerned dad.

02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:46.420
I wasn't.

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:50.300
That was a polite way of saying shut up.

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:54.820
I would say though, honestly, the scariest game I've probably played, like scariest experience,

02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:56.460
turn all the lights off.

02:20:56.460 --> 02:21:02.940
Well now it's a tie because Quake, uh, with all the lights off and the headphones and

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:06.700
just staring at the monitor and playing Quake, that's actually super scary because the first

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:10.060
person and everything, especially when that game was out, you know, the graphics are a

02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:11.260
little bit ahead of its time.

02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:13.820
That was really scary to me because you turn a corner and then monster.

02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:18.940
I guess the, the, well, the recently, I'll kind of, it had like a moment in there would

02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:21.700
have been, uh, the original Bioshock.

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:26.060
Like there's the one, especially that one scene where you're, you know, going around

02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:29.460
through like the, um, I think it was a lab or something like that.

02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:36.180
And like the, this gas or, um, some sort of like line burst and like it's steamy and you

02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:40.060
turn around and there's a guy like Santa right in front of you and you're just like, ah,

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.060
die, die, die.

02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.380
Uh, but then the other one I'm thinking of.

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:47.100
Actually, even though this wasn't, you know, the best of the silent Hill games, I was playing

02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:49.740
silent Hill homecoming home alone.

02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:54.660
I actually want to play that one during a rainstorm and it was dark and there was a

02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:58.840
scene where like the ceiling falls and all this stuff like falls down and it scared the

02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.840
shit out of me.

02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.580
And then I got up and I saw the front door had blown open and that was the moment I said,

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.180
Nope, Nope, Nope.

02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:09.780
Turned off the three 60 shut the door, went in my room and crawled into the covers.

02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:10.780
Nope.

02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:11.780
DS night.

02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:17.060
Didn't they, didn't they do though, um, a game based off of the ring that came out in

02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.060
Japan.

02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:20.700
Yeah, they'd had it on the Wii.

02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:23.040
I actually, I actually want that game.

02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:29.060
I wanted to play it, but I wanted to play like, I want like a game like that where you

02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:31.500
die in the end, you know, cause there's no happy endings.

02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:32.500
They had one.

02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:35.860
Well, I don't remember if it was a rain, but they had the one, it was, God, I don't remember

02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:36.860
these movies anymore.

02:22:36.860 --> 02:22:38.540
It's the one that was the grudge.

02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:39.540
Yeah.

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:44.380
Cause there were also a bunch of TV movies and cause the ring series just got stupid

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:46.140
in Japan with the Sadako 3d.

02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:47.200
It was awful.

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:48.540
That was a bad movie.

02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:49.540
Um, let's see.

02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:52.120
Fifth dream says I couldn't play PT.

02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:55.020
Even watching sky play freaked me out for a couple days.

02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.020
Oh, live.vognetwork.com.

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:59.540
Oh, let's move on to the next email.

02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:00.540
Sorry.

02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:01.780
Next email.

02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:06.540
Hey, orange lounge, I've been playing through divinity original sin and it's kicking my

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:07.540
ass.

02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:08.540
I'm struggling.

02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:12.060
Completing objectives is almost like getting that good grade after hours of studying for

02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:13.060
a test.

02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:16.020
What was the, what were the most difficult games that you've ever played that made you

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:18.460
rage and smile all at the same time?

02:23:18.460 --> 02:23:19.460
Much love.

02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:23.100
EA skeezy from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.820
Rage and smile at the same time.

02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:33.420
I guess that sense of accomplishment for making it through something super meat boy.

02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:37.380
I got that with fractal, any mega man game.

02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:38.380
Fractal.

02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:39.380
Mega man two.

02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:40.380
Mega man two.

02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:41.380
Mega man nine recently.

02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:42.380
Oh my God.

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:45.400
I haven't even played, I bought that and I never played it.

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:46.900
Now's the best time.

02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:50.340
But you remember when I was on my really big fractal kick?

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:51.340
Hmm.

02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:55.060
Just getting into level 30 on fractal cause each level was like a struggle.

02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:57.860
I would try for days to pass one level.

02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:02.500
And then I was like, because me, I love my puzzle games and just being good at fractal.

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:07.620
And then, um, there was a one day that while I was intensely intoxicated playing on Wendell's

02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:16.660
uh, uh, PSP that I got to like, what was it, 25 on, um, uh, great, now I can't think of

02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:22.260
the name, that puzzle game that has Luminesce while I was drunk and I could never do it

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:23.260
again.

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:27.140
And then I was like, I have a level 25, oh, that was great.

02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:32.420
Um, ask me this question again about level 85 and wow.

02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:36.300
Ask me this question again about rage inducing games that you love when I lose my hardcore

02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.260
character in Diablo three, especially if I end up live streaming that big moment that

02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:44.780
I lose my hardcore character because that's going to be a table flipping moment.

02:24:44.780 --> 02:24:47.100
How high is your hardcore character right now?

02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:48.220
Right now I just beat act two.

02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:50.140
I think I'm only 28 so it's not that far.

02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:54.140
I have, I have to get to 70 but I'm, I'm playing conservative right now.

02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:55.420
I'm not trying to push it too much.

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:59.100
I'm making sure I'm a little out geared, but we'll see.

02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.580
I'll give you updates cause I'm really sucked into this right now.

02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:02.580
Like that's my goal.

02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:03.700
That's my current goal of the moment.

02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:08.180
Destiny will veer me off track for a little bit, but I'll, I'll, I can only sit in front

02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:12.260
of the PlayStation for so long before I'll end up back at the PC.

02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:13.260
Next email.

02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:14.260
Last email.

02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:15.260
Last email.

02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:18.500
Hi, I've been a long time listener since the live three 65 days.

02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:21.860
I don't have too much to add, but I do want to thank you for all the hard work you guys

02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:22.860
put into your show.

02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:27.020
I really do enjoy listening to the different perspectives of the events of the gaming industry

02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:30.260
and I was looking forward to hearing from you three or sometimes four or five.

02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:31.260
You get the idea.

02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:33.380
I hope all is well and take care.

02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:34.620
And that's from needle crash.

02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:36.580
Oh, is that no question?

02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:37.580
Nope.

02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.580
Just a nice wow.

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:39.580
Happy email.

02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.580
Well, that's awesome.

02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:41.580
Thank you.

02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:42.580
I love the happy emails.

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.580
Thank you.

02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:46.820
And while you have been listening to us for a long time, you know what's funny and you're

02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:47.820
still here.

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:54.300
I've been randomly meeting people at Dragon Con even this happened and just through some

02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:58.500
other events where people are like, yeah, you know, I've never really emailed or called

02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.260
or said anything, but I've been listening since the live 365 days and I'm like, well,

02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:04.260
nice to meet you.

02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:05.260
Thank you for showing up.

02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:07.820
I'm always just blown away by how long people have been around.

02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:14.020
I wouldn't know what we're doing because it doesn't feel like we're really doing much,

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:15.220
but I guess we are.

02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:18.580
I think in some ways, not to get too sappy on you.

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:20.020
It's not what we're doing.

02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:23.020
It's what we're not doing.

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:24.700
That could be part of it.

02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:28.860
I think in some ways, it's like that bar cheers, right?

02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:29.860
Right.

02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:31.580
It's the old 80s sitcom cheers.

02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:33.900
Does that mean I get to sit in the corner and drink beer?

02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:37.780
You are definitely Rhea Perlman.

02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:40.060
I would be Ted Danson.

02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:41.060
Loki's Kirstie Alley.

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.060
No, no, no.

02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.620
No, no, no, no.

02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:46.620
You are Norm.

02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:47.620
He'd be our Norm.

02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:48.620
He'd be Norm.

02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:53.380
I would say Rama's more the norm because every time, every week when he calls, Norm, Rama,

02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:54.380
right?

02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:59.340
But anyway, all that joking aside, I think it's this place and we've tried really hard

02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:02.580
to build a welcoming place, like no jerks allowed, right?

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:06.740
A welcoming place where we can just sit around and talk about video games.

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:10.660
And even when I don't agree with you guys, and there's some of you guys in chat that

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:15.420
I disagree with an awful lot, you know who you are, but I respect you and I respect your

02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:16.420
opinion.

02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:20.300
And I think the fact that we all respect each other in that way and have helped create that

02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:24.900
environment has helped the longevity of this show in a way you guys can't even imagine

02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:27.260
because we don't tolerate that disrespect.

02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:30.780
We're not going to allow that type of environment because that's what's going to make people

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:32.100
not want to be here.

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:36.420
So and if you'd rather participate quietly, then that's cool too.

02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:40.020
Just know that if you ever want to speak up, we're here to listen.

02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:42.060
Every gamer has a voice.

02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:43.900
And it might be mine.

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:48.740
It is yours an awful lot, but we love you.

02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:54.460
I'm the one reading the emails unless I have, you know, laryngitis or something.

02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.180
And those are the days when I sound like this.

02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:01.140
Hi, this is Jamie, you're listening to Orange Lost Radio.

02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:05.700
Now you sound like one of those anti-smoking commercials or something.

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:07.860
I sound like the tracheotomy cow.

02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:08.860
You do.

02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:09.860
You do.

02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:15.220
Actually, I sound like one of the Simpson sisters, Marja sisters.

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:16.220
Patty and Selma.

02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:17.220
Patty and Selma.

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:18.220
I love Patty and Selma.

02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:19.220
All right.

02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:20.220
Yeah, that's it.

02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:23.980
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send us an email.

02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.580
And if you want to send a very kind email like that one was, then you know what?

02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:30.340
Those emails really make my fricking day.

02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:33.140
So I appreciate that you even take 30 seconds to type that out.

02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:37.220
If you want to send an email that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck, then I'll read that

02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:38.220
too and then hit delete.

02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:39.220
And then we'll laugh.

02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:46.020
No, but again, I, I don't always agree with some of the opinions, but I respect them.

02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:50.700
As long as you're, I like things that as long as you treat respectful discussion, yes.

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:52.160
As long as you treat people respectfully.

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:53.160
That's all I care about.

02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:55.940
Sometimes we're going to get heated here in the, here in the room.

02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:59.620
We've all had, we've had the dark soccer and I have gotten into it.

02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:00.620
Dark soccer, Loki gotten into it.

02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:04.700
I've gotten into it, Loki, but we all respect each other a ton and more and more every week

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:05.700
that we still are.

02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:08.780
And then Rob buys Mass Effect 3 on Wii U.

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:11.100
You only, you only said that cause Shane walked in.

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:15.140
I know, but it's funny, Shane, did you hear what happened earlier in the show?

02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:24.140
I bought, I bought Mass Effect 3 on Wii U because it was $13 on Amazon, but, but, but

02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:25.140
I own it.

02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:27.900
Shane, Shane, no one can hear anything that he's saying.

02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:31.900
Shane said you could have borrowed mine for free and figured out that it's garbage.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.980
But now Shane, now you don't understand.

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:36.860
Now Shane, I own Mass Effect 3, every single version or Mass Effect.

02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:38.900
You don't sound like Harvey Fierstein.

02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:42.900
Shane, come here and get on a mic if you're going to keep talking.

02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:46.900
We're doing a show.

02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:47.900
You're talking to everybody else.

02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:51.420
I was just saying, why did you buy that when we need to buy cables for iPhones and we could

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:52.420
have combined the order.

02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:53.420
Why?

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:54.420
Porque no los dos?

02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:59.100
I don't understand Mexican.

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:00.100
Get out.

02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:01.100
Okay.

02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:09.980
You know what, apparently I sound like Aunt Slappy and Aunt Slappy sounds like an old

02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:10.980
Jewish woman.

02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:11.980
All right.

02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:17.900
I'm, I am falling more and more into the stereotype of my adopted culture.

02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:18.900
All right.

02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:19.900
I'm no good at saving money.

02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:21.540
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.020
You ready for the FUs of the week?

02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:24.020
Here we go.

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:45.980
I am surprisingly good with my lot in life right now.

02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:54.820
The only things I have to say about FU is people who don't know how to support their

02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:58.940
ideology without using fallacious arguments.

02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:02.860
Therefore I have decided that henceforth, anytime I disagree with somebody, I'm just

02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:06.660
going to point out how the argument sucks and how they've actually spouted a logical

02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:09.700
fallacy and tell them to talk to me when they can actually debate.

02:31:09.700 --> 02:31:11.740
Like we learned how to do in school.

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:15.620
Is that similar to how on Twitter I have a policy where if people try to troll me with

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:19.540
that messages, I just respond with a RuPaul's drag race gift?

02:31:19.540 --> 02:31:25.100
Kind of, but like for example, it's like, Oh, well marijuana is a slippery slope to

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:26.100
this and that.

02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:30.220
Slippery slope arguments are considered fallacious.

02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:34.740
I need something with numbers and proof behind it.

02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:38.460
Maybe they just need to smoke some weed and chill out.

02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:41.620
This is like, um, you know, I don't, I don't do marijuana for the record, but I don't care

02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:45.660
if you just used, uh, an emotion, emotional reasoning instead of logical reasoning.

02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:48.420
I want you to rephrase that using proof.

02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:49.420
All right.

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:50.420
Loki, your review of the week.

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:51.420
You know what I say?

02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:54.860
It's snow covered mountains are slippery slope.

02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:55.860
It's factual.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:32:00.580
Especially when you go sledding and they're extra slippery.

02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:02.060
Is that your FU of the week?

02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:06.900
No, I guess my FU of the week would be, I have nothing to do at work.

02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:11.300
I guess I could be looking for work, but it feels a little wrong to be looking for work

02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:12.300
at work.

02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:16.940
But since they're like, well, they're training people like on the new system, but I'm not

02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:19.300
one of those new people that they're trained on the system.

02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:25.380
And then, then apparently they're keeping a couple reps from our Dallas office for some

02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:26.380
reason.

02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:31.180
I don't know, but they wanted to keep some outside reps instead of paying for one rep

02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:33.860
to be in our Folsom house, but whatever.

02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:39.020
So I've got to get them up to speed on my accounts, but they don't give a shit.

02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:40.860
So fuck it.

02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:43.060
I don't give a shit too then.

02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:48.820
So I guess I have you to my boss and his boss for not fucking writing my rec letters or

02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:49.820
recommendation.

02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:52.420
Like I asked you, I fucking asked you like weeks ago.

02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:54.860
And then I reminded you again and you still haven't fucking done it.

02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.940
I'm only asking you one fucking thing.

02:32:56.940 --> 02:33:00.580
You can't give me a job, but the least you can do is fucking write me my goddamn letter

02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:02.040
of recommendations.

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:05.180
So I can apply for other jobs.

02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:06.180
What a mess.

02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:07.460
I hope you get through that quick.

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:08.460
Logie.

02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:10.540
Oh, well, like a couple more weeks or a few more weeks.

02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:14.580
So 30th, a few comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:17.860
Rama says marijuana is a slippery slope to me having an empty fridge.

02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:19.860
You know what I said?

02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:20.860
What?

02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:24.700
It's a slippery slip to Benadryl for me since I'm allergic and then that's a slippery slip

02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:25.700
to naps.

02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:26.700
Lots of naps.

02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:31.980
Uh, SSG100 Matt says what Jamie needs is for people to show her the receipts for their

02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:32.980
arguments.

02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:36.140
So people are actually buying their arguments or something.

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:37.900
I think it's a reference to the Whitney Houston.

02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:39.900
I want to see the receipts.

02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:42.620
According to the market on an argument.

02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:43.620
So sales.

02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:44.620
Hello.

02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:47.620
I'm here to have an argument.

02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:51.620
Oh, this is abuse.

02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:52.620
All right.

02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:53.620
Do I get to do my FUs of the week?

02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:54.620
Here's my FUs of the week.

02:33:54.620 --> 02:33:55.620
All right.

02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:56.620
Yes.

02:33:56.620 --> 02:33:57.620
Remember that whole thing about respect and all that.

02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:58.620
We all love and respect each other.

02:33:58.620 --> 02:33:59.620
Put that on hold for a minute.

02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:01.060
Put that on hold for a minute.

02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:02.700
Shut up lady.

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:07.900
My FU of the week goes to everybody with the exception of code man and fifth dream.

02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:08.900
My hype.

02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:09.900
My high five.

02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:15.540
F you to everybody who made fun of me for buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U.

02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:22.660
I'll do what I want rod buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U is like me having cheesecake

02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:23.660
for breakfast.

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:25.220
Well, I'm a grown up.

02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:26.500
What's the fucking problem?

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:28.500
I'm a grown up.

02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:29.500
Exactly.

02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:30.500
I'm a grown up.

02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:37.500
It's like as Gordon Modesto for Duncan.

02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:38.500
All right.

02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:40.100
Team adult.

02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:44.460
We know how to adult.

02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:48.980
Just a few more stories for you guys and then your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR

02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:53.440
and then, and then the week after that we go to San Francisco, just go to hot cookie.

02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:55.420
And then after that we go to LA.

02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:56.420
Just go to Disneyland.

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.420
All right.

02:34:57.420 --> 02:34:58.420
Calm down.

02:34:58.420 --> 02:34:59.420
Calm down.

02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:00.420
Put the car in park.

02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:03.380
Uh, one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:07.460
All one word, but first a couple more stories for you guys, uh, Loki.

02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:14.680
So Sega is locked in a courtroom battle with gearbox, um, regarding aliens, colonial Marines

02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:15.680
and some more.

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:23.080
Um, I guess testimony came out, um, on September 2nd and regarding, you know, how gearbox handled

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:27.940
the majority of the marketing of the game and, um, basically said the significant level

02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:35.060
of public relations, the anatomy and was demanded by the studio and to, you know, the TLDL of

02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:38.220
it is, um, or I messed that up.

02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:46.060
The TLDR of that is, um, basically gearbox president Randy Pitchford just did whatever

02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.060
the fuck he wanted.

02:35:47.060 --> 02:35:54.340
Uh, according to, uh, say guy just, just did what he wanted and, you know, uh, advertise

02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:55.720
the game however he wanted.

02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:00.700
And so they're blaming him for the fact that the game didn't quite meet what they were

02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:02.180
showing off at E3.

02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:08.980
And I don't know, it's a drama, a whole bunch of drama.

02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:12.180
No shortage of that in the gaming industry these past couple of weeks.

02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:17.460
I mean, I think right now they're trying to distance the fact that yes, it was gearbox

02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:23.200
that, you know, cause this game to suck and not Sega because Sega does have another aliens

02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:26.840
game coming out in like a month from now.

02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.460
So they probably want to establish that, yeah, it wasn't us, it was them.

02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:33.460
So that people buy that game.

02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.500
I think they've distanced enough from it.

02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.700
A lot of the, a lot of the people I think are pretty good about knowing that it's a

02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:41.460
different thing.

02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:44.580
That's the impression I get anyway, especially, especially when you've got Sigourney Weaver

02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:48.700
and some of the DLC, that's a pretty, pretty big land, you know?

02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:49.700
Yeah.

02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:55.260
So, all right, well, uh, I got one more thing for you guys here and it has to do with a

02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:58.160
possible competitor to Steam and Origin.

02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:03.640
Another challenger enters the ring, and that could be Warner Brothers, now keep in mind

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:08.880
this is all rumor, however, Warner Brothers filed a series of trademark applications this

02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:14.720
past week for something called WB Play, covering things like, quote, online retail store services,

02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:19.040
quote, audio and video broadcasting services, and quote, entertainment service.

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:22.600
And also, quote, downloadable virtual goods.

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:25.040
So hmm, very interesting.

02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.280
Warner Brothers has used Steam and Origin in the past, but possibly they're going to

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:30.720
come up with their own thing.

02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.880
Uh, again, you have to really tinfoil hat this an awful lot, but it's not like we haven't

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.440
seen companies kind of try to do their own thing and try to have that central, you know,

02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:42.120
hub for their stuff.

02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:47.280
You know, Ubisoft has one, EA's got that whole pass online, well, and they have Origin, right?

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:49.600
So well, yeah, and it can go one of two ways.

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:54.960
I mean, it could be like Uplay where their games are offered on Uplay and they're offered

02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:00.040
on the Steam store, or it could be like Origin where their games aren't usually offered on

02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:02.400
the Steam store, it's just on Origin.

02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:10.440
So hopefully it's more like, you know, Uplay, but I don't know.

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:15.040
Warner does some weird, having worked in the industry with Warner Brothers on the movie

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:20.080
side, they do some really strange shit, and then they turn around and do some other strange

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.960
shit and it just keeps going on and on like that, and even if it doesn't make any fucking

02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:29.840
sense they will keep sticking with it like, oh, they're going to sell direct to everybody,

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:33.600
oh, they're not going to sell direct to everybody, oh, they're going to do that again, oh, they're

02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:38.360
not going to sell to, you know, distribution, they're going to just, you know, limit rental

02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:40.040
windows, oh, they're not going to do that.

02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.080
It's just like, ugh, I can't follow what they're doing anymore.

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.160
Um, so, I could see them doing this, whether it's successful or not, but they're going

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:52.640
to stick with it, and if anything, they may do this just for, you know, not only games

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.080
but movies as well, you know, have a platform where they can digitally distribute their

02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:58.080
products.

02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.240
Well, now, WBPlay is going to be something because the domain name, wbplay.com, it was

02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:08.240
registered back in 2013, but they're not doing anything with it right now, so clearly something

02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.040
is going to happen with this, and, gee, the launch of Batman Arkham Origins would be a

02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:17.000
great time to kick the wall down with launching something, especially with the Mortal Kombat

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:21.760
10, or Mortal Kombat X, excuse me, just around the corner as well, so, you know, 2015 would

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:24.680
be a great year for Warner Brothers to make a move in that department.

02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.760
I'm all for competition, but at the same time, Origin was, I don't like the whole, like,

02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:35.000
required thing, and yes, I realize Steam started this way, but Steam's been around so long

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.440
now that time and an epic amount of Steam sales have really healed a lot of things.

02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:43.160
So I just hope if Warner Brothers is going to do their own thing, I just don't want it

02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:44.600
to be mandatory.

02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:46.400
Make me want to install it.

02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:50.200
Do something that's going to make me want to get on there and use the service.

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:51.200
That's all.

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.120
That's all I want.

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:54.640
Is that a fair request, Loki?

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:55.640
Yeah.

02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.640
All right.

02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.920
Speaking of Steam, just a real quick update, they did do a client beta update that does

02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:08.840
some in-home streaming, I guess, optimizations and some updates for AMD, so some more video

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:13.520
cards supported there for the in-home streaming support, so stay on top of your Steam beta

02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:16.080
updates if that's something that's of interest to you.

02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.360
All right.

02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:18.360
Now we're done.

02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:19.680
We're to the calls.

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:20.680
So let's open it up.

02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:25.740
Skypline is open right now, 1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:28.800
And in the meantime, I'm going to get to the Twitters, because I know we had a few Twitter

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:30.280
topics tonight.

02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.160
While I bring up Twitter, does Loki have any last minute stories he wants to cover?

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:35.960
Uh, no.

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:36.960
Really?

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.320
It's like Borderlands 2's coming to Linux.

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:41.320
That's kind of cool.

02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:42.320
Oh, that's cool.

02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:47.480
I don't know why this was even news anywhere, but apparently, yeah, the new 3DS models,

02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:50.680
they're region-locked as well.

02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:51.760
Really is that a shock?

02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.880
Because the original 3DS and 3DS XL were region-locked as well.

02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:59.640
What made you think they were going to all of a sudden change their mind on that?

02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:05.400
Although honestly, if it wasn't region-locked, they might sell a few more systems, but yeah.

02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:06.400
I have the reasons.

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:09.800
If the new 3DS was not region-locked, I'd buy one in a heartbeat.

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:12.520
Anyway, let's go ahead and go to the phones, because the phones are lighting up.

02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:13.520
Let's get to it.

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:15.520
Who's this?

02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:16.520
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:17.520
This is Kaijuto.

02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:18.520
Hey, Kaijuto.

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:19.520
What's up, buddy?

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:24.960
I got to put my two cents into the new 3DS, and also I want to let you guys know about

02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:27.880
a news story that I think that you should cover maybe later that I haven't really seen

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:28.880
in the news.

02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:29.880
Okay.

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:32.520
So I'm going to try to make it all quick so you can get to another phone call.

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:39.760
The 3DS, I'm pretty much convinced that everything about the new 3DS is to fix whatever

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:41.960
everybody felt was wrong about the current 3DS.

02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:46.840
If you think about it, the faster web browser, like Loki mentioned, a lot of people complained

02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:48.880
about that when the 3DS came out.

02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:52.560
Also, a lot of people hated the fact that I never had this problem, but people were

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:57.720
saying, if you look too far off to the side, you lose the 3D, and what do you see now in

02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.720
the new 3DS?

02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.060
It's like you can tilt it a little further, so that means that more people can stand around

02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:05.440
you at the bus stop and watch you play your 3D game.

02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:09.920
The thumbsticks, which I mentioned before, the extra shoulder buttons, which makes it

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.840
sound like they're making it for hardcore gamers, so-called hardcore gamers.

02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:18.640
The SD card slot, that's another thing that people wanted, and hopefully with all this,

02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:22.400
they'll bring back picture chat, or whatever the hell that thing was called.

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.640
Oh, the swap note.

02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:25.120
Yeah, swap note, yeah.

02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:26.120
That would be great.

02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:27.640
They're willing to bring that back.

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.720
Is that why there's going to be a 60 cent lock on this maybe with the parental controls?

02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:32.720
That actually-

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:33.720
I wouldn't doubt it.

02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.720
Huh, interesting thought.

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:39.160
That's a good thought, and here's where I stand with the new 3DS.

02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:42.320
As much crap as we've kind of been giving you here, especially over the name and things

02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:46.680
like that, ultimately, golden rule, we've said this before, our system is only as good

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:48.080
as the games that are on it.

02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:51.380
All I'm hearing right now is that, oh, we're going to get Xenoblade, which was already

02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:55.060
done on the Wii and have already played, so that alone is not enough to convince me to

02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:58.780
replace my XL, which works for the 3DS library just fine.

02:42:58.780 --> 02:43:01.960
Some of these other features, they all sound good and cool and things like that, and yay

02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:06.240
for the people that don't already have a 3DS, but eh, I can play my 3DS games just

02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.240
fine right now.

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:08.240
I'm not going to-

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.780
A lot of fans, a lot of fans of the current 3DS, I mean, it's almost like they pretty

02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:17.200
much heard people's cries and they fixed them.

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.200
Obviously, that's not their main reason.

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:26.120
Their ultimate goal, of course, is to make money, but yeah, to me, I applaud them for

02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.800
doing it because I think that they're actually listening to their fans and trying to correct

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:30.800
the mistakes.

02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:34.880
Y'all know that the, what the hell is it, the 3D XL, whatever the hell it's called,

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:37.280
I mean, people were complaining about the screen being too small.

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:38.280
They fixed that.

02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:41.760
It seems like they just seem to make the 3DS for everyone.

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.880
People hated the 3D, you got the 2DS, you know, it's like, you know, I think it's a

02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.880
good thing.

02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:49.880
I don't know if I'm going to buy it anytime soon, but it's a good thing.

02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:54.480
See, see, wait a minute.

02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:59.360
At the end of the day, I'll try to put cynical Rob aside and say, you know what, if Nintendo

02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.640
is really listening to people, and I really hope you're right, that this is what they're

02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:09.720
trying to do, is they're really trying to listen to people, that would be fantastic.

02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:11.160
I do hope you're right in that regard.

02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.480
I'm a little skeptical if that's really the case, but I would love it if it is the case.

02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:16.480
I'm almost sure of it.

02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:19.480
All right, let me get to this real quick and I'll let you get to a call.

02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.000
You guys got to find out about what's going on with CraftBucket and Minecraft.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.600
I know that, Loki, you used CraftBucket for your server, right?

02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:29.000
Yeah, I did.

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:31.560
They kind of already explained what went on with that.

02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.880
It's just that I guess the original dev or whatever doesn't want to work on it anymore,

02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:40.640
and apparently it was purchased by Mojang at one point, and so they're going to continue

02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:45.720
development on it, at least for 1.8, internally within Mojang, and they're going to release

02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:46.720
that at some point.

02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:53.400
And I don't know where Minecraft's officially supported mod singing works into it.

02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:58.920
I can only hope that, I mean, fuck, I'll switch over to whatever they have if it, you know,

02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:01.840
supports what I want to run on it.

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:02.840
So we'll see.

02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:08.320
You know, it would be nice to have one unified thing that I don't have to wait for, oh, CraftBucket

02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:13.640
to update to support 1.8, you know, because right now I'm on 1.79.

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:14.640
I don't know.

02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:17.440
I hope it's better.

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.440
I don't know, man.

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.240
With Mojang, I mean, it took them a year just to come out with 1.8.

02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.600
I mean, I know it's a big update, but it took them a year.

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:27.960
Those guys have proven to be super slow.

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.960
I don't know what the hell they're doing over there drinking goat milk or whatever the hell,

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:39.160
but they don't seem to do things on time, and they changed their mind, because I remember

02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:43.800
back in 2011, we were supposed to get the mod API, and all of a sudden, I didn't know

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:46.480
where we got runs, which doesn't make any sense to me.

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:48.880
They're doing a lot of tweaks, though, to the game.

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:54.400
I saw kind of a development article about how they're redoing their calling engine for

02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:59.480
it and stuff to make it a lot faster, because remember, you know, if your chunks aren't

02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:03.120
loading or whatever, you can see kind of in the distance and see all these different caves

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:09.520
and stuff that are down there, where now that's all going to be culled out so that your CPU

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:12.960
isn't trying to render shit that you're nowhere near.

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.240
So I think that's great, and they were doing that for the Pocket Edition, I think, mainly,

02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.240
but I'm sure they can apply that to the regular edition as well, and that only means better

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:23.760
performance.

02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:29.200
I kind of wish they would move out of, you know, using Java for everything, but I mean,

02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:32.140
that's just the way the game's built, I guess.

02:46:32.140 --> 02:46:37.420
It would be nice to see some sort of, you know, boost for, you know, having a nice graphics

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:38.420
card and stuff like that.

02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:42.960
I don't know, I just don't really see that with their client.

02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:47.200
But I'm hopeful once they do get the mod API support out there, and once, you know, maybe

02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.160
even if, you know, CraftBucket gets updated to 1.8, it doesn't matter that they're, you

02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:57.200
know, not getting every single little update, it's just, you know, you can fill the gaps

02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:00.600
in with a lot of stuff that, a lot of the mods that they have on there.

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:05.440
I kind of wish that they would have, you know, like, Forge support where you can make your

02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:11.360
own, you know, characters and, you know, stuff in there, like, that's really what I wanted

02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:15.400
to have, is like, was it CraftForge or whatever, I forget how they, I don't remember what it's

02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:16.400
called, but basically...

02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:19.400
Yeah, SpoutBucket, Craft, all types of Craft.

02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:24.600
Yeah, it's like so many different, like, offshoots of, you know, Bucket, you know, of like, SpoutCraft

02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:30.160
or something like that, where you can, you know, combine, you know, Bucket plug-ins with,

02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.440
you know, just the, all this user-generated stuff, you know, new blocks, new enemies,

02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:38.680
new all sorts of things, that would be pretty awesome.

02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:45.040
But honestly, if they make it easier to put stuff in there mod-wise, at least on a server

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:49.000
than they have with Bucket, because Bucket is kind of a pain in the ass sometimes, I'm

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
all for that.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Yeah.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
It's glitchy, it's buggy as hell.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.520
I mean, I have a server on it, and, I mean, I'm always, like, you know, having to remove

02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:02.880
something and putting something back in, downgrading, upgrading, it's a mess, so I'm what you're

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:03.880
saying.

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:06.320
All right, well, Kaijuto, buddy, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but have

02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:07.840
a good one, and thanks for the call.

02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:08.840
Good perspectives.

02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:09.840
All right.

02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:10.840
Later, buddy.

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:15.680
All right, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to

02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:16.680
give us a call.

02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.000
Meanwhile, I'm reading some Twitter topics, so I wait for another call to come in.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:26.120
Alan Alchemy tweeted us earlier today, saying, another OLR challenge for me, all three hosts

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:30.240
play Hatoful Boyfriend for How Is Your Gaming Week.

02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:32.840
Loki will say no, in parentheses.

02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:35.680
I want to do it, I want to check out this game for sure.

02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:38.240
I will say no, because I don't have money to buy that game, and honestly, I don't need

02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:40.520
yet another game in my backlog.

02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:43.840
What if Alan gifted it to you?

02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:45.400
It looks silly, but I don't want it.

02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:46.480
I don't really want it.

02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:51.720
It's not my type of game, yeah, it's funny, it's pigeons and birds and stuff, it's a dating

02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:55.880
sim, it's hilarious, but I think it's just going to get old so fast, like once you get

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.680
past that joke, it's just whatever.

02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:58.840
Will Jamie play it?

02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:01.000
Hatoful Boyfriend, Dating Pigeons?

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
I've already played it.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Oh, well then-

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.600
Not the new one, but I've played the old releases.

02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:07.520
You should play the new one, and tell us which they are.

02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:08.520
Well, maybe I will.

02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:09.520
All right, we'll see.

02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:10.520
Anyway, we're going to go to the phones again.

02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:11.520
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:13.520
Hey everyone, this is Norm Peterson.

02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:14.520
Hey, Norm!

02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:15.520
Hey, everybody.

02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:17.920
What up, my friend?

02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:18.920
Not much, not much.

02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:19.920
Did you appreciate that comparison?

02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:25.080
Oh yeah, and the funny thing is, I was about to shout in the chat room, that's me, before

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:27.320
you said it.

02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:32.880
You know what though, to be fair, there's a lot of regular callers to OLR that I feel

02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:36.680
rightfully share the title of, Norm.

02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:39.680
You're very good at getting through first or second, though.

02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:43.840
I actually gave you a shout out on one of the panels, and I don't even remember, it

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:49.520
was because we were talking about just creating that kind of environment, and I actually asked

02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:53.560
the room, I asked the room, I said, how many of you guys here listen to OLR?

02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:56.480
And a good chance, I was surprised, I was like, wow, a lot of the hands actually went

02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:57.480
up.

02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:00.960
And I said, could you guys imagine an episode of OrangeLoungeRadio where Rama doesn't call

02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:01.960
in?

02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:02.960
And I got a resounding, no!

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:08.960
So I'm a ratings bringer!

02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.920
Something like that, something like that.

02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:12.880
I thought you would appreciate that story.

02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:13.920
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:19.280
Well, I just wanted to make sure I got everybody's orders correct, so Rob, you want three bags

02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:26.440
of pumpkin spice latte, Jamie wants a dozen donuts, shrink-wrapped, freeze-dried sent

02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.320
to her, and Loki wants a large black coffee, right?

02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:32.320
Loki doesn't drink coffee.

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:35.600
No, this is vacuum-sealed, that way they stay fresh.

02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:40.120
Okay, that's why I was calling the order back over to make sure I had it correct.

02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:42.120
I want pumpkin as well.

02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:49.520
Loki wants you to knock this shit off, that's what he wants.

02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:52.520
I don't know, no, I think it's fantastic.

02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:56.440
I will be fighting Dark Sakura for those donuts, but she'll be fighting for the coffee, so

02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:57.440
it'll work out.

02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:59.600
Rob, you are such a consumer whore.

02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:02.280
And how?

02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:06.720
I just bought Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U, that's my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3, take

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:09.800
all the shots you want tonight, I don't give a fuck.

02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:15.440
I know you don't give a fuck.

02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.600
There's shame in your game, Mr. Rob Roberts, and for that, I salute you.

02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:20.600
You know what?

02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:22.080
Support the games you love, right?

02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.080
I don't know.

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:24.080
Oh yeah.

02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.080
I got nothing.

02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:26.080
I got nothing.

02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:27.080
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:30.520
Was it just to check the order, or what's your game been like the past couple weeks?

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:32.240
We didn't have a show last week.

02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:35.600
I actually picked up the Lego Movie video game, and it's been pretty fun.

02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:36.600
Oh yeah?

02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:37.600
Yep.

02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:38.600
Everything is awesome?

02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:43.640
Everything is awesome, everything is cool, and you're part of it.

02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:44.640
Let me stop.

02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:45.640
Let me stop.

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:51.280
If I start seeing that, I'm gonna hang up, turn on the PS3, start playing this game and

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:52.960
realize it's time for me to go to bed.

02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.440
Shit, it's six o'clock in the morning.

02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:56.440
I got 45 minutes.

02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.520
That ain't happening.

02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:01.800
Rama, what's coming up on Anime Jam Session this week?

02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:06.920
Oh, actually, we don't know yet, because Marco hasn't gotten the outline to me yet.

02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:09.480
I usually don't know until Monday, so...

02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:12.360
Well, shoot, here I was trying to let you have a plug, but...

02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:17.560
I know, and I appreciate it, but you know how the saying is, good help is so hard to

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:18.920
find these days, you know what I'm saying?

02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:19.920
Yeah, no, I understand.

02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:23.400
Well, look, I have OLR show rule done about two hours before we're live, so you know,

02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:24.400
I know how it goes.

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:25.400
Exactly, yeah.

02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:27.400
Tacking Melly Rob that morning.

02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:32.320
Loki, the other week, Loki had his stories in at four o'clock, and I was like, Loki,

02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:33.320
God damn it.

02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:35.560
All right, but anyway, we make it work.

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:36.560
All right, Rama.

02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:39.600
No, no, no, no, hold on, my stories were not in at four o'clock.

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:40.880
Not this week, but a prior week.

02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:41.880
No, that's true.

02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:42.880
It was like three weeks ago.

02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:43.880
But usually I get it before that.

02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:44.880
Yeah, you're okay.

02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:45.880
All right.

02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:46.880
No, they work hard.

02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:51.600
I was like, I took a nap before four o'clock today, I know for a fact that those stories

02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:53.480
weren't in.

02:52:53.480 --> 02:52:55.080
The joys of producing a podcast.

02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:58.000
All right, Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.480
If you really do do this donut thing, you're so awesome, I can't even...

02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:06.160
I'm not gonna do the donut thing, but remember, I did do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:09.440
I called all of you out, but you don't have to worry.

02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:13.400
Act Def is taking one for the team, because remember, he does work for the site.

02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:16.200
I don't have ice or a bucket, so that's not gonna work.

02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:18.640
I ship you a bucket, sir.

02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:19.640
Mr. Bucket?

02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:20.640
Mr. Bucket?

02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:25.520
No, I would like to continue to do things to support the MS Foundation.

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:29.200
It's kind of my charity of choice right now, so I'm gonna try and put some things together

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:30.720
with the Hoard House guys for that.

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:32.520
But I think what you guys are doing is fantastic.

02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:33.520
Yeah.

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.280
All right, I'm gonna let you go, buddy.

02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:36.280
Take care.

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:37.280
You too, man.

02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:38.280
Stay black.

02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:39.280
You too.

02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:40.280
Bye.

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:41.280
Bye.

02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:43.000
The bucket of advice right now sounds pretty good.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.400
It's kind of warm in here.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:48.360
I'm gonna make sure the AC's on or something.

02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:53.280
You guys fill time while we wait for another call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:58.600
Um, words.

02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:04.280
I really have no idea what to say, because I have a 10-hour day tomorrow.

02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:05.480
Sounds like fun.

02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:08.720
I did sign up for it, but I have an extra day off.

02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:13.480
So my goal is to have something playable in my game by episode 573.

02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:14.480
That's my goal.

02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:15.480
Really?

02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:16.480
Yes.

02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:17.480
I am back, by the way.

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:18.820
I turned the AC down one degree.

02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:23.760
For you guys, I can spare the electric bill for one degree.

02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:24.760
Let's see.

02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:25.760
Looking at some other comments.

02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:30.480
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:33.240
all one word.

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:34.840
Flaco Jones sent us a tweet.

02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:37.120
Since you took the week off, I hope you can still touch on this story.

02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:39.920
I'm looking forward to Loki's reaction.

02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:45.320
And the story that he posted was about, and this is from the official Xbox news wire,

02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:50.000
talking about the Xbox One standalone Kinect sensor will be available in October.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.120
It will be bundled with Dance Central Spotlight, which came out while we were out as well,

02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:58.200
and it will be available at retailers for $149.99.

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.840
Did you hear about that?

02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:01.840
Yeah, I did.

02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:04.120
A little higher than what I was expecting for retail price.

02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:06.120
I don't think anyone's going to buy it.

02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:07.120
No, seriously.

02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:11.000
I mean, look at who you're targeting this towards.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:15.320
You're targeting it towards somebody that wanted to buy an Xbox One system because they

02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:20.240
thought having Kinect in there was too expensive, and so they wanted to spend $100 less.

02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.600
And now you're telling them, oh, spend $150 on a Kinect that you probably don't want in

02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:31.200
the first place to play, what, a game that you didn't really know about from the beginning

02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:32.760
that you wanted to have Kinect for?

02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:38.680
I can't think of any game that's coming out for Kinect that would justify spending an

02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:39.680
extra $150.

02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:42.520
I can't think of anything.

02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:47.880
I'm sorry, Fantasia, while it's probably a cool game, is not fucking worth another $150.

02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.280
Nor is Just Dance, nor is that Dance Central game that they're putting out on it.

02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:56.920
Yeah, it's like, I want to play Dance Central Spotlight, but not $150 bad, you know?

02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.320
It's really too expensive.

02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:02.680
The only thing I see that this is a positive is if this works on PC as well, because the

02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:06.200
PC one that they had, which I don't know if it was a dev kit or something like that, was

02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:07.200
$200.

02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:08.200
Jeez.

02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:09.880
So it's just ridiculous.

02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:17.000
It's a good way not to, I guess, if anything, this being out there makes maybe the Xbox

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.880
One with Kinect a slightly better value if you really want Kinect, but honestly, you're

02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.680
probably not really going to want Kinect, because look at their track record.

02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:29.120
What have they done for games with Kinect?

02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:31.360
Has there really been anything that innovative for it?

02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:32.360
No.

02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:35.160
I feel so bad for Harmonix, who's so invested in that.

02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:36.800
Harmonix is the Kinect right now.

02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:42.600
You know, with the Disney Fantasia and the Dance Central Spotlight, I feel so bad for

02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:43.600
them in a way.

02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:48.160
Well, props to them that they have some really good software on there, and to be fair, the

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:53.600
stuff that they do have for Kinect, like Just Dance, I'm guessing, is pretty good, and Dance

02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:59.120
Central was fun, but it's almost like buying a Wii U at that point, you know?

02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:02.480
Why am I going to spend this kind of money for two games?

02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:04.000
Well, there's more than two.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.720
I understand that, but I'm saying it's the equivalent of like, you know, why am I going

02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:13.280
to spend this kind of money for a couple games, and potentially in the future, I don't really

02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:18.680
know what, other than another Just Dance game, I mean, really, what else is going to be coming

02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:19.680
out?

02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:20.680
Another Kinect sports game?

02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:21.680
Does anyone give a shit about that?

02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:22.680
No.

02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:25.360
What about another Star Wars game where I can do the Han Solo?

02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:28.360
All right, look, I've got to get back to Twitter topics.

02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:34.560
All right, Jason says, on the subject of rebuying the same game, I have three copies of Titanfall,

02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.760
360 physical, Xbox One digital, Xbox One physical with limited edition.

02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.720
Thank you, Jason, you get me, you get me, even though I don't know if I'd buy three

02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:45.720
copies of that game.

02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.640
I do have at least one, so, but at least you get me.

02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:53.800
All right, SGA100Matt says, could the scum bar from Monkey Island become an official

02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:54.800
Lego set?

02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:55.800
It's possible.

02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:58.480
And he links us to an article from RetroCollect.com.

02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:01.360
Loki, you're the big Lego fan around here.

02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:04.960
I don't, well, I don't know if you still really do those with the kids, but I would think

02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:06.640
that's a fun activity you could all do together.

02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:09.520
Would you be interested in a scum bar from Monkey Island?

02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:12.680
I wouldn't pay for it, but I am sure it's one of those cousteau things.

02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:16.080
They have, like, was it the Back to the Future one looks pretty cool, and every time I pass

02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:22.760
by those Minecraft ones, I'm like, eh, maybe, but no, Legos are too damn expensive nowadays.

02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:26.080
I'm sure they were just as expensive when I was growing up, but it seems like it's like

02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:32.320
what you get for your money is just ridiculous, and I have so many Legos as it was.

02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:34.960
I do have the Hogwarts Express, though.

02:58:34.960 --> 02:58:35.960
I have a few of them.

02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:36.960
I should bring one of those.

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:41.920
They're little tiny Hogwarts Express Lego things.

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:45.360
So I've got some of those, and Star Trek Enterprises, which I gave you one of those already.

02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:47.640
But yeah, I don't know.

02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:48.960
Last call for phone calls.

02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:49.960
1-877-GAMO-LR.

02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:52.920
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:58:52.920 --> 02:58:57.880
I will be closing it here after one more tweet from Dar Tetsuya, who says, thoughts on the

02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:02.000
new Mario Kart 8 DLC coming out between now and next year.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.960
This happened during the week we were off.

02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:06.440
I'm glad you brought this up, because this was some big news.

02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:08.640
Hopefully we can have more game nights with the new tracks.

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:11.880
So if you guys haven't heard, Dar Saket, this might be of particular interest to you.

02:59:11.880 --> 02:59:15.080
I don't know if you saw this, but they announced for Mario Kart 8.

02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:20.760
There are going to be two DLC packs, and they're already pushing this shit in the game.

02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:24.800
In the game, they show up on the freaking character select screen.

02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:30.600
I gotta say, as much as Nintendo does DLC very well, the way they sell it is kind of

02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:31.840
shameless.

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:35.840
The fact that it's right there in front of you in the game, and you just have to push

02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:38.480
A to buy it or whatever.

02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:42.480
But anyway, the stuff that's in it, one pack will be a Zelda themed pack.

02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:47.840
There's going to be four Hyrule tracks, and four, I guess, retro tracks, I think.

02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:54.400
And the characters will be Link, and I think it's Cat Peach, and then Tanooki Mario, I

02:59:54.400 --> 02:59:55.840
believe are the racers.

02:59:55.840 --> 03:00:02.800
But then get this, the second DLC that comes out in early 2015 is an Animal Crossing pack.

03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:09.400
And you get the villager, and Isabelle.

03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:13.920
And there's another Mario related character, I can't think of right now.

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:17.480
But then four Animal Crossing themed tracks.

03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:18.480
I know, it's weird.

03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:20.840
But didn't they have something that looked like F-Zero in there?

03:00:20.840 --> 03:00:25.920
They did, I think somehow the blue racer, Captain Falcon's little racer from F-Zero

03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:27.120
was going to be...

03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:31.120
Or actually, I don't think the four tracks are all Zelda themed or all Animal Crossing

03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:34.680
themed, because I swear to God in one of the screenshots, it looked like it was Mute City

03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:37.000
or something was going to be one of the tracks.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:44.120
Which, fuck you, cocks, for fucking teasing me like that.

03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:46.840
I don't know, I don't know whether to love them or hate them.

03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:47.840
Hate them.

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:48.840
Alright, I'll hate them.

03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:49.840
Hey, I turned my back.

03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:53.520
I think it's cool that they're having DLC for it, I think it's reasonably priced.

03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.520
I wish it was coming out sooner, because it's just like taking a look.

03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:00.320
I turned my back and the phone was lighting up, I want to get to it, but I want to read

03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:02.200
this comment from MacDeft as well.

03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:05.560
Isabelle is going to be my new favorite Carter, I agree, mine too.

03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:07.800
Although right now it's all about Wendy Okupa, it's a close call.

03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.800
Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?

03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:10.800
Hey guys, it's Jason.

03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:11.800
Jason, how you doing buddy?

03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:12.800
Pretty good.

03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:17.920
I just wish that my train that was supposed to be here ten minutes after the show started

03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:18.920
was here.

03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:19.920
Oh my gosh.

03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:20.920
Yeah.

03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:21.920
Oh no.

03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:22.920
Yeah.

03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:23.920
It's been quite a night.

03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:24.920
It's fine.

03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:29.960
I was going to get in in the mid-afternoon, get into Chicago in the mid-afternoon tomorrow,

03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:33.200
and this delay means I'll get there right around the time I have to be anyways, so you

03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:34.600
know, no big deal.

03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:36.640
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:37.640
We miss you here in California, buddy.

03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:40.800
I wanted to expand a little bit on the tweet, and there was something that Loki was talking

03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:42.400
about earlier that's actually relevant.

03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:48.360
Not only do I own Titanfall three times, but I also own the, holy hell, what's it called,

03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:54.200
season pass for both the 360 and the Xbox One as well, and I was so, so, so close to

03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:59.560
buying it on the PC as well, but I figured that'd be mildly excessive, and I'd play it

03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:01.760
not at all, so I didn't.

03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:08.080
Well, did somebody just break a dish there in the background?

03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:12.080
No, I'm walking around on the platform, it's the garbage being chucked out behind me.

03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:13.080
Okay.

03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:16.320
So wait, so wait, why all the copies of Titanfall?

03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:22.800
I bought it on the 360, so as I've mentioned on the show before, work has Xbox Ones, which

03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:27.280
exposed me to Titanfall in the first place, and I got super addicted to it.

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:29.880
I got home and I bought it, naturally.

03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:34.280
And then after I went back out to San Francisco and continued playing even more there, I finally

03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:39.320
decided to take the leap to get an Xbox One, so I did, and that answers the second question

03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:41.240
of why the second copy.

03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:47.640
The limited edition was just because the two-scale, like, what, three-foot high Titan figure is

03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:51.920
kind of gorgeous, actually, so much so that I don't even want to take it out of its box

03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:52.920
and haven't.

03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:53.920
So, you know.

03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:56.640
Well, I guess that's fair, I guess you got a little something extra with that collector's

03:02:56.640 --> 03:02:57.640
edition.

03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.440
Yeah, that was very explicitly sought out because I'm very much looking forward to this

03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:06.840
game and what they continue to do with it, and I'm just having a lot of fun with it,

03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:10.080
so much so that I haven't paid any attention to Destiny, and I'm pretty sure all of the

03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:13.840
multiplayer matches on Titanfall are just going to kind of, like, disappear on Tuesday.

03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:16.800
Nah, they won't disappear, because there's going to be some people that aren't going

03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:21.600
to be able to drop the 60 bucks right away on, you know, Destiny or whatever.

03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:25.600
And so the thing I was going to, I was saying that was mentioned earlier in the show, was

03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:31.160
that it would not have been a big deal, this sounds so foolish for me to hear myself say

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:35.680
it, and it always has whenever I have this conversation, the thing that's ridiculous,

03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.800
the reason why I bought the Xbox One for Titanfall, despite already having another 360, is because

03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:46.600
my Xbox One pilot was leveled three times higher than my pilot on the 360.

03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:49.960
And those, even just those, like, I wouldn't be torn up if I couldn't play against Xbox

03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:53.600
One players and multiplayer, but the fact that the pilot stats don't transfer between

03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:56.000
both systems is completely absurd to me.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.920
That sucks, and you know what, all that stuff doesn't really transfer in Mass Effect either.

03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:04.880
Your Galaxy rating does, but that's about it, but yeah, I hear you, I like it way better

03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:07.440
when there's, like, a cloud save or something like that.

03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:11.760
Real quick, I wanted to say about Titanfall and the multiplayer matches, PC you shouldn't

03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:14.360
see affected too much, because Destiny's not coming out on PC.

03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:19.960
A lot of people forget that that's, for some reason, Bungie, Activision not deciding to

03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.120
release there, which I thought might have been, like, maybe a piracy thing, like, they

03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.200
were just afraid the game would get pirated to hell, but because it's so online-enabled,

03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.440
that would be a hard thing to do, so I'm kind of curious why they are omitting PC.

03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:37.000
I guess it's got to be a keyboard and mouse versus controller thing, I don't know, maybe

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:38.640
it'll be later, I don't know.

03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:42.080
Yeah, I mean, Grand Theft Auto, has Grand Theft Auto V actually hit PC yet?

03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:43.480
I know that was super delayed.

03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:46.680
No, and we actually talked about that way at the top of the show, a little bit, a little

03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:50.720
bit, just because, like, you know, we know that the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions

03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:53.760
are supposed to come out some, at some point, so.

03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:57.320
Yeah, it's, it's very interesting, all of these shifts that are happening, and the fact

03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:58.320
that...

03:04:58.320 --> 03:05:01.560
You still there, buddy?

03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:03.160
Jason, you just dropped.

03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:07.640
You know, the, the, we had such staying power when the, yes, yeah, that happens.

03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:11.920
Okay, yeah, sorry, your audio, your audio's cutting out, buddy, I'm gonna let you go.

03:05:11.920 --> 03:05:13.840
I think you just hung up.

03:05:13.840 --> 03:05:15.840
All right, bye buddy, if you can hear me.

03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:19.360
All right, always appreciate having Jason calling to the show.

03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:21.280
DarkStalker, you're, you're heading out of here, right?

03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:22.280
Yeah, I got work.

03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:24.720
Okay, so, final thought.

03:05:24.720 --> 03:05:25.720
I got work.

03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:26.720
All right, bye.

03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:27.720
Bye.

03:05:27.720 --> 03:05:31.480
All right, actually, we are gonna start to wrap things up here in studio, because when

03:05:31.480 --> 03:05:36.320
you have a call with tech problems, that usually says, end the damn show already, and we are

03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:39.880
running a little late tonight, it's almost 930 here on the West Coast, but hey, that's

03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:41.880
what happens after a week off at OLR.

03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:45.160
I wanna thank all you guys for listening to the show tonight, downloading the show, checking

03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:48.360
it out, or listening live, however you're participating, thank you for being a part

03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.360
of our family here.

03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:53.160
Again, I wanna encourage you, if you liked what you heard here at OLR, please help us

03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:56.040
spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:05:56.040 --> 03:06:03.040
I met some folks at DragonCon, actually, and one came up and introduced himself, and the

03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:06.400
other said that my friend got me into listening to the show, and I said, oh, well, then a

03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:10.680
gold star for your friend, because he did what we asked, so I really appreciate that.

03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:13.980
Tell a friend or two or five about our show, help spread the word about Orange on its Radio,

03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:19.620
we really, really appreciate it, and yeah, we'll keep doing what we do.

03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:26.200
Next week, we will be back here, live in studio, Jonas and Diego will be back next week.

03:06:26.200 --> 03:06:31.640
They were here about a month ago, talking about the teabaggers, which, yes, is a thing,

03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:33.640
the big anime game room.

03:06:33.640 --> 03:06:37.340
They had SAC Anime happen, since Dark Soccer didn't make it to SAC Anime, we're gonna hear

03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:41.460
about that whole thing from them and how that went, and what's next on their agenda, I don't

03:06:41.460 --> 03:06:44.740
know what con they're doing next, but it'll be fun to have them back, and we'll talk to

03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:46.140
them about what they're playing.

03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:50.300
Destiny's out next week, whole lot of talk gonna happen about that, at least for me,

03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:52.980
I don't know about my co-hosts, but I know I'm gonna be playing an awful lot of that

03:06:52.980 --> 03:06:53.980
next week.

03:06:53.980 --> 03:06:54.980
We'll see if I buy it or not.

03:06:54.980 --> 03:06:55.980
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:58.820
Well, meanwhile, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:06:58.820 --> 03:07:00.540
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:05.940
Working more on my game this week, and so, hopefully, I wish I get some progress, it

03:07:05.940 --> 03:07:09.820
seems like every time I get somewhere, it's like, ah, crap, gotta redo that again.

03:07:09.820 --> 03:07:16.420
So I'm hoping, now that I kind of, while sitting during the show, I was kind of outlining

03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:22.380
what I need to do for rotating stuff, and it looks easy enough, so I'll write that up

03:07:22.380 --> 03:07:28.980
tonight and test it, and hopefully it works, and if it all works, then the next thing I

03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:35.340
need to do is add into my editor stuff to do level creation, because right now it's

03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:40.580
kind of catered towards building, like, parts, and not, if I were to build a level with it,

03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:44.380
it'd take fucking forever, so I gotta fix that.

03:07:44.380 --> 03:07:49.620
Alright, and my final thought is, building on something I said earlier, respect.

03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:55.500
If we all had a little bit more of it, I think, things would not be so fucking dramatic sometimes,

03:07:55.500 --> 03:07:58.220
so think about that for a little bit.

03:07:58.220 --> 03:08:01.820
But I know most of you guys that listen to this show all have a pretty good mindset and

03:08:01.820 --> 03:08:05.260
are all very respectful, and for that, I appreciate you guys for keeping our family

03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:07.940
strong here at Orange Lounge Radio and The Voice of Geeks Network.

03:08:07.940 --> 03:08:13.340
Thank you guys again for another great week here of OLR, we will see you in seven days,

03:08:13.340 --> 03:08:17.820
until then, happy gaming, and I have my fingers in my toes crossed that Destiny will actually

03:08:17.820 --> 03:08:21.700
work on Tuesday for all you guys, but if it doesn't, that's okay, I'll just level more

03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:22.700
in Diablo 3.

03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:23.700
Good night.
