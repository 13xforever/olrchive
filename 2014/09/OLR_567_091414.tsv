14000	20000	This week, rumors swirl of a possible acquisition of Minecraft developer Mojang as controversy unfolds involving the author of the mod Craftbucket.
20000	23000	License and ownership accusations lie, as do fraudulent police reports.
23000	27000	The story goes much deeper than this, and we'll explain more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 14th, 2014 with episode number 567 of our show.
45000	49000	You numerology fans will be very happy with that tonight. 567 of our show.
49000	60000	This is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all you guys listening live and via the podcast, as well as my co-hosts here in studio.
60000	64000	First off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
64000	65000	Sup bitches?
65000	66000	Hey Jamie, how you doing?
66000	67000	I'm okay.
67000	71000	Today on VOGnetwork.com, you posted a review of Hatoful Boyfriend.
71000	74000	I posted a very basic preliminary review.
74000	75000	I see.
75000	84000	Because as I told you offline, the game is more fucked up than you get just through the first story line.
84000	86000	Gotcha. How was it? I mean obviously-
86000	87000	Pudding!
87000	89000	We want people to go read the review, but overall-
89000	90000	Pudding.
90000	91000	So it sounds like you're going to play more of it.
91000	93000	Oh yeah, I'm actually going to be livestreaming it.
93000	95000	I was livestreaming my first playthrough.
95000	97000	I actually got the death ending first.
97000	99000	And then, well most of the endings are-
99000	102000	I'm sorry, no spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
102000	104000	Oh my god, you killed the damn bird? That's upsetting.
104000	106000	No! I got killed by the damn birds.
106000	111000	The birds kill you? Is this a Hitchcock film? What a fucked up game is this?
111000	116000	If you don't pay the birds enough attention, then the secret bird society come and kills you.
116000	123000	My god, is my cat going to kill me? Is that why my cat's been trying to wake me up more and more at 4.30 in the morning?
123000	124000	No, that's because cats are assholes.
124000	125000	Oh, okay.
127000	129000	Also joining us in studio, say hello to tech master Loki.
129000	130000	I second that.
130000	131000	Are you Loki?
131000	133000	Cats are assholes.
133000	136000	Hey, by the way, Loki, happy birthday from all of us here at OLR.
136000	137000	Happy birthdays.
137000	138000	Thank you.
138000	139000	You haven't told us what you want.
139000	142000	Loki had a birthday this week. He wants world peace and a new pair of glasses.
142000	143000	Oh, fuck world peace.
143000	145000	What, two billion dollars?
145000	147000	Okay, what would you reasonably like?
147000	149000	A new pair of glasses, apparently.
149000	151000	I don't know. I don't know what I want.
151000	155000	Loki, what's up with- so you joined the glasses society this week?
155000	158000	I'm just wearing them to get used to them. I really don't need them.
158000	159000	Really?
159000	162000	I don't. I actively, literally take them off right now and be just fine.
162000	164000	You're probably like me. Like, I have glasses, but I-
164000	166000	I just think I look cooler with glasses on.
166000	167000	Yeah, me too.
167000	168000	So I wear them.
168000	169000	Me too. I look smarter.
169000	170000	Yeah, exactly.
170000	172000	I wear glasses all the time because I need them.
172000	175000	I look older though, so that's the only problem.
175000	176000	You guys look like blurs.
176000	181000	My big thing is night driving. Like, driving at night, it's better if I have glasses on.
181000	184000	Like, I'm not being unsafe by doing it without, but, you know, instead of-
184000	189000	Instead of, I see a red blob that looks like a stop sign, I can actually see clear-
189000	193000	Hey kids! Look forward to this when you're over 35!
193000	197000	Well, here's the thing, it's like, I don't really notice a difference wearing them.
197000	205000	It's not like, oh hey, that's a lot more clear. It's actually the same, except now, like, if I look far away, it's like, really annoying.
205000	209000	I don't know. It's like, I can't- like, I can't read any of that text. Let's see.
209000	212000	Well, my eyes, see, they're blurry because I'm going-
212000	214000	Can't hear you, Lucky. Mic.
215000	218000	Sorry. They're going back and forth between-
218000	220000	Why is my mic not working?
220000	227000	Anyways, between, like, focusing with and without glasses, so I can't really tell, but, I mean, it looks about the same.
227000	231000	If there's any improvements, like, super small-
231000	233000	Alright, well good to know you spent hundreds of dollars on those glasses.
233000	236000	I didn't spend any money on it. My insurance spent money on it.
236000	239000	Okay, that's good. That's good. Show them that.
239000	243000	Alright, so, how did you spend the birthday? Did you have a good birthday?
244000	247000	Um, I just stayed home and did nothing.
247000	250000	Gotcha. Well, you know, that's what I've been doing in my 30s.
250000	254000	It's pretty much just, like, any night. We took care of the kids, that was about it.
254000	256000	How, let's see, you would be 32 this year?
256000	257000	Four.
257000	259000	34? My god, why did I think you were way younger?
259000	260000	Yeah.
260000	261000	34.
261000	263000	You're officially mid-30s. Welcome.
263000	269000	I can't wait till you guys get 37, so I can say it in a row. Like everyone did to me all last year.
270000	273000	Yesterday, my sister had her wedding, so I went to that.
273000	274000	That's right.
274000	275000	Did all that fun stuff.
275000	276000	There you go.
276000	277000	Yep.
277000	281000	Alright, and your sister actually married, like, one of your best friends, right?
281000	283000	Yeah, she married my best man at my wedding.
283000	284000	Wow.
284000	285000	Yeah.
285000	286000	That's neat.
286000	292000	So, yeah, it worked out. And then, um, what else did I do this week? Yeah, that's pretty much it.
292000	295000	Had he caught the garter at your wedding?
295000	302000	No, no, the people that caught the garter in the bouquet at my wedding were actually my two cousins that were brother and sister.
302000	307000	So they had to dance with each other, which is kind of funny.
307000	312000	No, but, um, it was kind of cool, though, because I got to see one of my cousins who I haven't seen in, like,
312000	318000	God, when I saw him, he was like eight last time, so now he's all grown up and stuff.
319000	323000	You know, I haven't seen most of my cousins since they were little, so I got to see them.
323000	325000	And, um, yeah.
325000	331000	I think my cousin actually did catch the bouquet again, but she's getting married, so it's, you know.
331000	336000	You know what garter I caught, whose wedding I caught the garter at, was Mel B.
336000	341000	For those of you DDR people back in the day, when Mel and Mel got married, I caught the garter.
341000	345000	So, hasn't worked yet, but, you know.
345000	347000	No, it was good times, good times.
347000	353000	Anyway, we're going to be talking about games with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
353000	357000	because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern,
357000	359000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
359000	363000	Again, that's the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
363000	366000	And folks in our chat talking about age.
366000	368000	Kaijuto in chat starting us off tonight saying,
368000	372000	Thirty-four, that's like the Atari 2600 demo.
372000	376000	Maybe I should have did a different song for the cookie today.
376000	379000	Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.
379000	382000	I am, well, I think we have people of all ages really listen to our show.
382000	385000	I know people in their 40s that listen to OLR and have a good time with it.
385000	388000	I know people, we'll get emails.
388000	390000	Well, actually, I met a listener not that long ago.
390000	392000	It was like, yeah, I used to listen to you guys in high school.
392000	395000	And now I'm in my mid-20s.
395000	401000	Two of my coworkers listen to us in high school.
401000	403000	Is that awkward at all?
403000	405000	One of them's true.
405000	407000	Oh, okay. Well, that's, yeah.
407000	408000	Drew and Jay.
408000	409000	Oh, okay.
409000	412000	No, thankfully, nobody at my work, I don't think, listens to OLR.
412000	415000	I think one person did once and then probably-
415000	416000	They won't make that mistake again.
416000	418000	They won't make that mistake again, that's for sure.
418000	422000	I may actually have some of my coworkers from Locat listening tonight, so.
422000	426000	Well, howdy and hello to all of you that might be listening.
426000	428000	Hey, I'm famous.
428000	430000	Or something.
430000	432000	I'm famous on the internet. What does that get me?
432000	434000	Can I get a raise?
434000	436000	I am not pushing my luck.
436000	438000	Let's see.
438000	440000	So, yeah.
440000	443000	Kossin in our chat room says, I'm not the oldest one in the room.
443000	446000	I went to the movies today and didn't get carded.
446000	450000	That happens to me a lot. I don't get carded for booze or bars anymore.
450000	452000	They stopped carding me at the bars.
452000	453000	Oh, Rob.
453000	454000	I know. That's done.
454000	457000	You know what's funny? I'm older than you.
457000	458000	I know.
458000	460000	And I got carded for my bottle of Beaujolais last week.
460000	464000	Yeah, but, you know, you don't have a beard and thinning hair.
464000	467000	No, I just have an alley on my chin.
467000	468000	Aww.
468000	469000	I fell.
469000	473000	Isn't that a big lie that you think you're supposed to be done with acne after your teens?
473000	475000	It wasn't acne this time.
475000	476000	No.
476000	479000	This was me falling and scraping my chin on the wall.
479000	480000	Ouch.
480000	481000	On the wall texture.
481000	483000	I've fallen and I can't get up.
483000	486000	Was it cat related? Because that's a cat move right there, you know?
486000	493000	It's like, seriously, you're just walking through the hallway, minding your own business, and they dart out of the corner.
493000	498000	Excuse me while I run to the next room for no reason because I'm batshit insane and an asshole.
498000	500000	Yeah, just like this morning.
500000	502000	No, that wasn't cat related. It was holding laundry related.
502000	508000	Hey, 5.30, everybody's asleep. This never happens at 5.30. I won't wake everybody up because I'm an asshole.
508000	514000	That's what Sanrio's resorted to doing lately is it's like, hey, it's 4.30 in the morning. Let's jump up on daddy's bed.
514000	517000	We've actually started locking Midna out of the bedroom at night.
517000	518000	Yeah.
518000	523000	Because apparently she's like, starts pawing at Dan's face and getting cat hair in his eyes.
523000	530000	She's like, daddy, mama's making that noise again. Get up and feed me, daddy.
530000	536000	Alright, look, we could talk about cats all night long. In fact, as somebody said earlier, Fifth Dream in our chatroom said,
536000	540000	cat-iful, boyfriend. Maybe that'll be the sequel.
540000	544000	But we want to talk about games. And for our kickoff topic tonight, by the way, later in the show,
544000	549000	joining us later around the 7 o'clock hour, Jonas and Diego are going to be back tonight from T-Banger,
549000	555000	which if you were listening a couple weeks ago, the big anime game room, T-B-A-G-R, the big anime game room.
555000	559000	They're going to be back tonight. I want to talk to them about SacAnime, Dreamcast Birthday,
559000	564000	and whatever else they might have on their mind. They might have some upcoming appearances to plug as well.
564000	566000	Is YowieCon coming up? They're probably doing that.
566000	567000	Probably.
567000	569000	That's happening. And GamerX3.
569000	571000	YowieCon's always been in October, I think.
571000	574000	GamerX3 is going to happen next year, and I'm sure they're going to come back for that.
574000	578000	I'm assuming the Kickstarter is going to be a success. If you don't know about the GamerX3 Kickstarter,
578000	583000	they're very, very close to their goal, so if you want to get your tickets for cheap, you should go.
583000	589000	And actually, I can say this on the show, myself, on behalf of VOG Network, kicked out the money,
589000	592000	so VOG is actually going to be a sponsor of GamerX3.
592000	595000	So we will be there with the table, and very cool.
595000	599000	And just announced Jennifer Hale is going to be one of their guests.
599000	603000	The voice of FemShep, and what? She's what?
603000	608000	Leah in Diablo. She's in lots and lots of games.
608000	610000	And she's Ms. Marvel.
610000	611000	And she's Ms. Marvel.
611000	615000	So anyway, that's very exciting stuff to look forward to.
615000	617000	So we'll talk to them about conventions later on the show.
617000	620000	We will get into our gaming weeks here, but I always like to do a little bit of a kickoff.
621000	626000	Unfortunately, my co-hosts haven't played this yet this week, so I don't know how much of this we can talk about,
626000	630000	but I want to talk about the big anticipation for Super Smash Bros.,
630000	634000	which, I got to admit, the worst titles in the franchise ever,
634000	638000	because it looks like they are really going with Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and for Wii U.
638000	642000	Did they lay off the person that comes up with titles for anything, like for Nintendo a while back?
642000	646000	Because seriously, it's like, yeah, we're going to call that the new 3DS.
646000	651000	Yeah, we're just going to call that Smash Bros. for Wii U, because, you know...
651000	658000	I guess it's one of those things where, I mean, it is what it is.
658000	660000	Nintendo is delivering what they want.
660000	662000	They want Smash Bros. on Wii U.
662000	664000	So here it is. Smash Bros. for Wii U.
664000	667000	Like, at least it is what it is.
667000	670000	It's not some crazy name like Wii U as a system, I don't know.
670000	672000	But anyway, I digress.
672000	675000	So, I'm sure you guys have all heard, if you're listening to this show,
675000	678000	it's all over Twitter and all over Facebook and all that,
678000	680000	but for whatever reason you missed the boat on this,
680000	685000	Smash Bros. has a demo for the 3DS version coming out this Friday.
685000	689000	There's going to be a demo playable for everybody to check out this Friday,
689000	694000	but Nintendo sent out emails to folks that were Platinum members
694000	699000	between certain dates of Club Nintendo for a period of time in about the past year
699000	701000	who get their email things,
701000	703000	and Nintendo just basically said,
703000	706000	hey, we thought you'd want a sneak peek at the Smash demo, so here it is.
706000	708000	And here are three...
708000	712000	So it was four codes all together because Smash Bros. is a four-player game, right?
712000	717000	So here's four codes for you and some friends to enjoy Smash Bros. on 3DS,
717000	719000	the demo, one week early.
719000	724000	It's the Google effect where it's an invite-only thing
724000	726000	and now everybody's got to have it.
726000	730000	It was something that the fans are crazy over, like Smash Bros.,
730000	732000	because we all know Nintendo's got some hardcore fans, right?
732000	734000	Hardcore fans.
734000	736000	And then when you talk about Smash Bros. on Nintendo,
736000	739000	they love their Smash Bros., right?
739000	745000	So people are foaming at the mouths insane for copies of this demo one week early.
745000	747000	Especially since the Japanese version's already out
747000	749000	and all the rosters have already been leaked.
749000	751000	Right. Well, and there's another certain level of insanity
751000	755000	where you already own the Japanese 3DS and you just imported it from Japan.
755000	759000	I'm looking at you, my pal Captain Spike from GamePooey.org,
759000	761000	but that's why we love you.
761000	765000	There's that level of foaming at the mouth crazy.
765000	768000	I did that for Brawl, so whatever.
768000	770000	All right, fair enough. We've all been there,
770000	772000	and I did it for BeatMania 2DX back in the day.
772000	776000	So some of us that have been able to do that in the past, we've all been there.
776000	780000	But then there's that next level where it's like, I've got to have this now.
780000	786000	And people are selling codes on eBay for 20, 30 bucks on eBay.
786000	789000	People are scouting Twitter up and down.
789000	793000	And if you even say Smash Code on Twitter, people are like,
793000	797000	got any extra, bro? Hey, bro, got any extra? Hey, got some extra Smash?
797000	800000	I mean, it's insane how people will jump on that.
800000	803000	They just need to hit, man. They just need a little bit.
803000	806000	Well, and here's the thing. I was fully prepared to wait a week to play the demo
806000	808000	because I'm like, sure, I want to check it out.
808000	811000	But I'm like, I'm not going to pay 20 bucks to download the code.
811000	816000	And to be fair, I'm not a platinum, foaming Nintendo member.
816000	818000	If I have to wait, okay.
818000	821000	But then I saw one of our listeners, ActDeft, wrote a tweet,
821000	823000	and he was like, yay, I got my email.
823000	825000	And I just thought, I'll just try asking.
825000	829000	So I want to get in before the other guys, the Twitter brigade,
829000	831000	hits him up and tries to get all his codes.
831000	835000	So I just said, hi, I don't have a code. Do you have any extras?
835000	837000	And he said, sure. So thank you, ActDeft.
837000	839000	He gave me a code, and I was able to check out the demo.
839000	841000	So that was very nice of him to do that.
841000	845000	I felt bad, though, for Shane because another listener contacted me
845000	849000	the next day and was like, hey, Rob, did you get into the Smash demo
849000	851000	because I have an extra code?
851000	854000	And I said, you know, I didn't get in, but I know Shane is dying to get in
854000	857000	because Shane was playing my 3DS, and I knew he wanted to get his own
857000	859000	so we could play against each other.
859000	862000	So this guy just tweeted Shane a code.
862000	864000	He didn't use direct message, though,
864000	866000	because probably Shane wasn't following him at the time or whatever,
866000	868000	so he couldn't send a direct message, so he just tweeted Shane the code.
868000	870000	Well, you can guess what happened in the hour that it took Shane
870000	872000	to get home from work and see that he had a code.
872000	876000	Somebody stole it, which, you know, I...
876000	880000	It's not selling if you put it on your front porch and say, get it.
880000	884000	Yeah, no, and to be fair, you know, but it sucks that the listener
884000	888000	had every good intention and probably had no idea that everybody
888000	890000	would see the code or whatever.
890000	893000	It just kind of sucks that people take advantage of that situation.
893000	896000	I mean, I understand it's like, well, you should have waited in DM,
896000	898000	but at the same time, you know, somebody's trying to do a good thing,
898000	902000	and somebody took advantage of that, and that's really poopy, so...
902000	903000	But thank you to everybody.
903000	904000	You can't trust humans.
904000	906000	I know, it sucks, and it sucks, but anyway,
906000	909000	big thanks to everybody that's offered to help out with the Smash demo.
909000	911000	I really appreciate that.
911000	913000	Maybe if you're in chat right now at live.vognetwork.com
913000	915000	and you happen to have an extra code or two,
915000	918000	I'm sure some listeners would be very, very thankful.
918000	922000	The one thing that this early demo does have versus the Friday demo
922000	926000	is apparently the one that came out early has unlimited uses,
926000	930000	and the one that's going to come out Friday has only 30 uses,
930000	932000	like a lot of the Nintendo demos do,
932000	934000	which I never really understood the point of that,
934000	938000	but at the same time, I don't think I've ever played a demo past like maybe 25.
938000	940000	I think Bravely Default I got down to 25.
940000	943000	I think I had to play it five times before I beat it, you know, or...
943000	946000	Oh, Saints Row I must have played until the game came out.
946000	948000	Right, right.
948000	951000	So what do you guys think about what Nintendo's doing with that
951000	953000	to kind of drive the anticipation?
953000	955000	I'll talk about my thoughts on the demo real quick.
955000	958000	Oh, by the way, if you didn't already know, the demo has five playable characters,
958000	963000	Mario, Link, Mega Man, the Villager from Animal Crossing, and Pikachu,
963000	966000	and only one stage, so that's essentially the demo.
966000	968000	None of the other side modes are in there or anything like that,
968000	971000	but it's enough to give you a taste,
971000	976000	and for me, it was very much about seeing how Smash Bros. runs on a 3DS,
976000	978000	because I have to admit, I'm kind of like,
978000	983000	I don't know if I'm going to get Smash Bros. on the 3DS,
983000	989000	because that's a game you play on the TV with all the zoom-ins and outs and all that stuff.
989000	991000	I don't know if I'm going to really get it on the 3DS,
991000	994000	but at least the demo was able to help me see if I would get it,
994000	997000	and I'm using my quotey fingers, get it or not.
997000	999000	But quickly, before I get to my thoughts on the demo,
999000	1003000	you guys and your thoughts about how Nintendo is doing this.
1003000	1005000	Is this a good thing for them to build buzz?
1005000	1007000	Is it a little ridiculous? What do you think?
1007000	1009000	I mean, it's a good thing, I guess.
1009000	1012000	There was already a lot of buzz as it was just because of all the leaked rosters and everything.
1012000	1014000	It just gets people excited about it.
1014000	1019000	But at the same time, though, demos aren't necessarily a good thing,
1019000	1024000	and so there are a lot of people that may have picked it up at one time just to pick it up,
1024000	1025000	and then they play it, and they're like,
1025000	1028000	you know what, it doesn't really look that good on the 3DS.
1028000	1031000	I'm just going to buy it on the Wii U or something like that.
1031000	1033000	So they may lose a little bit of sales from that,
1033000	1035000	but they'll gain a lot of buzz from it also.
1035000	1039000	Yeah. Let's see, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1039000	1042000	Kaijuto in chat says, if you buy a code, you deserve to be ripped off.
1042000	1045000	Oh, I wonder if that was a thing where people were selling fake codes.
1045000	1046000	Yikes.
1046000	1050000	Dark Tetsuya said, you should see the Mario Kart 8 community I'm on on Facebook.
1050000	1055000	This whole week you'd think it was a mislabeled Smash Brothers community.
1055000	1059000	So yeah, and let's see, Bochikawa says, I'll just wait for the other demo,
1059000	1062000	or wait for Wii U, probably the later.
1062000	1066000	And S2100Matt says, I'm skeptical too, but I will end up getting it anyways.
1066000	1068000	I'm almost done with my 3DS games that I play on my commute.
1068000	1073000	Again, those comments from live.vognetwork.com.
1073000	1076000	Jamie, any quick thoughts on how Nintendo's doing this?
1076000	1078000	Is this a good thing to build buzz,
1078000	1083000	or is this kind of annoying when they build this super special secret club
1083000	1084000	type of thing for a week?
1084000	1091000	I think that it's a good way to encourage people to make Platinum level.
1091000	1095000	Other than that, honestly, it's been building the buzz.
1095000	1096000	People are talking about it.
1096000	1098000	I think that's what their goal was.
1098000	1103000	What the rest of the populace does isn't their concern at that point.
1103000	1105000	Right.
1105000	1108000	It's interesting you talk about how it gives the value to the Platinum level
1108000	1111000	because I seem to remember that this year Nintendo got a lot of flak
1111000	1114000	because all of their rewards this year were digital only.
1114000	1115000	Remember that?
1115000	1118000	Their Platinum and Gold rewards were just virtual console games
1118000	1121000	like Wario, Game and Warrior, or whatever.
1121000	1124000	A few other little games were available for Platinum and Gold.
1124000	1126000	Nintendo got razzed for that a little bit,
1126000	1129000	but now we're finding that if you're a Platinum Nintendo person,
1129000	1132000	maybe you're going to get access to shit like this.
1132000	1134000	Can you imagine what's going to happen next year
1134000	1138000	if the Platinum people get the Zelda demo early?
1138000	1142000	Maybe this is the start of something for Nintendo. Who knows?
1142000	1146000	Even then, all of the people selling codes and this, that, and the other,
1146000	1148000	at that point that stops being Nintendo's concern.
1148000	1149000	The buzz is there. That's what they want.
1149000	1150000	Right. Exactly.
1150000	1152000	All right, so let me talk about the demo itself real quick.
1152000	1155000	Again, I don't like to base my impressions of the game off the demo,
1155000	1158000	but it is very ironic that just the day before this all happened,
1158000	1160000	I was kind of talking on Twitter, and I was getting into,
1160000	1162000	I don't know if you want to say it was a debate,
1162000	1167000	but just a discussion on why I wasn't really jazzed about Smash on 3DS,
1167000	1170000	but why for other people it was a great thing.
1170000	1174000	And in general, I have a hard time getting really thrilled about handhelds.
1174000	1176000	And it could have been worse than that Smash Bros thing.
1176000	1180000	They could have totally went the route of, oh, yeah, you can go get the demo.
1180000	1184000	You have to beam it to your 3DS. You got to go visit the GameStop to do that.
1184000	1187000	Bite your tongue. Bite your tongue. Anyway, let me finish.
1187000	1188000	No, that's fine.
1188000	1192000	So I was kind of talking about how, you know, I'm not really big on handhelds,
1192000	1196000	and I find that I only seem to play them ever if I'm on a plane for a few hours,
1196000	1198000	and I don't like having that tiny little screen.
1198000	1200000	I feel like you have more real estate on a big screen.
1200000	1203000	I don't really get the allure, quote, unquote, of handheld games.
1203000	1205000	But there were some other people that were talking back to me,
1205000	1208000	and one of the comments that really resonated with me was from AkumaJP,
1208000	1211000	and I don't, sorry, buddy, I forget exactly what you said,
1211000	1216000	but it got me thinking about how, like in Japan, handhelds are a way bigger thing.
1216000	1220000	Why? Because there's that total commute culture, so to speak.
1220000	1222000	Not that we don't have that here, but like in Japan,
1222000	1226000	you also have like that big subway and public transit are really big,
1226000	1229000	and a lot of people play games on that, so like 3DS makes a lot of sense.
1229000	1233000	I thought you weren't allowed to use electronics on the trains.
1233000	1236000	Oh, maybe not. I don't know, but it got me thinking about like all that.
1236000	1242000	It's probably the culture is probably more like, you know, friendly to the handhelds and so forth,
1242000	1246000	and then like Captain Spike was talking about how he has this,
1246000	1249000	and I know he takes the Bay Area train into work all the time,
1249000	1253000	and he probably has like an hour every day where he's able to play 3DS.
1253000	1258000	That's not part of my lifestyle, so I see the 3DS as, you know,
1258000	1261000	it's like the mini screen to play things on, because when I get home from work,
1261000	1264000	I plop on the couch and I want to play something on the TV,
1264000	1267000	so that's why I don't get as excited about handheld games.
1267000	1270000	But anyway, so there's no right or wrong.
1270000	1275000	I think it's just your perception based on your lifestyle, what kind of speaks to you.
1275000	1281000	So anyway, I was a little concerned about Smash on 3DS because, you know,
1281000	1284000	the game has a tendency to zoom in and out. It's fast paced.
1284000	1287000	Was it going to be too blurry? Was it going to be too hard to see?
1287000	1295000	And the answer is a little bit for me, but not game ruining bad, if that makes sense.
1295000	1298000	Keep in mind, I'm playing on an XL.
1298000	1302000	If I had a regular 3DS, and I know Bobby talked about this on his show tonight,
1302000	1305000	he had some frustrations playing on a regular 3DS,
1305000	1308000	I could see where that's going to be pretty hard to do,
1308000	1312000	especially when you get into those four player matches and the screen zooms all the way out.
1312000	1314000	That's going to be really rough.
1314000	1317000	Did you mess with the outline options or whatever in there?
1317000	1323000	Not really. I didn't really tinker with the... I don't even know if that was an option, so to speak, to play with.
1323000	1325000	I didn't even really get in there and play with that.
1325000	1326000	Yeah, you can adjust them.
1326000	1329000	Can you? Well, you know, and that's probably help.
1329000	1333000	But, you know, I didn't dislike it at all.
1333000	1338000	In fact, you know, it was Smash Brothers. It was enjoyable enough.
1338000	1340000	It's kind of, you know, what I remember.
1340000	1342000	I'm way more into the series than I do.
1342000	1345000	I can probably speak more as to, you know, the subtle differences and everything,
1345000	1348000	but I just know I had a lot of fun playing as Mega Man,
1348000	1351000	because I've gotten to play a Mega Man game that wasn't like a virtual console
1351000	1354000	or revisit of an old game in a very long time.
1354000	1357000	So getting to play as Mega Man in the demo was an awful lot of fun.
1357000	1359000	So that was pretty cool to me.
1359000	1363000	And, you know, I was able to win a couple matches and get a feel for the game
1363000	1367000	that it will probably be worth buying on 3DS.
1367000	1371000	It really depends on how long the wait is between 3DS and Wii U,
1371000	1374000	because they still haven't announced the date for Wii U, right?
1374000	1375000	Even though...
1375000	1376000	21st November.
1376000	1380000	Is that official or is that still the rumor based on the Fred Meyer leak?
1380000	1382000	It's been...
1382000	1384000	It's going to be the 21st of November, I'm sure.
1384000	1388000	I don't doubt that. That's literally the last Friday before Black Friday, right?
1388000	1395000	Well, that's when they have, was it, the new 3DS Pokemon games,
1395000	1396000	I guess, coming out as well.
1396000	1399000	So it's going to probably be around that time.
1399000	1403000	Just like even, like, grant the thought of the rumor was it was going to be coming out on the 18th
1403000	1405000	and it finally came out on the 18th, so...
1405000	1406000	Yeah.
1406000	1411000	So whether I get the game or not I think is really going to depend on
1411000	1413000	do all my friends get it too?
1413000	1415000	Do I have people to play with?
1415000	1418000	Is that hype thing going to be there?
1418000	1421000	Is there going to be functionality with the 3DS and the Wii U
1421000	1423000	that makes me want to buy the 3DS version?
1423000	1425000	Yes, I've heard about the controller, right?
1425000	1430000	Which, by the way, on an earlier show didn't I tinfoil hat and say
1430000	1433000	the 3DS could be a Wii U controller someday.
1433000	1434000	So...
1434000	1435000	But anyway.
1435000	1439000	You know why the 3DS is a Wii U controller actually makes a lot of sense?
1439000	1442000	Because what other controllers are there?
1442000	1444000	There's the Pro Controller, right?
1444000	1446000	But how many people have actually run out and bought those?
1446000	1450000	Or you get those little Wiimotes from the old Nintendo Wii
1450000	1452000	that don't really have very many buttons.
1452000	1456000	So the 3DS makes a very obvious, easy, portable controller.
1456000	1460000	Not everybody may like the way it feels, but it gives you the buttons
1460000	1462000	and the D-pad and everything that you need.
1462000	1464000	So it makes a lot of sense to me.
1464000	1465000	But anyway.
1465000	1468000	So that's ultimately going to be what I base it on.
1468000	1472000	I don't feel like I have to have Smash on the 3DS
1472000	1474000	knowing that the Wii U version is imminent.
1474000	1477000	But I'll probably get it.
1477000	1480000	It'll just kind of depend on a few other factors.
1480000	1481000	All right.
1481000	1484000	Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1484000	1489000	ActDef says, whether on 3DS or Wii U, Smash is going to be the game of these holidays.
1489000	1490000	Let's see.
1490000	1492000	Kaijuto says they should have given me a demo.
1492000	1494000	I'm an ambassador, dammit.
1494000	1496000	Let's see.
1496000	1499000	AkumaJP says you can do what you want on trains.
1499000	1505000	So apparently it's fine to play 3DS and all that stuff on the trains there.
1505000	1508000	Maybe I was just thinking more of the tucking on cell phones.
1508000	1509000	Perhaps.
1509000	1512000	And 5th Dream says you can't talk out loud on a phone on trains.
1512000	1513000	That's how I understood it anyway.
1513000	1514000	Maybe that's that.
1514000	1516000	And SH200Matt says I can see that.
1516000	1519000	I mean, I commute three hours a day to and from work.
1519000	1522000	I need to pass the time by playing a game or watching something on the trains
1522000	1524000	when I'm not sleeping, of course.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1527000	And my commute to work is 20 minutes in my car.
1527000	1528000	So I can't exactly.
1528000	1530000	I like to listen to the radio.
1530000	1532000	I can't play games or anything like that.
1532000	1539000	So, yeah, I guess it's very dependent, I guess, on how you do your day and your culture.
1539000	1544000	Well, I'm sure everybody else is going to be looking forward to that Smash demo on Friday,
1544000	1545000	those that aren't in yet.
1545000	1548000	And lots of people are going to be giving their impressions.
1548000	1550000	So I'm curious what you guys think throughout the week.
1550000	1552000	You can always send us an e-mail with your thoughts if you want.
1552000	1555000	Participate at orangelandradio.com.
1555000	1557000	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks
1557000	1560000	and what other video games we have been playing this week
1560000	1562000	besides some of the things we've brought up in the show already.
1562000	1564000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1564000	1565000	I dated birds.
1565000	1567000	We already talked about that.
1567000	1569000	Yeah, I've played Hot to Fool Boyfriend.
1569000	1571000	I've played a little bit of Mass Effect 3.
1571000	1574000	I've played some Final Fantasy XIV today.
1574000	1579000	This week has really been a lot of adjusting to my new work schedule
1579000	1582000	because now I work four days, ten hours.
1582000	1586000	So most of this morning was spent sleeping.
1586000	1591000	But, yeah, I'm actually going to be making it a point
1591000	1594000	to play more stuff that's on my list.
1594000	1596000	So Hot to Fool Boyfriend is every Tuesday.
1596000	1602000	I'm livestreaming it at twitch.tv forward slash dark sakura underscore olr.
1602000	1605000	And I'll probably be throwing in some other games too,
1605000	1609000	but I'm working now on my dailies for Final Fantasy XIV
1609000	1613000	and going to be getting back into Bravely Defart.
1613000	1615000	Good times.
1616000	1618000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1618000	1619000	I played nothing.
1619000	1621000	Again? Because you've been programming.
1621000	1623000	You've been playing your own game of secrets.
1623000	1625000	I haven't really been playing my own game,
1625000	1627000	but yeah, I've been programming my own game.
1627000	1629000	I had to rewrite my whole...
1629000	1632000	It's pretty much the whole way that everything's drawn in the game.
1632000	1634000	So I finished that this week.
1634000	1636000	And I just now...
1636000	1641000	The only thing I've left to do is rebuild my user interface for my editor.
1641000	1646000	So I'm not using the crappy old Unity user interface.
1646000	1648000	I'm actually going to use the nice ones.
1648000	1651000	So I've got to have to look into doing that.
1651000	1653000	There was a recommendation, because I watched this week
1653000	1655000	because my work's been really slow.
1655000	1659000	In fact, it's going to become pretty much non-existent at the end of this week
1659000	1662000	because they're going to shut off our current system.
1662000	1667000	And so at that point, I will have literally nothing to do.
1667000	1670000	Look for a new job, I guess.
1670000	1672000	Well, yeah. So I've been at work.
1672000	1674000	Hey, if anyone's hiring.
1674000	1677000	Yeah, exactly. Anyone's hiring, yeah.
1677000	1679000	So I've been just...
1679000	1682000	I watched some tutorial series.
1682000	1685000	They had Microsoft's Virtual Academy crap.
1685000	1687000	So they had some stuff talking about Unity
1687000	1693000	and talking about incorporating stuff into Microsoft Azure and that stuff.
1693000	1696000	So I was watching that, but they were showing the new user interface.
1696000	1700000	They did it in a certain way where the canvas was really large
1700000	1703000	so that the units on there equaled one pixel and stuff.
1703000	1706000	So I kind of want to set mine up like that, because that looked pretty cool
1706000	1708000	and made a lot of sense.
1708000	1710000	So I just have to figure that out.
1710000	1714000	Hopefully I'm getting close, because now that I've rewritten everything,
1714000	1717000	I think it's going to be efficient enough.
1717000	1719000	I mean, because, God, if this isn't efficient enough,
1719000	1721000	then I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
1721000	1723000	I don't know. I'll figure something out.
1723000	1727000	I think I've gotten it to the point now where it's as efficient as it's going to be.
1727000	1730000	And so we'll just have to play with that.
1730000	1734000	And yeah, so still shooting to have something playable soon, hopefully.
1734000	1735000	Nice.
1735000	1736000	But that's about it.
1736000	1740000	Yeah, I thought about getting Destiny, but I was just like,
1740000	1743000	yeah, you know, I can spend the money now.
1743000	1746000	But it would be on an Xbox version,
1746000	1748000	and I don't really want to get an Xbox One version,
1748000	1751000	because God knows when I'm getting an Xbox One.
1751000	1754000	I'm probably going to get PlayStation 4 at some point.
1754000	1756000	But I don't know.
1756000	1758000	I just didn't want to spend the money on it right now,
1758000	1760000	because I don't have the time to play it.
1760000	1763000	Or at least I just don't want to spend the time playing it right now.
1763000	1770000	Although Grand Theft Auto coming out again right around the corner is like, uh-oh.
1770000	1772000	That might get you, huh?
1772000	1773000	All right.
1773000	1775000	Well, then let me start off my gaming week talking about one thing
1775000	1778000	that I played briefly this week between everything else.
1778000	1781000	I got my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U this week.
1781000	1783000	Thank you very much.
1783000	1784000	Thank you very much.
1784000	1786000	Stop rolling your eyes over there, young lady.
1786000	1788000	I did get my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U,
1788000	1790000	so I played it just a little bit,
1790000	1792000	and I went right into multiplayer because I wanted to check out
1792000	1794000	how the multiplayer runs.
1794000	1797000	My only complaint is that loading times are a real pain in the butt,
1797000	1801000	but I seem to remember they were pretty bad on 360 as well,
1801000	1802000	so I can't really haze it for that.
1802000	1805000	And in multiplayer, you don't get the maps on the game pad.
1805000	1808000	You get the score, so you don't have to pause the game.
1808000	1811000	But I did not realize that that whole voice chat thing
1811000	1814000	that's in, like, Mario Kart 8 is in Mass Effect.
1814000	1817000	I thought you had to have a separate headset in order to use voice chat.
1817000	1820000	You don't. You can do talking through the Wii U game pad.
1820000	1823000	So that was unexpected and kind of cool.
1823000	1825000	So, yeah.
1825000	1828000	Otherwise, yeah, I didn't play a whole lot of that.
1828000	1830000	I just put it in and played it for a little bit.
1830000	1831000	Is it in-game or just in lobbies?
1831000	1832000	In-game.
1832000	1834000	Do they have that in-game in Mario Kart 8?
1834000	1836000	No, only in the lobby.
1836000	1837000	So, yeah, right?
1837000	1840000	There's this feature that doesn't seem to be in any other freaking game.
1840000	1841000	It's so stupid.
1841000	1843000	No, protect the kids! Protect them!
1843000	1844000	Oh, come on!
1844000	1846000	They are on the internet, okay?
1846000	1848000	They've already been exposed to everything already.
1848000	1849000	It's just...
1849000	1853000	No, there's a big mic button on the thing so that you can push it and then talk.
1853000	1856000	And it's like your push to talk is on the game pad.
1856000	1857000	You know what?
1857000	1860000	I hate encouraging this kind of behavior,
1860000	1862000	but I would totally be fine with them
1862000	1867000	enabling parental settings from the get-go
1867000	1870000	and paying 60 cents to unlock it
1870000	1872000	if all this bullshit would go away.
1872000	1875000	Like, if they just made the friend codes thing a lot easier,
1875000	1879000	if they just allowed voice chat throughout the entire thing the entire time,
1879000	1882000	I think it's worth it for that sacrifice.
1882000	1887000	Otherwise, with my week, I've been continuing on Diablo 3 in all different forms.
1887000	1891000	PC, I have my hardcore character I'm playing on PC.
1891000	1894000	I have a Crusader I'm playing on PC with a friend of mine.
1894000	1898000	Those are both seasonal characters, so I'm working through the 2.1 stuff with that.
1898000	1900000	And then I'm still playing on PS4.
1900000	1901000	I have my Barbarian.
1901000	1904000	I was playing a little bit with Extifer one night this week.
1904000	1907000	I think I'm up to, like, Paragon 30, I think, on my Barbarian.
1907000	1909000	And then I also have a hardcore Witch Doctor
1909000	1911000	because I'm trying to get the rest of those trophies.
1911000	1915000	I really think I am going to take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy,
1915000	1918000	which might not happen this holiday with all the other games coming out,
1918000	1920000	but I think eventually I will take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy.
1920000	1924000	I don't think, maybe on a PSN game somewhere,
1924000	1929000	but I don't think I have a single Platinum Trophy on any PSN game,
1929000	1933000	but it's totally achievable for me with Diablo 3, so I think I'm going to do it.
1933000	1937000	Alright, but then the other big thing this week that's been eating up an awful lot of my time,
1937000	1940000	as I'm sure many of you have had your time eaten up by this game,
1940000	1942000	except, of course, Loki didn't play it,
1942000	1945000	and I know Dar Sakura's not really interested in this title,
1945000	1947000	but I know a lot of you guys out there have been checking out Destiny.
1947000	1952000	Destiny, of course, the hugely anticipated Bungie title that released on 9ix9ine,
1952000	1957000	the makers of Halo, which, you know, I'm not huge on first-person shooters,
1957000	1960000	but I've always had a bit of a special place in my heart for Halo,
1960000	1962000	and I've told this story on the show before.
1962000	1966000	I got introduced to Halo 1 at a wedding at the reception.
1966000	1970000	The bride and groom decided they wanted to have a Halo land party for their wedding reception
1970000	1973000	because, you know, it was an awesome wedding like that.
1973000	1975000	So that's where I got introduced to Halo for the first time,
1975000	1977000	and I loved playing the multiplayer. It was a lot of fun,
1977000	1980000	and that rolled into playing Halo 2 with my buddies from college.
1980000	1983000	So I've always had a good respect for the Halo series,
1983000	1988000	and I really enjoyed Halo 4 as well, which I talked about on the show when that came out,
1988000	1991000	and that's probably what's going to finally make me get a freaking Xbox One,
1991000	1995000	is this Halo collection or Halo 5 will probably finally do it
1995000	1998000	because I know 343 has got the series now and they're doing a good job with it,
1998000	2000000	but I digress.
2000000	2002000	So Bungie's put out Destiny this week,
2002000	2008000	and it was not totally what I think we were expecting from the makers of Halo,
2008000	2011000	but, you know, you could say that based on the beta,
2011000	2016000	and I talked before when I played the beta about how Destiny felt more influenced
2016000	2021000	by a game like Phantasy Star Online than it necessarily did a game like Halo,
2021000	2025000	and I still believe that to be true with the full release of the game.
2025000	2029000	Let's talk about some of the good things about Destiny.
2029000	2035000	I love the way that Destiny fosters a cooperative environment.
2035000	2039000	You've heard the term mingle player out there apply to this game,
2039000	2043000	and I think that that is actually a really neat thing.
2043000	2049000	I don't think there's a whole lot of use out of random people on the planet while you're there.
2049000	2053000	Once in a great while, you might find that you're fighting the same pack of mobs,
2053000	2057000	so you inadvertently help each other, and that's, I guess, kind of cool,
2057000	2061000	but I like way more how, oh, everybody's playing Destiny this week,
2061000	2064000	and let's say Bobby sees that I'm online, which happened this week.
2064000	2066000	Bobby sees that I'm online playing, doing missions on the moon,
2066000	2069000	so he just presses a couple buttons, joins my fire team,
2069000	2072000	warps to where I am on the moon, and now we're doing missions together,
2072000	2075000	and that's kind of fun because we didn't have to set that up,
2075000	2077000	and I know there's a lot of co-op games out there,
2077000	2081000	but you have to kind of set that up and, oh, we're going to play co-op in such and such time.
2081000	2085000	The environment of Destiny is very drop-in, drop-out, and that's really cool,
2085000	2088000	and I like what they've done for adventuring in that way.
2088000	2092000	I love that as somebody who's not very good at first-person shooters,
2092000	2094000	I can out-level things.
2094000	2098000	I can take things at my own pace by doing these open-world missions on Earth
2098000	2100000	or on the moon or on Venus or whatever
2100000	2104000	and level myself to a point where then I can go back and play the story content,
2104000	2109000	and it's not as difficult because some of the story content does get pretty difficult,
2109000	2112000	and I don't know if I would be able to beat it
2112000	2115000	if I was necessarily at the same level that you're supposed to be.
2115000	2120000	So there is no difficulty scale in Destiny,
2120000	2126000	but it's okay because you can sort of create your own destiny
2126000	2131000	with the difficulty in regards to how much are you willing to go back and grind and some of that.
2131000	2135000	The music in Destiny is phenomenal,
2135000	2141000	which always makes that more surprising that the guy was let go from Bungie,
2141000	2143000	which we had that story a few months ago,
2143000	2145000	but neither here nor there.
2145000	2148000	The music in Destiny is fantastic,
2148000	2151000	very good at setting the ambiance and building the tension
2151000	2154000	when you get into these moments when the enemies just show up,
2154000	2159000	and it's not like a metal gear alarm goes off.
2159000	2163000	The music really builds naturally and builds this anticipation.
2163000	2169000	It's so well done, and even though I have caught similar bits being reused in places in the game,
2169000	2172000	the music doesn't get repetitive at all,
2172000	2177000	which in most MMOs, I'm using my quotey fingers because I don't really consider Destiny an MMO,
2177000	2180000	but in most MMOs, the music gets very repetitive.
2180000	2183000	That doesn't feel the case in Destiny, so that's very good.
2183000	2187000	And last but not least in the good column, graphics are fantastic,
2187000	2191000	and I'm playing on PS4, and I just got to the Venus level,
2191000	2194000	and it's gorgeous, my god.
2194000	2196000	I could just sit there and walk around.
2196000	2198000	I was doing that on the moon. I was just walking around.
2198000	2201000	Where's another pretty cave I can go in and look at pretty purple things?
2201000	2205000	Because that was a lot of fun.
2205000	2207000	Let's talk about some of the not so good about Destiny,
2207000	2210000	because I haven't read reviews out there.
2210000	2215000	I don't usually read a lot of reviews on games unless my friends write them.
2215000	2220000	But my understanding is the Metacritic for Destiny is not above 90,
2220000	2227000	which for a game of this magnitude of anticipation means it's an absolute colossal failure.
2227000	2231000	I don't really mean that. It's just the impression I'm getting from Twitter.
2231000	2234000	So I don't remember what the Metacritic is for this game right now.
2234000	2238000	It's high 70s, low 80s, something like that, which is still good.
2238000	2241000	And isn't 70 considered average? I don't know.
2241000	2244000	Is 50 considered average? I don't even know what the hell is considered average on Metacritic.
2244000	2249000	But it sounds like it's still at least above average, and that's probably where I'd place Destiny 2.
2249000	2251000	I would not give this game an A+.
2251000	2258000	In fact, I may review the game on VoG later once I've been able to complete my playthrough.
2258000	2263000	But some of the things I can tell you that detract from the game a little bit.
2263000	2269000	For a game this caliber with this much anticipation, with this much of a budget that's gone into it,
2269000	2273000	the story sucks. There's no easy way to say it.
2273000	2275000	There's no nice sugar-coat-y way to say it.
2275000	2277000	The story's really uninteresting.
2277000	2280000	I don't really fucking care why I'm blowing up all these aliens.
2280000	2284000	These cutscenes I'm forced to watch that I can't skip over that are really annoying.
2284000	2288000	It just seems so generic. Ugh.
2288000	2293000	It's really not until I got to Venus and this first cutscene on Venus where I finally met a character
2293000	2297000	where I was like, okay, now this character is at least borderline interesting.
2297000	2302000	But it's so badly voice-acted, too.
2302000	2304000	We've talked about this during the beta.
2304000	2308000	The Peter Dinklage ghost character. Not a good character.
2308000	2314000	And your own avatar, whatever you tend to play as, either a female or a male,
2314000	2319000	like human or Awoken or robot, dude or dudette, I don't remember what they're called.
2319000	2323000	Sometimes your character talks like they're there.
2323000	2329000	Sometimes your character is that MMO character that doesn't do the talk and everybody else talks around.
2329000	2336000	It's so weird how your character is sometimes there and sometimes not, it seems like, in the way the story is told.
2336000	2339000	So, yeah, not a good story.
2339000	2346000	And for a game of this magnitude, especially coming from Bungie, I was really surprised and kind of disappointed.
2346000	2349000	It's flat. I'm not interested.
2349000	2352000	Now, granted, I haven't beat it yet, so maybe it picks up a lot of steam,
2352000	2359000	but it would still be a detractor that has taken this long to get interesting, if that's the case.
2359000	2364000	One of the detractors of Phantasy Star Online plays into this game as well,
2364000	2371000	is that you're killing the same things over and over and over again with the hope that some new loot will drop.
2371000	2378000	And right in Phantasy Star Online, it was always the dudes with the claws and sometimes Arapi would come out in forest, right?
2378000	2381000	You have to kill more, kill more, kill more.
2381000	2384000	Or the other of the lizard-y things.
2384000	2386000	Yes, and the lizard-y things.
2386000	2390000	And there's probably two or three different monster types on Earth and on the Moon.
2390000	2393000	That variety is a little bit eh.
2393000	2398000	They try to spice it up with this thing that reminds me of the fates in Final Fantasy XIV,
2398000	2401000	where this big world event will suddenly happen.
2401000	2406000	It doesn't happen very often, but for instance, one time I was on Earth doing patrol missions
2406000	2409000	and a giant spider boss showed up for everybody to kill.
2409000	2411000	And you would get stuff if you participated in that.
2411000	2418000	So that made it at least a little more interesting, but it is kind of a slog of the same stuff over and over.
2418000	2422000	I get really excited when I see something new in the game. That helps out a lot.
2422000	2427000	And the other big problem I have with the game, which again, coming from the makers of Halo,
2427000	2430000	really surprises me that this is kind of a weak point of the game.
2430000	2441000	PvP. It's gated, which means that you have to, if you want to play the PvP free-for-all deathmatch,
2441000	2448000	which was always my favorite thing to play in Halo, you have to play a 3v3 control map one time.
2448000	2450000	Win or lose, you must play that map.
2450000	2453000	Then you must play a team deathmatch map.
2453000	2456000	Then you will unlock the free-for-all deathmatch.
2456000	2461000	And by the way, you can't even get to the Crucible until you're like level 5 or 6 or something in the story.
2461000	2467000	So if I want to buy Destiny and just hop in a brawl with my friends,
2467000	2470000	where we're all going to just blow the fuck out of each other with rocket launchers,
2470000	2472000	you can't do that in Destiny.
2472000	2474000	You have to wait until you get to a certain point.
2474000	2476000	You're going to have to play to unlock it.
2476000	2483000	And then when you get there, I tried playing some of the PvP,
2483000	2489000	and it didn't really thrill me the way that playing Halo did for the first time or playing any of that did.
2489000	2492000	It really feels like the sideshow.
2492000	2499000	So if you're looking at Destiny for PvP, I kind of worry that you're going to be a little bit disappointed.
2499000	2504000	Now I know that Bungie plans to do these events where they're going to roll out special maps for a weekend.
2504000	2507000	But again, that seems really weird to me too.
2507000	2512000	Why are you going to have that stuff only playable for like 3 days and then shut it off?
2512000	2518000	I mean, it's one thing to roll it out slowly or whatever, but why have something that's not going to be there again?
2518000	2521000	I don't know if I get the logic behind that.
2521000	2524000	So PvP, not as fun as I was hoping.
2524000	2529000	Alright, going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2530000	2531000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
2531000	2534000	It's literally the same fucking story as so many other things.
2534000	2539000	We discovered alien technology and everything was awesome and we were in outer space being hella rad,
2539000	2542000	but then aliens came and killed everybody and we're just trying to survive now.
2542000	2544000	Yep.
2544000	2545000	BlackWolf in chat says,
2545000	2548000	I don't blame Peter Dinklage, I blame his director.
2548000	2554000	Me too. Unfortunately, the blame is going to ultimately fall on Peter Dinklage, whether it's his fault or not.
2554000	2559000	That sucks, but I agree that the direction of the story in general, it's a problem.
2559000	2566000	And it's so frustrating because on one hand, the audio is so good.
2566000	2571000	The music is so good that the story components and the narration, the talking doesn't match.
2571000	2574000	And it's a glaring issue.
2574000	2576000	I don't know how else to put it.
2576000	2581000	I notice when these characters open their mouths, I'm just like, shut up, I want to hear the music.
2581000	2585000	What you're saying is literally not important.
2585000	2588000	Let's see.
2588000	2589000	Tigerclaw says,
2589000	2591000	I heard how this game is much like Halo.
2591000	2594000	The ghost character is basically the guilty spark from Halo.
2594000	2597000	Again, I think it's more Phantasy Star Online than Halo.
2597000	2599000	I stand by that.
2599000	2601000	Let's see.
2601000	2603000	SSG100Matt says,
2603000	2606000	Sounds like a ton of hoops to jump through just to play PvP.
2606000	2607000	Yep.
2607000	2610000	But there's a lot of people that don't give two shits about PvP,
2610000	2614000	so I can understand where that's like an asset to them, maybe.
2614000	2617000	But for me, I was hoping to just play a little bit of it.
2617000	2621000	But I'm glad that also one thing I noticed in PvP, I can't hear anybody.
2621000	2623000	And I don't know if that's just a PlayStation 4 thing,
2623000	2626000	or if they just flat out turn the voice chat off in PvP.
2626000	2629000	And I kind of hope that's the case, honestly,
2629000	2632000	is that they just turn the damn voice chat off on PvP.
2632000	2634000	Dungeonbuster says,
2634000	2638000	I technically beat it, and then I'll just leave it at that.
2638000	2641000	Destiny will sometimes mix encounters up with specials, too.
2641000	2644000	Enemies with yellow names that are a bit tougher.
2644000	2646000	And Dungeonbuster continues,
2646000	2650000	More stuff only opens up post level 20.
2650000	2652000	Economy is also gated limited.
2652000	2656000	You can only earn so many Vanguard Crucible Marks currency per week,
2656000	2658000	and that's what's needed to buy legendary equipment
2658000	2661000	coupled with an appropriate faction rank.
2661000	2666000	Yeah, that's where MMO is very much.
2666000	2667000	Blackwool says,
2667000	2670000	Marty O'Donnell must have hated the voice acting, so he was fired.
2670000	2671000	Well, who knows? Who knows?
2671000	2674000	So anyway, that's my thoughts on Destiny.
2674000	2676000	And yeah, there you have it.
2676000	2679000	So we are going to get into some housekeeping,
2679000	2681000	and then we're going to get into tonight's news.
2681000	2683000	And then I'm going to say hi to our guests tonight
2683000	2685000	who are just arriving here in studio.
2685000	2689000	I'm going to get them miked up here while we have Loki start off the news.
2689000	2692000	First off, follow us on YouTube.
2692000	2693000	Our shows are posted to YouTube,
2693000	2696000	where you can hear them on your 3DS or wherever you like.
2696000	2698000	YouTube username is OrangeLoungeRadio.
2698000	2701000	You can also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2701000	2705000	And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
2705000	2708000	Curious to see what you guys think about Destiny.
2708000	2710000	I'm going to try to beat the game,
2710000	2714000	so I feel armed enough to do a review for vognetwork.com later in the week.
2714000	2716000	And of course, should that happen,
2716000	2720000	you guys will be able to leave your response reviews there at vognetwork.com.
2720000	2723000	Tigerclaw says, sounds like Destiny was destined to fail.
2723000	2726000	I'm going to leave it at this and then get into the news here.
2726000	2728000	I don't think Destiny is a failure by any means.
2728000	2729000	In fact, I don't think it's a bad game.
2729000	2730000	I think it's an above average game.
2730000	2733000	There's a lot of great things to really like about Destiny.
2733000	2735000	But is the game perfect?
2735000	2737000	Nope, and I just told you why.
2737000	2739000	So, all right, let's get into some news.
2739000	2741000	Loki, start us off tonight.
2741000	2744000	All right, so the big news this week was that,
2744000	2747000	well first off, it started off as a rumor that
2747000	2752000	Mojang was going to be purchased by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.
2752000	2755000	Now, apparently, it is going to be official.
2755000	2758000	It's expected to be announced on Monday.
2758000	2762000	And, yeah, so they're going to be merged with Microsoft.
2762000	2764000	And so what exactly does this mean?
2764000	2767000	No idea yet, but the thought is that
2767000	2771000	Microsoft is using this acquisition as sort of a way to help
2771000	2774000	boost its presence in the PC and console market.
2774000	2777000	Which is kind of weird because PC-wise, I think they have
2777000	2781000	pretty much the lion's share of operating systems,
2781000	2785000	but maybe it'll convince people to buy stuff on the Windows Store?
2785000	2786000	I don't know.
2786000	2789000	But they're saying that they're going to try to use this to boost
2789000	2792000	the sales of Windows Phone and Surface tablets.
2792000	2798000	I think even if Microsoft made Minecraft exclusively for Windows Phone,
2798000	2800000	no one would still buy a Windows Phone.
2800000	2803000	So I'm not really sure what they're thinking there.
2803000	2806000	Well, what the hell is Microsoft hoping to gain from something like this?
2806000	2809000	Like, is Microsoft trying to just get the Minecraft IP?
2809000	2810000	Is this what it boils down to?
2810000	2813000	Because my understanding is Notch isn't coming with the deal.
2813000	2817000	So, I mean, are they getting access to Scrolls,
2817000	2819000	the new thing that Mojang's supposed to be working on?
2819000	2822000	Or is it just we want to have Minecraft 2 exclusive to our shit?
2822000	2823000	Is that what this all boils down to?
2823000	2825000	Maybe that's what it's all going to boil down to.
2825000	2829000	But, I mean, it's like, shit, there's like so many Minecraft clones out there.
2829000	2830000	It's like a dime a dozen.
2830000	2833000	I'm sure, you know, where the platforms that this is not on,
2833000	2837000	a new, you know, clone will rise up and take its place.
2837000	2840000	I mean, hell, there's all these people that are behind like Spoutcraft
2840000	2842000	and shit like that that have made all these mods.
2842000	2846000	It's going to be very easy for them to come around and do like almost like
2846000	2848000	an in the groove, if you will, of Minecraft, you know,
2848000	2851000	where it's going to be something that's sort of Minecraft,
2851000	2853000	but not quite Minecraft.
2853000	2857000	It's really weird to me, too, that didn't Notch take issue with the fact
2857000	2859000	that Facebook bought, I mean, this has to be said,
2859000	2862000	that Facebook bought the Oculus Rift for $2 billion.
2862000	2864000	Yeah, $2 billion changes your mind quite quickly.
2864000	2865000	How did that song go?
2865000	2867000	Sell out with me tonight.
2867000	2868000	Sell out.
2868000	2870000	Everything's going to be all right.
2870000	2871000	Doo, doo, doo.
2871000	2872000	90s? Anybody? 90s?
2872000	2873000	All right. Anyway.
2873000	2875000	All right, look, I know there's some guys here that want to comment
2875000	2878000	on the Minecraft situation and talk about a lot of different things going on.
2878000	2882000	Joining us now in studio, welcome back to the show, Diego.
2882000	2883000	Hello.
2883000	2884000	And Jonas.
2884000	2885000	Hello.
2885000	2889000	From the TeaBaggers, or the Big Anime Game Room.
2889000	2891000	You know I can't stop calling it the TeaBaggers, sorry.
2891000	2893000	The Big Anime Game Room.
2893000	2894000	How's it going, you guys?
2894000	2895000	Great. How are you doing?
2895000	2897000	Good. How did SAC Anime go?
2897000	2899000	You guys took your rig over to SAC Anime, right?
2899000	2901000	Yeah, this is probably the busiest show we've ever done.
2901000	2902000	Is it really?
2902000	2903000	Yes, for SAC Anime.
2903000	2906000	What were some of the hits that you guys had out on the floor
2906000	2908000	that people were just like, oh, my God, we got to play this
2908000	2910000	and keep playing this, can't get enough of it?
2910000	2913000	Well, I'd say like the biggest hit is when we did the Mario Kart 8 tournament
2913000	2918000	on the re-structured pre-registration when we made it into our main events hall,
2918000	2920000	which turned out really spectacular.
2920000	2923000	We filled up that entire room.
2923000	2924000	It was amazing.
2924000	2925000	There were so many people there.
2925000	2928000	We got a big hype up with a lot of the people.
2928000	2932000	People were having fun, a lot of cheers, a lot of good emotions and everything.
2932000	2933000	Nice, nice.
2933000	2936000	Well, this is probably the first chance a lot of people have
2936000	2938000	to kind of show off their skills in Mario Kart 8, too,
2938000	2940000	since the game hasn't been out that long.
2940000	2942000	So, awesome.
2942000	2946000	Well, look, I saw you guys, I suppose I saw Jonas was trying to put his hand up
2946000	2947000	while Loki was talking about Minecraft.
2947000	2952000	So, what's your guys' take on this Minecraft possibly being sold to Microsoft tomorrow?
2952000	2958000	With the whole trend of people buying, kind of like what Facebook did with Oculus Rift,
2958000	2961000	I think a lot of these companies, just by the way, it's my opinion,
2961000	2966000	a lot of these companies are just trying to buy the IP so no one else will take it.
2966000	2968000	It's kind of like what everyone was fighting with Twitch.
2968000	2969000	Interesting.
2969000	2975000	So, it's more about, even though they're not going to pull Minecraft from PlayStation 4, necessarily,
2975000	2979000	if Microsoft were to buy it, Sony's not going to get anything else from Minecraft.
2979000	2981000	I don't know that's the case, but if you think about it,
2981000	2986000	I can see where if you buy the Oculus Rift, you're kind of investing in the Oculus,
2986000	2989000	and you know that that's going to bring revenue down the line
2989000	2995000	because this could be the future of entertainment, of gaming, of the internet, whatever.
2995000	3002000	Same with Twitch. Obviously, a service like that is going to evolve into something.
3002000	3007000	It could be very much like the next YouTube, whereas Minecraft, shit, that's a game.
3007000	3015000	I mean, look at even the big games like Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds and stuff on mobile.
3015000	3021000	It blows me away how much those companies get bolstered up by that one breakaway title too.
3021000	3022000	Look at Zynga.
3022000	3030000	Yeah, it's all this stuff. I mean, they have their height, and then eventually the interest kind of fades away.
3030000	3035000	And I think, first off, discontinuing support for Bucket.
3035000	3041000	I mean, yeah, they're going to continue developing internally, but it's not where it was before.
3041000	3043000	That's got to hurt.
3043000	3049000	And the fact that I'm sure it's going to continue on PC, but say the next Minecraft comes out and stuff,
3050000	3055000	I don't think people are going to... Minecraft is a good game, but I don't know if it's a system seller.
3055000	3059000	I mean, people are excited about it, but it's just... I'm not going to buy the...
3059000	3064000	Isn't Minecraft on the 360 still continuously top 10 every month since the game was released?
3064000	3071000	That's true, yeah. It is a top title because it's cheap, and it's good for kids.
3071000	3075000	It's a family-friendly title. It's cheap.
3075000	3080000	There's not really anything that will dissuade you from playing it, I guess. I don't know.
3080000	3083000	I don't want my kids being around no creatures.
3083000	3089000	I'm all for them, though, coming out with a new Minecraft tier that has enhanced visuals, but still has the voxel stuff on there.
3089000	3091000	They can already do enhanced visuals in Minecraft.
3091000	3095000	I know on PC they can do it with mods, but I would love to see that as the standard.
3095000	3099000	They have to sell the mods they sell you, too. I bought the PlayStation 4 version,
3099000	3105000	and it's even in there where you can play with these skins, but you can't save your world.
3105000	3108000	They have the new block skins and stuff like that.
3108000	3114000	I think it also... I think iOS also has Minecraft if I crawl in Android, I think.
3114000	3116000	Pocket edition, yeah.
3116000	3122000	Yeah, because I see my nephews and nieces play it a lot on the mobile devices,
3122000	3126000	so I think that's probably what Microsoft's trying to prevent people from doing.
3126000	3130000	Take it away from iOS and Android users and put it straight to Windows Phone.
3130000	3132000	That's my assumption.
3132000	3135000	Why would you take it out completely, though, of the iOS?
3135000	3137000	Well, they'll just come out with something.
3137000	3143000	If Microsoft was going to be very territorial with it and just block sales of it,
3143000	3147000	I don't think it's going to sell a lot of Windows Phones.
3147000	3152000	People don't buy a phone, especially a terrible phone like Windows Phone.
3152000	3155000	I'm sorry, my wife has one. It's fucking terrible.
3155000	3162000	They're not going to buy a phone that's terrible like that just to play Minecraft Pocket Edition.
3162000	3165000	I mean, you're fucking insane if you buy a phone for an app.
3165000	3168000	That's like saying, oh, Angry Birds is exclusive to this phone.
3168000	3171000	Not Angry Birds, Flappy Birds is exclusive to this phone.
3171000	3173000	Are you really going to fucking buy a phone for that?
3173000	3178000	Bull's Advocate, you could say that there's probably some people that bought an iPhone for Siri.
3178000	3180000	That's stupid.
3180000	3182000	No, seriously, it's stupid.
3182000	3184000	I tried. All right.
3185000	3187000	Live.vognetwork.com says,
3195000	3198000	And we all know how that relationship turned out in the end.
3198000	3201000	Now Bungie is giving all the secret stuff to Sony.
3201000	3205000	Here's hoping they learn from that and just leave Mojang alone.
3205000	3209000	Well, they could just purchase Mojang and it could just be Mojang,
3210000	3214000	and they'll make money from anything that they produce.
3214000	3216000	Two billion.
3216000	3218000	Go ahead, Jonas.
3218000	3222000	That is true. Just buy the whole Mojang if they're going to do something like that.
3222000	3225000	Two billion just seems like so much money.
3225000	3230000	I doubt that Scrolls is going to be as big as Minecraft was,
3230000	3233000	and I don't even know what else they have in the pipeline,
3233000	3236000	because obviously a lot of that stuff Notch is working on.
3237000	3242000	I don't know. I just can't see this being a very smart purchase,
3242000	3245000	especially for that kind of money, but whatever.
3245000	3249000	I guess they can license the shit out of it.
3249000	3252000	Maybe Windows 9 will have it as a default game.
3252000	3254000	It'll just come prepackaged with like...
3254000	3256000	It's like the new Solitaire or Minesweeper.
3256000	3261000	Dude, that would be... You want to talk about firing a torpedo into productivity, man.
3261000	3263000	There you go.
3263000	3265000	Okay, over to our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com.
3265000	3267000	The seg says,
3267000	3269000	Siri has a lot more day-to-day functions than any game.
3269000	3271000	I don't know, dude.
3271000	3273000	I've got to say this very tongue-in-cheek,
3273000	3275000	but Minecraft is a way of life for some people.
3275000	3277000	People have made millions off of Minecraft.
3277000	3279000	I'm talking all those freaking YouTube channels,
3279000	3284000	and people have careers out of Minecraft.
3284000	3287000	It's crazy.
3287000	3289000	But I don't know.
3289000	3291000	It's just... Wow, it's so huge.
3291000	3293000	Which, again, I go, but $2 billion for Minecraft,
3293000	3295000	but then I remember, but yes,
3295000	3297000	people are making all this money off Minecraft.
3297000	3302000	Maybe Microsoft just wants to issue YouTube takedown claims
3302000	3304000	and get the money off all those videos.
3304000	3305000	That's what this is.
3305000	3307000	That's what this is.
3307000	3310000	Microsoft wants all this because they don't have a network anymore,
3310000	3312000	so Minecraft TV, 24-7 on the Xbox One.
3312000	3314000	I don't think they can do that because they've already had it
3314000	3317000	in their end-user license agreement that they're allowing them to do that.
3317000	3319000	I don't know if you can go back on that.
3319000	3320000	Maybe you can.
3320000	3322000	I don't know. $2 billion, you can do a lot.
3322000	3324000	Alright, moving on.
3324000	3326000	That $2 billion will buy a lot.
3326000	3329000	It could buy more, well, except now Microsoft's spending it,
3329000	3332000	so I guess they'll not be able to use that money to get more patches.
3332000	3335000	Yeah, why couldn't they have spent $2 billion on,
3335000	3337000	I don't know, making Windows 8 not suck?
3337000	3338000	You know what I mean?
3338000	3340000	Why couldn't they have spent money on that?
3340000	3342000	Or, I don't know, making Windows phone not suck.
3342000	3345000	Can you imagine what $2.5 billion could do for research
3345000	3348000	in a non-shitty operating system for their phones?
3348000	3350000	I mean, that would be fantastic.
3350000	3351000	Alright, well, one thing Microsoft...
3351000	3353000	Or Kinect. Holy fuck.
3353000	3354000	One thing Microsoft...
3354000	3355000	Yeah, I know.
3355000	3358000	Think of all the Kinect games that could have been made for $2 billion.
3358000	3360000	Oh my god, what a good point.
3360000	3363000	Like, $2 billion could have bought, like, a lot.
3363000	3366000	Like, you could have bought Harmonix to pump more Kinect exclusives.
3366000	3369000	You could have bought, like, oh my god, anyway.
3369000	3371000	Moving on.
3371000	3373000	Some more system updates with some of that money.
3373000	3377000	A new Xbox One system update coming out in October.
3377000	3382000	It will be a firmware update that will make some changes to the Snap feature on Xbox One.
3382000	3386000	Easier access to the Snap without having to back all the way out to the Home menu.
3386000	3390000	You will be able to use Snap after October to show friendless messages
3390000	3393000	and achievement progress in real time.
3393000	3394000	Get ready, Trophy Whores.
3394000	3396000	Achievement... Excuse me, Achievement Whores.
3396000	3398000	Trophies is the other system.
3398000	3403000	Also, there will be a button command that will record the last 30 seconds of gameplay.
3403000	3406000	So, a share button?
3406000	3411000	So, it replaces you yelling at the Kinect to record that,
3411000	3413000	because, as we know, not everybody has a Kinect anymore.
3413000	3415000	And they're not selling systems with Kinect, really.
3415000	3418000	I mean, one out of the four, five excuses they have.
3418000	3421000	More codecs will be built into the console's media player,
3421000	3427000	and there will be support for a digital TV tuner that is coming out in Europe at the end of October.
3427000	3432000	So, that is all coming to the Xbox One this next month ahead of the holidays.
3432000	3434000	Dark Soccer.
3434000	3438000	Well, you know, we've been talking about Bucket, right? The Craft Bucket?
3438000	3439000	You mean Mr. Bucket?
3439000	3441000	Uh, Mr. Bucket?
3441000	3444000	Hello? The... spits out the thing?
3444000	3446000	Ugh.
3446000	3447000	Yes!
3447000	3448000	I hear he's a bucket of fun.
3448000	3450000	Yes, he's a bucket of fun.
3450000	3458000	Anyway, the guy who did Craft Bucket, basically Wesley Wolf, has been swatted.
3458000	3460000	For anyone who doesn't know what swatting is,
3460000	3467000	it's basically when someone calls in some sort of fake police report
3467000	3470000	that would be enough to cause a swat team to come to the scene.
3470000	3476000	In this case, someone called and said that he had shot and killed his parents
3476000	3478000	and were going to kill more people.
3478000	3488000	In response to, basically, Wolf having done the DMCA takedown for Craft Bucket.
3488000	3490000	Yeah, the whole thing we talked about last week, right?
3490000	3491000	Exactly.
3491000	3498000	So, somebody is trying to prove a point by sending the police over to this guy's house,
3498000	3503000	by committing a criminal act, because in California, this is happening to celebrities all the time.
3503000	3504000	This happened in Texas.
3504000	3505000	No, but still.
3505000	3513000	But I'm saying it actually, in Texas it's probably even just as big, if not a bigger deal.
3513000	3521000	But on top of that, the police said that they set up a perimeter around this house
3521000	3524000	and used a PA system to get the attention of the family.
3524000	3530000	And then they talked to Wolf and his parents and confirmed everyone was safe and sound.
3530000	3537000	Basically, the call came through Skype on an untraceable line.
3538000	3545000	I don't understand, in the year 2014, when we've placed a robot on Mars.
3545000	3551000	We have a robot on Mars, yet we have untraceable lines on Skype. I don't understand.
3551000	3558000	And the NSA can spy on everybody, but yet that one call that was made on Skype is fucking impossible.
3558000	3562000	Well, what they know right now is that, okay, they said that they're working a little bit deeper on it.
3562000	3566000	That they know that the call was based in California.
3566000	3572000	So they are tracing it, but they said that the call itself, and my apologies, was unidentified.
3572000	3578000	Well, I hope they find this fucker, because this is not the way to prove your point.
3578000	3585000	I don't understand extremists when it comes to certain opinions in the gaming community.
3586000	3591000	People go to these huge extremes, from swatting people to sending tweets that, you know,
3591000	3597000	I'm gonna kick your ass and rip off your head and shove my dick down your throat and all this stuff.
3597000	3599000	They learned it from Duke Nukem!
3599000	3603000	All these hideous things people say on Twitter to try and prove a point.
3603000	3610000	What kind of point are you making with that? You are an asshole! That's the point you're making.
3610000	3613000	Anyway, sorry Diego, I just got on a rant.
3613000	3618000	When she was talking about the whole swat thing, I think I was reading an article that popped up on Facebook,
3618000	3621000	because someone had shared that about one person that was caught doing that,
3621000	3625000	and in the process of that they were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
3625000	3628000	And I was reading up on that, that this one child was pretty much crying his eyes out,
3628000	3633000	and my friend who had posted up the feed was like, well, that's what you get, you so-and-so, so-and-so.
3633000	3637000	And I'm like, wow, and I read the article, I was shocked, and the kid pretty much on the pictures itself,
3637000	3641000	he was just crying his eyes out, and I said, exactly, you shouldn't be doing that stuff.
3641000	3643000	Like, they actually caught someone in the act in that.
3643000	3647000	Well, and then I'm thinking, as you're saying that, I'm also thinking of when,
3647000	3652000	this just happened a couple weeks ago, was there was that guy, and he was the executive of some company,
3652000	3656000	somebody in chat's got to fill in, but he was on that flight that was going from Texas or whatever,
3656000	3662000	and somebody tweeted a bomb threat at the airline, and they put his, they grounded his plane,
3662000	3669000	and it was, I think this all had to do with that Gamergate fuckery, where they, I think, they grounded his-
3669000	3671000	I thought it was a Sony exec.
3671000	3676000	I think it was, but, you know, I think he made a comment that somebody didn't like,
3676000	3682000	so they tweeted a bomb threat to the airline, and his plane got grounded, all the bags were searched,
3682000	3691000	and it's like, dude, in trying to prove your point, you have committed a federal offense.
3691000	3696000	There are some things you don't do in a post-9-11 world.
3696000	3703000	Tweeting a bomb threat to an airline is one of them, you idiot. What point are you making with that?
3703000	3708000	The point is, you're an asshole. That's the only point that's coming out of that. Come on.
3708000	3714000	Debate is one thing. Discussion is another thing. Bomb threats, you're an asshole.
3714000	3721000	Exactly, like, I'm still kind of laughing at that right now, but exactly, it's as idiotic as that sounds as well.
3721000	3726000	You say it like this when you go towards the circumstances of talking about certain things, such as things like,
3726000	3731000	you lied to the government, that's a felony, but if the government lies to you, that's politics.
3731000	3737000	That's a whole nother Oprah, as we say.
3737000	3740000	Do you want to hear Matt say that article that might have been fake?
3740000	3748000	But the thing is that they're going to give a kid, even just using this example, 25 to life,
3748000	3753000	but yet they let rapists go after five years. I don't know.
3753000	3760000	Well, that is true. The judicial law is just corrupted as it is. Like we said, even though justice is blind, they just let people walk every day.
3760000	3763000	Justice is fueled by economy.
3763000	3768000	Not everybody's going to agree with me on this, and that's fine, we'll just have to have a political debate,
3768000	3771000	but whoever called in this swatting thing, you know what they need to do?
3771000	3778000	This is how MSNBC is going to get their ratings, because what they're going to do is they're going to turn MSNBC into a channel
3778000	3783000	where they're going to take this kid who called in the threat, and they're going to walk him out,
3783000	3787000	and they're going to pull his pants down on TV, and they're going to spank him.
3787000	3790000	They're going to spank him in front of the entire nation.
3790000	3793000	It was a hoax, by the way, a fake.
3793000	3795000	What, the whole swatting thing on this guy?
3795000	3796000	The one that they caught.
3796000	3803000	Okay, well, whoever swatted this guy, you know who needs to do it? Supernanny.
3803000	3805000	They should send him to Singapore.
3805000	3811000	No, Supernanny's going to pull down his pants and say, you've been a very naughty boy.
3811000	3816000	You need to sit on the naughty step and think about what you've done. And that's it.
3816000	3824000	But you have to understand that she only puts them in timeouts. Spanking is not really something that they approve.
3824000	3825000	Well, then get somebody else.
3825000	3827000	That's why I said send him to Singapore.
3827000	3829000	Get Jamie. Jamie will spank him.
3829000	3831000	That's why he has to sit on the noise.
3831000	3834000	As long as Jamie has some hand sanitizer, she'll do it.
3834000	3842000	No, that's okay, because not using hand sanitizer and anti-bacterials makes your immune system stronger.
3842000	3845000	Alright, anyway.
3845000	3848000	You don't need to use that shit unless you're a doctor.
3848000	3852000	Bochi Kawa says, fuck yeah, more spanking for children. Some of these kids need to learn.
3852000	3862000	This person's probably 23. I'm not talking about spanking children. If you act like a child, though, then you should be spanked.
3862000	3864000	This 23-year-old or whoever did this.
3864000	3867000	And now I'm just making up who called this in.
3867000	3881000	I cannot believe that when we, again, can travel to space, when we have all this technology in the palm of our hand, we can't trace a fucking phone call.
3881000	3888000	Well, it is Microsoft. They could have used that $2.5 billion to invest in their Skype system to be able to trace that fucking call.
3888000	3893000	I just had a brilliant thought. You know what should be done for people who break certain laws?
3893000	3895000	They need to have it tattooed on their face.
3895000	3900000	No, no, no. Have it permanently marked on their bodies for the rest of their lives.
3900000	3903000	Didn't they write a book like that hundreds of years ago called The Scarlet Letter?
3903000	3905000	No, that was sewn onto her shirt.
3906000	3913000	And that was because she was practicing the free rights that men had at the time.
3913000	3919000	Look, we started here. Now we're over here. Let's get back to the other video game news.
3919000	3923000	All right. Loki, bring us back here with something else.
3923000	3930000	All right. So, unfortunately, on Twitch, it's become a kind of a new haven for phishing scams.
3931000	3935000	It kind of goes to show you, don't click on links that you don't know what they fucking are.
3935000	3938000	Don't just click random links that appear in chat.
3938000	3946000	Apparently, they're saying that there's some sort of Counter Strike Go prize type links that are appearing.
3946000	3951000	And it pops up that, oh, you've won the weapon or something in the game.
3951000	3956000	And you have to log in to your Steam account to redeem it or something.
3956000	3961000	And so, when you log in, of course, it steals all your account information then goes through your stuff.
3961000	3967000	If you happen to be a Counter Strike Go player and sells all your weapons and shit that you got for money.
3967000	3969000	They steal that somehow.
3969000	3973000	That's actually pretty fucking clever, which kind of sucks.
3973000	3979000	Don't hear me wrong here. These guys are assholes for stealing all this stuff that isn't theirs.
3979000	3983000	But it just goes to show you, they'll go to pretty great lengths to do it.
3983000	3988000	And with Twitch becoming more and more mainstream as it is, they're going to come for you on there.
3988000	3994000	Oh my gosh. So be careful. Don't put your username and password in places where...
3994000	3999000	Always check the URL to make sure you're actually on Steam's website and all that.
3999000	4001000	Very important.
4001000	4005000	Or better off, just research all this stuff that goes on.
4006000	4014000	I'll tell everything later about fixing so many computers because people accidentally clicked one thing and now they get all this crap happening on their computer.
4014000	4017000	Pornography? On my computer?
4018000	4020000	It's more real than you think.
4025000	4029000	Anyhow, let's move on to something happy.
4029000	4032000	You know what, Jamie? I know you were a fan of this series, at least until the third game.
4032000	4034000	But I know you liked at least the second one.
4034000	4038000	But I'm talking about Fable. Remember that series? Fable? You guys like that?
4038000	4042000	It started on the original Xbox, made its way to 360.
4042000	4044000	Fable 2 was the one you really got into, right?
4044000	4048000	For about five minutes. Dan was really into the Fable series.
4048000	4051000	Well maybe this is something that might bring you back to it.
4051000	4054000	The PC version of Fable Anniversary will be coming out shortly.
4054000	4058000	And it's going to have modding support, according to Lionhead.
4058000	4072000	Producer Craig Oman, in speaking to Eurogamer, mentioned that Fable Anniversary on PC will have a version of the Unreal Engine 3 editor, which will let you edit all of the existing art and animation in the game.
4072000	4077000	So, two weeks Telenude patch? Three weeks? Two weeks?
4077000	4085000	That means that, if I am right, they're going to be able to use some of the same modding tools that Mass Effect 2 and 3 use.
4085000	4092000	Perhaps. Perhaps. In fact, you know what's funny is they're actually talking about one of the statements that Craig Oman said.
4092000	4096000	Quote, personally, I just hope someone creates a sci-fi version of Fable.
4096000	4101000	So, you could get, like, your Garrus Cross Fable. I don't know.
4101000	4104000	I need that now.
4104000	4107000	See? I knew you'd be interested in this eventually.
4107000	4110000	Only if somebody does that. And then I can have my Taurean dating sim.
4110000	4113000	This is the internet, Jamie. Anything can happen.
4113000	4117000	That'd be wonderful, though, just to have the whole sci-fi twist on it.
4117000	4126000	It already had a feel of having a Star Wars feel to it, of shooting lightning and thunder from your hands and doing other things and pushing people away. It felt like force powers as well.
4126000	4130000	It would be way more interesting than that Kinect Fable game, that's for sure.
4130000	4135000	It'd be way more interesting than any of the Fable games since 2, so I'm all down for that.
4135000	4137000	Fable Effect?
4137000	4140000	Possibly. That'd be great.
4140000	4142000	Let's see.
4142000	4148000	Going into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Kaijuto says, Fable 2 is the only Fable game you need.
4148000	4151000	It definitely was the peak of the series, that's for sure.
4151000	4156000	So, the game actually just came out in Europe, at least, on September 12th.
4156000	4163000	I don't know if that matches over here, because, again, I'm seeing this on Eurogamer, but I'm sure it's out very, very soon if it's not out already.
4163000	4177000	Also, in the game, there's a new heroic mode, if you are so inclined to play this super advanced mode, where there will be an increased line of sight for enemies and reduced damage on ranged weapons and reduced player armor levels.
4177000	4180000	So, you know, everything gets hard.
4180000	4186000	Very cool. So, for those of you that want to revisit the Fable and get all these patches, that'll be really neat.
4186000	4190000	Darsakura, one more story here before we get to the release dates.
4190000	4193000	Well, this is yet another reason to love Sega.
4193000	4196000	Sega is finally putting the crack down on assholes.
4196000	4215000	They have a new policy for the Sega blogs, Sega forums, and any of their social media accounts that basically they're going to be knocking down anyone who posts derogatory and hateful comments, personal attacks on any real person.
4215000	4224000	So Sega's going to be having the message deleted, and their right to post future comments permanently pooped on, as in not exist.
4224000	4227000	That's right. If you're going to make any hateful messages, it's better to read it to Sonic.
4227000	4230000	And his fucking weird ass long legs.
4230000	4236000	So you can still make all the fun you want of Sonic's friends. You just can't make fun of real people.
4236000	4239000	But if I want to say, you know, Tails sucks, I can do that.
4239000	4241000	Dude, seriously.
4241000	4242000	What?
4242000	4246000	They made Sonic have more fucking friends in the next game.
4246000	4251000	It's like, hey, what does everyone hate? They hate his friends. Let's give them more friends.
4251000	4254000	It's like, you fucking stupid.
4254000	4256000	And Sega just banned you.
4256000	4265000	And at any rate, what they've actually said is, therefore we're putting a new policy in place across all of Sega's community and social channels.
4265000	4272000	If you make a personal attack or otherwise inappropriate comment, we will delete your comment and we will ban or block you from our page slash channel.
4272000	4281000	And they said that while their fans may not always agree with the company or each other, that's not an excuse to not show mutual respect on a human level.
4282000	4285000	Which also takes me, though, to something that we were seeing.
4285000	4297000	A mini discussion that I was having with SSJ100 man in the chat room about removing anonymity from people to basically make them own up to how they treat other people.
4297000	4306000	That goes back and forth there. Removing anonymity can also damage people who need to use that anonymity to protect aspects of their personal life.
4306000	4311000	Exactly. See, then I think about when Battle.net was going to do the real ID thing.
4311000	4316000	And I was super against that because I was so not okay with my real name being out there.
4316000	4326000	And, you know, without getting too tangenty, we have this whole thing going on right now where Facebook is forcing all these people who are not using their real names.
4326000	4334000	And the most vocal right now of which is the drag queens of the world, that's where I'm seeing it happen a lot, is that they're all being forced to use their real names.
4335000	4337000	Which could put them in physical danger.
4337000	4343000	Right. Roller derby girls who use fake names. And I use a fake name and I've never made a secret about that.
4343000	4348000	That's because I like to keep my professional life and what I do with everything online and all that separate.
4348000	4354000	And I realize some people are probably going to figure out my real name and whatever, whatever, and vice versa.
4354000	4360000	But it's still that whole thing where it's like, respect the fact that I want to have these two separate personas.
4360000	4367000	Well, I put my real name out there because, you know, for a while I was really focusing on my design work.
4367000	4377000	But the stuff that I put there about my personal life, everything in my personal life pretty much except for Orange Lounge has a pseudonym or something that I've made up about it.
4377000	4381000	So no one knows where I work unless they happen to work with me or I've told them.
4381000	4389000	Or, you know, people don't really know where I live unless they know me and have been to my house or have sent me something.
4389000	4399000	And I'm fine. I'm fine now that battle net requires me to have a battle tag and everything can be traced back to that battle tag no matter what game I'm in.
4399000	4404000	And, you know, my account would be at risk if I was a total, you know, douche nozzle to somebody.
4404000	4407000	Then that, you know, and that's OK. I'd be accountable in that regard.
4407000	4415000	But, you know, again, when you go all the way to your full name, I don't think I'll say I think that there does need to be a different way to have accountability.
4415000	4422000	Like, it's really hard to have a happy medium between something that's either real or it's fake.
4422000	4432000	In that case, I think I do rather like what they have on Tumblr where you can block an anonymous commenter completely.
4432000	4436000	You won't see who that anonymous person is, so it will, quote, protect them.
4436000	4441000	But you can still block them. And sometimes trial and error, you can find out who they are.
4442000	4447000	I do think one idea Sega should have experimented with, though, is instead of like silencing these bullies completely,
4447000	4454000	they could have taken the Disney approach where, you know, the bullies would have to select and communicate only with a preselected list of phrases.
4454000	4459000	In this case, I think they should only be able to post quotes from Shenmue.
4459000	4461000	That would be all these people would be able to use in the future.
4461000	4465000	So it's like, you know, you want to comment on something? Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
4465000	4467000	That's all they could do. All they could do.
4467000	4476000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some games that are gonna, no doubt, cause some people to say some very naughty things on the internet somewhere. Loki.
4476000	4481000	Well, I hope not, because Cookie Mama 5, bon appetit, is coming out on 3DS.
4481000	4484000	Yeah, Cookie Mama, she's a bitch.
4486000	4490000	Thetrithym, Final Fantasy Curtain Call, coming out on 3DS as well.
4490000	4492000	Psh, Final Fantasy sucks.
4492000	4495000	Fairy Fencer F for PlayStation 3.
4495000	4497000	Fairy Fencer.
4497000	4502000	Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution for PS3 and Xbox 360.
4502000	4504000	Naruto's not a real ninja.
4504000	4511000	And finally, Air Conflicts Vietnam, they're doing a port of it for PlayStation 4. And that's it.
4511000	4519000	All right, let's go back, let's go over to Japan at some point and get the releases. I guess I'm flying over there right now, it's very slow.
4520000	4527000	Checking out the releases in Japan this week. Nothing really on the newer consoles, the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One.
4527000	4535000	On the PlayStation 3, there's nothing this week either. It's a pretty slow week over there in Japan. Nothing on the Xbox 360 either.
4535000	4542000	How about the handhelds? This is because Smash Brothers just came out, I bet. Cause Smash Brothers just came out this week on the 3DS.
4542000	4544000	Where's my Smash Code?
4544000	4547000	We already talked about that earlier in the show.
4548000	4551000	Did you guys get your Smash Codes and all that stuff?
4551000	4553000	No, I didn't get it, but everyone's been talking about it.
4553000	4557000	If you reach behind you, there's a gold 3DS if you want to check out the demo. If you want.
4557000	4561000	All right, and let's see...
4561000	4563000	I think I'll wait, cause I already played it in E3, so...
4563000	4565000	Yeah, I can understand that too.
4565000	4571000	On the Wii U, oh here's one release this week I'm finding. This is a pretty big one. This is a very Nintendo week.
4571000	4577000	Bayonetta 2 on September 20th in Japan. I know a lot of people looking forward to that, so there's something.
4577000	4579000	Boing boing.
4579000	4583000	And on the Vita, there's a couple games on the Vita this week.
4583000	4587000	Gundam Breaker and Fate Stay Night are both getting price reductions.
4587000	4591000	So they're not new games, but you can get them at an all new low price in the best collection.
4591000	4594000	So there you go, Bayonetta or nuttin'.
4594000	4597000	All right, let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.
4597000	4604000	I would move on to the UK if the UK list would load. I think we're all in the middle of our transportation.
4604000	4611000	So on the 16th we have Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. I'm getting super tired of all things Naruto.
4611000	4619000	On the 17th we have Anomaly 2, the 18th Endless Legend for PC and Train Simulator 2015.
4619000	4622000	On the 19th, Damn Near Everything Else comes out.
4622000	4630000	Flockers for PC, PS4, Xbox One, Hyrule Warriors for Wii U.
4630000	4635000	Natural Doctrine on PlayStation 3, Vita, and PS4.
4635000	4638000	Theater of the Final Fantasy, Curtain Call and 3DS.
4638000	4641000	And Wasteland 2 for Mac and PC.
4642000	4649000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Dance Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BABY.
4649000	4654000	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.
4654000	4662000	So apparently there is a brand new patent for some device from the Pokemon company.
4662000	4670000	And honestly it looks just like they're having some sort of near field communication thing with Pokemon figures.
4670000	4676000	I was really worried for a minute there it was going to be a Fleshlight add-on for Pokemon figurines.
4676000	4679000	So I was getting a little nervous there, but woo!
4679000	4680000	There's still time.
4680000	4683000	That won't stop some people from trying.
4683000	4688000	Apparently the device would be an information processing apparatus. Well that's very vague of you.
4688000	4695000	Basically able to read NFC and RFID chips like those front end Amiibo figures.
4695000	4705000	So yes, you can imagine that I'm guessing this is going to lead to some sort of thing where they sell every single Pokemon character as a figurine for Amiibo.
4705000	4708000	It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen.
4708000	4711000	And you know what? You gotta catch them all.
4711000	4712000	Because that's the only way.
4712000	4714000	Like some people in venereal diseases.
4714000	4720000	It's the only way you're gonna get like super shinies or some shit they're gonna come up with where, you know.
4720000	4727000	And then they're gonna start selling like real life burn heals for your wallet is the next logical step for this thing.
4727000	4728000	It burns.
4728000	4730000	That joke burns too.
4730000	4732000	Alright, moving on.
4732000	4736000	Talking about Pikmin, another Nintendo product.
4736000	4739000	Pikmin is gonna get a movie of sorts. Of sorts.
4739000	4741000	Yeah, this is a report from Variety.
4741000	4743000	Pikmin Short Movies.
4743000	4747000	It's animated shorts that are produced by Shigeru Miyamoto.
4747000	4750000	They're gonna be debuting at the Tokyo International Film Festival.
4750000	4752000	And this is gonna be at the end of October.
4752000	4760000	And so Miyamoto will be having a presentation where there's gonna be these Pikmin Short Movies and there'll be three animated shorts.
4760000	4762000	One is called The Night Juicer.
4762000	4766000	Where Captain Olimar wants to blend up Pikmin.
4766000	4768000	What is this? A fucking horror movie?
4768000	4771000	The name of that again? Can you say the name of that one?
4771000	4774000	Keep in mind this is October 25th to the 31st.
4774000	4776000	The Night Juicer.
4776000	4778000	You know what? I'm sorry.
4778000	4780000	Isn't that the attachment for the Pokemon?
4780000	4782000	The Night Juicer.
4782000	4787000	The Night Juicer, all that reminds me of is the fruit fucker from the Penny Arcade comic.
4787000	4789000	I see that now.
4789000	4792000	The fruit fucker movie. The Night Juicer.
4792000	4794000	That sounds pretty splashing.
4794000	4797000	Night juicer. Night juicer.
4797000	4799000	Night juicer.
4799000	4802000	Let's see, also Pikmin Short Movies.
4802000	4805000	Olimar blending up Pikmin? That's gross.
4805000	4807000	Whoa.
4807000	4810000	That's the concept. Night juicer. He's gonna blend up the Pikmin.
4810000	4812000	Listen, you guys are really fucking annoying me now.
4812000	4814000	So I'm gonna juice you.
4814000	4816000	I can see where this is all leading to. The juicing to the blending.
4816000	4818000	It's all making sense now.
4818000	4820000	They're onto something.
4820000	4822000	Will it blend?
4822000	4827000	I can't wait for the third episode where he rolls them up into a joint and smokes them.
4830000	4832000	Is that why there's no green Pikmin?
4832000	4834000	Alright, anyway.
4835000	4840000	Treasures in a Bottle, which will involve an odd treasure. That's all they say.
4840000	4842000	It's treasure in a bottle.
4842000	4844000	Surprise, it's fucking nothing.
4844000	4849000	And Occupational Hazards is the third one, which plays out at a construction site.
4849000	4851000	Sounds like a fucking...
4851000	4853000	It's like Happy Tree Friends.
4853000	4855000	Doesn't it?
4855000	4857000	It's Happy Tree Friends.
4857000	4859000	Or like Wile E. Coyote in Roadrunner.
4859000	4861000	No, it's Happy Tree Friends.
4861000	4864000	It looks like the future of Pikmin will now be blended together into one.
4864000	4866000	I guess.
4866000	4868000	Or it's becoming a horror franchise.
4868000	4870000	The one drink to rule them all.
4873000	4876000	You would say that at the exact moment Loki knocks a soda on the floor.
4876000	4878000	It's empty.
4878000	4881000	Speaking of a horror film, apparently Diego has the powers of persuasion.
4884000	4887000	Let's go back to a time when things were a little simpler.
4887000	4892000	You know, we didn't try to stick our video game characters in a blender.
4892000	4895000	That was something reserved for like goldfish.
4895000	4897000	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4897000	4899000	PETA, don't harass me.
4899000	4901000	What kind of sick person are you, Rob?
4901000	4903000	That you would think of that.
4903000	4905000	I never wanted to do that.
4905000	4907000	I knew some fucked up kids growing up.
4907000	4910000	Didn't we all know some fucked up kids growing up?
4910000	4913000	I would just chant at my brother's fish until they died.
4913000	4915000	Because I hated them.
4915000	4917000	Oh, so I'm weird trying to get out blenders.
4917000	4920000	Yet you would perform a satanic ritual on your boy.
4920000	4922000	No, no, no. You would murder them.
4922000	4924000	I would just wish them to die.
4924000	4927000	You would curse them in eternal damnation.
4927000	4929000	But I didn't murder them.
4929000	4931000	You fish murderer.
4931000	4934000	But then, you know, the quick murdering or the, you know,
4934000	4938000	very methodical ritual that you had.
4938000	4941000	It wasn't a ritual. I'd just be like, God, I hate you fish.
4941000	4944000	Why are we talking about murder? The happy music is playing.
4945000	4947000	I'm going to feed you to the cat.
4947000	4950000	Time for the classic game of the week,
4950000	4952000	where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault
4952000	4955000	and find, you know, next to her, you know, guns
4955000	4957000	and various tools of mass destruction.
4957000	4959000	Just for that, I'm going to put up puzzle and dragons
4959000	4960000	and then a week.
4960000	4962000	Oh, you're such a...
4962000	4963000	So mean to me. All right.
4963000	4965000	Here it is, your classic game of the week.
4965000	4966000	I gave you candy corn.
4966000	4967000	That's true. You did give me.
4967000	4969000	And it was apple pie and I ate them.
4969000	4971000	Just my fat.
4971000	4972000	All right.
4972000	4975000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4975000	4979000	The classic game of the week is, again, sticking with the CPS-2 theme.
4979000	4981000	I went for Armored Warriors, which in Japan it was called
4981000	4984000	Powered Gear Strategic Variant Armor Equipment.
4984000	4986000	It came out in 1994.
4986000	4988000	It was a beat-em-up.
4988000	4991000	Like I said, it was CPS CP System 2.
4991000	4994000	And there's no home version of this ever.
4994000	4999000	However, the mecha in the game were later used
4999000	5002000	for Cyberbots Fill Metal Madness.
5002000	5005000	Which, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game,
5005000	5009000	according to Devilot and Puzzle Fighter.
5009000	5012000	Anyway, Armored Warriors was basically
5012000	5014000	as a multiplayer beat-em-up.
5014000	5018000	You go around in robots and you basically beat up other robots.
5018000	5019000	Robots!
5019000	5022000	And then you can use different type of input commands
5022000	5025000	with the joystick and you get team-up change,
5025000	5029000	which lets you do tandem attacks with whoever you're playing with.
5029000	5034000	So basically, it's just a big robot war
5034000	5036000	and you are trying to get to the end
5036000	5039000	and beat the perfect warrior cyborg robot.
5039000	5041000	And Blodia's in it.
5041000	5044000	That just makes me happy because Blodia was awesome.
5044000	5045000	Oh, Janna?
5045000	5046000	Yep.
5046000	5048000	So the characters that you play as,
5048000	5052000	you have First Lieutenant Jeff Perkins, who pilots Blodia.
5052000	5056000	You have Captain Ray Turner, who is the pilot of Reptos.
5056000	5059000	You have Glenn Reed, who pilots Golden.
5059000	5061000	And Sarah White, who has Forty.
5061000	5066000	So basically, I mean, really, there's not a lot of special to it,
5066000	5070000	but the notable thing about this game is that this is what led to us having Cyberbots.
5070000	5073000	Which, Cyberbots is fucking awesome.
5073000	5078000	So, thank you, Capcom for Armored Warriors, which gave us Cyberbots.
5080000	5081000	That's it.
5082000	5084000	It has no home release.
5084000	5085000	No home release.
5085000	5087000	So, really, the only way you're going to play this is...
5087000	5088000	Get yourself a super gun.
5088000	5089000	That's right.
5089000	5093000	You're going to have to go to an arcade that might still have this game somewhere.
5093000	5094000	Armored Warriors.
5094000	5096000	Or, you know, they do make a CPS2 emulator.
5096000	5100000	I would never endorse using emulators and downloading the ROM illegally, but...
5100000	5103000	For an outdated system that has no...
5103000	5105000	Yeah, get a super gun.
5105000	5106000	All right.
5107000	5110000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Armored Warriors.
5110000	5112000	All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
5112000	5114000	We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5114000	5118000	In part B, we're going to talk to our friends from the big anime game room a little more
5118000	5120000	and talk about what's coming up next for them
5120000	5122000	and what their plans for the future might be.
5122000	5124000	And then we're going to get into some rapid-fire news.
5124000	5127000	The Fugu Question of the Week, your emails, and plenty more
5127000	5130000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5130000	5142000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this September the 14th, 2014
5142000	5146000	with the 567th episode of our show already in progress.
5146000	5150000	And you know what's very important and very special about this day
5150000	5153000	as was brought to my attention via Facebook.
5153000	5159000	September 14th, 1985, was the debut of the Golden Girls on television.
5159000	5162000	So, a very important day in television history.
5162000	5163000	My God, that was all...
5163000	5164000	Thank you for being a friend.
5164000	5167000	That was 29 years ago. 29 years ago.
5167000	5169000	No wonder they are all almost dead.
5169000	5171000	I mean, what's...
5172000	5177000	And woe to the poor children who were not alive when there were Golden Girls.
5177000	5178000	Yes, I know, I know.
5178000	5184000	Praise be to Betty White and she can't die ever, ever, ever, ever.
5184000	5186000	All right, let's see.
5186000	5188000	Moving on, before we get into some rapid-fire news,
5188000	5192000	let's talk to our friends Jonas and Diego a little more from the big anime game room.
5192000	5194000	What's next on you guys' agenda?
5194000	5196000	What big cons are coming up in the future?
5196000	5198000	What's your next big show?
5198000	5201000	Well, the bigger one that's coming up next is our one that's coming up in...
5201000	5203000	Oh, it's semi-big, but it's big enough.
5203000	5205000	It's the one coming up in Reno, Nevada.
5205000	5210000	It's known as a snafu that's abbreviated as Sierra Nevada Anime Fans United.
5210000	5213000	I've never heard of that one, but Reno's a fun town.
5213000	5215000	Where do they have that up there?
5215000	5216000	They have it at the Grand Sierra Hotel.
5216000	5219000	Oh, okay. So they do use some of the hotel space up there.
5219000	5221000	That's the one that used to be the Hilton years ago, right?
5221000	5222000	I believe so.
5222000	5223000	I think it was.
5223000	5224000	I believe so, yeah.
5224000	5225000	It's a beautiful place.
5225000	5226000	I think it's been going on for about four years now.
5226000	5227000	Nice.
5227000	5229000	Three to four years now.
5229000	5231000	What weekend is that?
5231000	5232000	I might have to go up there and check it out.
5232000	5235000	That's the second to last weekend of October.
5235000	5237000	I think that's 25th, 26th, and 27th.
5237000	5239000	Actually 24, 25, 26.
5239000	5241000	It's Friday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
5241000	5244000	Maybe tied down with rehearsals for a performance I got going on.
5244000	5246000	But that still sounds like it'll be a lot of fun.
5246000	5247000	Yeah, definitely.
5247000	5251000	Well, I won't say most of our group, but some of our group will be there since some can't really attend.
5251000	5255000	But we'll pretty much bring our armory with us of games.
5255000	5260000	And united with our Nevada friends and people who also staff our other cons.
5260000	5265000	Because some of them put their effort into staffing and are part-chair to this as well.
5265000	5268000	Because some of them helped start this convention at Reno.
5268000	5269000	Nice.
5269000	5270000	That's always kind of neat.
5270000	5274000	Have you guys kind of been at the ground level of a convention like that and really kind of seen it grow over the years?
5274000	5276000	Well, I guess GamerX, we talked about last time you guys were here.
5276000	5277000	It might be an example.
5277000	5282000	Are there a lot of cons you guys are kind of following since the first year that have really grown?
5282000	5284000	Yeah, Snapagon we saw grow from the ground up.
5284000	5286000	Yeah, Snapagon?
5286000	5292000	There's one called KrakenCon, which I got invited to, but I'm not sure if I'm able to go.
5292000	5295000	But I'll keep in tabs for it.
5295000	5298000	I think KrakenCon is in Oakland.
5298000	5300000	I believe it's the first or second week of October.
5300000	5304000	Wow, all these cons I've never even heard of. That's awesome though.
5304000	5307000	I know YaweCon is this weekend, but we aren't able to make it.
5307000	5309000	Oh, you guys aren't doing YaweCon?
5309000	5314000	We're not doing YaweCon because one, it's under new ownership.
5314000	5318000	YaweCon in 2011 got purchased by a manga company.
5318000	5319000	I didn't know that.
5319000	5322000	And then whatever direction they have, if they want game room, that's fine.
5322000	5327000	If not, then unfortunately they haven't made the decision to put a game room in there at the moment.
5328000	5333000	You know, I've never been to YaweCon, but I have heard that what happens at YaweCon stays at YaweCon.
5333000	5335000	I have heard that much.
5335000	5337000	It is quite an experience.
5337000	5344000	When it was under the original ownership back in the day, when it was in San Mateo and around the Bay Area, around San Francisco-ish?
5344000	5346000	San Mateo and San Francisco is the only one.
5346000	5350000	San Mateo and San Francisco. And when we first got in there, yeah, it was quite an experience, definitely.
5350000	5352000	And I was like, they have a game room?
5352000	5355000	I said, oh, game room. I get it.
5355000	5360000	But it was actually quite amazing. Really nice people there. Nothing practically went wrong.
5360000	5362000	It was good vibes over there, definitely.
5362000	5363000	Good. Awesome.
5363000	5370000	Last week we spent a little bit of time celebrating the 15th anniversary of the US launch of the Dreamcast.
5370000	5375000	And since you guys do a lot with classic games, I know you got something to say about the Dreamcast.
5375000	5380000	What are some Dreamcast memories that you see living on today in the game room?
5380000	5384000	What are some Dreamcast things that still live on today in the game room?
5384000	5389000	A favorite would be definitely Power Stone. Power Stone 2, to be exact.
5392000	5395000	Oh my gosh, you have the Dreamcast boot-up noise on your phone.
5395000	5397000	Yeah, it's what I do for my email.
5397000	5399000	That's awesome.
5399000	5402000	Towards that, what else did we have?
5402000	5403000	Choo-Choo Rocket.
5403000	5407000	Choo-Choo Rocket. Very underrated Sonic Team game, oh my lord.
5407000	5411000	When I first played that, that thing is on steroids, but it's fun steroids.
5411000	5414000	Not in that sense, but in the sense of gaming, that is.
5414000	5419000	It's so ridiculously fun that all you have to do is just fill up your rockets full of mice,
5419000	5422000	and there's so many things that change the game around and flip you around.
5422000	5424000	It's so chaotic, but it's chaotic fun.
5424000	5428000	Choo-Choo Rocket, I want to say they released that for iPad and all that stuff, too.
5428000	5432000	So at least there's a way to experience it if you don't have a Dreamcast to hook up.
5432000	5434000	Yeah, definitely.
5435000	5438000	Other things such as, I remember, Cannon Spike.
5438000	5442000	Cannon Spike was pretty popular for a while, definitely.
5442000	5445000	When I first found out about that game, I was like, wow, there's Kami in here and Mega Man,
5445000	5451000	and it's pretty much a bird's eye view shooter game that goes around,
5451000	5453000	and then just constantly shooting and going through the entire level.
5453000	5455000	It's actually quite amazing.
5455000	5456000	Any other ones?
5456000	5458000	Let's see.
5458000	5459000	Good ones.
5459000	5462000	The original Soul Calibur for the Dreamcast.
5462000	5464000	That was a big one at the time.
5464000	5469000	Sonic Adventure 2, because the newer generation like Sonic Adventure,
5469000	5472000	for those who did not grow up on the 2D Sonics.
5475000	5483000	Marvel vs. Capcom 2, because people still prefer that as the console to play Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
5483000	5484000	I bet.
5484000	5489000	Because I believe people are saying that if you play it on any other console, there's lag.
5489000	5490000	Yeah, yeah.
5491000	5494000	Not to mention, of course, the Dreamcast is based off the NAOMI board,
5494000	5498000	which Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the arcade was based off of.
5498000	5499000	Right.
5499000	5501000	Also, the game Jet Set Radio.
5501000	5503000	Yeah, that was another favorite right there.
5503000	5511000	You know what? Okay, if you guys have a Planet Harriers, I would be at every event ever.
5513000	5515000	Well, they'll have to find one.
5515000	5518000	Planet Harriers never had a home release.
5518000	5520000	It's almost impossible to emulate.
5520000	5521000	Wow.
5522000	5526000	So, I mean, you can emulate it, people have.
5526000	5528000	I couldn't get it working.
5528000	5530000	Planet Harriers.
5530000	5531000	Planet Harriers.
5531000	5534000	So, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5534000	5539000	It sounds like Diego is not the only one who has made the Dreamcast boot-up noise a way of life.
5539000	5543000	ActDef says, I used to have the Dreamcast starting sound on my phone, too.
5543000	5547000	And let's see. Fifth Dream says, I made my Windows PC boot-up sound.
5547000	5549000	The Dreamcast boot-up sound.
5549000	5551000	Definitely. I mean, it was thinking and it.
5551000	5553000	Well, I want to say it's still thinking now because people still use the.
5553000	5555000	We bring that back in our game room at least.
5555000	5556000	Yeah.
5556000	5557000	Yeah, we still have those things.
5557000	5559000	And Dreamcast, I want to say it was a great system.
5559000	5563000	Obviously, I wasn't there to pay for the full price and I kind of feel sorry for those who stood in line.
5563000	5567000	I had a roommate who stood in line at Florin Mall here in Sacramento to actually do that.
5567000	5568000	Which is now a Walmart.
5568000	5570000	Which is now a Walmart, yes.
5570000	5572000	They still have the Sears, though. The original Sears.
5572000	5573000	Oh, I didn't realize.
5573000	5574000	It still stands. Every brick.
5574000	5575000	Oh, wow.
5575000	5579000	That was. I think the Florin Mall was the first place I ever played Pump It Up.
5579000	5582000	And that was probably the last time you ever caught me at Florin Mall.
5582000	5583000	Right at the Tilt, right?
5583000	5584000	Yeah.
5584000	5585000	Oh, my goodness, the Tilt.
5585000	5586000	All right, the Tilt.
5586000	5590000	Local drama here in Sacramento, California, where our lovely show is based.
5590000	5593000	Skies of Arcadia. I almost forgot about that.
5593000	5595000	Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, good memories. Good memories.
5595000	5602000	It's great to see that through these game rooms that you guys do, you can still celebrate all those classic games.
5602000	5608000	And I'm sure until the end of time, there will always be a Dreamcast so somebody can play MVC, too.
5608000	5614000	Actually, we still do it because our most common game in a game with a Dreamcast is actually Typing of the Dead.
5617000	5619000	Of course. Oh, my God.
5619000	5620000	Yeah, that game is amazing.
5620000	5627000	Yeah, I was excited when they brought back. They put a version of it on PC not that long ago where they have a newer version of Typing of the Dead.
5627000	5629000	I don't know what's more amazing, watching the actual footage.
5629000	5634000	Just watching people have their faces change as they type the words out almost fiercely or something.
5634000	5637000	They really get into the game as they type those words out.
5637000	5639000	Well, then sometimes the words get really awkward.
5639000	5642000	And so then your face is kind of like, what?
5642000	5645000	Right. And as their hands are moving as well, they're like, oh, my goodness, I can't believe this is happening.
5645000	5647000	I can't believe I'm typing these naughty things.
5648000	5650000	What is this game forcing me to do?
5650000	5659000	All right. Well, look, we could reminisce about the Dreamcast all night long, but we're going to get into some rapid-fire news and talk about quickly what else is going on in the gaming world.
5659000	5665000	And you guys, please feel free to pipe up if there's anything you want to comment on as we move on throughout the rest of the show.
5665000	5667000	So let's start off with some rapid-fire news. Loki.
5667000	5676000	So this is kind of strange. They're kind of going the route of, what is it, the Disney Infinity with Little Big Planet.
5676000	5683000	They're re-releasing the Vita version of Little Big Planet, but they're dubbing it the Little Big Planet PlayStation Vita Marvel Superhero Edition.
5683000	5696000	Because the version of Little Big Planet that they're releasing is going to also include all the content of the original release as well as a host of Marvel Comics characters and skins and that kind of stuff.
5697000	5706000	So yeah. So that's kind of cool. And that's going to be coming out on, looks like around November 18th, November 19th.
5706000	5711000	Is that the same time that Little Big Planet 3 comes out in PlayStation 4?
5711000	5714000	Little Big Planet 3 is actually coming out in two weeks.
5714000	5715000	Oh, wow.
5715000	5720000	I'm sorry. No, not Little Big Planet 3. I'm sorry. Little Big Planet 3, yeah, actually that is around the exact same time.
5720000	5728000	So that'll be right, probably the same date actually. That'll be coming out. No, I'm sorry. I was thinking Disney Infinity for some reason. Disney Infinity is in two weeks.
5728000	5729000	Gotcha.
5729000	5738000	But yeah. This is kind of cool. The next Final Fantasy spinoff they're saying is going to be a text input battle RPG.
5738000	5744000	So, typing of the Final Fantasy, I guess. It's Final Fantasy Worldwide Words.
5744000	5750000	H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter. H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter.
5750000	5755000	No, no, no, no. That was Ragnarok Online or Port Pront.
5755000	5759000	Oh, sorry. C-U-R-E space P-L-Z, enter.
5759000	5761000	Port G-H. Port G-H.
5761000	5768000	Yeah, so apparently in order to defeat enemies in the game, you know, you can cast spells and stuff like that, but it requires you to type in words.
5769000	5776000	Could two things I love be blended together any better? Like Final Fantasy and typing of the dead? That sounds amazing.
5776000	5779000	It will be out on the Japanese Android, I guess.
5779000	5781000	Android? I don't want to type on a phone.
5781000	5785000	September 16th. An iOS version is supposed to be released soon.
5785000	5789000	What if the bonus rounds, though, force people to type with proper grammar?
5789000	5792000	I think I would need new underwear.
5792000	5796000	For the final boss, you must properly use your, your, and your.
5796000	5798000	Or their, their, and their.
5798000	5807000	And last but not least, the date has finally been confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 4 on, uh, or 4 or 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5807000	5813000	November 18th in North America, and then the PC version is coming out on the 27th of January.
5813000	5816000	Um, they were talking about some of the new additions to the game.
5816000	5822000	Of course, new weapons, vehicles, activities, more wildlife. They even have like an orca whale in there.
5822000	5824000	And cats. Cats are in there.
5824000	5829000	Which, by the way, when Loki and I were tweeting each other this week, I think the cat thing might have sold me on this.
5829000	5832000	Just, just, just to be clear.
5832000	5839000	So, um, yeah, uh, new foliage system and enhanced damage and weather effects.
5839000	5845000	And then, of course, 100 new songs added to the radio and 30 players in online.
5845000	5847000	Jeez. At a time instead of 16.
5847000	5851000	So, that's pretty awesome. And you'll be able to transfer your safety.
5851000	5857000	Loki might finally, he might buy himself like a PlayStation 4 as a, I just got laid off present.
5857000	5860000	And I don't think I, I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.
5860000	5862000	I would like to do that, but I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.
5862000	5863000	Bummer.
5863000	5864000	Yeah.
5864000	5868000	Alright, get that game done. Sell it. 50 bucks a pop.
5870000	5871000	Alright.
5871000	5874000	Uh, let's see. Checking out some other quick news here.
5874000	5878000	Uh, I'm surprised, uh, Loki doesn't have a lot to say about this, so maybe he does. I don't know.
5878000	5883000	But apparently there's an Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara crossover.
5883000	5884000	What?
5884000	5885000	What?
5885000	5886000	The fuck?
5886000	5900000	Okay, hold on, hold on. Before y'all get too excited, this is a Japanese retailer specific pre-order bonus for a pale wing costume in Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos.
5900000	5902000	That went from interest high to interest...
5903000	5908000	Jonas, she sounded like a big fan over there. Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara. Are you here for that?
5908000	5911000	I don't know if I can comment on this.
5913000	5918000	No comment. No comment. No comment for the tea baggers. Alright.
5918000	5925000	Ultimate NES Remix, you know, because NES Remix on the Wii U is not enough, they're gonna bring it to the 3DS as well.
5925000	5933000	So Ultimate NES Remix not only will offer, you know, the same similar types of things that you saw on the Wii U versions,
5933000	5941000	but obviously they have to give something new to make you want to buy it all over again, and that will be a full version of Speed Mario Bros.
5941000	5945000	It's a very fast version of the original Super Mario Bros.
5945000	5951000	So yeah, there you go. Mario's fast, the music is fast, you're gonna speed run this shit whether you want to or not.
5951000	5954000	That's what's gonna happen in Ultimate NES Remix with that.
5954000	5966000	And lastly, speaking of Nintendo products, if you are a Wii U Deluxe owner, don't forget you are getting 10% back from any e-purchase shop you make.
5966000	5973000	Meaning if you buy virtual console games, which I might be a sucker for those and I bought a lot of those,
5973000	5979000	but also if you got your free game with Mario Kart 8, that was an eShop game, so if you have a Wii U Deluxe,
5979000	5982000	you probably have like a $5 card sitting in your account right now.
5982000	5989000	Don't forget, this promotion ends December 2014, and you will have until March 2015 to spend those points.
5989000	5992000	So this is just a friendly reminder circulating the blogs.
5992000	5998000	Check that balance, because you would probably kick yourself if you missed out on some free games.
5998000	6002000	Interesting, I didn't get my free $5.
6002000	6006000	Make sure you log in, you connect everything on the Nintendo site.
6007000	6013000	I've done it before, I've gotten like $10 or $15 worth of cards, which says a lot about how much fucking shit I bought on the Nintendo Wii U.
6013000	6019000	Not because I recently went to the eShop just to buy the new DLCs from Mario Kart 8.
6019000	6021000	I didn't see any new transactions.
6021000	6025000	I got the free game, I got the free Pikmin 3.
6025000	6032000	You're not gonna see it in the store, you have to go to a website where you then redeem for the codes that you put in the store.
6032000	6034000	Okay, I have to check that out.
6034000	6036000	Yeah, check that out. What the hell's the website?
6036000	6037000	We're just taking a message.
6037000	6045000	Let me see if I can remember where the website is. I think it's like nintendo.net slash deluxe, or it's like deluxe.nintendo or something like that.
6045000	6048000	Nintendo.com slash deluxe.
6048000	6052000	Somebody in chat will help us out here over at live.vognetwork.com.
6052000	6055000	While we wait for that though, let's go to the next story from DarkSakura.
6055000	6058000	Next story or stories?
6058000	6059000	Stories!
6059000	6060000	Stuff!
6060000	6064000	Oh wait, first, actdeft. ddp.nintendo.com, thank you.
6064000	6067000	Dang it, actdeft, stop interrupting my shit.
6067000	6072000	Well hey, it was for free shit. I'm sorry DarkSakura, are you gonna give us free shit tonight?
6072000	6074000	Uh, I haven't been to gym boys.
6079000	6083000	As opposed to, just think, it's not TTP that we talk about on the show sometimes, it's DDP.
6083000	6089000	So, Ubisoft confirmed that Watch Dogs Wii U will be out November 18th.
6090000	6093000	Good for all of those people who are getting it.
6093000	6097000	Also, it will be out in Europe on November 21st.
6097000	6100000	Sorry guys, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait.
6100000	6104000	Are they doing anything extra in this version, or is it like just a straight up port?
6104000	6106000	I think it's a port?
6107000	6112000	Boy, it's another game that's been out forever coming out on the Wii U, this is sure to not fail at all.
6112000	6117000	Why should anyone have, oh I'm sorry mister, I just bought Mass Effect 3 for Wii U.
6117000	6121000	Yeah, and then you all called me crazy, so clearly I'm the exception to the rule.
6122000	6126000	I'm not gonna buy Watch Dogs on five different systems, I didn't like it that much, jeez.
6127000	6128000	Rob.
6128000	6129000	What?
6129000	6130000	Hearts.
6130000	6132000	So how about some Octodad?
6132000	6135000	It's also gonna be on the Wii U, well at least they're thinking about it.
6135000	6147000	The developers Young Horses are saying that they're in the deciding process, meaning, deciding process, why call it deciding process?
6147000	6149000	You're just deciding.
6150000	6151000	When you have-
6151000	6153000	With these big companies it can be a process.
6153000	6158000	When you're done, you have decided, you have a decision.
6159000	6161000	Process my ass, it's like boarding process.
6161000	6162000	Boarding process.
6162000	6164000	You're not boarding process, you're just boarding.
6164000	6166000	Now they're just deciding.
6166000	6168000	I'm sorry George Carlin said it best.
6168000	6169000	Anyway.
6171000	6176000	It said, this is the quote, we're not working on whether or not we want to bring the game to Wii U.
6176000	6178000	It's not a no, but it's also not a yes.
6178000	6182000	Trust us, we'll be quite loud about it if we do decide to happen to do the port.
6182000	6186000	Sorry for the non-answer, but that's all we've got right now, so sorry not sorry.
6186000	6188000	And he put a smiley face after it too.
6188000	6193000	So this is pretty good.
6193000	6209000	The TIGA basically has a proposal calling on the British government to create a new creative content fund for video games to the tune of 3 million pounds annually, which is about 4.9 million dollars.
6209000	6219000	They finalized the tax breaks for video game production so that companies can basically have their games pass a cultural test.
6219000	6224000	So looks like we've got a lot of big stuff going on with that too.
6224000	6232000	They're saying basically that the CCF could recoup investments from game sales once a developer has generated a certain amount of revenue.
6232000	6234000	So it has to pass a cultural test?
6234000	6235000	Yes.
6235000	6243000	So if somebody decides to make some of the OLR dream games such as Puzzle Sluts, that's probably not going to pass the cultural sensitivity test.
6243000	6247000	I think it's like the cultural thing like along the signs they say, is this porn?
6247000	6250000	Does it have cultural significance?
6250000	6251000	I see.
6251000	6253000	They could be sluts and not naked.
6253000	6255000	That's right, it's true.
6255000	6261000	All of those guys are sluts.
6261000	6264000	Which guys? Just everybody in general? Everybody's a slut?
6264000	6268000	For every woman that sleeps around, every man that sleeps around is a slut as well.
6268000	6270000	Yeah, that's fair.
6270000	6272000	Not a player. A slut.
6272000	6276000	What's that have to do with puzzles?
6276000	6289000	Moving on. Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.
6289000	6293000	Yes. The seg in our chat room says, I should think about making puzzle sluts.
6293000	6294000	Yes.
6294000	6297000	We have a wiki that has all the OLR dream games on it.
6297000	6302000	We need, we need though, if there are going to be puzzle sluts, there must also be man sluts in it.
6302000	6306000	No, we talked about that a long time ago when we first proposed the game. It would be equal opportunity slutting.
6306000	6308000	And, and, and, and.
6308000	6312000	I want like, I want alien sluts.
6312000	6320000	Gay sluts, straight sluts, every kind of sluts, just not like weird shit like dead people's sluts.
6320000	6322000	The slut machine?
6322000	6324000	Pigeon sluts.
6324000	6327000	And most importantly, consensual sluts.
6327000	6328000	Pigeon sluts.
6328000	6330000	Yes, pigeon sluts are fine. That's unlocked.
6330000	6333000	All right. Anyhow.
6333000	6335000	That's DLC. Pigeon sluts.
6335000	6340000	I do want to point out though, remember an OLR dream game did become a reality.
6340000	6341000	Give this a cheap plug.
6341000	6342000	We have bungee ferret tossing.
6342000	6348000	That's right. Bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360. That is a, it's a fucking real thing.
6348000	6349000	Yes.
6349000	6353000	Show to game bungee ferret tossing. You should consider taking that to the next game room.
6353000	6355000	Just say it'll be a big hit.
6355000	6357000	Bungee, bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360.
6357000	6360000	Yeah, we already did something with like Food Ninja and people actually got a hype on that at the conventions.
6360000	6361000	Right?
6361000	6364000	They, they just went hysterical on that thing. They just loved it.
6364000	6369000	And they were screaming at the top of their lungs just because someone sliced like five watermelons and a banana at the same time.
6369000	6371000	I could do that in real life.
6371000	6373000	Act-a-dusted puzzle sluts two super slut edition.
6373000	6374000	All right.
6374000	6378000	I want super, super, I want super puzzle sluts DX for matching service.
6378000	6381000	All right. Look, we've got our Fugu question.
6381000	6383000	The Fugu music is still playing and here we are talking about sluts.
6383000	6384000	All right.
6384000	6386000	Let's get to the Fugu question of the week.
6386000	6395000	We take our Facebook and our Google plus communities and we ask a question of the communities and we read some of our favorite answers.
6395000	6398000	By the way, I just want to, well, hold on, stop the happy music for a minute.
6399000	6401000	Fucking Facebook.
6401000	6402000	Okay.
6402000	6412000	So Facebook today, after staring for months and months and months of this thing on our page at facebook.com slash orange launch radio that says you should finally put a fucking cover image on your page.
6412000	6417000	So I finally clicked the button and I'm like, gee, I have this old promo shot from like 2007.
6417000	6420000	So I put it on our, our, our Facebook page, right?
6420000	6427000	Because we haven't taken promo shots since like 2007 because look how much hair I have here.
6428000	6433000	But anyway, uh, so, so still in my hair was hot pink.
6433000	6435000	You guys, you guys look the same.
6435000	6437000	But anyway, uh, I don't like the same.
6437000	6448000	The thing is though, I put up that picture as the cover photo on Facebook and you can see how many times something has been viewed and the cover picture.
6448000	6453000	Facebook has shown to more people than the Fugu question of the week got seen this week.
6453000	6456000	So that'll teach me to listen to Facebook when it says to update things.
6456000	6461000	I thought it was going to say, Hey, you know, you should update your Facebook cover image or something like that.
6461000	6463000	Like right after you put it up there.
6463000	6465000	Hey, it's been up there for a little bit.
6465000	6466000	Leave it to me.
6466000	6468000	I'll make one like it new.
6468000	6470000	Like, isn't this your Justin TV image from back in the day?
6470000	6472000	And it's like, don't worry.
6472000	6473000	Mama will fix it.
6473000	6474000	Yes.
6474000	6475000	Yes.
6475000	6478000	This, this, this, this image on our Facebook was for the Justin TV channel.
6478000	6480000	Just to give you how old that is.
6480000	6484000	Anyway, back to the happy music.
6484000	6486000	Fugu question of the week.
6486000	6487000	It's about the Sega story.
6487000	6489000	The dark soccer talked about earlier.
6489000	6494000	It is, uh, uh, you know, Sega dealing with rudities on their site.
6494000	6501000	So we asked our readers and listeners, how much do you believe a gaming site should regulate the comments of their readers?
6501000	6509000	Should everyone get to have a say, even when that is what said is nasty or should everything be approved by a moderator before it's visible for all to see
6509000	6510000	or something in between.
6510000	6513000	So let's start with some of our Facebook answers here.
6513000	6520000	Uh, fifth dream says even negative comments can be made without calling names, cursing like crazy or being snotty and rude.
6520000	6525000	I think most sites should have a three strikes policy, be a jerk a few times and you get banned.
6525000	6531000	Uh, Guillermo R replied and said, I think every site should be moderated against trolling and harassment.
6531000	6536000	Not go as far as having to approve every comment, but definitely have a big ban hammer for people that don't know how to play nice.
6536000	6538000	I applaud Sega for their stance.
6538000	6545000	Andy R says, I'm fine with moderation in places like that, especially seeing as these communities often contain younger children.
6545000	6548000	Gaming needs to be more welcoming these days, not less.
6548000	6555000	Uh, Duchok, I hope I said that right, says, I feel like whichever approach you take, it needs to be consistent.
6555000	6559000	There will always be trolls, but you need to set and reinforce expectations.
6559000	6565000	That is the exact same thing that Supernanny says, set and reinforce expectations.
6565000	6569000	I didn't mean to make her a theme tonight, but I'm just saying.
6569000	6572000	I watched a lot of Supernanny when that was on.
6572000	6578000	Alright, uh, Jenner Johnny says, I'm all for free speech on company websites, but only if it's used in a constructive and or mature manner.
6578000	6587000	People who use their anonymity to post unintelligent and destructive comments should be subject to moderators and or removal of said comment.
6587000	6593000	Uh, Keoki replies and says, in a world where so many people enjoy being rude and troll everyone,
6593000	6598000	simply because they are hidden behind the anonymity of the internet, sites should moderate and approve comments,
6598000	6602000	even if it's just to stop people from getting their enjoyment that way.
6602000	6608000	And lastly, Morning Wolf says, some moderation is in order, but as someone who moderates a set of fora.
6608000	6612000	Is that the plural for forums? A fora? I've never heard that before.
6612000	6613000	I don't know, but anyway.
6613000	6614000	I thought the plural of forum was...
6614000	6617000	Forums, yeah, right? A set of forums.
6617000	6619000	A set of forums, well, whatever.
6619000	6621000	I just researched this.
6621000	6623000	As who moderates a set of fora.
6623000	6626000	What if it's multiple forums, though? Anyway, forget it.
6626000	6628000	Alright, a set of fora. I'm interested to know how...
6628000	6630000	That could just be autocorrect, for all I know.
6630000	6635000	I'm interested to know how they'll define inappropriate and personal attack.
6635000	6639000	Too many people see criticism of any kind as personal.
6639000	6643000	A very interesting comment from someone who has a little more experience with this,
6643000	6649000	and that is, you know, this might all sound fine and good, but where exactly are they drawing the line?
6649000	6652000	Okay. The plural of forum is forums.
6652000	6659000	The plural fora, as in the original Latin, is chiefly used when talking about a public square in an ancient Roman city.
6659000	6664000	So therefore, for the internet sense, forums is correct.
6664000	6667000	Fora only refers to the physical location of a public forum.
6667000	6672000	Interesting. Well, I still think that was a teaching moment here on OLR, so there you go.
6672000	6673000	The more you know.
6673000	6675000	Solved by the resident grammar nerd.
6675000	6682000	Alright. Anyway, going over to Google Plus in our foogle, which is a completely made-up word.
6682000	6684000	Is that in the dictionary? Alright.
6684000	6690000	Redertainment saying, not long ago, Jezebel, as well as other sites across the Gawker network,
6690000	6695000	changed the way they handle comments in order to address what they perceived as a growing and pervasive problem against their commenters.
6695000	6700000	If such a problem exists, the people who run any website should be able to take steps to address the problem,
6700000	6704000	and if that includes requiring moderator approval for comments, so be it.
6704000	6709000	Sure, we'd like to be free to say what we want in response to an article with nothing to act as a hindrance,
6709000	6715000	but, as we all know, the anonymity of the internet has led to a high population of unrepentant jackasses online.
6715000	6719000	That's going to be my next rock band. Unrepentant jackasses.
6719000	6723000	The problems those jackasses cause cannot be ignored and must be addressed,
6723000	6729000	even if it causes problems among those who do not engage in such jackassery.
6729000	6731000	Is that a fair use of the word, jackassery?
6731000	6733000	Yes, jackassery.
6733000	6738000	ActDeaf says, I think that encouraging discussion should be allowed, but when things get out of hand,
6738000	6741000	a moderator should definitely step in.
6741000	6746000	Not sure if I totally approve of screened messages, but it's their site, so they can handle it how they please.
6746000	6750000	I'm not sure if this is Brozime or Brozime, and I've probably asked this like a million times before.
6750000	6752000	I'm going to think it's Brozime.
6752000	6754000	Alright, well it's one of the two.
6754000	6757000	Repisant says, it unfortunately needs to stay the way it is.
6757000	6764000	Human moderators can be paid to take down unwanted opinions and can't possibly work fast enough to keep up on popular pages.
6764000	6771000	Inhuman moderation has the problem of misfiring like copyright claims on YouTube, so that could potentially be worse as well.
6771000	6775000	That's a very good point. Don't let a fucking robot moderate your forum.
6776000	6782000	Ronnie B. last but not least on Google says, I think it's okay to censor personal attacks at least.
6782000	6786000	In general, people should treat others how they would want to be treated.
6786000	6793000	Companies should also be expected to allow respectable criticisms as feedback from their consumers, perhaps to better their product.
6793000	6800000	I like ending on that comment because it reinforces the golden rule which nobody follows on the internet these days.
6800000	6804000	Treat people like you would want to be treated. Dang it.
6805000	6808000	I'll just open it up to comment in the room. What do you guys think is appropriate?
6808000	6812000	I'd say treat people better than you would like to be treated.
6815000	6822000	Honestly, freedom of speech, at least in the United States, only applies to speaking about the government in approved forums.
6822000	6828000	Therefore, a private organization can limit the speech of whoever is using their services.
6828000	6838000	If it is a public forum, like for example, Sega can't go on Twitter. Twitter could regulate that speech, but Sega could not.
6838000	6845000	And Twitter also, since you brought that up, they kind of need to do a better job of it too, because there's a lot of real nasty shit on Twitter.
6845000	6849000	And I know Twitter does have a report abuse feature, but it's not working.
6849000	6852000	It's also being abused too, by the way.
6852000	6859000	Yeah, so Twitter kind of needs to fix their shit. And I love Twitter. I've embraced that since the beginning.
6859000	6867000	I think it's very smart where you basically make people speak in text messages, which I know doesn't sound smart, but it's been a great concept.
6867000	6874000	But Twitter really, really needs some type of overhaul in regards to some of their policies.
6874000	6876000	You know what Twitter needs?
6876000	6877000	A mother.
6877000	6881000	No, a button simply called expose.
6881000	6888000	Hmm. I could see some people using that for naughty purposes. What does the expose button do?
6888000	6891000	Reveals their identity for a solid hour.
6891000	6896000	But then we go back to the whole, not everybody should necessarily have to have their identities online.
6896000	6903000	Did you hear though about the, it was a paper printed, I want to say, in one of the big psychological publications.
6904000	6919000	It was between a couple psychologists and a few sociologists who actually revealed that by classic definition, people who go behind anonymous names and tell people to kill themselves or do hate like that are criminally insane.
6919000	6922000	They're labeled as true sociopaths.
6922000	6930000	That given the chance for them to go around and cause harm to people physically in real life and remain anonymous, they would most likely do it.
6930000	6934000	And that's the kind of shit that Twitter needs to like, we need to be able to respond faster to that.
6934000	6935000	But anyway.
6935000	6937000	Those are the kind of people I wish wouldn't breed.
6937000	6938000	All right.
6938000	6943000	All right. Well, if there's no other comments on that, let's move in back to our-
6943000	6944000	I do have one comment.
6944000	6945000	Sure, please Jonas.
6945000	6951000	With the way Sega's moderation thing, will it be similar to the way that like me versus moderating things or just-
6951000	6957000	No, it just sounds like the Sega is going to be pretty swiftly acting against people that attack people.
6958000	6961000	You can go on there and say, all of Sonic's friends are shitty.
6961000	6965000	You can say that because it's not real people.
6965000	6974000	But when they say things like, let's say they post one of the developers at Sega, you know, hard at work and somebody's going to go, wow, he looks like a fugly slut.
6974000	6977000	Then that's not okay because that's a real person.
6977000	6986000	So Sega is going to take a stance against, you know, moderate errors, taking a stance where they're going to moderate that shit and, you know, we ban you for a very long time.
6986000	6993000	All right. Let's get back into some news and we'll get to the mailbag and your calls very soon.
6993000	6997000	1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
6997000	7005000	So there's a rumor now that Microsoft is testing the ability to stream Xbox games to a browser.
7005000	7007000	So that's kind of neat.
7008000	7016000	According to, I guess, a tech blog, Neowin, they're saying that they're currently testing the ability to play Xbox games via the web browser.
7016000	7025000	I guess that would be for use on, like, I don't know, their tablets and stuff or whatever.
7025000	7032000	Or hey, maybe even, you know, the Xbox One since, you know, it does have Internet Explorer built into it.
7033000	7043000	Apparently it's saying, you know, Xbox 360 titles, the 360 dashboard both run in browser and with the games outputting at about 60 frames per second.
7043000	7045000	I'll believe that when I see it.
7045000	7053000	But, I mean, I guess if it's possible to do something similar with, you know, similar technologies that they have right now at Sony.
7053000	7059000	Cool. I hope that's the case because I'd love to play my Xbox 360 games from work.
7060000	7065000	So this could be a very different kind of streaming thing than what maybe Sony's doing.
7065000	7068000	You know, obviously there's PlayStation Now. They're trying to build into everything.
7068000	7073000	But that would be very interesting because Microsoft would have the capability to kind of build that into Windows in a way.
7073000	7074000	Yeah.
7074000	7076000	And through their browser.
7076000	7078000	That would be cool even with just, like, laptops.
7078000	7084000	Like, that would get me to use Internet Explorer specifically for that.
7084000	7087000	But that's, you know, it's a small win, I guess.
7087000	7088000	Yeah. Interesting.
7088000	7095000	But think about how much better that would be if they spent 2.5 billion dollars investing in that technology and not buying Minecraft.
7095000	7100000	The seg in our chatroom says, and all on Silverlight.
7100000	7104000	Oh, you better believe it. You'll have to have that installed in order to do it.
7104000	7105000	Whatever.
7105000	7112000	I already have it installed for God knows what other websites I have to visit with their stupid Silverlight in there.
7112000	7115000	Could they, maybe they could just bring one versus a hundred back as a browser game.
7115000	7117000	Just do HTML5 or something.
7117000	7123000	I mean, I thought that was the whole thing with, or was all that, like, crap with Internet Explorer.
7123000	7125000	Was it beyond 10 now or something?
7125000	7130000	Was, like, oh, because remember they had it where you can run games directly from the browser and stuff.
7130000	7133000	Like, specific IE pages or something.
7133000	7136000	Is that all running on Silverlight or was that, you know, HTML5?
7136000	7139000	I can't remember which that was.
7139000	7145000	I think it's, like, I don't, if you're using Internet Explorer on the Xbox and stuff, like, I don't think it has Silverlight.
7145000	7148000	But I think it will do HTML5. I think.
7148000	7153000	Don't quote me on that, though. It's not like I browse the Internet from my Xbox very often.
7153000	7155000	All right. Well, let's move on.
7155000	7159000	If it does support HTML5, let's say just hypothetically that I was using that.
7159000	7165000	Could I stream an Xbox 360 game to my 3DS or, sorry, new 3DS?
7165000	7167000	That'd be pretty cool.
7167000	7173000	All right. Moving on. Speaking of Xbox One, the console was released in Japan.
7173000	7176000	I don't know if you guys heard, but the console did release in Japan.
7176000	7180000	And I'm not sure a lot of people in Japan actually heard the Xbox One was launching there either.
7180000	7183000	Or they didn't care because the sales figures are in.
7183000	7192000	And in four days in Japan of the console launch, 23,562 units were sold.
7192000	7195000	That's kind of low, just so you guys know.
7195000	7200000	That is way less than what the Xbox 360 sold in the region when it first went on sale there.
7200000	7203000	Which was 60,000 units in two days.
7203000	7210000	The original Xbox was 123,000 units in three days back in 2002.
7210000	7214000	So the Xbox One sold like a sixth of that.
7214000	7219000	The best-selling game on the system in Japan, Titanfall, which was bundled with the console apparently.
7219000	7223000	I didn't know that they sold like a Titanfall bundle over there, but there you go.
7223000	7226000	Connect Sports Rivals sold just over 14K copies.
7226000	7231000	Dead Rising 3, 7,330 units.
7231000	7237000	Just to compare this, Act Def says kind of low. Those are almost rock bottom.
7237000	7242000	Yeah, to put this in perspective, Xbox One sold 23,500 units in Japan, right?
7242000	7246000	The Wii U sold 308,000 units in two days.
7246000	7251000	The PlayStation 4, 322,000 units in two days.
7251000	7256000	So, Xbox One kind of went over like a poop in Japan.
7256000	7259000	But this surprises nobody, I think.
7259000	7261000	It was a very weak fart.
7261000	7263000	They didn't do much to try.
7263000	7266000	Microsoft's not exactly trying to get Japan at this point.
7266000	7271000	If they want the games for Japan, just release the sequel to Galgun for the Xbox One.
7271000	7276000	No, but seriously, they didn't honestly do anything.
7276000	7279000	We were kind of waiting to see what they were going to announce.
7279000	7285000	It was going to be kind of like, ooh, this is the must-have thing for the Xbox One in Japan.
7285000	7288000	There's that one thing from Platinum Games they alluded to at E3.
7288000	7291000	The one trailer they had.
7291000	7293000	Yeah, but that's it.
7293000	7296000	And there was really nothing besides the concept thing.
7296000	7299000	They announced the new Monster Hunter game on Xbox One. Maybe then.
7299000	7302000	There you go. That might get people a little more excited.
7303000	7305000	SSG100Matt says,
7305000	7309000	Those are the type of numbers you cross your legs in pain to.
7310000	7316000	Those are the type of numbers that a good independent app on...
7316000	7319000	Just a random app out there might sell.
7319000	7321000	A good one.
7321000	7323000	Well, there you go.
7323000	7328000	So apparently Microsoft is not really going to try to push the Xbox One in Japan any further.
7328000	7330000	At least not that we're seeing.
7331000	7335000	Anything's possible, but not really expecting anything huge.
7335000	7338000	But hey, to be pleasantly surprised would be great.
7338000	7341000	If they come out and say, Lost Odyssey sequel.
7341000	7344000	I'm going to be like, God damn it, because now I'm going to have to buy an Xbox One.
7344000	7347000	Speaking of that, whatever happened to Miss Walker?
7348000	7351000	That is a good question. This came up on a previous show.
7351000	7353000	They were making 3DS games.
7353000	7358000	The last thing I remember them doing was Last Remnant on the Wii, which was a very late Wii.
7358000	7360000	You mean Last Story or Last Remnant?
7360000	7364000	Sorry, Last Story. Thank you, Last Story, not Last Remnant. Thank you.
7364000	7367000	I was going to say Last Remnant, that was on PS2 or PS3.
7367000	7370000	Shit, I have that in my Steam library and I haven't even played it yet.
7370000	7372000	That was Square's first Unreal game, I think.
7372000	7373000	Yes, it was.
7373000	7376000	Let's see, other games by Miss Walker.
7376000	7379000	Terra Battle is Android and iOS.
7379000	7382000	That's a terrible name for it. Terra Battle.
7382000	7385000	I mean, it's Terra Battle. I mean, it sounds like terrible.
7385000	7387000	But that's an Android and iOS game.
7387000	7391000	The last console game they made was The Last Story on the Nintendo Wii,
7391000	7395000	and before that was Blue Dragon on the Nintendo DS, the Awakened Shadow.
7395000	7400000	So things have been kind of quiet on the Miss Walker front.
7400000	7402000	I think they're still going.
7402000	7406000	I don't think they have folded, but they must be focusing.
7406000	7408000	Yeah, their website's still up and going.
7408000	7413000	They've got a little thing for Terra Battle, and party with Terra Battle's artists.
7413000	7416000	So I guess that's their big thing right now.
7416000	7419000	A lot of stuff I see on here is about Terra Battle.
7419000	7422000	Is it Terra Bad-al?
7422000	7425000	I don't know. I have not played it.
7425000	7428000	Are you checking it out on your phone right now?
7428000	7431000	No, I'm sending Grandpa an email.
7431000	7433000	Hi, Grandpa.
7433000	7438000	Well, Dark Soccer, you might have to put a break in your email here and do the next story.
7438000	7442000	Well, this is actually really, really awesome stuff.
7442000	7447000	The 2014 Women in Games Hall of Fame inductees have been announced.
7447000	7450000	We have King.com's...
7450000	7453000	I'm going to mispronounce her name.
7453000	7458000	Katharina Lavers-Mallet and Marie-Claire Aissaman from the Norwich University of Arts
7458000	7462000	are the latest inductees that were included.
7462000	7468000	This basically was put into effect in 2011, sponsored by EA,
7468000	7472000	and it's part of the European Women in Games Conference that took place yesterday.
7472000	7477000	So they're definitely giving some more recognition to some very deserving ladies.
7477000	7481000	I don't know if you know this, but is there actually a physical hall of fame,
7481000	7484000	or is this more a spiritual thing as part of this convention?
7484000	7487000	I don't know if it's a spiritual thing or not. I would think that it is.
7487000	7493000	But you can get more information at womeningamesjobs.com.
7493000	7500000	It made me think about at the Sony Metreon back when it was the big place to be for PlayStation,
7500000	7503000	they started a gaming walk of fame there, and they were trying to make it like...
7503000	7507000	It was supposed to be the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it would be in San Francisco,
7507000	7511000	and then two years later is when the PlayStation Store closed and all that stuff.
7511000	7515000	I don't even know if it's still there, the Walk of Fame. I doubt it.
7515000	7517000	The Gaming Walk of Fame. I don't know.
7517000	7521000	But anyway, sorry. You talking about not to hijack your story, Darcyro.
7521000	7525000	It just kind of made me think, like, oh, I wonder if it's maybe a physical place I can go and learn more.
7525000	7527000	But a lot of times these things are kind of more spiritual.
7527000	7530000	I don't think so much. Yeah, but go check out the site.
7530000	7531000	Okay.
7531000	7532000	Learn more.
7532000	7533000	Sounds good.
7533000	7538000	We need more, I would say, women not just in the development arena,
7538000	7543000	but definitely in the reporting and the coverage analysis, the business behind it,
7543000	7547000	without having someone wiggle their finger at them and accuse them of doing things.
7547000	7548000	Mm-hmm.
7548000	7550000	A little bit more respect, guys.
7551000	7553000	All right. Loki.
7554000	7555000	All right.
7555000	7558000	Oh, sorry. Sorry. The SAG has a report. Sorry, Loki. The SAG has a report.
7558000	7560000	Oh, man. The Walk of Game.
7560000	7563000	No, it's now a Target. All of Target.
7563000	7565000	Oh, there it is.
7565000	7570000	So the Walk of Game is now Women's Lingerie Department.
7570000	7576000	I thought that I read that they were going to bring that to, like, a convention or something like that.
7576000	7577000	Maybe.
7577000	7579000	They were doing something with that or something.
7579000	7582000	Because that confused me. I'm like, how do you move that?
7582000	7586000	Well, you move the slabs somewhere. You don't have to have the whole sidewalk move.
7586000	7587000	Anyway.
7587000	7588000	Anyways, moving on.
7588000	7590000	So, Oculus Rift.
7590000	7597000	Apparently, the Oculus Rift consumer version will be out by summer of 2015.
7598000	7599000	Cool.
7599000	7602000	And priced somewhere between $200 and $400.
7602000	7609000	They're saying it's also going to have a high resolution and a 90 hertz or a higher refresh rate.
7610000	7618000	So, yeah. I'm excited to see what comes of that and what they're going to do with it once it actually launches.
7618000	7625000	Next year's going to be a big VR year because I bet Morpheus will be what we're going to talk about for PlayStation 4 holiday as well.
7625000	7631000	So this is going to be very curious to see what the pricing looks like on those and, you know, what the games are looking like.
7631000	7633000	And very, very interesting.
7635000	7639000	And I fully anticipate a Virtual Boy 2 coming out of Nintendo.
7639000	7644000	And with the same type of graphics, too, because you know how Nintendo just doesn't quite get it right away.
7644000	7646000	So it's going to be, you know...
7646000	7651000	Well, to be fair, the 3DS was kind of ahead of the time a little bit.
7651000	7656000	I mean, 3DS gaming kind of came and went, but now it's kind of a thing again with all this Oculus stuff.
7656000	7658000	I mean, it's different, but...
7658000	7660000	Diego, comment?
7660000	7663000	I remember when Game Gear was ahead of its time.
7663000	7666000	That thing lit up the entire room, that light.
7666000	7672000	Yeah, and it also single-handedly kept Energizer, EnduraCell, and business for all the batteries that thing ate through.
7672000	7674000	Yes, it did.
7675000	7678000	I think it was like a power generator. It could probably light up the entire house.
7678000	7682000	I think the person that invented rechargeable batteries owned a Game Gear.
7682000	7684000	I think that's the only plausible explanation.
7684000	7685000	There's got to be a better way.
7685000	7687000	There's got to be a better way.
7687000	7689000	Too much power.
7689000	7693000	Well, now it's just that Nintendo, was it their Wii Remotes, I think, do that.
7693000	7695000	Unless they improve that in the Wii Remote Plus.
7695000	7702000	I don't own one of those, but the original Wii Remotes, man, they'll just nom on those batteries even while you're not using it.
7702000	7704000	That's Nintendo for you.
7704000	7713000	Well, speaking of all these VR things, you know, we talked a little bit last week about the Samsung Gear VR that has the Oculus built into it, right?
7713000	7718000	And it's going to be, you know, one type of, like, you know, kind of baseline Oculus, if you will.
7718000	7723000	Well, Harmonix is actually going to be creating a VR experience for the device.
7723000	7730000	And I think this makes most of us in the room kind of perk up, because I know a lot of us are music game fans, and Harmonix does a very good job with their music games.
7730000	7739000	So, Harmonix Music VR, it's a music listening, dream-like experience that uses the company's music analysis engine to generate VR world elements.
7739000	7746000	It's a visualizer that you can basically be in with VR. That's kind of neat.
7746000	7750000	A comment here from Steve Janiak, the CEO of Harmonix.
7750000	7755000	Harmonix has always been interested in creating fundamentally new ways for people to interact with music.
7755000	7762000	There's an incredible amount of potential for this with virtual reality, and Harmonix Music VR is just one way we can deliver on these types of innovative experiences.
7762000	7768000	We can't wait to hear what people think about this new way to experience the music they love.
7768000	7773000	That's totally, like, one-ups the beats thing. That totally one-ups that. We'll see.
7773000	7780000	I think it would be cool if they brought their first person shooter over. I think that would be good.
7780000	7781000	Chroma?
7781000	7783000	Yeah, Chroma would be a good thing.
7783000	7785000	Did they kill it off?
7785000	7789000	It was Alpha, so they're still working on it.
7789000	7791000	It's on hold for a little while.
7791000	7796000	Maybe they'll put frequency on this. Who knows? No, I guess they can't, because the whole Sony tie-in.
7796000	7798000	Yeah, Morpheus.
7798000	7801000	Or Amplitude. No, it's not Amplitude. They're bringing it back.
7801000	7806000	Same thing. Same thing. Yeah, maybe they can put that on Morpheus. Who knows?
7806000	7810000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.
7810000	7815000	Mailbag at Orange, excuse me, participate at Orangelaunchradio.com. This place is in his emails.
7815000	7822000	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place where our mailbag is located, and Dark Soccer is going to dive in to the mailbag.
7822000	7823000	It's all sticky.
7823000	7827000	Well, I thought it was really empty when I looked. It was very dusty in there.
7827000	7830000	It was, and it's making me log in again, so hold on.
7830000	7833000	So Dark Soccer is going to get her can of compressed air.
7833000	7836000	I'm going to get some bleach.
7836000	7841000	Dusty out the mailbag there, and read some of your emails. Or email, as the case may be.
7841000	7842000	Two.
7842000	7844000	Oh, two emails. There was only one when I looked earlier.
7844000	7847000	Well, that's what you get for only looking once.
7847000	7850000	Hi, OLR. It's the Nasty Canasta.
7850000	7855000	I just wanted to inform everyone about the Binding of Isaac Rebirth finally getting a release date.
7855000	7858000	November 4th for Steam, PS4, and Vita.
7858000	7862000	The date was announced through a trailer so surreal it was too hot for Steam.
7862000	7865000	Seriously, it's about as weird as P.T.
7865000	7870000	If you can spare 90 seconds to watch and creep out your listeners at the same time, here's the link.
7870000	7871000	Which we're probably not going to do.
7871000	7875000	Yeah, I'm going to skip over that just because I don't know if it's an audio-visual thing. I'll have to check that out later.
7875000	7876000	Here's what I will do though.
7876000	7877000	Google it, people.
7877000	7879000	I am copying the link, and I will paste it in the chatroom in a moment.
7879000	7880000	There you go.
7880000	7884000	Nicholas is being quite generous with the release of Rebirth.
7884000	7887000	The game will be given away to PlayStation Plus subscribers.
7887000	7895000	And if you own the original Isaac on Steam, you can take advantage of a 33% loyalty discount toward Rebirth before it's out.
7895000	7898000	Have a great night, the Nasty Canasta.
7898000	7901000	And I'm going to go post that link in the chatroom real quick.
7901000	7902000	Sounds good.
7902000	7908000	I don't have a whole lot else to say on this except, you know, Binding of Isaac, it's a really weird game.
7908000	7911000	Like, it's kind of scary, odd, disturbing.
7911000	7913000	And Smash TV-like.
7913000	7921000	But, yeah, you make the mistake of thinking it's Zelda when you first see the interface, but yeah, it's way more like a Smash TV or a twin-stick shooter type of thing.
7921000	7922000	Yeah.
7922000	7923000	But it's fun.
7923000	7927000	Makes me wish I had a way to hook up my twin sticks to it. I have Dreamcast 2 and 6.
7927000	7932000	But I'll check out the expansion because it probably won't be very much because, you know, Isaac was very reasonably priced game.
7932000	7937000	And showed up in all these Humble bundles and things like that.
7937000	7940000	Is the Binding of Isaac Rebirth?
7940000	7950000	But, you know, now that I think about it, though, if I have a way to hook up my Dreamcast keyboard to my computer, chances are I might be able to hook up my twin sticks to my computer.
7950000	7952000	Somebody's written a driver for it, I'm sure.
7952000	7957000	I have to play this with my twin sticks for Virtual On. Oh my god, it must happen.
7957000	7961000	Hey, OLR, it's Brozime.
7961000	7964000	Which I'm going to stick with Brozime.
7964000	7972000	As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?
7972000	7974000	Please use punctuation.
7974000	7979000	Have you... I'm going to restart this and imagine proper capitalization.
7979000	7982000	Imagine a world where people don't write emails on their mobile phones.
7982000	7987000	Because I'm trying to phrase it properly and I can't... I'm phrasing it the way that it's written.
7987000	7988000	So I have to stop.
7988000	7989000	Breathe in, breathe in.
7989000	7990000	Okay.
7990000	8004000	As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?
8004000	8007000	Have you played any of the games and do you like them?
8007000	8015000	I haven't played a single one. I have a lot of friends that are into them. I might play one. That's it.
8015000	8017000	Oh, I thought that was the email saying that.
8018000	8024000	Actually, yeah, I must admit Persona's a series I kind of have missed out on. I haven't really played a lot of the games.
8024000	8031000	I think Shane's super into it and I know other people out there too that are really into it. I haven't played an awful lot of it.
8031000	8036000	My understanding is the last one was on the Vita and I didn't really get into that.
8036000	8038000	I keep seeing Persona 4 really cheap.
8038000	8044000	I know it was on PS2 and it was on PS3. I just, for whatever reason, never got around to the series.
8044000	8049000	I never really got into it, but I have a lot of friends that are into it who have been trying to get me hooked and no.
8049000	8053000	How about our anime game room guys? Are you guys big on Persona at all?
8053000	8057000	No? Blank Stayers? Not really?
8057000	8058000	Exactly, no.
8058000	8062000	Mike Jonas, please.
8062000	8068000	Not really, though. We have shown Persona 4 arena the fighting game for one of the tournaments.
8068000	8069000	Ah, okay.
8069000	8071000	There you go.
8071000	8079000	Alright, yeah, sadly, you know what? We've kind of missed out on it too, but I'm keeping tabs on it. Something I'll catch up on eventually.
8079000	8083000	And by the way, correcting your grammar is how I show love.
8083000	8089000	Also, Rob, last week you said you've been playing Dragon's Crown on Vita. Period.
8089000	8093000	Are you looking for anyone to play with?
8093000	8098000	Probably not on the Vita. I'm going to see if I can still grab it for free on the PlayStation 3.
8098000	8104000	I don't know if there's cross-play or whatever, but yeah, sure, I'd play that. I thought the game was pretty rad.
8104000	8108000	I've got the game on both PS3 and Vita, and wouldn't mind an excuse to play more.
8108000	8109000	Well, there you go.
8109000	8110000	I'm going to play some more for Dragon's Crown.
8110000	8111000	Yes, I own the game.
8111000	8116000	You do? Yeah, that's nice. Good artwork.
8116000	8117000	Yeah, artwork.
8117000	8122000	Remember, grammar correction is love. I correct your grammar because I care.
8122000	8123000	I know.
8123000	8127000	That and bad punctuation really makes emails hard to read.
8127000	8131000	Alright. Well, there it is. Is that it for the emails tonight?
8131000	8132000	All two of them.
8132000	8135000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8135000	8139000	Only if you're going to write from your mobile phone, please take your time.
8139000	8140000	Alright.
8140000	8145000	It really is not that hard to switch over to using the period. Just saying.
8145000	8149000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, appropriately enough.
8157000	8162000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
8162000	8165000	This is fucked up.
8165000	8167000	I don't know.
8167000	8172000	FU to adjusting to my new schedule.
8172000	8178000	It's not all that great working on Saturday, but I also don't mind having my weekdays off.
8178000	8186000	And FU to situations on behalf of my friend who just lost her children.
8186000	8187000	Oh, no.
8187000	8189000	I have them taken home.
8189000	8190000	Oh.
8190000	8194000	That's... Sorry, my mind went to, like, lost, lost.
8194000	8195000	No.
8195000	8197000	But still, I mean, that's still very unfortunate.
8197000	8200000	I'm not going to name names or anything. It's a private thing.
8200000	8201000	Sure, sure, sure. Of course.
8201000	8213000	But I'm sending out my love to my friend because I think that it was a misguided and incorrect accusation I led to it.
8213000	8214000	Oh, boy.
8214000	8218000	So I am thinking very positive thoughts for her and her family.
8218000	8220000	Okay. Complicated.
8220000	8225000	Alright. Well, you know what, Jonas? I know you love the FU segments. Why don't you go next, buddy?
8225000	8234000	FU to those who keep posting misinformation and hashtagging important information and stuff.
8234000	8238000	Or, like, important news that posted on Facebook or whatever.
8239000	8244000	Again, people, if you want to educate people about your opinion, please get your sources right.
8244000	8252000	I don't want to hear another Ferguson where people are posting videos that are, like, one year old or videos that actually have...
8252000	8257000	that took place outside the state of the... where the locations are.
8257000	8260000	That just... It doesn't educate people. It just adds more ignorance.
8263000	8266000	People love to be ignorant on Facebook.
8266000	8269000	Or just in general, though, because then...
8269000	8278000	Yeah, but I see more of it on Facebook. Like, the proportion of ignorance, like, outside the computer and what I see on Facebook, it's not the same. Anyway.
8278000	8282000	Anyways, I don't want to deal with people getting angry over the wrong information.
8282000	8288000	Another big fuck you to everyone spamming smash codes advice.
8288000	8293000	I have smashed codes. Here's a code. Burger.
8293000	8294000	What?
8294000	8295000	What?
8295000	8296000	Smashburger.
8296000	8298000	Oh, God.
8300000	8304000	Not everybody has that chain is going to get the joke. Oh, my God.
8304000	8306000	Let's see.
8306000	8309000	Another F you to...
8309000	8313000	Pretty much anybody who tries to just kill George just any conversation whatsoever.
8313000	8318000	It's, like, it could be the happiest and people just completely killed you with complaining and moaning and whining and bitching.
8318000	8319000	Oh, like Debbie Downer?
8319000	8321000	You seen that Saturday Night Live sketch, Debbie Downer?
8321000	8322000	I haven't seen that. I actually haven't seen that.
8322000	8324000	Oh, you got to look it up. It's hilarious.
8324000	8332000	But in general, it's like, if people are that miserable, get some help. Just seriously, get some help.
8332000	8337000	All right, Jonas, I got to cut you off on a three hour show. All right, Loki.
8337000	8343000	F you to Microsoft and their stupid Windows update auto restart.
8343000	8354000	If you don't turn it off and you get a nice 15 minute countdown and that's basically saying, listen, you have 15 minutes to save your shit and I'm just going to restart your computer.
8354000	8360000	There's no way to click that off. You know, like I'm in the middle of a podcast or something and I need to not have that happen.
8360000	8368000	So I had to actually jump in and stop the service from running twice because the first time it decided, hey, I'm going to do it again.
8368000	8377000	So that's really annoying and they really should have a way to stop that from happening because I don't need to be granny through Windows updates.
8377000	8385000	In fact, the fact that they have as many updates for Windows anyways is just annoying. So I got to manually shut that off now.
8385000	8388000	Diego, you want to go?
8388000	8394000	Right now, I actually F you to my carrier right now because Sprint likes to do what it wants to do.
8394000	8401000	Yeah, it seems to go on and off and I don't know, I can never have a connection and I do have a fast connection.
8401000	8407000	And whenever I go to Fanime, which is another convention that we do, it seems to just completely shut down.
8407000	8413000	I'm completely useless at that point that I can't even talk to anyone. I might as well be dead.
8413000	8419000	It's amazing how much we rely on mobile phones too. Like that's just, I mean, we have to have that.
8419000	8424000	Oh, right. And when you have so many people in, especially conventions, especially conventions anyway.
8424000	8431000	Yeah, especially when you're in there and people are using all the phone, all their phones at the same time, spamming up the air with all these waves. It's just crazy.
8431000	8439000	Also, F you to some people at the con who just don't realize that they should take a shower.
8439000	8441000	Welcome to Confunk.
8441000	8451000	Especially that, especially just the sound or the motion of just seeing sweaty bodies go around and not just having the correct personal hygiene.
8451000	8461000	At least not even using the proper amount of soap for a proper amount of cleaning of itself. After that it just gets into more nastier, creamy details.
8461000	8470000	Let me, let me ask this as, cause you guys do the, the game room and stuff. Are there certain people where like after they touch the controllers and things you like, as soon as they turn around, you go for breeze.
8470000	8472000	Like, is there, is that like a thing?
8472000	8478000	It's like degreaser. I mean, sometimes that pretty much becomes our new cologne. If you think about it.
8478000	8486000	I mean, after the whole incident with Jonas's a we string that looked like someone just, I'd be like, fuck it to the guy who pretty much floss his ass with it.
8486000	8490000	Sorry. That's a little too much there, but that's what happened. That's what it seems like happened.
8490000	8507000	Wow. All right. I'm cutting you off too. All right. Uh, let's see my, a few of the week, my a few of the week goes to the fact that, um, I, I, I'm trying this lifestyle adjustment where I'm eating a little differently, which has been good because I've lost a whole four pounds this week.
8507000	8509000	Sorry about the candy corn. Not sorry.
8509000	8520000	Yeah, but I ate that bag of candy corn anyway. But also as a result of this eating change that I'm clearly not doing very well on, uh, I haven't had a taco all week.
8520000	8527000	Like F you to the lack of tacos in my life. It's, it's depressing. And like Jamie had to go and say Jim boys earlier.
8527000	8529000	Ah, he's the one who brought it.
8531000	8532000	Jerk.
8532000	8544000	All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on past the FUs of the week. Let's get to a few more stories for you guys. And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. But first, Loki.
8544000	8557000	If you have a PSP and no other system, you're going to be in trouble if you're in Europe or Asia because you're going to lose access to the PlayStation network starting tomorrow. Too bad.
8557000	8559000	I mean right now then probably.
8559000	8575000	Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So apparently, you know, of course they, um, halted the production of the PSP, um, back in June of this year in Japan. Wow. That's been going that long in, I guess January, um, for North America.
8575000	8585000	But I don't know. Hopefully most of you have like a, you know, a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 and you can download stuff with that.
8585000	8590000	I was going to say, those of you that have a PSP Go are really fucked at this point, aren't you?
8590000	8592000	Oh shit, yeah.
8592000	8594000	Cause you can't even use discs.
8594000	8596000	Oh wow, yeah.
8596000	8598000	That's, uh, life sucks for you.
8598000	8607000	I'm surprised we haven't seen that, like, you know, that headline, you know, on, I guess no one's realized it because everyone forgot about the PSP Go.
8607000	8609000	I didn't forget, Loki.
8609000	8610000	I didn't forget.
8610000	8611000	Never forget.
8611000	8612000	Never forget.
8612000	8614000	I got overshadowed by PS Vita.
8614000	8616000	Yeah. I just, yeah.
8616000	8617000	Completely.
8617000	8634000	My recommendation would be, um, if you really, really want to use your PSP and, I guess, get a Vita. I mean, you can transfer all your digital purchases over that way and, uh, shit, they've got to be coming down in price at some point soon since, uh, you know, PlayStation TV is going to be dirt cheap, so, you know.
8634000	8635000	Right.
8635000	8638000	Or get a PlayStation TV if you play at home all the time.
8638000	8639000	There you go.
8639000	8656000	Alright, and, uh, lastly, uh, kind of a sad note to end the show on, but, uh, you know, when there's a passing in the game community, we like to take a minute to acknowledge their contributions to the community and this is, uh, this is really strange timing because, um, I did this as a Classic Game of the Week just a couple months ago.
8656000	8669000	I don't remember the episode number off the top of my head, but it was a week that Dark Soccer wasn't here because, you know, when she's not here is when I, myself or Loki, end up doing the Classic Game of the Week and just a couple times ago, I picked Lode Runner, that's L-O-D-E Runner, as the Classic Game of the Week.
8669000	8678000	Uh, 1983 was when this game came out and the creator was a man named Douglas E. Smith, who unfortunately passed away this past week.
8678000	8707000	Um, so, Tozai Games, who currently holds the license, which I'm sure is developing probably like mobile phone, because, you know, they are still making Lode Runner, uh, but, you know, even when Sierra was doing it, it just wasn't the same as the, uh, classic, classic game, which was not only a platformer run and use ladders and get the gold bars and everything, but it was also, uh, had a level editor, which at that time, you know, 1983 was practically unheard of in games to have, like, a full-on level editor.
8707000	8709000	So, uh, very, very tragic to hear about this.
8709000	8718000	Um, so, uh, yep, just a reminder, Lode Runner began being developed by Douglas Smith during his time at the University of Washington.
8718000	8730000	The prototype was originally called Kong, and then the finished version was called Miner, but Broderbund finally distributed it as Lode Runner for the Apple II, the Atari 8-bit, the MSX, and the Commodore 64.
8730000	8733000	Uh, Lode Runner Classic was released in 2012.
8733000	8742000	That was, uh, on the Xbox Live and all that stuff, I believe, and had some features in the original version that Broderbund Software distributed.
8742000	8746000	So, uh, rest in peace, Doug Smith, who passed away this week.
8746000	8750000	Very sad to hear. Somebody made a level with his initials, D.E. Smith.
8750000	8753000	I guess it's a memorum type of thing.
8754000	8761000	Alright, uh, that is going to do it for Stories here, but that means the Skype line's open if you want to call and talk about anything we've discussed tonight.
8761000	8768000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
8768000	8771000	And some folks in chat reminiscing a bit about Lode Runner.
8771000	8777000	SSJ100Matt says, I've been kicked out of the computer lab in school because of Lode Runner many a time.
8777000	8784000	We never played Lode Runner in the computer lab at school. The thing that we always played the shit out of was Scorched Earth.
8784000	8790000	Scorched Earth and... What was the other tank game before that? Like, VGA tank or something like that?
8790000	8791000	I don't remember.
8791000	8795000	Tank VGA? We need to livestream some Scorched Earth sometime. That would be...
8795000	8796000	That would be awesome.
8796000	8800000	That would be fun, wouldn't it? Think we can still get the shareware version of that somewhere? I don't know.
8800000	8804000	Alright, well, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8805000	8808000	Local residential convention whore DJ Rama S.
8808000	8810000	Hey, Rama. How you doing?
8810000	8813000	I'm doing pretty good. How about everybody in that studio?
8813000	8814000	We are doing fantastic.
8814000	8816000	Doing good. Hello, DJ Rama S.
8816000	8817000	Better now that you're here.
8817000	8818000	Hello.
8818000	8819000	Awesome.
8819000	8820000	What's up, buddy?
8820000	8823000	Alright, there's a couple of things I want to talk about, then I'm going to get the heck up one out of here.
8823000	8826000	Now, you mentioned Con Funk earlier in the show.
8826000	8833000	I didn't mention it. I didn't mention it. Diego, our guest. That's Diego from the big anime game room.
8833000	8835000	Hi, there. I sure did bring it up.
8835000	8840000	So Diego understands the struggle, because I've been doing anime cons for God knows how long,
8840000	8846000	and if there's an arcade room with a DDR machine, you go in there early in the morning or late at night.
8846000	8850000	Other than that, yeah, you're going to need to change your clothes when you get out of that game room.
8850000	8852000	Oh, you better believe it.
8852000	8855000	Yes, because check this out.
8855000	8862000	In a few weeks, New York Comic Con is going to be upon us, and everybody's going to be there, except for me because I got issues.
8863000	8866000	Wait, I'm not going to be there. Do I have issues?
8866000	8869000	No, you're on the West Coast. You're exempt.
8869000	8870000	Okay, cool. Good.
8870000	8873000	I'm 45 minutes away from this convention, so...
8873000	8876000	And you're not going because you have issues?
8876000	8885000	Issues are the fact that I'm not losing a day's pay to stand in a line for 8 to 12 hours for a badge,
8886000	8892000	and if you don't believe me, Google New York Comic Con badge lines.
8892000	8896000	You'll see people standing in front of comic book shops for hours just to get badges.
8896000	8901000	I made a typo, and I typed Anime Expo badge line, and it got the same thing. Imagine that.
8901000	8903000	No, no, he's on the right track.
8903000	8905000	Actually, it's more or less the same damn thing.
8905000	8909000	No, this guy's on the right track, I concur, because the same thing happened at Fanime.
8909000	8911000	It was something called Line Con.
8911000	8912000	2013.
8912000	8916000	2013, hence the word 13. Unlucky number right there. It was really bad.
8916000	8920000	People were in line for 7 to 8 hours. They were just so mad.
8920000	8924000	They were coming into the game room they were running, and they were like,
8924000	8926000	So, did I make it to this? So, did I make it to that?
8926000	8930000	I'm so sorry, but this just passed about an hour ago, and they were so pissed off
8930000	8936000	that it created more tension and more sweaty bodies that made much more odor than there should be.
8936000	8937000	It's like a fucking skunk.
8937000	8939000	Exactly. Made my level...
8939000	8941000	Did you get sprayed?
8941000	8945000	I think I drenched myself in an entire bottle of Febreze.
8945000	8950000	It was just a big bathtub. I just had to get out of that room after a while.
8950000	8954000	You know how they have those spray bottles with water and a fan on it?
8954000	8957000	You just put Febreze in there instead.
8957000	8959000	See, but here's the thing.
8959000	8964000	You can't do the Febreze because there are people that are actually literally allergic to some of those chemicals.
8964000	8967000	You have a problem and a lawsuit on your hands.
8967000	8969000	That is true.
8969000	8973000	The list of line cons. Anime Boston 2008.
8973000	8976000	I was there for that!
8976000	8978000	Oh, there you go.
8978000	8980000	But here's the thing. Here's the thing, though.
8980000	8984000	I was working the dealer's room, so I had no idea what was going on.
8984000	8987000	So I came out there, and I was like, Holy shit.
8987000	8996000	And if you go to Anime Boston's forums for 2008, someone wrote a parody of Still Alive to Anime Boston Still In Line.
8996000	8999000	Well, it's okay if they sue you anyways.
8999000	9003000	You can always settle for just an extra hour in the ball pit, so it's okay.
9003000	9007000	Oh yeah, my convention is getting a ball pit just for that.
9007000	9012000	We've kind of fell off the beaten path here, but here's the thing.
9012000	9016000	There are a bunch of volunteers, and I salute them.
9016000	9024000	They are handing out free deodorant at New York Comic Con that says New York Comic Con on it.
9024000	9026000	Sponsored by deodorant.
9026000	9028000	As long as it's not Axe.
9028000	9034000	It looks like it's actually, you know, the dry roll ain't no spray.
9034000	9036000	Wow.
9036000	9042000	And you know someone's gonna be offended by this, and to that I say, well that person must stink the holy high hell.
9042000	9046000	Oh yes, I had my fair share of smelly. Oh gosh.
9046000	9051000	Oh my gosh, it's just like, just stand under some hot water at least, if nothing else.
9052000	9057000	Okay, well, geez Rama, thank you for stinking up the show, I appreciate it.
9057000	9064000	I stunk it up in a positive way, at least I'm not as bad as some of those people who are selling Smash Brothers codes for 50 bucks a week.
9064000	9066000	Oh no.
9066000	9068000	Now that stinks.
9068000	9078000	It does stink, but you know what, I wouldn't do it because not for nothing, like almost everybody here in the chat room and in the studio, we all got bills to pay.
9078000	9083000	That's right, we got bills to pay, we got, you know, things to buy from the store, like deodorant.
9083000	9085000	Alright, take care my friend.
9085000	9090000	Are you kidding me? Those people won't even think about buying that, they're too busy spending all their money in the dealer's room.
9090000	9093000	Alright, I gotta let you go buddy so we can get more calls.
9093000	9094000	Alright.
9094000	9095000	Alright, later, bye.
9095000	9097000	For the record, my husband uses Axe, so.
9097000	9100000	I do too, and you've never said anything about it, so you know what.
9100000	9102000	You just need the GameCube and the...
9102000	9104000	It's the guys who bathe themselves in the spray.
9104000	9105000	I don't bathe myself in it.
9105000	9106000	That's just gross.
9106000	9107000	Alright, let's get to another call.
9107000	9109000	Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio, who's this?
9109000	9110000	Legend of Zaku here.
9110000	9112000	Hey Zaku, how you doing?
9112000	9123000	Oh, not much, just recovering from any possible jet lag incurred as a result of coming back from Tokyo after spending ten days there the past couple of weeks.
9123000	9125000	Welcome back!
9125000	9127000	Okay, Nasai.
9127000	9130000	Did anybody smell on the plane?
9130000	9143000	I mean, it was just like, all I know is that aside from a minor bout of motion sickness heading there from Vancouver, the flight back was a lot easier for me to sleep on.
9143000	9146000	I freaking love Vancouver, but we'll get into that another time.
9146000	9149000	How was Tokyo? What'd you see there?
9150000	9160000	Pretty much the usual spiel of stuff, and not to mention all the arcades in and around the areas, even close to where we were staying.
9160000	9172000	Since let's just say that, in a nutshell, it's just vending machines, packed subway cars, fancy arcades, UFO catcher spoils.
9172000	9175000	Case in point, one of these that I managed to win at the UFO catcher.
9175000	9178000	What is that? A model initial D car or something like that?
9178000	9180000	Oh, it's an actual RC.
9180000	9182000	Oh my god.
9182000	9185000	Yup, an actual RC car that I wanted the UFO catcher.
9185000	9188000	Wow, they give away some pretty nice stuff in those things.
9188000	9191000	Now, how much did you have to burn to get that? Alright, don't answer that.
9191000	9195000	It was only a hundred, it was on my first try, a hundred yen.
9195000	9197000	Wow, alright.
9197000	9203000	So, tell us about, okay, so you've been big into arcades over here in the US and you've kind of seen them rise and fall.
9203000	9208000	What kind of struck you as different with the Japanese arcades versus US arcades?
9208000	9214000	Holy hell, just the fact that the rhythm gaming scene is still thriving there.
9214000	9220000	And not to mention the fact that even other types of arcade games, like the Gundam Pod one,
9220000	9231000	where you sit in this huge pod-like cabinet where you open the door and you sit on a cockpit and you move controls just to play around.
9231000	9237000	And more importantly, 2DX machines are just like at least more than one in every single arcade.
9237000	9241000	And it's all ordered and you can smoke in the arcades.
9241000	9243000	What? Oh my god, that can't be...
9243000	9247000	Yes, there are smoking sections in the arcades in Tokyo.
9247000	9249000	That's like casino status right there.
9249000	9251000	I know, I haven't seen smoke in the arcades.
9251000	9253000	Yeah, it's exactly like casino status. Same thing with the pachinko parlors.
9253000	9257000	Oh yeah, the pachinko machines, that's right. I was going to ask about that.
9257000	9260000	Yeah, I tried, but it's like...
9260000	9266000	Where I was staying at, it was really hard to understand how to actually put money to get the actual balls.
9266000	9274000	I mean, I played it before in the past, but it was too much of a hassle, so I just like bailed and went to the nearest adores,
9274000	9280000	which is one of the arcades, chain of arcades there, aside from Taito Game Station or the Sega Club.
9280000	9285000	So yeah, I was pretty much in and about all the major places, including but not limited to Akihabara.
9285000	9289000	Were you there for the Xbox One launch then?
9289000	9294000	I think I actually, yeah, I was there during that time, like the day of the launch,
9294000	9299000	I was actually in Shinjuku, me and my girlfriend were in Shinjuku and Big Camera,
9299000	9305000	one of the big malls, you know, one of the big chain stores there.
9305000	9309000	And yes, they were like Xbox One folks handing out flyers.
9309000	9316000	It was pretty depressing because there was only like one or two people playing demos in there.
9316000	9323000	Yeah, it was that bad. I mean, everything else like PS4s and whatnot were selling pretty well,
9323000	9328000	especially the PS3 games that I managed to grab. Oh shit, it's all the way.
9328000	9332000	Wait, were you there for the launch of Smash Brothers then?
9332000	9334000	Because that just launched on what, Friday?
9334000	9340000	No, no, no, I actually came actually flew back on Friday. So I was actually, I wasn't there.
9340000	9346000	I was close. I was seeing those ads on the subways heading there, you know, when I was,
9346000	9351000	you know, when I was out there, I was seeing all those subway ads for Smash Brothers all over the place.
9351000	9356000	But no, it was by the time I left, it pretty much launched.
9356000	9360000	So other than that, it's just the usual, the usual stuff.
9360000	9364000	The Gundam statue, the Imperial Palace, Mount Fuji.
9364000	9368000	Oh, one of these days, one of these days I need to get over there.
9368000	9374000	Did you do like a touristy tour type of thing or were you there visiting like some of these relatives?
9374000	9382000	No, we stayed in a hotel, but most of it was just me and my girl kicking around in the subways.
9382000	9387000	Except for the one day that we did like a tour up to the Ghibli Museum
9387000	9393000	and then a full day tour to Mount Fuji, Hokone, the big area, the mountainous areas.
9393000	9395000	Sounds like fun.
9395000	9400000	I know, it was, well, yeah, it was definitely fun, not to mention cheap food, cheap liquor,
9400000	9407000	UFO catchers everywhere, convenience stores, as far as the eye can see, vending machines,
9407000	9413000	especially the same thing they used to get into the subway you can use to get stuff from vending machines
9413000	9419000	and UFO catchers, it's ridiculous. It makes New York look like Atlantic City.
9419000	9423000	Yeah, I heard you can get pretty crazy things in those UFO catchers.
9423000	9430000	Yeah, I mean there were plenty of things, I mean some of them are, like the really good ones with the good prizes are kind of rigged.
9430000	9436000	Like there was one in Shijuku that had like tablets and PS Vita's and 3DS's, but I knew they were rigged.
9436000	9439000	Well, Dave Busters rigs it too, come on.
9439000	9445000	Yeah, but that depends on the actual chain, like most of them, the way you actually win at the UFO catchers,
9445000	9452000	you have to play the foreigner's stick. In other words, if an attendant sees you playing the UFO catchers
9452000	9460000	and you try to, you know, you do your best to try to get the prize out of the, you know, try to get the prize into the chute,
9460000	9467000	and you fail, what they will do is they will try to reset the prize, but they will try to set it up so that way
9467000	9471000	it's very easy for you to just grab it and push it into the chute.
9471000	9477000	Because that, in their minds, that pretty much, you know, that translates into word of mouth.
9477000	9484000	Because then you'll have a good experience and then you'll tell your other friends that you won big at those UFO catchers
9484000	9485000	and they'll multiply.
9485000	9488000	Just like you told us and bragged about your little RC car that you got.
9488000	9494000	No, my girl made out with even more stuff. I was trying to get like the portable battery chargers
9494000	9503000	and all the other, all the other like high-end items, but yeah, I think we spent like one or two hundred,
9503000	9510000	we spent almost the equivalent of one fifty to almost two hundred bucks on UFO catchers alone throughout the entire trip.
9510000	9513000	That sounds like our soccer and crane machines back in the day, but anyway.
9513000	9517000	I didn't spend that much and I got like eight things out of that one at Walmart.
9517000	9523000	Alright. Zaku, I gotta let you go because you're making me jealous more and more by the minute because I've never been to Japan.
9523000	9525000	But take care buddy. Glad you had a good time.
9525000	9526000	Yep.
9526000	9527000	Alright.
9527000	9528000	Yep, I definitely did.
9528000	9529000	Alright, take care.
9529000	9530000	Yeah, like a bandit.
9530000	9531000	Bye.
9531000	9533000	I want to go to Japan.
9533000	9534000	So do I.
9534000	9535000	You never been either?
9535000	9536000	No, never been there.
9536000	9537000	It's not just me.
9537000	9538000	Only in a dream.
9538000	9539000	Only in a dream.
9539000	9543000	I don't know, the culture shock would be so hard though. Like I don't speak a lick of Japanese.
9543000	9546000	I mean, you've heard me do Japanese release dates on this show. I don't speak a lick of it.
9546000	9547000	Oh yeah, mine's horrible too. It's just...
9547000	9549000	Like if a Kumbu JP isn't there to help me out.
9549000	9552000	You'll have too hard of a time finding people who speak English.
9552000	9553000	I guess that's true.
9554000	9555000	But, anyway.
9555000	9556000	Alright, 187...
9556000	9560000	Oh, I shouldn't even bother saying that because it's already lighting up all over again.
9560000	9563000	Let's get back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
9563000	9565000	Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.
9565000	9566000	Hey, Kaijuto. What's up to you, my buddy?
9566000	9568000	I'm going to keep this real quick.
9568000	9569000	Alright.
9569000	9571000	I can't hear anybody. Can you say something again?
9571000	9572000	Yeah, hi. Hello.
9572000	9573000	Alright, there you go.
9573000	9574000	Alright, yeah, I'm going to make this real quick.
9574000	9575000	Sure.
9575000	9580000	The thing about Smash Brothers and the 3DS, I'm getting it for the 3DS and I'm only getting it for the 3DS.
9580000	9583000	I don't know what people are complaining about with the little screen.
9583000	9590000	I've been playing Jump Ultimate Stars for god knows how long and that was basically Smash Brothers before we got Smash Brothers.
9590000	9594000	It was for the original DS and I still play it to this day.
9594000	9600000	I remember back in the day when the DS came out, everybody was crying for a Smash Brothers port.
9600000	9604000	Now we got it and now you have people complaining about something as lousy as a screen.
9604000	9609000	Every week, Nintendo is surprising me with the stuff that they're doing.
9609000	9615000	Like I said last week, it sounds like they're listening to the fans and they're giving us what we asked for and I appreciate that.
9615000	9617000	That's all I have to say.
9617000	9620000	I didn't play any of that stuff.
9620000	9625000	Here's the thing, I didn't think the Smash demo was terrible by any means.
9625000	9629000	It does get a little crazy when things zoom out.
9629000	9635000	All that crap aside, there really isn't a lot of differentiation between the 3DS and the Wii U version.
9636000	9639000	I'm not seeing the urgency to get both.
9639000	9643000	I'm kind of like, I'll just get the Wii U version that better fits my lifestyle.
9643000	9646000	I happen to own a Wii U anyway for other stuff.
9646000	9651000	Unless I have a bunch of friends that are going to have the 3DS version, I'm not really feeling that urgency.
9651000	9656000	I can wait for the Wii U version. It's only going to be another 6 weeks.
9656000	9660000	For me, if I did have a Wii U, I don't have a Wii U.
9660000	9663000	If I did, I would actually get two copies of the game.
9663000	9667000	The main reason why is because I do like to play multiplayer with friends.
9667000	9674000	From what I know from past experiences with Nintendo handhelds, that can get very expensive.
9674000	9680000	If you actually have friends who don't actually have the system, you would need to let them borrow one of your 3DSes.
9680000	9684000	You would also have to buy an extra cartridge, which I've done before in the past.
9684000	9694000	I've actually had multiple cartridges so that if I had someone over, we could play multiplayer on a 3DS game that you can't play anywhere else.
9694000	9698000	Just for that reason alone, I would get it for the Wii U.
9698000	9702000	I know that I can just play local multiplayer and everybody around the television, and that's about it.
9702000	9706000	But it's not for screen size. It's just basically so I'm not broke.
9706000	9712000	Will Smash Brothers not have the whole, you can beam a limited copy of the game to somebody else?
9712000	9717000	Yeah, but that's always crap. You're probably going to be playing as, what was the thing with the Mario Kart?
9717000	9720000	You play like a little ghost dude, who's that guy?
9720000	9721000	Yeah, that's right.
9721000	9724000	It wasn't that bad though, considering the other person...
9724000	9725000	No, it sucked.
9725000	9729000	That was fun because it was like, you could still join in the game and such.
9729000	9735000	Yeah, but your cars always sucked. Everything was default. You're just like a default character.
9736000	9743000	The DS version was kind of broken, because once you figure out snaking, it's impossible to catch up on anybody.
9743000	9744000	True.
9744000	9751000	I played someone on DS, and they had the robot. What is it, Robbie the Robot? And they did that snake crapping.
9751000	9752000	Oh yeah, that's right.
9752000	9754000	Yeah, but I gotta go.
9754000	9757000	Alright, I appreciate the perspective, Kaijuto. Enjoy the game.
9757000	9758000	Alright, later.
9758000	9761000	I should have asked if you had the demo.
9762000	9770000	Okay, if you guys want to code this one, but I was more like, if he's already had a chance to kind of sample it and see if it's what he's hoping for.
9770000	9774000	But yeah, I mean, I forgot about that Jump Ultimate Stars, which I actually have played.
9774000	9777000	But for me, it was one of those things where I was just like, hee hee, this is funny.
9777000	9782000	I wasn't feeling the urgency to buy it or whatever, but that's cool.
9782000	9790000	I've been getting some of the feedback on the new Smash Brothers, since some people have been testing out the combinations and so forth to try and get better at the game.
9790000	9797000	And people, of course, I can understand what he was saying, Kaijuto was saying about the critics and stuff, but him just focusing on this game.
9797000	9801000	And saying because people have done this from the past since the first game and ground up.
9801000	9805000	And just experimenting on them and all that stuff to see how the differences are.
9805000	9812000	Because some say it's toned down or it's gotten to a point where it felt like it went back to the first game, it's felt.
9812000	9814000	That's what some people say that it feels.
9814000	9815000	Interesting.
9815000	9820000	Alright, we have one more call coming in. I guess this will probably be it for tonight and then we'll wrap up.
9820000	9822000	Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio. Who's this?
9822000	9823000	Hey, this is Agdeft.
9823000	9826000	Hey, Agdeft. Thanks again for that code. You rock.
9826000	9833000	Well, I feel like a dealer now because last week, there was a factory and now the Smash Brothers code.
9833000	9840000	Wow, Agdeft, you're literally ruining my life. Well, I gotta let you go. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, buddy?
9841000	9846000	Well, I just wanted to add to Caillou's call right now.
9846000	9853000	Especially because the string complaints people are having are pretty legit complaints.
9853000	9856000	I have played the demo, of course.
9856000	9863000	And I don't have that problem that much, but it's still a problem. I can see it.
9864000	9876000	And I was talking to Bobby on this earlier on his show that with all the action, what's happening on the screen, especially with four players, even with three players, it gets a real frenetic.
9876000	9884000	And it's kind of hard to follow where you are or to locate where your character is.
9884000	9887000	Do you have an XL or do you have an original DS?
9887000	9888000	I have an XL.
9888000	9899000	See, Bobby's rocking the original 3DS and I can't imagine how that's gotta look. I mean, I kind of want to see it now. I don't even know anybody that has an original 3DS.
9899000	9908000	But I can imagine it's gotta get tricky when it's three and four people all zoomed out. I can see where that gets really annoying.
9908000	9916000	Yeah, and I have played on a normal DS. Not the Smash Brothers demo, but I have played other games on a normal DS, like the other of them.
9916000	9931000	And I look at the screen and I'm like, oh my god, this is really small. Even looking at the original DS screen that's even smaller, I really don't know how people are gonna play at least comfortably with multiple people.
9931000	9941000	Maybe one person or another person. Yeah, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay. But playing with four or three, yeah, it's gonna be really hard to see.
9941000	9947000	Bobby actually chimes in on that too in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying the screen size complaints are definitely a personal problem.
9947000	9954000	For some people, it's okay. For others, like me, it's not. So, you know, a lot of it is personal preference. Diego wanted to jump in with something too here.
9954000	9962000	Yeah, I believe they were also discussing about making a new XL with the C-Stick on it. I think specifically for this game as well, I believe.
9962000	9971000	Well, is that that new 3DS? That's a whole other thing because, you know, now they're talking about games that will only be playable on that.
9971000	9982000	And then I guess the thing with Smash Brothers, the thing I was hearing is that you can't post to Miiverse in Smash Brothers because the system can't freaking handle it unless you have a new 3DS which does have the processing power to be able to do it.
9982000	9984000	Yeah, that's right. Interesting, huh?
9985000	10002000	Yeah, and speaking of the new 3DS, it seems like it's going to be released for Smash Brothers especially because it definitely serves a lot of the people's complaints about the C-Stick, maybe the screen.
10002000	10013000	But I don't think that much because if I remember correctly, the screen is going to be the same size for both bottles, the normal and the XL.
10013000	10014000	I'll remember.
10014000	10023000	I'm wondering how that C-Stick actually feels because it looks really tiny and it doesn't look like, remember with the little analog sticks they have on the PSP and everyone fucking hated them?
10023000	10031000	It's still so weird to me that Nintendo, like, you know, Nintendo's got to know how rabid their fanbase is and it's like, it's no freaking secret.
10031000	10037000	Japan's getting a new 3DS. Like, why won't they comment more about, like, are they going to do it or not for America?
10037000	10044000	Like, even if they're just kind of like, oh, well, we're evaluating the market. At least I'd like to hear something like that.
10044000	10051000	They're keeping, they're definitely their fanbase because they don't want to, fans do not want to see that controller change, especially for the Wii U.
10051000	10053000	That's why they put in the adaption for the GameCube controller.
10053000	10065000	Not only that, I was going to say, not only that, but they also, you know, they just put out or announced a bunch of exclusive new 3DS systems that they're going to have available that they obviously want to sell.
10065000	10066000	Oh, right.
10066000	10072000	Also, they're not going to say, oh, hey, save your money because a new 3DS is coming. They don't want to tell anybody that.
10072000	10075000	They want you to buy that system and they go, oh, I want that system, too.
10075000	10079000	And I really want the NES one, but GameStop's exclusive.
10079000	10081000	Oh, yeah, I saw that one, too.
10081000	10088000	It's a picture of a Nintendo controller on the top part of the DS. Like, when they did that Game Boy, it was, what, the Advance SP?
10088000	10089000	Yeah, the Advance SP.
10089000	10091000	That one was rad because you opened it up and it looked like an NES one.
10091000	10092000	Yeah, the flip one.
10092000	10097000	Yeah, that one was cool, but this one doesn't look that inspiring, but I don't know.
10097000	10102000	Yeah, and he was going off the one about the NES one coming out next month as well.
10102000	10104000	That's pretty cool as well. Like, really retro.
10104000	10106000	Anyway.
10106000	10109000	All right, well, Act F, any other thoughts before I let you go?
10109000	10114000	And did you talk about how the 3DS is going to function as a control for Snatch Brothers?
10114000	10119000	It came up briefly when we were talking about the demo, but what are your thoughts on all that?
10119000	10132000	I think it's pretty cool. Using a 3DS controller, especially, it's something that should be done more frequently for especially games that aren't on both consoles.
10132000	10139000	It's almost like I suggested that on this show a few months ago. Who knew?
10139000	10150000	It's almost like it should be something that's just built into the fucking system that should be just a controller that can be used for any game and not just, you know, this one particular game.
10150000	10154000	All right, Act F, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call, buddy.
10154000	10156000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10156000	10159000	All right, have fun smashing. All right, later.
10159000	10165000	All right, and I don't think I really asked him how he liked the demo, but I guess there's always next week.
10165000	10178000	All right, I am going to close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through, please feel free to tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, or you can always send us an e-mail as well, participate at orangelaunchradio.com.
10178000	10186000	Speaking of Twitter, I didn't see it light up a whole lot this week, although I did get a little bit more taunting about the whole Mass Effect on Wii U thing.
10186000	10197000	Just so you guys know, I bought my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3 last week live during the show because I now own it on four different platforms, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and now Wii U.
10197000	10205000	And so, of course, everybody's giving me shit about it because it's like, dude, you bought the same game four times, and I'm just like, you know what, you don't know me or my life.
10206000	10217000	Pika Uno tweeted saying, just wanted to chime in with the support. I, too, would buy Mass Effect Trilogy if I had the money, the Wii U, and less cents.
10217000	10222000	I'm not sure that was totally a support, but thank you.
10222000	10233000	Let's see, Dartitsuya said, I want to give a plug to Construct 2. It's a game programming tool for those that can't get the hang of Unity. Great for 2D retro games.
10233000	10239000	Oh, well, programming for dummies sounds right up my alley, so I'll have to check that out. Construct 2, I'll check that out.
10239000	10242000	Loki, any last minute stories for us tonight?
10242000	10244000	Uh, no.
10244000	10245000	No? Alright.
10245000	10246000	I don't have anything important.
10246000	10248000	Dartitsuya, how you doing?
10248000	10249000	I'm talking to Marissa.
10249000	10250000	Hi, Marissa!
10250000	10252000	Marissa's in chat, and I love her to death.
10252000	10258000	I love her to death, too. Well, I mean, I wouldn't want her to die. I just love her a lot.
10258000	10266000	I love her with the crushing force of a thousand black holes.
10266000	10271000	Wow, you should write, like, Hallmark greeting cards.
10271000	10276000	I love you with the force of a thousand crushing black holes.
10276000	10279000	And then I'll put the formula inside.
10279000	10283000	Then there's a picture of a kitten. Alright.
10283000	10287000	Anyhow, that is going to do it, then, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10287000	10293000	Hey, guys, thanks so much for visiting the show again this week. I appreciate you guys stopping by. Feel free to come by anytime.
10293000	10295000	Definitely. Our pleasure.
10295000	10308000	Be sure to throw out the plugs. How do we find out more? If I'm in the Northern California, Northern Nevada region, probably Portland at some point, region where you guys travel, how can I keep tabs on you guys?
10308000	10315000	We have Facebook, Twitter, official website, obviously.
10315000	10317000	And where would that website be?
10317000	10321000	tbagger.org.
10321000	10328000	Alright, sounds good. Thank you guys very much for being here. Diego, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10328000	10334000	Actually, not exactly. No, not really. Nothing coming to mind at the moment.
10334000	10336000	Just a very, very zen...
10336000	10340000	Well, besides going back to the Congo, just try and keep clean.
10340000	10343000	Yeah, wash your ass, for God's sake.
10343000	10347000	Please do. And don't floss it with things that need to be played on.
10347000	10352000	Alright. Jonas, your final thought for our listeners tonight?
10352000	10359000	Oh, yeah, I have a couple of Smash codes, but not for Smash Brothers game.
10359000	10361000	Shut up. Alright.
10361000	10365000	You're not welcome here anymore, you tease. Alright, I'm just kidding.
10365000	10367000	Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10367000	10376000	You just need to make a video that says Smash codes, and you write down codes, like, you know, the Konami code, and you take a hammer and smash it.
10376000	10385000	My final thought is, you are all super dumb right now. Just saying, I don't often feel like the smartest person in the room, but right now, I'm getting close.
10385000	10388000	Alright, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
10388000	10391000	Good riddance to bad rubbish on my Facebook page.
10391000	10397000	Oh, Snapples. This sounds like some drums. Some drums.
10397000	10407000	I just have a particular issue with people who only pick and choose, quote, facts to believe, and don't accept that, yes, there may be good, but there are also bad.
10407000	10410000	Understanding both sides of this is what makes an intelligent person.
10410000	10413000	Wait, people think differently than I do?
10413000	10420000	Exactly, that's why one version of the soundtrack for Sonic is better than the other version, I'm telling you.
10420000	10424000	Oh no, did you drop Bobby as a friend, are things gonna get awkward?
10424000	10427000	No, I don't give a shit which version he likes.
10427000	10429000	He can be wrong if he wants.
10429000	10439000	And isn't that how we should all get along? If you want to like the wrong version of Sonic, then you know what, you go right on ahead, that's your right, but you are wrong in that right.
10439000	10441000	I'll just play some Sonic 3D World.
10441000	10451000	I'm just gonna put it this way, if you can't see the flaws in the thing that you are supporting, then you can't be a true supporter of it. You have to know the flaws to be able to know what to make changes in.
10451000	10455000	So what are the flaws in Orange Lounge Radio?
10455000	10458000	Me not having a taco.
10458000	10460000	I eat all the tacos.
10460000	10464000	And on that note, that's gonna do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
10464000	10477000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into the program and spending time with us. Hey, if you like the show, you know what we ask, please tell a friend or three or fifteen about our little program and help spread the word, because we don't have like a million dollar magazine or website backing us.
10477000	10482000	All we have are our big ass mouths, and your big ass mouths, helping spread the word of the show.
10482000	10495000	Thanks a lot. Be nice to each other when you're playing games online. Remember, there are human beings on the other side, and for the love of God, do not swat people, or Supernanny will spank you in the town square.
10495000	10499000	Think on that for a little while. Until next week, good night.
