Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Blizzard Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.800
This week, two massively multiplayer experiences are fading away.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.480
Sony announced that PlayStation Home will be shut down next year, and Blizzard revealed

00:19.480 --> 00:22.000
that their next MMO, Codename Titan, is no more.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.960
The news is not all bad, and we'll tell you about it right now on the show, where every

00:24.960 --> 00:27.500
gamer has a voice.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.500
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.500 --> 00:34.980
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.980 --> 00:36.340
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.340 --> 00:43.320
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, September the 28th, 2014, with episode

00:43.320 --> 00:48.380
number 569 of our program.

00:48.380 --> 00:55.740
That is right, it has been 500 shows since the infamous episode 69, where Techmaster

00:55.740 --> 01:01.700
Loki right over there did karaoke with Karaoke Revolution and sang, in fact I just got a

01:01.700 --> 01:09.460
tweet about this earlier this week, where somebody said, I cannot listen to Gloria Gaynor

01:09.460 --> 01:10.460
did that song right?

01:10.460 --> 01:11.460
I'm Coming Out.

01:11.460 --> 01:14.900
I cannot hear that song anymore without, was it Donna Summer, I don't even know.

01:14.900 --> 01:20.220
I cannot hear that, thank you DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.220 --> 01:25.020
I cannot hear that song anymore without hearing Loki actually singing the changed lyrics in

01:25.020 --> 01:26.020
my head.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.020
I'm sorry.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.740
You've ruined music forever.

01:28.740 --> 01:35.980
Yes, I think as soon as I open my mouth to sing that song against my will, yeah.

01:35.980 --> 01:43.700
Alright so what, what'd I do?

01:43.700 --> 01:49.540
If we're tangled, can I be Flynn Rider, alright, and I don't know why they're not hearing you

01:49.540 --> 01:50.540
for some reason.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.540
Are you?

01:51.540 --> 01:52.540
How about now?

01:52.540 --> 01:54.020
Yeah, you weren't talking into it I don't think.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.020
Maybe.

01:55.020 --> 01:57.700
Alright, well, you know it is a live program.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.500
We have all those live problems.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.420
So of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

02:02.420 --> 02:03.420
Eastern.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.620
The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:07.620 --> 02:12.700
My name is Rob Roberts and as introduced a moment ago, she is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.700
Yep.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.220
And he is Tech Master Loki.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.540
Yep.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.940
Welcome back to the show by the way DarkSakura.

02:17.940 --> 02:18.940
Thank you.

02:18.940 --> 02:23.340
I know you've been extremely busy with all your cubes and techs type of things that you

02:23.340 --> 02:24.380
do.

02:24.380 --> 02:27.020
So hopefully things are calming down a slight bit for you.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.020
No, they're not.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.020
They're not at all.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.020
But you're here.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.020
But I'm here.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.180
Well, I had also worked like 37 hours and three days right before that and then had

02:36.180 --> 02:38.220
worked that morning.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.660
Came home, passed out, woke up with a raging headache and no voice.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.340
So it's a bummer because you missed, you missed a fun show last week.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.520
I don't know if you had a chance to hear it yet, but we had the general manager, Mike

02:48.520 --> 02:50.100
from Jackbox Games was here.

02:50.100 --> 02:55.340
It was kind of a fun little party game reflection episode with you don't know Jack and Fibbage

02:55.340 --> 02:56.340
and all that stuff.

02:56.340 --> 02:57.340
It was a good time.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.340
As they say, c'est la mort.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.340
I know it happens.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.340
It happens.

03:00.340 --> 03:02.980
Uh, but you, well, we have some, we have at least one more interview coming up.

03:02.980 --> 03:05.100
I'm trying to get a couple others for the end of the year.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.100
So don't, don't get sick anymore DarkSakura cause you don't know what you're going to

03:08.100 --> 03:09.100
miss.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.100
Okay.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.260
But, but, but, but you know what?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.260
But what?

03:13.260 --> 03:14.860
They gave us pizza at work and it was awesome.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.860
I don't know.

03:15.860 --> 03:16.860
Pizza.

03:16.860 --> 03:17.860
Pizza.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.860
Sorry.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.860
Pizza.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.540
Mr. Loki, how have you been?

03:21.540 --> 03:23.060
I've been okay.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.060
Yeah.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.540
So I'm trying to break an addiction.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.540
Okay.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.620
I know where, I know where we get into, how is it down the pipe?

03:30.620 --> 03:33.340
I know we're getting to how is your gaming week a little later in the show, but this

03:33.340 --> 03:34.340
is too good.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.340
You have to tell us about your latest addiction.

03:36.340 --> 03:39.180
Oh, it was just, I'm pretty, I think I'm over it.

03:39.180 --> 03:42.060
I even cheated just to try to get it over with quicker.

03:42.060 --> 03:48.060
But um, I, I unfortunately ran across one of the random articles that were floating

03:48.060 --> 03:53.140
around on a bunch of different websites talking about a game called clicker heroes sitting

03:53.140 --> 03:54.140
at work.

03:54.140 --> 03:56.140
You know, this is at the point they've already shut down our system.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.420
I literally can't do anything.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.940
I'm like, I'm going to sit here and program on my computer.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.940
Oh wait, what's this article clicker here is okay.

04:02.940 --> 04:03.940
I'll play this for a second.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.580
Oh, this is kind of like cookie clicker.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.060
And three hours later that was that.

04:09.060 --> 04:15.380
And then I come home like, okay, that was so that was fun, but I'm not gonna play here.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.380
Click click click click.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.100
It's like, it's like, God damn it.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.700
No, I'll play it for another five minutes.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.700
And yeah.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.460
And they were like, see, cause the game plays itself when you're not playing it.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.460
Yeah.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.740
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check in and see how much my clicking's going when

04:29.740 --> 04:31.420
I'm not there with my auto clicks.

04:31.420 --> 04:32.420
Yeah.

04:32.420 --> 04:33.420
That cookie clicker shit's addicting.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.020
And it really blows my mind that they don't have an official iPhone app.

04:37.020 --> 04:40.720
I mean there's like 10,000 knockoffs in the store and I'm sure this is the same thing

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
on Android.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.740
I just happened to be a iPhone user myself.

04:44.420 --> 04:49.140
So I see that there's like 10,000 of these cookie clicker clones and, and, and then all

04:49.140 --> 04:50.140
this other crap too.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.900
Like the one that I've played will advertise for sushi clicker, which you just tap on.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.220
It's the same fucking thing, but it's just sushi.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.420
And then like all this other lame crap too.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.780
This one's a little bit different because you're not just like tapping to like generate

05:03.780 --> 05:04.780
stuff.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.900
You're basically killing monsters.

05:05.900 --> 05:09.820
And so each monster has certain HP and every five levels you get a boss monster that you

05:09.820 --> 05:11.380
have to kill in a certain timeframe.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.400
If you're not, you don't have enough DPS going into it.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.380
You have to almost sounds like theater them except theater them set to music.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.380
Yeah.

05:20.380 --> 05:25.220
Uh, and so if you don't have enough, um, you know, DPS and damage with your clicks and

05:25.220 --> 05:27.540
stuff, you have to kind of grind a little bit.

05:27.540 --> 05:31.060
But um, you know, the game will play itself when you're not playing it.

05:31.060 --> 05:36.100
And um, yeah, and they just get kind of addicting, I guess.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.060
Going to some of our comments in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:39.060 --> 05:44.500
Ssj100matt says, I know people who have laptops solely dedicated to cookie clicker, just constantly

05:44.500 --> 05:45.500
running.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.060
Well, see this, you don't even have to have it constantly running.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.020
You can save your game if you want.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.940
And then when you don't want to play it, you just close it and forget about it and come

05:51.940 --> 05:52.940
back like later on.

05:52.940 --> 05:56.820
And cookie clicker did the same thing where even if you're not there, the auto click still

05:56.820 --> 05:57.820
clicks for you.

05:57.820 --> 05:58.820
I thought that was the thing.

05:58.820 --> 05:59.820
Oh, I don't know.

05:59.820 --> 06:00.820
I don't know.

06:00.820 --> 06:01.820
Anyway.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.720
Uh, and then an anonymous chatter in our chat room says, I'm surprised Loki isn't addicted

06:03.720 --> 06:06.220
to all those weird clash of clan esque games.

06:06.220 --> 06:11.300
No, I keep seeing the stupid advertisements on like my Reddit app on my phone and stuff.

06:11.300 --> 06:15.780
And uh, I was showing my son, uh, angry birds today or not angry birds, uh, flappy bird

06:15.780 --> 06:19.260
because he thought it was funny to tap the button once and watch the bird head plant

06:19.260 --> 06:20.260
into the ground.

06:20.260 --> 06:23.260
So he just did that like for about five minutes.

06:23.260 --> 06:28.620
But uh, yeah, it just keeps seeing the advertisements for the clash of clans things and not, there

06:28.620 --> 06:35.980
was like, was I was picking him up from, um, Oh God, from, uh, his like, uh, my gym thing.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.540
It's like kind of this thing where they go and play and stuff.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.660
But the people that were there, like the people that watch the kids and stuff we're talking

06:41.660 --> 06:42.660
about is it?

06:42.660 --> 06:43.660
Yeah.

06:43.660 --> 06:44.660
I'm a total gamers.

06:44.660 --> 06:48.060
Like my clans doing this stuff and I'm like thinking, Oh, you've like play call of duty

06:48.060 --> 06:49.060
or something.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.500
You know, I'll play clash of clan.

06:50.500 --> 06:54.900
What's the, all the, all the ads I see for that fricking game, it kind of actually turns

06:54.900 --> 06:55.900
me off.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.900
I don't know.

06:56.900 --> 07:00.460
It's like the same reason I don't watch game of thrones or breaking bad or whatever.

07:00.460 --> 07:05.860
Other TV show gets super hyped up because everybody always talks nonstop about how amazing

07:05.860 --> 07:06.860
these programs are.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.860
And it just, I don't know.

07:07.860 --> 07:12.980
It's just, it's that inherent two year old in me that just goes like, well then no, no.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.220
Like every time I've tried, every time anyone said, this show is awesome.

07:16.220 --> 07:17.220
This is awesome.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.220
And I've sat down to watch it.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.220
I've been like bored now.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.220
Yeah.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.400
Except for supernatural.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.640
And then I don't know why, but I start, you don't know what you've done.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.640
What did tiger call it?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.340
You just ruined so much productivity.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.700
Oh, somebody asked in the chat, what game is it?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.700
And tiger call linked at clicker heroes.com.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.860
Oh no, I said it.

07:34.860 --> 07:35.860
Save yourself.

07:35.860 --> 07:36.860
Just don't do it.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.000
Don't click on it.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.900
Orange lounge radio, ruining lives, ruining lives.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.020
Uh, Brad from pod culture says, doctor who?

07:45.020 --> 07:49.020
That is one of the shows that despite all the hype, I will still have to bring myself

07:49.020 --> 07:50.020
to watch at some point.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.300
Cause I did watch a little bit of it and I did enjoy it.

07:52.300 --> 07:57.300
I've seen some ninth doctor, but I've been watching it since I was four.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.700
Have you watched a lot of the new ones though?

07:58.700 --> 08:00.860
I didn't think you were on top of the new ones.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.740
I just haven't been watching this season yet.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.020
Just because I've been too busy and haven't had time, but that's okay.

08:06.020 --> 08:09.940
Cause that means you can binge watch it later if I feel like it and bringing bad is actually

08:09.940 --> 08:10.940
supposed to be pretty good.

08:10.940 --> 08:14.440
I've only watched the first couple of seasons, but it wasn't that great.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.160
The first couple of seasons by here gets really good and there's only a finite amount of shows.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.160
So when you're done, you're done.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.180
I mean, it's not like game of thrones, which is still has new several seasons coming or

08:23.180 --> 08:26.360
you know, a doctor who breaking bad bored the fuck out of me.

08:26.360 --> 08:31.100
I try not to watch new shows because then they get canceled and I get really pissed

08:31.100 --> 08:35.180
off that I invested myself into these shows that end on these cliffhangers.

08:35.180 --> 08:40.620
But because I like Batman, I did watch Gotham this week, which for me is like a really big

08:40.620 --> 08:43.620
deal that I sat down and I watched a TV drama.

08:43.620 --> 08:47.180
I never do that, but I did watch Gotham this week and it was, there were things I liked

08:47.180 --> 08:50.940
and things I didn't like, you know, I didn't, I didn't hate it as much as a lot of people

08:50.940 --> 08:56.900
on Twitter sure seem to, but it had some issues including 5,000 cameos that didn't need to

08:56.900 --> 08:59.940
all be in the first 30 minutes of the show.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.100
But okay, it's a pilot, it's trying to get people in, let's see what happens in the next

09:04.100 --> 09:05.100
week or whatever.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.340
But anyway, we're not here to talk about TV, we're here to talk about video games.

09:08.340 --> 09:12.360
So let's start off with a kickoff topic and then we'll talk about our gaming weeks.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.140
This week's kickoff topic, auto invoke a lot of memories.

09:16.140 --> 09:22.180
We like walking down memory lane for our kickoff topic and believe it or not, we're celebrating

09:22.180 --> 09:28.620
this week a gaming company that turned 125 years old.

09:28.620 --> 09:35.340
That's right, Nintendo is the company that was founded September 23, 1889 by Fuzajiro

09:35.340 --> 09:36.340
Yamauchi.

09:36.340 --> 09:43.060
Nintendo, of course, they haven't been making game consoles since 1889, but similar, you

09:43.060 --> 09:48.220
didn't have game consoles in the 1800s, but you did have playing cards and that is what

09:48.220 --> 09:49.820
Nintendo started with.

09:49.820 --> 09:54.580
They made specifically Hanafuda playing cards and I'm sure if you've read up on Nintendo,

09:54.580 --> 09:56.980
you know this, that that was where their past was.

09:56.980 --> 10:00.660
Or if you were a big Ranma fan, you know what Hanafuda is.

10:00.660 --> 10:05.340
They also did some Disney cards when they had an agreement with Walt Disney because

10:05.340 --> 10:08.420
Disney was also or is also really big in Japan.

10:08.420 --> 10:11.320
So that type of partnership does very well.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.820
Playing card sales started declining in the early 60s and then they eventually, I didn't

10:16.820 --> 10:22.700
even, I did not know this about Nintendo, they had a taxi service and a love hotel chain.

10:22.700 --> 10:23.700
What?

10:23.700 --> 10:24.700
I didn't know that.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.700
Awesome.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.700
That is awesome.

10:26.700 --> 10:27.700
That's good.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
Those are, those.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.700
They still have love hotels in Japan.

10:29.700 --> 10:36.340
But the, but the love hotel is an IP that Nintendo needs to bring to the Wii U.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.340
That should be the name of the next console, the Nintendo love hotel.

10:39.340 --> 10:43.780
Love hotel taxi, playing card.

10:43.780 --> 10:49.100
Anyway, and as we all know, obviously Nintendo eventually got into gaming technology.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.860
You know, they had the game and watches and eventually the Famicom came out and I think

10:52.860 --> 10:54.620
y'all know what happened from there.

10:54.620 --> 10:58.560
So yeah, there it is, 125 years of Nintendo.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.740
I thought I'd go around the room and just ask, you know, what, what is a favorite Nintendo

11:02.740 --> 11:03.740
memory of yours?

11:03.740 --> 11:06.740
Do you have a favorite Nintendo memory?

11:06.740 --> 11:11.300
And for me, I mean, Nintendo is really the reason I'm probably into video games as much

11:11.300 --> 11:12.300
as I am.

11:12.300 --> 11:17.780
Granted, I started on Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 after that, but Nintendo really seemed

11:17.780 --> 11:22.860
to kind of penetrate the marketplace in a way that those other two things hadn't, or

11:22.860 --> 11:28.480
at least pop culture maybe, and that's probably, you know, thanks in big part to games like

11:28.480 --> 11:34.260
Super Mario Brothers and Zelda that were so iconic that created characters that a little

11:34.260 --> 11:38.780
yellow box in adventure on the 2600 just couldn't really do in the same way.

11:38.780 --> 11:43.340
So you know, everybody at school was talking about Zelda and it's like, I had to have a

11:43.340 --> 11:44.940
Nintendo entertainment system.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.180
And so I got good grades.

11:46.180 --> 11:49.620
My mom said she would buy me with Rab, not going to buy you a Nintendo because it'll

11:49.620 --> 11:52.900
get bad grades, but Rab, if you get straight A's, I'll buy you Nintendo.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.780
So I got straight A's and I got Nintendo.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.700
You just convinced her that, hey, then, you know, there's that Donkey Kong teaches math.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.700
You're right.

11:59.700 --> 12:00.700
Yeah.

12:00.700 --> 12:01.700
Right.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.700
Well, she kind of knew that was a line.

12:02.700 --> 12:03.700
It's edutainment.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.820
Keep in mind, I already had a 2600 at this point, a Commodore 64, so she already saw

12:05.820 --> 12:08.120
how games would ruin me.

12:08.120 --> 12:13.840
But I got good grades and got my Nintendo and, you know, it actually, despite all the

12:13.840 --> 12:19.460
bullying that I went through when I was younger, Nintendo was kind of the one thing that sometimes

12:19.500 --> 12:24.180
kept me cool, meaning like even the bullies who would make fun of me in my face when they

12:24.180 --> 12:28.940
would see me alone later would be like, so like, where's the fourth level in the second

12:28.940 --> 12:31.260
quest on Zelda?

12:31.260 --> 12:35.080
And you know, of course you want to be nice so you don't get bullied anymore.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.580
So I'd tell them, do the video game tips and that kind of helped keep me afloat for a little

12:39.580 --> 12:40.860
while in school.

12:40.860 --> 12:45.620
So thanks Nintendo for making the bullying a little less severe in elementary school

12:45.620 --> 12:48.940
through deep knowledge of your games.

12:48.940 --> 12:52.780
Jamie, what's some Nintendo memories from you?

12:52.780 --> 12:57.660
Um, trying to get my mom out of my room so I could play it.

12:57.660 --> 13:01.300
It's like, mom, this is mine.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.340
Mind you, my mom had me at 17.

13:03.340 --> 13:05.500
So imagine the age gap, right?

13:05.500 --> 13:09.820
My mom was a twenties, thirties year old gamer.

13:09.820 --> 13:10.820
She played everything.

13:10.820 --> 13:16.980
So I'd be like, um, mom, I'd like to play my Nintendo now, please leave private time,

13:16.980 --> 13:19.140
mom, private time.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.660
I want to beat this level now.

13:21.660 --> 13:28.460
And so, and a cutthroat, uh, Dr. Mario, would you play Dr. Mario with your mom?

13:28.460 --> 13:30.300
Not with my mom, with my little sister.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.300
Oh really?

13:31.300 --> 13:32.300
Cutthroat.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.460
I was really good at that game.

13:34.460 --> 13:42.700
Meaning the loser gets operated on and I just, I don't know cause it was, it was sort of

13:42.700 --> 13:45.740
like the whole girls don't play games like, yes we do.

13:45.740 --> 13:46.740
Shut up.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.260
So I, I was just, it was my thing.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.460
I, my friends all had one.

13:52.460 --> 13:58.180
I begged and begged and begged and I got one and the rest was history.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.260
I'd already had my Coleco vision though.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.180
I liked my Coleco vision.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.220
Uh, Loki, any Nintendo memories from you?

14:04.220 --> 14:08.580
I just remember when I got mine, um, you know, my parents got it for me.

14:08.580 --> 14:15.900
Everyone else already had one and I had a Coleco vision with like 47 games, which my

14:15.900 --> 14:21.300
dad got and see, here's the things like, he's not really a gamer, he says, yes, but

14:21.300 --> 14:26.140
you were the one that owned a Coleco vision system with all the, all the possible accessories

14:26.140 --> 14:30.580
you can fucking get for this thing and like 40 some games for it.

14:30.580 --> 14:31.580
Yeah.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.580
You weren't a gamer.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.580
Right.

14:33.580 --> 14:37.860
You know, and my grandparents too, they had, uh, like an Atari 2600, I wonder if they still

14:37.860 --> 14:38.860
have that.

14:38.860 --> 14:43.660
Um, so I don't know, maybe they got it when he may have actually purchased that stuff

14:43.660 --> 14:47.060
and, um, you know, they were clearing everything out, you know, back, back during the crash.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.540
But anyways, they got it for me.

14:48.540 --> 14:53.440
Um, I remember it was running, uh, the legend of Zelda when I got it and they had set it

14:53.440 --> 14:54.440
up in my room.

14:54.440 --> 14:59.700
And so first three games I had were the legend of Zelda breakthrough and bubble bubble.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.700
And that was awesome.

15:02.700 --> 15:06.500
It's funny you guys talk about like your parents being involved with the gaming because mine

15:06.500 --> 15:08.420
were so disconnected from gaming.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.780
Like my dad, even though my dad was kind of a nerd, he was always way more of a computer

15:11.780 --> 15:15.780
nerd and I don't think he really understood video games as much and he didn't really like

15:15.780 --> 15:18.180
they got in the way of his TV watching.

15:18.180 --> 15:21.780
So it'd be like, get off the TV so I can watch the news or whatever it is.

15:21.780 --> 15:22.780
Well, that's the thing.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.340
It's like after, you know, you have those systems, like you kind of just, I don't know,

15:26.340 --> 15:28.260
I guess he got out of it or something.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.260
Yeah.

15:29.260 --> 15:33.020
And then my mom, she was always, I don't know, she, she thought it was stupid and the only

15:33.020 --> 15:36.780
stuff she would like to play and do remember, and I've told this about my mom on the show

15:36.780 --> 15:39.460
before, she would never touch the controller.

15:39.460 --> 15:44.500
Like the controller was diseased to her, but she would enjoy playing things like, um,

15:44.500 --> 15:50.420
family feud, jeopardy, wheel of fortune, or she would bark at me what to do.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.980
So we would play wheel of fortune.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.180
She'd be like, all right, spin the wheel.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.380
And then if I landed on a bankrupt, she'd be like, you didn't spin it the right way

15:56.380 --> 15:58.140
or something, you know, or whatever.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.140
Let's push the button.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.140
Yeah, exactly.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.140
Right.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.140
All right.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.940
Guess an E. And then, you know, then I would, I would guess the answer to the puzzle.

16:04.940 --> 16:08.860
She'd be like, how do you know that you're cheating.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.740
So anyway, that was, that was some of my memories.

16:10.740 --> 16:16.780
Uh, look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I grew up on the NES

16:16.780 --> 16:18.140
around the time when it first came out.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.220
I was with my uncle at the time.

16:19.220 --> 16:23.500
I'll never forget the first time I saw him playing super Mario brothers, uh, SSG at 100.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.260
Matt says, my mom would sneak into my room while I was asleep in the middle of the night

16:26.260 --> 16:28.060
and play Tetris and super Mario brothers.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.900
My mom can still out speed run me and super Mario brothers.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.900
That's awesome.

16:31.900 --> 16:38.980
Um, Visaya925 says, Nintendo made gaming popular like Apple made smartphones popular.

16:38.980 --> 16:45.380
Uh, definitely that pop culture phenomenon, I think in, in a way, uh, that those two things

16:45.380 --> 16:46.940
kind of have in common.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.940
Um, Dungeon Busters says, I remember someone bringing a dot matrix printout of the companies

16:50.940 --> 16:52.660
that were making games for the NES.

16:52.660 --> 16:56.900
I called up Vic Tokai's office to find out more about their games and the guy who would

16:56.900 --> 17:00.900
probably come straight from Japan answered the phone as best as he could in English.

17:00.900 --> 17:07.380
Um, Loco Poco says, I remember being a huge TMNT fan and my parents got me a super Nintendo

17:07.380 --> 17:10.540
just for Ninja turtle tournament fighters for my birthday.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.780
I have the Japanese version of that one.

17:12.780 --> 17:16.900
And Tiger Claw says, remember the time when you had an NES and this was way before the

17:16.900 --> 17:21.740
internet, you read through some gaming magazines looking for codes or buying a VHS tape that

17:21.740 --> 17:24.260
contains some gameplay tips and codes.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.660
One of my questions was in Nintendo power once years and years ago.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.260
One of my tips was in Nintendo power.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.260
Was it really?

17:30.260 --> 17:35.060
It was the, uh, mega, uh, how to get through mega man three with no life bar where you

17:35.060 --> 17:38.420
know how to do the double jump, the extra high jump in mega man three, where you have

17:38.420 --> 17:43.140
someone hold the other controller and hold a left and right at the same time.

17:43.140 --> 17:48.700
Well, if you jump down a hole while you're holding that, let go and then hold it again,

17:48.700 --> 17:49.700
you'll die.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.820
And then you can jump back up out of the hole and you have no life bar.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.700
You have to use special weapons the whole time.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.420
But if you touch it, you know, a life thing, then your life will fill up and it's over.

17:59.420 --> 18:02.500
But you're basically a undead mega man.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.340
I think, I remember my question was about the game legacy of the wizard, which I don't

18:06.340 --> 18:08.860
know if you guys have ever played this on the Nintendo entertainment system, but it's

18:08.860 --> 18:09.860
fucking hard.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.500
That game was really hard.

18:11.500 --> 18:16.460
And um, it was a kind of like a side scroller adventure game, uh, where you played all the

18:16.460 --> 18:17.620
members of a family.

18:17.620 --> 18:22.740
Like you could even play as their pink pet, which it made sense at the time.

18:22.740 --> 18:23.740
Just roll.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.540
It looked like Kirby, honestly, like they had a pet Kirby.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.460
And that game was so hard.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.180
And I think my question was something about what were the key, what order do you collect

18:32.180 --> 18:33.180
the keys?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.100
Because it was, Oh my God, that game was so hard.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.620
Like looking back on it, like I don't think I ever beat it the right way.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.540
I think I had to use cheat codes to do it.

18:39.540 --> 18:42.540
If anybody else remembers that game, you probably know what I'm talking about.

18:42.540 --> 18:46.380
But Nintendo used to be very good at answering all of their fan mail.

18:46.380 --> 18:49.100
Like I probably wrote Nintendo like five letters over the years.

18:49.100 --> 18:52.820
And every time I got back, like it was, it was definitely like a form letter, but the

18:52.820 --> 18:56.540
middle portion, like somebody would write that would respond to whatever my question

18:56.540 --> 18:57.540
was.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.700
And then it would be like, you know, in the future, consider calling our 900 number for

19:00.700 --> 19:02.260
game hotline tips.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.260
This is cheaper.

19:03.260 --> 19:07.740
I've done that a couple of times actually when I was a kid, I asked permission.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.780
My mom specifically said, you cannot call the 900 number.

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
Why don't you write them a letter?

19:11.780 --> 19:15.660
Yeah, I, I, yeah, I called the nine number number once and that was because I bought

19:15.660 --> 19:18.940
a used copy of star tropics without the manual in it.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.900
So I was unable to dip the envelope in the water.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.820
And so I was like, I can't figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to do here.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.620
You know, it says, dip the envelope.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.260
I don't have an envelope in my inventory.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.220
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.860
And then so I had to call them up and they're all, well, you just have to dip the envelope,

19:34.860 --> 19:38.940
you know, in the manual, you know, and I'm like, well, I bought the game used at a flea

19:38.940 --> 19:40.160
market.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.460
I don't know exactly what they were trying to, and they're like, alright, code six, seven

19:44.460 --> 19:45.460
67.

19:45.460 --> 19:51.460
So I thought it was seven 47, 47, an airplane, seven 47.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.180
So, so yeah, I had to do that.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.860
I was like, sweet, I can be the game now.

19:55.860 --> 20:00.100
It's like the ancient form of copy protection and how to, how to prevent used game sales.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
Nintendo was onto it.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.900
Well, I don't think it was to prevent used game sales.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.300
I think it was just, they just thought it was a cool thing in there and you know.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.300
Do you now?

20:07.300 --> 20:08.300
Yes.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.300
Do you now?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
Cause I don't know.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.300
I mean.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.740
Why haven't we seen star tropics come back?

20:12.740 --> 20:15.020
Cause that was a pretty awesome Nintendo game.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.100
It was, you know, and there was a star tropics too.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.100
I know, but it was on Nintendo.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.300
It was like the next to last.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
So does revenge.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.340
That was like the next to last game on the NES.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.740
I'm surprised we haven't seen like, I mean, wasn't that a first party Nintendo game?

20:25.740 --> 20:29.300
Uh, if not first then second cause Nintendo in house.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.700
That would be awesome to see like that dude come back for like smash brothers or something

20:32.700 --> 20:34.420
like his yo-yo type thing or something.

20:34.420 --> 20:37.100
I'm sure he's an assist in one of the games or something.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.100
He's gotta be.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.220
Maybe, maybe it was second party though.

20:40.220 --> 20:43.140
It might've been, did H A L H A L do it?

20:43.140 --> 20:44.140
It may have been.

20:44.140 --> 20:45.460
But then again, they did smash the first ones.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.460
I don't know.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.460
Hmm.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.460
Anyhow.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.140
Um, so there you go.

20:50.140 --> 20:57.180
Nintendo turns 125 this week and here's to 125 more if the Wii U doesn't bankrupt you.

20:57.180 --> 20:58.180
Toast.

20:58.180 --> 20:59.180
Just kidding.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.180
I'm kidding.

21:00.180 --> 21:03.140
So question though, what was your first video game system?

21:03.140 --> 21:08.980
My first very first, including computers that play games, Atari 2600, which I think the

21:08.980 --> 21:14.380
family had bought one for my brother and I would have been like one or two, but I sort

21:14.380 --> 21:15.380
of inherited it.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.300
What was the first one you played?

21:17.340 --> 21:19.060
The first one I played was Atari 2600.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.060
Okay.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.060
Yeah.

21:21.060 --> 21:22.540
Uh, the first game was combat for sure.

21:22.540 --> 21:23.980
Probably combat and Spiderman.

21:23.980 --> 21:24.980
I know what mine was.

21:24.980 --> 21:25.980
What?

21:25.980 --> 21:26.980
Magnavox Odyssey 2.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.980
Nice.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.980
Playing the, uh, what was it?

21:28.980 --> 21:32.780
The, the legend of the four rings or whatever it was.

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Yeah.

21:33.780 --> 21:34.780
Playing that.

21:34.780 --> 21:35.780
We forgot the board game.

21:35.780 --> 21:36.780
We just played the little video game.

21:36.780 --> 21:39.420
And what was your very, very first game you remember playing?

21:39.420 --> 21:40.420
Logie?

21:40.420 --> 21:41.420
Me?

21:41.420 --> 21:42.420
It was definitely on the ColecoVision.

21:42.420 --> 21:46.060
Um, I remember playing the Smurfs game a lot.

21:46.060 --> 21:51.500
Um, dude, my dad was totally a gamer cause he bought all these like stupid ass systems,

21:51.500 --> 21:53.660
like the action max.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.740
He bought the fucking action max and I played the hell out of that, especially if they had

21:56.740 --> 22:01.300
like the little, uh, like trailer for the other games that are in there, which was also

22:01.300 --> 22:02.300
playable.

22:02.300 --> 22:05.380
Um, but like, God, he had that too.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.020
So I don't know.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.740
I don't know what his problem is now.

22:08.740 --> 22:14.140
It's like, Hey, so I don't play any of those systems too hard to control.

22:14.140 --> 22:15.140
All right.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.340
So from gaming's past to gaming's present, let's talk about how is your gaming week?

22:19.340 --> 22:23.380
We always like to check in on what everybody's playing just to sort of see what your frame

22:23.380 --> 22:27.100
of reference is and maybe if you have any reviews on new things you've played recently.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.340
So we always check in at the top of the show with how is your gaming weeks?

22:30.340 --> 22:31.700
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

22:31.700 --> 22:38.940
I played Final Fantasy 14 a little and I played some Mass Effect a little and then I, um,

22:38.940 --> 22:42.700
actually we do have a new game in the house that Dan paid 125 bucks for.

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
What?

22:43.700 --> 22:44.700
Yeah.

22:45.260 --> 22:49.500
Um, Outrun 2 SP for the PS3 or PS2.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.500
Yeah.

22:50.500 --> 22:57.380
The PS2, which is supposed to be the best version of Outrun 2 you can get as far as,

22:57.380 --> 23:00.840
you know, the sound quality and everything being complete and having all the animations

23:00.840 --> 23:02.860
from the arcade version.

23:02.860 --> 23:06.900
And it's a little dated looking, but it's still really freaking good.

23:06.900 --> 23:07.900
Why so much?

23:07.900 --> 23:09.500
Was there just not a lot of copies made of it?

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
I have no idea.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.900
It's maybe, yeah, I guess maybe it was a limited run.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.860
That is an import, but, um, he's been a happy boy.

23:16.860 --> 23:20.900
It also supposed to be like have like some of the best support for the, uh, driving wheels.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.660
Oh, is that something he puts in his little rig with the, he doesn't play it on this rig.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.140
He plays it with his leftovers that he built just hook up to the TV.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.140
Oh, gotcha.

23:29.140 --> 23:34.820
Um, and he's, uh, really been, it's got like all kinds of like unlockables for different

23:34.820 --> 23:39.300
music and everything and you can get different cars and it's really crazy.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.500
And I was like, why did the later versions of this suck so much?

23:42.500 --> 23:46.340
Because like, for example, and this is a minor thing, but like when you pick magical sound

23:46.340 --> 23:51.340
shower, right, you get magical sound when, before the next thing loads, but it actually

23:51.340 --> 23:55.660
finishes saying magical sound shower when you pick the name and then goes forward.

23:55.660 --> 24:00.780
It's like, and it's like, like the animations, like the, uh, shuttle blasting off into space

24:00.780 --> 24:04.460
on one of the endings, whereas it's just sitting there.

24:04.460 --> 24:11.120
Um, but yeah, Outrun 2 SP is supposed to be pretty, it's, it's pretty, pretty worthy.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.080
And it was, it was a really nice, smooth game.

24:13.080 --> 24:19.120
And then he's got this other one that's, um, basically it's Outrun, um, the original Outrun,

24:19.120 --> 24:23.200
uh, recompiled to work, um, on a PC.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.520
So it will run like widescreen layouts and everything.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.360
And I don't remember what it was called.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.040
Um, it's not called Outrun something, but it's something else.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.600
But, um, popcorn, I think.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
I don't remember.

24:34.600 --> 24:39.680
But anyway, um, but, uh, Dan's been like, the house has been nothing but Outrun music.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.960
I'll come home, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

24:43.960 --> 24:44.960
Every time I come home.

24:44.960 --> 24:45.960
Well, it's good.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.240
I mean, it's good to spend that much on a game, you're going to get your money's worth

24:48.240 --> 24:49.240
out of it, right?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
So actually play it.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.200
That and I think the cat's fascinated by watching him drive.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.520
Midna's like, the fuck are you doing?

24:55.520 --> 24:58.600
Is Midna destined to become Toonces, the driving cat?

24:58.600 --> 25:03.480
I don't know, but she's like, she'll like rub up under his legs while he's, you know,

25:03.480 --> 25:04.480
using the pedals and everything.

25:04.480 --> 25:09.640
And then she'll just sit there and go, daddy, why are you turning the thing?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.760
So she's just crazy.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.680
So yeah, that's been my.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.520
And then I, one thing I noticed you didn't mention was your Hataful Boyfriend stream

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
on Tuesday.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, I forgot.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
Cause I even tuned in for some of that.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.800
Hataful Boyfriend, I'm doing basically, I'm playing Hataful Boyfriend on Twitch TV.

25:25.800 --> 25:31.280
I actually made a Twitch channel for OLR, for me on OLR, so it's DarkSakura underscore

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
OLR.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.960
Um, and I'm just playing Hataful Boyfriend, I'm dating pigeons.

25:36.520 --> 25:43.200
This week, actually Tuesday, I will try to be on, hopefully around five, cause I'm gonna

25:43.200 --> 25:46.880
do two playthroughs and I'm gonna go for the Psycho Doctor ending.

25:46.880 --> 25:51.560
If you want to see what happens to our poor girl by trying to romance the doctor.

25:51.560 --> 25:56.840
My question is, do any of them talk like the pigeons from the Animaniacs?

25:56.840 --> 25:57.840
No.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.840
Damn.

25:58.840 --> 26:03.120
Although one of them is crazy and obsessed with pudding, and he apparently can't speak

26:03.120 --> 26:05.320
proper English, but everyone can understand him.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.940
Or proper Japanese in the game.

26:06.940 --> 26:11.960
He just says, coo, and then they translate everything, his name is Oko-san and he's crazy.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.280
He likes pudding.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.040
I did my second date through, I dated Oko-san.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
Good times.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.640
So that's been, your Tuesdays basically.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.640
I've been dating pigeons.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.640
Alright, awesome.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.640
My husband's okay with it.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.560
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:26.560 --> 26:29.520
You actually played things, not just the clicking heroes or whatever.

26:29.520 --> 26:34.360
Yeah, not just the clicky hero thing, but no, I actually did play Road Redemption because

26:34.360 --> 26:36.660
it was something I backed on Kickstarter.

26:36.660 --> 26:41.600
It's a Unity game that's sort of like a spiritual successor to Road Rash.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.600
The only problem is it runs like shit on my laptop, and that's no fault of the game.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.280
It's the fault that my laptop runs games like shit.

26:48.280 --> 26:52.160
So yeah, I mean it was fun.

26:52.160 --> 26:57.440
It's just, it kind of chugged because I didn't drop the graphics settings down too much and

26:57.440 --> 27:02.400
I kind of blame Unity a little bit because, you know, their descriptions for the different

27:02.400 --> 27:06.800
graphics levels are pretty vague, so it's hard to tell.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.520
But it looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.580
You just, you kind of play it like Road Rash and then they have different little events

27:13.580 --> 27:16.800
that you do and stuff, so it's pretty cool.

27:16.800 --> 27:21.280
The only thing I didn't like about it was kind of the shooting controls because you

27:21.280 --> 27:25.520
can actually get a gun and shoot in the game and that was a little difficult to actually

27:25.520 --> 27:29.720
manage to do that, so I don't know.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.720
But it's fun.

27:30.720 --> 27:36.240
And it's on early access if you didn't back the game, so you can check it out.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.240
Alright.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.840
Let's see, my gaming week.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.680
A lot of similar stuff from the previous weeks.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.240
I haven't played a lot, a lot of new stuff.

27:43.240 --> 27:48.600
I will mention that one new thing I did play, I played the Final Fantasy IV, which isn't

27:48.600 --> 27:51.120
really a new game, but it is on Steam.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.720
And I think I talked about this briefly last week that, you know, it would be my like seventh

27:54.720 --> 27:56.400
time buying it if I bought it on Steam.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.560
Well, of course, you know I bought it.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.200
And I actually did a livestream myself later on Monday night.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.360
It was pretty late Monday night.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.680
I did a stream of that for a little bit.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.940
And originally my whole goal was that I was going to stream a little bit every week until

28:08.940 --> 28:09.940
I beat the game.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.960
Well, you and I and everybody else know that's not going to happen.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.040
And a lot of that is probably because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and there were some

28:16.040 --> 28:17.200
things that came out in the stream.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.160
I was like, oh God, it's like totally, the sound isn't right.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.960
So anyway, I might end up doing that with something else later on.

28:22.960 --> 28:31.240
But Final Fantasy IV is, it is the iOS or DS version on your PC, probably best experienced

28:31.240 --> 28:36.840
in Steam big picture mode where you, you know, can use like the 360 controller and all that,

28:36.840 --> 28:38.840
which works very well with the game.

28:38.840 --> 28:42.320
Otherwise, I guess I would say it's one of those things where maybe if you're a younger

28:42.320 --> 28:47.240
listener of OLR and you've never really experienced this game, like, you know, you just, you miss

28:47.240 --> 28:50.840
the boat when the Super Nintendo version was out and you haven't really ever picked up

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
this game.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.300
And I think the story in this game is really good still and holds up very well.

28:55.300 --> 28:59.960
It might feel a little cliche to you, but just keep in mind that, you know, Final Fantasy

28:59.960 --> 29:01.080
IV is an older game.

29:01.080 --> 29:05.520
And I think, I think it's one of those things where I think to truly appreciate, you know,

29:05.520 --> 29:10.120
where RPGs have been and where they are now, Final Fantasy IV is definitely worth a look.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.800
And this is a, this is a fair way to experience it.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.520
I don't think this PC port is the best version of it.

29:17.520 --> 29:23.680
I still think the PSP one was my favorite, but, um, it's, it's not bad.

29:23.680 --> 29:28.040
I'm surprised they haven't, um, remade, and maybe they have, cause I haven't been paying

29:28.040 --> 29:31.640
attention, but they haven't remade, uh, the Dragon Quest games in kind of the same lore

29:31.640 --> 29:32.640
fashion.

29:32.640 --> 29:38.400
It's happening on, um, iOS because they just released, funny you bring that up, they just

29:38.400 --> 29:39.400
released the first one.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.200
The mis- misnamed one, what was it?

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
Oh, Dargon Quest.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.720
Well, they, that was, I think seven that they did that.

29:46.720 --> 29:51.800
But like the original Dargon Quest just came out, like that was a big thing they were just

29:51.800 --> 29:53.640
hyping up like in this past week or two.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.640
Sounds like my first RPG that I played that is my, well, aside from, I don't know if you

29:58.640 --> 30:02.280
consider, Zelda's more of an adventure game, but you know, it was the first like RPG I

30:02.280 --> 30:04.040
kind of played was Dragon Quest.

30:04.040 --> 30:08.240
I wouldn't be surprised at all, actually, if Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior, I guess over

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
here.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.240
Yeah, Dragon Warrior over here.

30:10.240 --> 30:15.160
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that does hop over to Steam, um, because you know, Square's

30:15.200 --> 30:19.120
kind of been milking the Steam thing lately and especially with the 13 ports that are

30:19.120 --> 30:23.240
coming now, I think they realize it's, you know, it's, it's extra money.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.240
So why not?

30:24.240 --> 30:30.560
I mean, this isn't Square, but, but, but, but Microsoft or whoever, I think it's Microsoft,

30:30.560 --> 30:34.120
it was like a first party, second party game.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
Lost Odyssey, please.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.960
Yeah, uh, Mistwalker.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.400
So it's not Square, it's people that used to be with Square, but it's not really Microsoft

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
either.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.240
Oh God, I don't care who it is, please.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
Yeah.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.640
Or a sequel, man.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.640
I would be all over that.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.640
I know, I know.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.640
Me too.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.640
I still need to finish the first game.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.640
I know those feels.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.000
Uh, otherwise I've been playing a lot of other stuff.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.880
I've actually played some more Diablo 3, of course I've been playing more Final Fantasy

30:59.880 --> 31:08.520
XIV, more Destiny, I hit level 20 in Destiny, um, and, um, Destiny is such a complex game

31:08.520 --> 31:13.080
to talk about because there's so many things I really, really, really love about it.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.160
And the game is so much fun, especially when you're like able to play with other people.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.500
And even by myself, I have fun doing the little patrol missions and so forth.

31:21.500 --> 31:27.480
But then on the other hand, there's the, like the way you level up after level 20 is 100%

31:27.480 --> 31:28.760
based on loot.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.680
And there's a stat on loot called light.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.040
And the more light your character has, the higher your level goes.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.000
So it's so stupid.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
I hate it.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.680
I really hate the end game in Destiny and how you level up past 20.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.480
I don't have a nice way to put it.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.680
It's, it's really awful.

31:46.680 --> 31:51.480
And that isn't me being a stick in the mud thinking like, oh, well, you know, because

31:51.480 --> 31:53.560
every other RPG in the past has worked this way.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
This one should too.

31:54.560 --> 31:59.520
I'm all for them doing something different, but like I've literally done all these like

31:59.520 --> 32:05.400
missions and strikes and bounties on the planet and so forth and I get these drops and I have

32:05.400 --> 32:08.840
yet to get to level 21 or even see my bar move.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.240
Like I'm not getting any gear with light on it.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.320
So it's, it's really frustrating.

32:13.320 --> 32:16.400
Now granted, I know there's a patch coming and we're going to get into some of that later

32:16.400 --> 32:17.960
in the show.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.640
Some of this stuff is fixable.

32:19.640 --> 32:23.920
I mean, if they fixed Diablo three, they can fix this, but it's just as it is right now

32:23.920 --> 32:25.520
today.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.560
That stuff kind of makes the end game and destiny like really not fun.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.720
Now wasn't destiny supposed to be a game that they're going to be carrying out for like

32:32.720 --> 32:34.560
10 years or something like that?

32:34.560 --> 32:35.560
Absolutely.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.480
Can you actually see that happening?

32:37.480 --> 32:47.280
I mean, actually, well, maybe not 10 years, but I could see through DLC, they're going

32:47.280 --> 32:51.960
to probably do at least squeeze another good year out of this through the two DLC packs

32:51.960 --> 32:56.760
they're planning on and then, you know, they can still drop in patches and events and so

32:56.760 --> 32:59.560
forth and support the game for a few years.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.640
I think can the destiny mythos or whatever last 10 years?

33:03.640 --> 33:07.680
Yeah, they'll probably be a destiny two at some point or something, you know, but I,

33:07.680 --> 33:11.600
this game by itself for 10 years, I, I don't know.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.800
That's an awful lot of DLC and I think some of us would expect bungee to kind of do something

33:15.800 --> 33:19.920
else, especially maybe after the lukewarm reception this game has got.

33:19.920 --> 33:24.520
But again, I go back and I pointed Diablo three, everything that that game went through

33:24.520 --> 33:27.840
and now Diablo three is a, I love playing Diablo three.

33:27.840 --> 33:28.920
It's so much fun.

33:28.920 --> 33:33.480
Uh, I, I still play that to this day on PlayStation four and PC.

33:33.480 --> 33:39.000
Um, so you know, if Diablo three can fix itself, destiny can too, which is so weird that we

33:39.000 --> 33:43.560
live in this, you know, coming off this old school Nintendo topic that we just had, you

33:43.560 --> 33:49.480
know, you couldn't fix a game after launch like that back in the day, but now it's like,

33:49.480 --> 33:51.320
it's just part of what you expect.

33:51.320 --> 33:55.120
It's so interesting how those day one patches have really changed things tremendously.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.120
I don't know.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.720
It just seems to me, maybe it's just my, uh,

33:59.400 --> 34:01.520
Rose colored goggles, I guess.

34:01.520 --> 34:05.360
Um, but it seemed like a lot of those like old Nintendo games, man, they were pretty

34:05.360 --> 34:06.360
polished.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.720
I mean, granted, I mean, there's some pretty big bugs and they're like, you know, blaster

34:08.720 --> 34:12.800
master, all the exploits you can do by pausing the game and grenades and stuff like that.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.400
But it ended up being coming, coming part of the game.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.320
And I don't know, I just looked so fondly upon that stuff.

34:19.320 --> 34:23.120
It's like, you know, everything, almost everything that came out, it's like, Oh, this is going

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
to be a really great game.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.760
Well, can be not every single game, but like, you know, there's a lot of really great games

34:27.760 --> 34:28.760
on there.

34:28.760 --> 34:35.280
It's just, I don't know, destiny to me, it seems like it's, don't call this an MMO, even

34:35.280 --> 34:38.840
though it's kind of like saying, you know, don't say this is on rails, you know, for

34:38.840 --> 34:39.840
fable.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.280
It's, I don't know.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.360
It's just kind of a weird looking game.

34:43.360 --> 34:49.640
Uh, I like that term mingle player I think is, is appropriate, but it's again, this,

34:49.640 --> 34:54.760
every problem that I had with fantasy star online is almost exactly what is the issue

34:54.760 --> 34:55.800
with destiny.

34:55.800 --> 35:00.440
Although at least a fantasy star online credit, there was none of this ridiculous, like post

35:00.440 --> 35:04.020
level cap junk being driven through gear.

35:04.020 --> 35:09.320
Like there is, I mean, the loot system in PSO was sadly better than it is in destiny.

35:09.320 --> 35:14.480
But you know, I, I feel like there, I mean, we have news coming up later about destiny's

35:14.480 --> 35:15.480
doing a patch.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.040
That's going to fix a lot of the problems like in the coming weeks.

35:18.040 --> 35:22.080
So I'm not interested until you can feed mags and turn them into Opa Opa.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.520
Uh, I'm, I'm hoping you can feed your ghost or change.

35:25.520 --> 35:30.280
I mean, it seems like you can change your ghost because it's one of the options.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.600
I mean, I don't know if anybody's seen where you can actually change the ghost or if that's

35:34.600 --> 35:38.560
coming in a future, um, expansion, maybe that's just something they're leaving room for, but,

35:38.560 --> 35:39.560
uh, yeah.

35:39.560 --> 35:46.880
Uh, no Opa Opa, but you're probably no Opa Opa, uh, link in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.880
Uh, let's see.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.600
The seg agrees with me saying light is stupid.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
That's right.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.040
Grats on 20.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.560
Now the real struggle begins.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.560
Yeah.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.160
I have to beat the game.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.160
That's the other thing.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.160
I haven't beat the game yet.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.280
I'm still, I still have like a bunch of missions to do on Mars.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.840
I just got to Mars and I hit low.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.360
You better get your ass to Mars.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.360
Right.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.360
Get my ass to Mars.

36:06.360 --> 36:09.240
Uh, Visaya 9 25 says the leveling is so long.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.800
It drives me bonkers.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.120
Some of the strikes take forever.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.620
I wish we could actually talk to other people.

36:14.620 --> 36:16.280
The game feels so empty.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.280
Yeah.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.000
You know, when I do strikes with friends, that's no problem because you can voice chat

36:21.000 --> 36:26.240
with other people, but, um, bungee made a conscious decision to disable voice chat

36:26.240 --> 36:30.880
in destiny and they're getting some shit for it, but it's very interesting to see them

36:30.880 --> 36:34.840
say that basically, and this is their reason for doing it is that they said, you know,

36:34.840 --> 36:41.960
we had, um, voice chat on in halo and we saw what toxic things were done because of it.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.120
So we made a decision to shut it off in destiny.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.840
And there's a part of me that kind of goes, well, that's kind of rad actually because

36:47.840 --> 36:50.240
people are real dicks on the line sometimes.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
That makes sense.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
And I'm glad I can't hear them.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.240
That makes sense.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.780
And a death match type situation where, you know, okay, you might wash it off, but this

36:56.780 --> 36:59.600
is more like an MMO where it's more co-op.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
Yeah.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.340
You don't really need voice chat in a death match.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.760
You probably need voice chat in like a co-op type situation.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.240
I mean team death match, I guess you can be doing some like, you know, strategies.

37:10.240 --> 37:13.440
And people still find ways to troll people even with no voice chat.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.960
Like I was walking around doing earth missions and I was doing some stuff.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.640
Some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face, like, cause that's something

37:20.640 --> 37:21.640
you can do in destiny.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.440
You hit the trigger and it throws a punch.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.940
So some guy just walked by me and punched me in the face.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.240
Is that what we do to people now?

37:27.240 --> 37:28.520
Is that, is that how we say hello?

37:28.520 --> 37:30.440
Hey, Loki, let me come over and say hello to you.

37:30.440 --> 37:35.280
How you doing buddy?

37:35.280 --> 37:38.400
And I play a woman character.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.880
Didn't your parents ever teach you not to hit a girl?

37:40.880 --> 37:41.880
Anyway.

37:41.880 --> 37:44.400
Cause we fucking hit back.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.620
Well, I did try to hit this guy back actually, but then he ran away.

37:47.620 --> 37:48.620
So I shot him.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.380
But, but that doesn't do any damage.

37:50.380 --> 37:53.760
You can't actually shoot other players.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.680
Well but you can throw a grenade and grenades do do damage.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.520
So I did contemplate that, but I was like, you know what, no, I'm going to move on.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
I did.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
I did.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
All right.

38:03.520 --> 38:09.320
Um, they have been talking about though that they're going to do like an opt in voice chat

38:09.320 --> 38:12.680
thing where when you play online, you can opt into voice chat.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.680
So

38:13.960 --> 38:17.520
you've got these clans and stuff that you've made up.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.780
The clan support is terrible in destiny and that's another thing they need to fix.

38:21.780 --> 38:25.480
Like we have a VoG clan and it's awesome and I encourage you to join.

38:25.480 --> 38:29.520
The only problem with said VoG clan is that there's nothing in game that shows me who's

38:29.520 --> 38:33.480
in the clan and if you're online or not, cause I'd love to run strikes with all of you, but

38:33.480 --> 38:35.400
not all of you are on my friends list.

38:35.400 --> 38:40.320
So like why isn't the clan list in the game right next to your friends list?

38:40.320 --> 38:42.700
I mean I think even Halo did that.

38:42.700 --> 38:46.620
So that seems like a really weird decision, but whatever, whatever.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.100
All right.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.500
Uh, anyhow, let's see.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.540
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, my fem Hunter was trolled, but I jumped into orbit and that

38:54.540 --> 38:55.540
was that.

38:55.540 --> 39:00.180
Uh, Viziah says, I love the teabagging and PVP or maybe they should limit the speaking

39:00.180 --> 39:03.380
to a few seconds so that the crap talk is kept at a minimum.

39:03.380 --> 39:07.740
Oh, that would be kind of awesome that like, you know, the more you prove yourself, the

39:07.740 --> 39:09.420
longer you're allowed to talk.

39:09.420 --> 39:12.220
That's going to be awesome.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.220
All right.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.780
That's enough about destiny for now cause I have a story coming up on it later.

39:15.780 --> 39:16.780
We'll get into it then.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.220
Or if you talk, you put down your weapon or something like that.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.220
Right.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.820
So while you're talking, you can't shoot.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.820
Oh, that'd be neat.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.820
We'll see.

39:24.820 --> 39:25.820
We'll see.

39:25.820 --> 39:26.820
All right.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.820
Anyhow, uh, let's move on.

39:27.820 --> 39:28.820
I think that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

39:28.820 --> 39:32.820
Uh, so I did play a couple other little things like I did like crypt of the necro dancer

39:32.820 --> 39:36.260
one night and I was playing eight bit boy on steam the other night too.

39:36.260 --> 39:39.460
But uh, I'll talk, I guess more about those games at length at a later date.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.820
So let's get into our news right after some housekeeping.

39:42.820 --> 39:48.820
Uh, we, uh, are on Facebook of course, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and Twitter, twitter.com

39:48.820 --> 39:53.300
slash O L R and Google plus google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

39:53.300 --> 39:59.160
We're also on YouTube at username orange launch radio and you should subscribe and check out

39:59.160 --> 40:03.660
our episodes when they're released on YouTube because that's a great archive to go back

40:03.660 --> 40:05.040
and visit past episodes.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.540
It's a building up there on YouTube and YouTube's on everything you could watch.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.700
You can watch O L R on your TV, although you're really just listening to it because

40:11.700 --> 40:12.700
it's a radio show.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.980
It's orange launch radio, not orange launch television.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.420
Um, but let's see.

40:17.420 --> 40:23.220
The other thing I wanted to mention is that we will not be here live on October 19th.

40:23.220 --> 40:27.640
So if you are a live listener, you'll want to go ahead and, and uh, I don't know if Bobby's

40:27.640 --> 40:28.640
here that week.

40:28.640 --> 40:32.600
Uh, so he'll, he'll let you guys all know about that, but we will not be here live on

40:32.600 --> 40:37.900
October 19th because I will be at final fantasy fan fest in Las Vegas.

40:37.940 --> 40:39.420
And uh, so I won't be here.

40:39.420 --> 40:42.380
We will be replaced by banjo playing chimpanzees.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.280
We're trying to tape in advance that week.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.200
So at least there'll be something new for you guys to listen to.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.020
Cause I know we just missed a show over labor day weekend, so we don't like to miss shows

40:49.020 --> 40:50.020
a lot.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.460
Uh, cause you know, we want to keep you guys in the habit of having something to listen

40:52.460 --> 40:53.460
to on Monday.

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
So we're gonna try to tape something prior that week.

40:55.460 --> 40:59.780
Uh, but just, just see live folks know we won't be here live for sure that night, October

40:59.780 --> 41:00.780
19th.

41:00.780 --> 41:01.780
All right.

41:01.780 --> 41:05.320
Uh, let's get into some news.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.100
Loki's going to start us off with some news tonight.

41:07.100 --> 41:14.540
So, um, it was announced that, uh, blizzard has canceled Titan and the problem is not

41:14.540 --> 41:15.540
a lot of people know what Titan was.

41:15.540 --> 41:21.100
I mean, we kind of thought it was a, you know, their next MMO and I guess that's sort of

41:21.100 --> 41:27.420
what it was as a, basically their most ambitious game that they had possibly imagined.

41:27.420 --> 41:29.020
And the only problem was that it wasn't fun.

41:29.020 --> 41:33.660
So you can have all that ambition, but if it's not fun, then what's the point?

41:33.660 --> 41:39.900
So they still didn't reveal any details regarding it other than that, you know, it just wasn't

41:39.900 --> 41:40.900
working out.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.580
So they decided to cancel it.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.580
So I don't know.

41:44.580 --> 41:48.780
I guess that means that, you know, I was kind of hoping that that was going to be like a

41:48.780 --> 41:51.940
follow up to world of Warcraft, but I guess it just means there's going to be more world

41:51.940 --> 41:52.940
of Warcraft.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.580
You know, why bother putting out a new game?

41:54.580 --> 41:58.660
That would be nice cause there hasn't really been world of Warcraft for about a year now

41:58.660 --> 41:59.980
because of content patches.

41:59.980 --> 42:03.220
They've been running that same raid for a year.

42:03.220 --> 42:09.780
So I don't know, maybe, maybe they're just worried that if they put out another MMO,

42:09.780 --> 42:15.660
that it would kind of split their user base and you know, they want more people on world

42:15.660 --> 42:16.660
of Warcraft.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.660
I don't know.

42:17.660 --> 42:22.220
Well, there's been a lot of chatter that this game Titan, I don't know if you saw some of

42:22.220 --> 42:26.660
the details about what the game was, but a lot of people have been saying that Titan

42:26.660 --> 42:29.900
had a lot in common with destiny.

42:29.900 --> 42:33.180
And that is why possibly they pulled the plug.

42:33.180 --> 42:36.540
But, and I got into this a little more on Horde house and I don't want to repeat myself

42:36.540 --> 42:39.500
because my other show, Horde house on Wednesday, we talked about this a little bit, but in

42:39.500 --> 42:45.380
a nutshell, um, why would Activision fund two games that were saying the same thing?

42:45.380 --> 42:47.940
Not just, I mean, cause they're both Activision games.

42:47.940 --> 42:52.380
Activision is publishing the bungee destiny and Activision's public would have published

42:52.380 --> 42:54.900
a blizzards, uh, Titan or whatever.

42:54.900 --> 42:59.060
So Activision was not going to let two games of the exact same thing.

42:59.060 --> 43:04.100
And I realized Activision might be hands off or whatever, but look like once a year,

43:04.100 --> 43:05.940
these games at least are checking in.

43:05.940 --> 43:12.880
So I think there must've been enough with Titan that differentiated it from destiny.

43:12.880 --> 43:17.380
It almost sounds to me like there was probably a Sims type of element to this too.

43:17.380 --> 43:20.700
And maybe even some elements that I would have wanted to see in a mass effect MMO.

43:20.700 --> 43:26.300
I mean, maybe that's really wishful thinking, but maybe it was too disjointed and that's

43:26.300 --> 43:27.420
why it didn't work.

43:27.420 --> 43:31.500
It might've just been a really like a good, like they had a bunch of stuff that they wanted

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
to implement in there.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.260
Like I think there was one where you could be like a shop vendor or something like that

43:35.260 --> 43:36.700
and you didn't even have to fight.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.860
You could have just, you know, sold stuff and that kind of stuff.

43:39.860 --> 43:45.380
Um, and all that stuff was cool and work, but it's kind of like, well, is it fun?

43:45.380 --> 43:47.140
Is it going to be fun doing this?

43:47.140 --> 43:48.660
I mean, probably not.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.780
I mean, I don't know.

43:49.780 --> 43:56.380
It just has an awful long time to be developing a game just to come up, you know, with nothing

43:56.380 --> 43:58.660
and well, lizard does this a lot.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
Blizzard does this a lot.

43:59.660 --> 44:03.220
You know, there was Warcraft adventures, which is what, that was the point and click game

44:03.220 --> 44:04.780
with the, the orcs, right?

44:04.780 --> 44:07.740
And then there was a Starcraft ghost, which was the actiony thing that was supposed to

44:07.740 --> 44:08.740
be on.

44:08.740 --> 44:09.740
What was that?

44:09.740 --> 44:13.000
A PlayStation cast game to PlayStation two or one of those.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.440
And that never ended up happening either.

44:14.440 --> 44:17.180
So I mean, blizzard does this a lot.

44:17.180 --> 44:18.180
Yeah.

44:18.180 --> 44:19.340
And then I don't know.

44:19.340 --> 44:23.700
I mean, if it wasn't fun, I mean, who cares if it was being worked on for awhile?

44:23.700 --> 44:27.180
I mean, some games that are worked on for a while that do eventually come out and end

44:27.180 --> 44:29.340
up sucking to be going forever, for example.

44:29.340 --> 44:30.860
So I don't know.

44:30.860 --> 44:35.540
I mean, I'm sure they know what they're doing, so we'll just have to imagine what it was

44:35.540 --> 44:41.660
and wait for the, you know, the eventual, uh, art portfolio leak from somebody looking

44:41.660 --> 44:45.460
for a job or something like that, that showed like some concept art or something, uh, tiger

44:45.460 --> 44:49.220
claw and chat says the reason why blizzard shut down Titan is because they want to have

44:49.220 --> 44:54.100
the burden or imagine that as they don't want to have the burden of managing two MMOs

44:54.100 --> 44:57.940
at the same time, they spend a lot of time maintaining, wow, it would be difficult for

44:57.940 --> 44:59.860
them to balance two MMOs.

44:59.860 --> 45:04.380
You know, another way I kind of look into that comment is, um, that maybe blizzard has

45:04.380 --> 45:12.340
set their own bar too high and they, the realization was that this game was not going to get that

45:12.340 --> 45:16.700
same amount as a buy-in that wow has.

45:16.700 --> 45:18.980
And so it would have been written off as a failure.

45:18.980 --> 45:20.100
You know what I mean?

45:20.100 --> 45:24.300
Because like no MMO has even come close to touching, wow.

45:24.300 --> 45:27.820
In America, in North America and probably Europe too.

45:27.820 --> 45:32.980
I'm glad that they've stopped advertising different MMOs as a wow killer now that everyone's

45:32.980 --> 45:38.880
kind of, you know, gotten to the point where it's like, wow's dipping though.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.540
And I think, I think wow has peaked.

45:40.540 --> 45:44.620
I don't see wow getting back to the subscriber numbers that had during wrath of the Lich

45:44.620 --> 45:45.620
King.

45:45.820 --> 45:51.220
In all honesty, I've been fortunate enough to play the Draenor alpha and beta.

45:51.220 --> 45:54.840
And as much as I'm thankful for the opportunity to check that stuff out, I'm going to tell

45:54.840 --> 45:59.140
you I'm, it's not good enough for me to buy the expansion.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.640
I don't care.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.640
Like it's just, I, it wasn't enough.

46:02.640 --> 46:07.380
Like it really just felt, it felt so boring to me.

46:07.380 --> 46:11.220
Sorry, but that's kind of like where I'm at with Warcraft now.

46:11.220 --> 46:14.500
You know, great community, but the game just, you know.

46:14.500 --> 46:18.660
But at the same time, here I am, I can't stop fucking playing Diablo three.

46:18.660 --> 46:22.500
So you can't say that Blizzard isn't doing something right and Blizzard is doing a good

46:22.500 --> 46:25.180
job at having something for everyone right now.

46:25.180 --> 46:28.660
I mean, there's a lot of people playing Hearthstone.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.300
Hearthstone's up to like what, 20 million people have checked that out.

46:32.300 --> 46:35.340
Heroes of the Storm appears to be doing very well for them.

46:35.340 --> 46:40.060
Maybe Blizzard thought that Titan didn't fit in there somewhere, that Titan wasn't going

46:40.060 --> 46:45.420
to bring in those new people that these other games have brought in to the fold somehow.

46:45.420 --> 46:48.460
I don't know.

46:48.460 --> 46:52.740
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Blizzard has always been really picky about its properties.

46:52.740 --> 46:55.460
Look how long Diablo three took to finally get out.

46:55.460 --> 46:58.020
And that comment over at live.fognetwork.com.

46:58.020 --> 47:03.700
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, what if it were to go free to play?

47:03.700 --> 47:07.540
I would probably check it out a little bit if it went free to play, but I just don't

47:07.540 --> 47:08.600
see that happening.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.400
They don't have to go free to play right now.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.400
It's very hard to be a premium MMO.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.080
There's so few premium MMOs right now.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.080
So few.

47:18.080 --> 47:21.080
You could probably count them on one hand.

47:21.080 --> 47:26.360
Final Fantasy 14 and 11, wow, WildStar, Elder Scrolls.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.360
And WildStar was crap.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.680
I haven't really played WildStar.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.580
I've watched somebody else play it and I was really impressed by the whole housing thing

47:33.580 --> 47:37.960
and just how deep that is, but I'm not impressed at some of the end game stuff I'm hearing

47:37.960 --> 47:43.640
about that and the awful, horrible grind that they, they, they, they basically made

47:43.640 --> 47:46.840
a game for people that missed vanilla wow.

47:46.840 --> 47:50.960
Who didn't realize how awful vanilla wow really was like that.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
That's the impression.

47:51.960 --> 47:52.960
I'm getting.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.960
How many times did I quit vanilla?

47:53.960 --> 47:54.960
Wow.

47:54.960 --> 47:55.960
Yeah, I know.

47:55.960 --> 47:56.960
Right.

47:56.960 --> 47:57.960
Again, I haven't played WildStar myself.

47:57.960 --> 47:58.960
I've only watched other people play it.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.440
So there's also Ragnarok online too.

48:00.440 --> 48:01.440
Right.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.440
Which is free.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.440
That's free.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.440
Yeah.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.440
Yeah.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
So I can't think of a lot.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.440
Come on Square.

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
Final Fantasy 11.

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
Free to play.

48:09.920 --> 48:10.920
I know.

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
Come on.

48:11.920 --> 48:16.600
They still support that really well, but you know, people are flocking to free MMOs too.

48:16.600 --> 48:21.200
Like I know my Twitter feed has been lit up with a ton of people checking out arch age

48:21.200 --> 48:25.360
and complaining about server issues over there because the game is so damn popular right

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
now.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.560
People are having a hard time getting in.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.560
That's a big one that just launched.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.920
I might be going back to Star Trek online.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.200
Star Trek online obviously is really fun.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Yeah.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
A big one too.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
And they've got a big expansion coming out.

48:36.200 --> 48:40.240
You know, there's a lot to be excited about in the free to play market as well.

48:40.240 --> 48:44.040
Ah, anyhow, let's move on.

48:44.040 --> 48:45.040
More news.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.800
Hey, I promised you some stuff on Destiny and let's talk about what is going to happen

48:48.800 --> 48:53.240
with patch 1.0.2, which is coming this week.

48:53.240 --> 48:58.800
And one of the big changes they're going to make with Destiny 1.0.2 is Cryptarch changes.

48:58.800 --> 49:03.600
Thank God the Cryptarch will finally learn how to decrypt things at the level they're

49:03.600 --> 49:05.000
supposed to be at.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.400
Meaning legendary engrams will always be legendary or better items.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.720
Rare engrams will always be rare or better.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.720
Thank God.

49:12.720 --> 49:16.640
And rare engrams will also have an increased chance to produce legendary quality items.

49:16.640 --> 49:22.400
So no more of this bullshit where you get a rare engram and it decodes into a green.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.400
Fuck that shit.

49:23.400 --> 49:29.440
Some of the activity changes will change and rare and legendary engrams will be added as

49:29.440 --> 49:30.440
rewards.

49:30.440 --> 49:34.960
That will be something you can do to sort of motivate people to do those more.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.600
And some other item changes.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.640
Ascendant materials have been promoted to legendary status.

49:40.640 --> 49:45.880
And legendary engram items that already exist in your inventory will be demoted when the

49:45.880 --> 49:47.800
patch goes live.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.200
So that's very interesting.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.720
So if you are holding onto legendary engrams, they will be demoted.

49:53.720 --> 49:59.560
And Bungie makes a very tongue-in-cheek joke in their patch notes that says, let's be honest,

49:59.560 --> 50:02.800
even if you don't, we all know they were blues already.

50:02.800 --> 50:07.200
Like Bungie's making fun of themselves.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.820
So strange.

50:08.820 --> 50:10.960
So anyway.

50:10.960 --> 50:15.100
Also on the Destiny front, since a lot of you guys are playing it, we should mention

50:15.100 --> 50:16.100
this.

50:16.100 --> 50:21.100
There was some little previews given of the Destiny expansion.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.100
Not intentionally.

50:22.100 --> 50:27.620
I guess some leaks were found in Destiny through a bug because this game is connected and downloads

50:27.620 --> 50:29.580
patch data.

50:29.580 --> 50:34.180
Some of the information about the next patch has kind of leaked in into the game.

50:34.180 --> 50:38.340
So it looks like there will be a new raid called Crota's End.

50:38.340 --> 50:41.020
It's a level 28 raid that will be on the moon.

50:41.020 --> 50:44.300
And you can see more about this over on YouTube.

50:44.300 --> 50:48.260
Some folks have decoded some of the stuff in the game.

50:48.260 --> 50:54.340
Looks like to get into the story a little bit, I'm trying to say this in a non-spoilery

50:54.340 --> 50:55.940
way.

50:55.940 --> 51:00.780
Something that you work very hard to destroy in the expansion they will try to rebuild.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.460
That's probably the easiest way I can put it.

51:02.460 --> 51:06.040
Very generic plot, but we already know Destiny had one of those anyway.

51:06.040 --> 51:08.140
So there you go.

51:08.140 --> 51:12.700
House of Wolves content being found in the game too, but like literally there's placeholder

51:12.700 --> 51:18.300
text that says moon underscore portal underscore one.

51:18.300 --> 51:25.120
So there's not a lot to be known about that yet, but that's interesting to know that the

51:25.120 --> 51:31.760
expansion is probably coming early next year with this extra raid and extra stuff.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.880
And I really hope it will do something to make the end game a little more exciting in

51:35.880 --> 51:39.360
regards to gearing up and all that.

51:39.360 --> 51:44.320
And the seg in chat says, make sure to process your engrams before Tuesday early morning.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.160
And Rob, you're not spoiling much of the story in this game.

51:47.160 --> 51:49.040
There's not much to spoil.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.880
Exactly I know, I'm just trying to prevent that email.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.880
I was waiting to buy Destiny until I got a PS4 and you went and ruined everything about

51:55.880 --> 51:56.880
the story.

51:56.880 --> 52:02.040
And I'm like, just like put every generic sci-fi story you've ever heard right next

52:02.040 --> 52:03.040
to each other.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.400
And that's like what Destiny is, spoiler alert.

52:05.400 --> 52:08.880
So just saying, like don't play Destiny for the story.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.680
Just don't.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.160
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

52:12.160 --> 52:17.200
Well, how about something that has nothing to do with Destiny?

52:17.200 --> 52:23.320
Obviously, and there's been a lot of, I would say, some anger, some resentment about the

52:23.320 --> 52:25.200
new 3DS.

52:25.200 --> 52:29.760
But they have release dates for them in Australia and New Zealand.

52:29.760 --> 52:34.160
It's going to be out November 21st this year.

52:34.160 --> 52:39.640
And looks like there's going to be, of course, Super Smash Brothers will be out.

52:39.640 --> 52:47.160
The price is going to be, and this is Australian dollars, $219.95 for the regular size of the

52:47.160 --> 52:50.680
revised one, and the XL will be $249.95.

52:50.680 --> 52:58.400
So I don't know, I still think having the system is kind of, I understand they're not

52:58.400 --> 53:02.280
wanting to limit the games by technology, so they're really expecting a lot of people

53:02.280 --> 53:03.760
to put out the money to buy that.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.040
I'm not sure.

53:06.040 --> 53:11.320
I'm hopeful that because they have dates for New Zealand and Australia that happen to take

53:11.320 --> 53:18.080
place this year, that hopefully we'll see release dates for North America as well soon,

53:18.080 --> 53:20.320
because that'd be awesome.

53:20.320 --> 53:27.560
Maybe, hey, Perfect Timing would be around the time that Pokemon, was it Ruby and Sapphire

53:27.560 --> 53:31.560
come out on 3DS?

53:31.560 --> 53:33.960
I don't know.

53:33.960 --> 53:39.480
I'm expecting it to be sometime around the same time over here, but I haven't been too

53:39.480 --> 53:42.240
excited about the news myself.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.000
Are you getting one?

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Not yet.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Not yet.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.960
Just because I already had a 3DS and didn't really play anything on it, but we'll see.

53:50.960 --> 53:56.560
If they have some really good games out for it, maybe the next Zelda game or something.

53:56.560 --> 53:59.680
I don't want to have to redo my puzzles.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.000
So yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.360
I just maxed out all my puzzles.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.360
I don't want to do them.

54:03.360 --> 54:08.880
Well, I think you can transfer your data over to your new system, and maybe that puzzle

54:08.880 --> 54:11.880
data will go over as well.

54:11.880 --> 54:18.960
So this is kind of disappointing, but apparently PlayStation Home is shutting down, both in

54:18.960 --> 54:21.360
the US and Europe.

54:21.360 --> 54:27.080
That's coming out, I guess, ending March 31st, 2015.

54:27.080 --> 54:34.840
Of course, it's already kind of closed, or I think it's closing sooner actually in Japan.

54:34.840 --> 54:40.240
Unfortunately they're going to stop making new content for it on the 12th of November,

54:40.240 --> 54:47.120
and I guess in Europe you'll be able to download your content, or download content, I guess

54:47.120 --> 54:54.320
until the 3rd of December, and as a thank you for supporting the platform, they're going

54:54.320 --> 54:59.720
to have some free stuff that they're going to be releasing prior to its close, and I'm

54:59.720 --> 55:02.120
sure they're going to be doing a lot more stuff with that.

55:02.120 --> 55:06.160
Now, I'm hoping, though, that there's ways to get some of those free PlayStation 1 games

55:06.160 --> 55:10.800
on there, because I remember they used to have several ways to get, was it like Warhawk

55:10.800 --> 55:17.880
and Twisted Metal, and I'm not really sure what the other one was, they had some other

55:17.880 --> 55:24.600
free game that was on there too, but I wanted Twisted Metal.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.960
I don't know how to feel about this whole PlayStation Home thing shutting down, because,

55:27.960 --> 55:30.000
well I mean, it's inevitable, right?

55:30.200 --> 55:33.280
We knew it was going to shut down because we heard before it was going to happen in

55:33.280 --> 55:34.280
Asia, right?

55:34.280 --> 55:38.240
And so, I think we even said then, well, mark your calendars, it's going to happen in the

55:38.240 --> 55:39.640
US too, right?

55:39.640 --> 55:43.920
And so now we have the official word, and I don't know how to feel about it, how to

55:43.920 --> 55:51.060
feel about it, because I feel like there was so much potential with PlayStation Home, and

55:51.060 --> 55:55.200
I know it had a great community behind it, because VOG, we've actually participated in

55:55.200 --> 55:59.160
some of these events in the past, and there were some good people that were playing it

55:59.160 --> 56:04.320
and participating, but there were some things about it that just really bugged me, that

56:04.320 --> 56:07.320
I think always kind of doomed it from the start.

56:07.320 --> 56:11.340
And the fact that it wouldn't load things in the background was one of the huge things

56:11.340 --> 56:12.340
for me.

56:12.340 --> 56:15.920
Like, when you would zone into a new area, you would have to wait 10 minutes for everything

56:15.920 --> 56:16.920
to download.

56:16.920 --> 56:17.920
An update.

56:17.920 --> 56:18.920
Yeah, exactly, an update.

56:18.920 --> 56:24.640
Now, I feel like that's why I'm kind of surprised in a way that it's not graduating to PlayStation

56:24.640 --> 56:29.400
4, because I would think PlayStation 4 seems to be a little more in tune with downloading

56:29.400 --> 56:30.800
things in the background.

56:30.800 --> 56:35.680
It's got a way bigger hard drive built in, so I would think that maybe more of that could

56:35.680 --> 56:36.680
happen.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.560
Rebuild it for PlayStation 4 or something.

56:38.560 --> 56:43.040
But that's not going to happen, because we've heard that folks are going to be out of a

56:43.040 --> 56:44.200
position because of this.

56:44.200 --> 56:48.640
So clearly, when they're closing PlayStation Home, they are closing PlayStation Home, and

56:48.640 --> 56:53.400
it's not going to continue, which, you know, I mean, on one hand, it's like, well, if you

56:53.400 --> 56:57.280
loved PlayStation Home so much, maybe you should have fucking been using it.

56:57.280 --> 57:00.200
But on the other hand, it's like, well...

57:00.200 --> 57:01.840
It was kind of a drag to use it.

57:01.840 --> 57:06.120
On paper, there was so much to really like about PlayStation Home.

57:06.120 --> 57:12.280
Like, and I loved the idea about like, oh, when you unlock trophies, you could have a

57:12.280 --> 57:16.320
virtual trophy cabinet, and, you know, and show these things off.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.800
But that never happened.

57:18.800 --> 57:19.800
It didn't really.

57:19.800 --> 57:24.400
You had some things like, you could achieve things in games that would unlock like a shirt.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.140
Like I seem to remember like in the Namco Museum game on PlayStation 3, that we have

57:28.140 --> 57:29.600
a cameo in, right?

57:29.600 --> 57:33.020
You actually play that and you unlock like a Pac-Man shirt or something that you can

57:33.020 --> 57:34.140
use in Home.

57:34.140 --> 57:37.960
And like, depending on some of the achievements you get, you do get those sorts of tangible

57:37.960 --> 57:38.960
items.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.280
So that in that sense, it's kind of cool.

57:41.280 --> 57:46.260
But I mean, I don't know, like, again, it just it would take like 10 minutes to get

57:46.260 --> 57:47.260
into Home.

57:47.260 --> 57:52.640
And then the clubhouses were limited to what, 25 people, and I couldn't really do anything

57:52.640 --> 57:53.640
with it.

57:53.640 --> 57:58.900
They're going to raise the clubhouse, you know, limit on March 30th.

57:58.900 --> 58:07.920
So looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, the seg says, so many feels and conflicts.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.680
Buddy of mine is getting laid off as he works for that department, which at least he has

58:11.680 --> 58:14.980
an end date and a plan, so he should be better off to make his plan.

58:14.980 --> 58:18.240
And it goes on to say, I wish that trophy cabinet thing happened, but I don't think

58:18.240 --> 58:25.200
any developer was willing slash able to make a full 3D model for a trophy.

58:25.200 --> 58:30.080
Take 3D model from said game, put trophy base on it, done.

58:30.080 --> 58:35.880
Or maybe some really easy, like maybe some generic trophy bases that were already done,

58:35.880 --> 58:40.800
where maybe they could have taken their achievement art from the Xbox 360, right?

58:40.800 --> 58:43.240
Because all those achievements on 360 have art.

58:43.740 --> 58:47.260
And then you could just slap it on a trophy somehow, I don't know, like an easy convert

58:47.260 --> 58:48.260
thing would have been cool.

58:48.260 --> 58:55.620
It would have been that hard and you don't have to support it, you just, I don't know.

58:55.620 --> 59:00.360
It's a bummer to see that they're not going to try to push PlayStation home a little more.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.940
I mean, I get it.

59:01.940 --> 59:05.740
It just wasn't probably making the money and attracting the developers and like seg said

59:05.740 --> 59:10.340
in his comment there, you know, people didn't really want to spend money, you know, artists

59:10.340 --> 59:11.340
are expensive.

59:11.340 --> 59:15.200
They didn't want to spend money to create all these new 3D models and things for home.

59:15.200 --> 59:18.080
It probably just wasn't a good return on investment or whatever.

59:18.080 --> 59:21.200
So I mean, from that standpoint, it makes sense, but it's just kind of, I don't know,

59:21.200 --> 59:24.720
you always kind of feel like maybe, and this might sound like a really weird thing to say,

59:24.720 --> 59:27.700
but maybe home was ahead of its time in a way.

59:27.700 --> 59:29.160
I don't know.

59:29.160 --> 59:32.880
Maybe I'm maybe homeless too much like Second Life.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.080
I don't think it was though.

59:34.080 --> 59:36.720
I think Second Life was was really different.

59:36.720 --> 59:42.020
I do because because home was really more of a celebration of video games, you know,

59:42.020 --> 59:43.740
and Second Life isn't really about that.

59:43.740 --> 59:44.740
But anyway,

59:44.740 --> 59:46.380
Second Life is for furries.

59:46.380 --> 59:51.700
Well, some would argue that home turned out into that type of thing as well.

59:51.700 --> 59:53.820
So I mean, but

59:53.820 --> 59:55.020
everything is for furries.

59:55.020 --> 59:56.020
What are we talking about?

59:56.020 --> 59:59.020
We talk about on this show all the time.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.620
Time to penis, right?

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.220
TTP, time to penis.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.700
You put an internet chat room out there, somebody's going to make a chat room dedicated to cocks.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:12.000
So when you do this type of thing on PlayStation or whatever PlayStation chat room, there are

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.280
going to be chat rooms dedicated to all sorts of things that you can imagine.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.120
And you know, furry when you when you sell these suits and things is one of them.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120
But

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.040
furry things don't have to necessarily be a negative either.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.400
I mean,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.400
I know people, I know people are into that and I don't care what you do, as long as you're

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.020
safe and consensual.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.020
Furries are awesome.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.080
I'm just saying that that's been the biggest thing that I've seen is a very, very big furry

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080
community.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080
Yeah.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.800
Bobby Blackwolf popping in saying Second Life and home are not comparable.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.740
Second Life was all about people building and creating their own experiences.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.380
Home was about people taking in Sony's experiences.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.760
And maybe that a little bit was a part of the problem as well as that I was expecting

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.040
to be able to build a little more of an experience when I got a clubhouse and all that stuff.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.180
And you know, I did see some impressive stuff that was done later on down the line.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:09.340
But I mean, it's still like, how awesome would it have been if we had like a special OLR

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.660
thing, like a little mini video or something that you could only see in our clubhouse,

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.780
that you could like go into the clubhouse or like, if I happen to be playing PlayStation

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:23.540
as well, you know, and I'm there in home, I could actually talk to you instead of like

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.220
typing, I could be sitting at the top at the back of the room and actually talking and

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.920
doing like a podcast in PlayStation home.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.760
But maybe now that Twitch is a thing and we have PlayStation live and all that, that's

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.220
kind of trumped anything that maybe home would have done.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220
I don't know.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.220
So anyhow.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.220
All right.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.220
Well, there it is.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.920
PlayStation home going to be closing.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.360
Let's move on to talk about Bayonetta 2, which as you know, is going to be coming out here

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.160
in the US very soon.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:01.660
Well, Bayonetta 2 actually came out in Japan and Bayonetta 2 sales numbers in Japan.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.760
Honestly, there's no way to spin this.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.500
It's not probably as good as it should be.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.060
Bayonetta 2 sold 67% of their first shipment in Japan.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.380
I guess from that perspective, that's not terrible, but here's the thing.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:20.580
Bayonetta 2 sold 38,828 copies.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:28.560
The original Bayonetta in 2009 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 sold 200,000 copies

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.560
in the same time.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.060
So that's like what?

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.560
Maybe 18, 19% of what the first Bayonetta sold.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.500
Now granted, we have to take into consideration.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.860
There's just not as many Wii U's in Japan out there as there were PlayStation 3's combined

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.860
with Xbox 360.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:49.540
I mean, there weren't a lot of 360s either, but combined with Xbox 360s back then.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:55.180
But still, when you kind of see this that, oh, Bayonetta 2 sold not even 40,000 copies

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.140
in Japan on launch week, it's pretty hard to spin that number positively.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.660
I mean, Loki, what do you think when you hear that number?

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.100
I think that it's just there's not a lot of systems out there and it's not surprising,

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.100
I guess.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:13.420
And sadly, I mean, it's kind of along the lines of Platinum Games and even with the

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420
Wii.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:21.380
Mad World looked like such an awesome game and really hyped up and people were excited

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.660
about it and it didn't sell very well.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.440
And same with, you know, Bayonetta, unfortunately, yeah, there are a lot of people that are fans

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.740
of Nintendo that own a Wii U, but the Wii U is kind of also directed towards more of

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:39.680
like families and kids and unfortunately those aren't the people that are going to be purchasing,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.540
you know, Bayonetta 2.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:47.260
Am I hearing in a way that maybe Nintendo ought to just embrace its status as a family

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.700
friendly game maker?

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.220
Because I mean, there's a lot of people out there that say Nintendo needs to do more hardcore

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220
shit.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.540
Nintendo needs to do stuff that caters to the hardcore gamer.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.540
Well, here they go.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.220
They're doing Bayonetta 2 and then it does this.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.220
No, that's the thing is, yeah, they do need to dedicate themselves a little bit more towards

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.220
hardcore stuff.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:11.180
But the problem was you're forgetting that the hardcore games back when the NES was out

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.340
and stuff were like Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.260
It was their mainstream games that were also, you know, bringing in new people to play them.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:24.340
You just need to make games that kind of bring in both.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:30.060
Like I think, like for example, the, you know, Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker, whatever

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:37.220
that's coming out, I think that kind of, it's more of like an easy, you know, slower paced

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.540
game for everybody else.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.220
Maybe we're just getting too lazy in our game playing that, you know, they're afraid

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:47.220
that too hard, you know, gameplay that's too hard is going to drive off people from playing

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.220
those games.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.220
And the other hand, I think it's good to have gameplay that's hard because it makes you

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.220
a better gamer.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.040
Akuma JP in chat says, what do you expect?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.900
It was on the Wii U.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.900
Maybe that's it in a nutshell.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.900
I don't know.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.860
You know, something we didn't really talk about at the top of the show and this game

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.300
did come out this week was Hyrule Warriors.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.500
And I only didn't talk about it because none of us have bought it yet.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.780
I think I'm the only Wii U owner in the room and I just didn't get around to buying it

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.780
this weekend.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.860
I'm kind of waiting to see a little more, like what the reactions are to the game for

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:20.940
my friends before I decide if I want to plunk $60 on it, which is a lot of money, right?

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.040
So, but I did see the pictures out in New York City where people were lined up around

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.340
the block at that Nintendo World Store for that limited edition thing that not everybody

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.380
didn't even get because Nintendo wasn't anticipating demand being as high as it was.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:37.940
And a bunch of resellers got their hands on those little limited edition figurines for

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.980
Hyrule Warriors or whatever it was they were giving away in New York City.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:47.500
So maybe Bayonetta 2 stands to do a little better here in the U.S. potentially?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.980
I mean, we'll find out in a couple of weeks.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.800
We do know a few things about Bayonetta 2 in advance of the U.S. release here.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:02.860
As if it's any surprise, it has been rated mature by the ESRB due to blood, gore, intense

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:08.300
violence, partial nudity, strong language, and suggestive themes.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:14.140
And there's also an online component, which you could be exposed to unrated user-generated

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.140
content.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:18.020
Here's the official summary.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.740
This is an action game in which players assume the role of an ancient witch that battles

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.980
angels and demons in a fantasy world.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.460
Players use hand-to-hand combat, pistols, giant scythes, axes, and magic to kill enemy

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.580
creatures.

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.620
Players can also perform various finishing moves, which depict exaggerated and intense

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.260
acts of violence.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:41.060
Enemies thrown into spinning spiked wheels, characters decapitated by a guillotine, a

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:47.260
dragon ripping characters apart, large blood-splattered effects and gore can be seen frequently.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.780
During the course of the game, some female characters perform suggestive taunts and poses.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.420
For example, opening their legs, dancing on poles.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.260
Outfits are occasionally shed during battle, with characters' breasts and buttocks partially

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260
exposed.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.820
The words fuck and shit appear in the dialogue.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.340
This game sounds awesome!

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.140
That should be like a searchable tag in eShop.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.220
The words fuck and shit appear in dialogue.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:20.020
Just print that on the back of the box.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:24.860
I mean, come on, characters decapitated by a guillotine and a dragon rips characters

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.380
apart.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.080
Awesome.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.640
One other awesome thing that should be mentioned about Bayonetta 2, as the game is out in Japan,

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.800
people are tearing this apart on YouTube.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:42.440
And get this, there is a Star Fox Easter egg hidden in Bayonetta 2, and apparently it goes

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.960
so far as to like, you're actually playing something that feels like Star Fox within

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.000
the game.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.360
And that is all within Bayonetta 2.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.160
At least they didn't have an F-Zero Easter egg in the game, otherwise you would just

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160
piss me off.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.680
Well, they're saving that for Mario Kart just to piss me off.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.880
That means they probably won't do another one.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.480
But there you go, Bayonetta 2, all the latest on that.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:07.320
Now what's funny is that even though I'm kind of like, on the fence about Hyrule Warriors,

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.360
I'm definitely getting Bayonetta 2.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.680
If for no other reason than what I just read.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.400
And I want the original on Wii U too.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.380
So we can have games that they're not going to make a sequel to, Excite Truck.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.080
They should totally have.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080
What about Excite?

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080
They did have that sequel.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.080
Excite Bots.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.080
Excite Bots.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080
Yeah, that was crap.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.360
I mean, it's a game you make a sandwich in the race, and you throw a pie at a clown,

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.080
or you knock a star, it didn't make any sense.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.880
But it would be awesome to have the Excite truck or Excite Bots as an assist in Smash

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:47.320
Brothers, but Nintendo's not going to actually put their own properties like that in there.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320
Such an awesome racing game.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.500
Alright, let's move on.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.240
We got one more story here, and then we're going to do release dates.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.240
Start Sakura.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.560
How would you ever like to game in your own arena?

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.040
Or at least have a dedicated arena.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.620
The US is finally getting one.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:06.000
I have an arena in my living room, and I don't have to wear pants there.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.040
I don't want to know about your pants off dance off.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.240
It's more of a peen arena.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.360
I even have a little referee, a little furry referee that meows at me when I...

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:24.080
She just looks at you like you're a weirdo, and then runs when people come over, and hides

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.560
under the bed the whole time.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.000
She's such a crazy old lady.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.400
Anyway, so now we get an esports stadium!

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400
Yay!

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.320
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.800
Are you ready to rumble?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800
MLG is putting it out.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:45.800
It's going to be called the MLG.TV arena, which will be 15 minutes away from Ohio State

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.800
University.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.800
Why are they putting it in Ohio?

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.800
I don't know.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.760
Anyway, since Columbus has actually hosted some of their most successful events, they

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.840
said that's where it'll be.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Wasn't Ohio also...

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.520
Wasn't that also the school that did the scholarship program?

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.260
We talked about this a few weeks ago on the show.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.540
That might have been the same school.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.800
That could be why.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.760
Ohio might be some type of hotbed for this stuff that we just don't see here in California.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.440
What else do they have to do in Ohio?

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.560
I know we have listeners there, so...

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.560
Tell us what there is to do in Ohio.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.920
Be sad.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.920
That's Alabama.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.920
That's be sad and go to New Orleans.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.680
You leave the state.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.840
So that's cool that they're putting in a little arena there, but an arena?

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.120
I mean, aren't they going to use the arena for Lady Gaga concerts too?

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.880
If it's only for gaming events, it seems like such a waste of space.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880
You know what I mean?

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.640
Actually Fifth Dream says pantsless dojo.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640
That's the name of my living room.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.360
For the record, I'm not wearing pants.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.120
I'm wearing shorts.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.880
Those guys are wearing pants.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880
Let's see.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.000
The SEG says, woo, tax breaks.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.600
Maybe that's part of it there.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600
Let's see.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.480
What Up G says, the Ohio State marching band.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.560
Oh, that would be some marching bands.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.140
That's something to do in Ohio.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:12.200
And Brad from Pod Culture says, Dark Sakura, Christina is from Cleveland.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
That's okay.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.920
But as I understand it, she moved.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.440
No, I'm just kidding.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.320
God, I don't want angry emails coming from Ohio.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320
No, no, no.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.640
We make fun of all States of the Union.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.920
I make fun of all the States, especially the ones I'm from.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.680
Alabama really gets a ration of shit from me.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.240
We could spend a whole three hours talking about what irritates us about California,

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.040
but people, traffic, that'll be another day.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
All right.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.600
So go around the world and check out some release dates and things that will be coming

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.000
out in every state across the nation.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.800
And then we'll even travel to some other countries.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
Loki.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800
All right.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.520
This week, we've got a few things coming out, including Natural Doctrine, which is on PlayStation

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.960
3, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:05.160
Crimes and Punishments Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.280
Xbox One.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:15.560
We've also got Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax on PlayStation

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:24.680
3 and Xbox 360, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Falling

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:33.480
Skies The Game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus Limited Edition,

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:42.280
the Let's Get Physical Edition, and that's on Vita.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.520
Game on the 3DS called Super Smash Brothers, I'm sure no one's interested in.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520
And then coming out...

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.040
I just love the way you phrased that.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.640
And then since we had, you know, last week, Disney Infinity 2.0, now we're going to have

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640
Skylanders...

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.960
I guess if you want to call it 4.0 or whatever, Skylanders Trap Team, they've got that coming

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:14.240
out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, the Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and even

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.560
if you want to, a tablet version for Android and iOS.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:26.000
And that includes even a little Bluetooth controller, which is kind of cool.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.720
And they have also got that regular and dark editions, if you want to do the limited edition

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720
for that.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720
That's it.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720
All right.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.760
We're going to travel over to Japan and check out the release dates there, but I'm looking

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760
at chat.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.480
We're getting read the Riot Act on Ohio right now in chat.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.680
And guess who doesn't really care?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.240
Let's see.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.840
Kick-ass amusement parks in Ohio, especially Cedar Point, says WhatUpG.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.320
I have heard about that.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.280
And Brad from PodCulture says, got to interview the eighth doctor in Ohio.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:02.160
I love how people get massive, like, butt-hurt wedgies when someone makes a joke about something.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.960
You go in the bathroom and dig out your panties.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.480
Let's find another state to pick on.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480
Where do we not?

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480
Delaware!

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480
Oh, we're in Delaware.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.040
I'm going to go look at the map.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.280
I want to think of a place I've been that I have a beef with.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.780
Where's a place that I've been that I have a beef with?

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.780
You know what?

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.840
I kind of, I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.960
I have a little bit of a beef with Wyoming.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.160
Dan's grandmother's from Wyoming.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160
Really?

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160
Yeah.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
Well, sorry.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
I don't care.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
I've never been there.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160
Anyway.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Moving on.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.160
How about Stockton?

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160
How about, yeah.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.160
That's not a state.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:41.640
I can think of a ton of places in California that are way worse than any of these states

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.640
that we're talking about.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.080
Stockton's near the top of the list, honestly.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.320
Or like, fucking, can we talk for a minute about Bakersfield?

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320
Oh my god.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.560
Biggest source of boring ever.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560
Anyway.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.800
Sorry to, I think we actually have a listener in Bakersfield.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.320
Sorry, but you know, you know.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.320
You know.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:05.880
The only thing that I would ever go to Bakersfield for was because they had a Sonic, and then

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880
we got Sonic.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.040
So that was good.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.880
Yeah, the only reason to go to Modesto is that's the only Dunkin Donuts now in all

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880
of Northern California.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.160
We went to the Madera County Fair on purpose once.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.440
To see where it all.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.320
Tigerclaw in chat says, what about Sacramento?

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320
Hey, fuck you.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320
You know what?

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320
Sacramento's awesome.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:30.000
I'm kind of, you know what, I'm kind of with you a little bit.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.400
Sacramento's kind of just like, eh.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.000
You know what, though, is near Fresno?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.480
You know what, Tigerclaw?

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.560
Don't fucking get me started on Florida.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.960
Do not get me started on your home state of Florida.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960
Do not.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960
But.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:49.040
Like, we could talk about Florida more than the other 49 states combined.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040
Anyway.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.040
Yes, Dark Sakura?

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.040
Nothing.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040
Florida man.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040
Florida woman.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040
I'm done.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.640
All right, let's talk about Japan.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.520
Japan has a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 that might be of interest to Dark Sakura.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.120
Are you a fan of Quintet, Dark Sakura?

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Quintet?

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.120
Yeah, I thought you, uh.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120
Quartet.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120
Oh.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280
It's Quintet.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280
But I guess, uh.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.760
Quartet's an action-adventure game, not a dating sim with dancing girls.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.240
I guess, yeah, this dancing girl game is not really something that would be up your alley.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.400
I don't know, but it looks like at one point they're, like, fighting a tentacle monster,

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400
so.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400
What, with the power of dance?

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Yeah.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400
There's something.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.200
Anyway, the game is actually called Omega Quintet, and it comes out.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200
And it says it's Quartets by Sega.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.440
All right, there you go.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440
So they're different.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440
I got them mixed up.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440
Oh, well.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:45.080
Mixing elements of the idle simulation and JRPGs into a brand new IP.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:51.120
Takuto manages to protect the verse maidens, five pop idols, who have the ability to defeat

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.680
the invading Beep, that's what it's called, the Beep, with the power of their song and

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.040
dance.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.640
This game sounds awesome.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.520
I wish the PlayStation 4 wasn't region locked.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.520
I hope there's some streams on PlayStation.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520
Isn't that on, oh.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.200
This is on PlayStation 4, believe it or not.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.640
Let's see, looking at some other games coming out in Japan, is that coming out on the Xbox

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640
One?

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.960
Looking at Xbox One releases, no.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.280
But Forza Horizon 2 gets its release in Japan this week.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.480
So look forward to that.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:25.360
On the PlayStation 3 on October 2nd, Kingdom Hearts 2.5 remix gets its release in Japan.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.960
I did not realize that was this soon in Japan.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.760
And there's also a 1.5 and 2.5 starter pack coming out.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.240
And you can import that here in the US for 150 bucks.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.280
Is that the 4.0 pack?

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280
Right.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.960
That's what it adds up to, right?

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.800
So that must be the case.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.000
Let's see, on the Wii U, nothing to report this week on the Wii U, unless I read the

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
list wrong.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
No, I did not read it wrong.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.680
There's nothing on the Wii U this week.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:56.880
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Nikketsu Ino Bukkatsu Tan Trigger Kiss comes out this

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.320
week on the Vita.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.080
And lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.160
Hot blooded something.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.600
Let's see, there is Kinken no Maguna and Nozotoki Battle Tori Densetsu no Makyuu wo

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Fukkatsu Saseo comes out.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600
You want me to look up with that?

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.240
It's an Amco Bandai game.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.440
It looks like Explore the Pyramids.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.920
It looks like some type of Temple Run game on the 3DS sort of thing.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:31.600
But maybe less Temple Run and more like puzzle minigame Egyptian tomb.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.600
That's what it is.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.160
All right, let's travel over to the UK, DarkSagra.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:44.960
On the 30th, Chariot on PS4 and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on PC and October 1st, Chariot

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.400
on Xbox One and I think that's it.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.720
All right, let's see, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.440
game of the week.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.640
I'm looking at the states of the union argument going on in our chat right now.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.680
Oh my gosh.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.680
What about Alaska?

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680
I'm about to leave chat.

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.600
What, uh, PlayStation 4 is region free, is it?

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.240
I thought it was region locked.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.440
No.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.120
I thought that was a big change in the new generation is that they were region locked.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120
I know the PS3 wasn't.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.640
PS4 and Xbox One are not region locked.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.200
Holy shit, I might have to, uh, well I don't really understand Japanese though.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.520
I'm gonna have a hard time playing that game probably.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.520
Which game?

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520
Uh, the Quintet.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520
Oh.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.520
RPG.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.120
It's gonna like totally be in Japanese and I don't, you guys hear how horrible I am at

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.680
speaking and I don't understand it at all.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.680
All right.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.280
Anyhow, uh, let's go to those two more stories here.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
Loki.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.080
Well, unlike, uh, this should be something that people are getting used to on the Wii

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:49.680
U unfortunately, um, Ubisoft has confirmed that the bad blood downloadable content for

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.680
Watch Dogs will not be coming to the soon to be released Wii U version of the game.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:02.800
And um, no, the Wii U version does not have DLC they confirmed and, um, they haven't really

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.880
said why.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.920
But they've done that in the past I thought with Assassin's Creed where they didn't have

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.200
a DLC for that maybe or was it Batman?

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.580
One of those didn't have DLC even though Batman's not technically a Ubisoft game but it's kind

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.580
of weird.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.420
I guess they just don't want to port it over.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.480
Maybe they think that they're not gonna make their money back or something or maybe, I

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.940
don't know.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:30.340
But yeah, they're lackluster support for the Wii U now and even more, less support

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:33.300
for any sort of download content for said games.

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.700
Why are they even bothering to release this game on the Wii U?

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.940
I think because it was, I think this is one of those games that was done already and they're

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.980
just waiting to release it.

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:42.980
Which is stupid.

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.140
I don't understand why.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:48.060
It's gonna be an embarrassment and then people are gonna point at it and go, well this is

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.580
why we don't release games on the Wii U because this is how they sell.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:58.300
Yeah, because you totally treated it like the bastard kid of the family, like it's gross

01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.300
what they're doing with this.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.900
They did that with Rayman Legends last year.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.140
Uh huh.

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.220
And is, uh, why bother?

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.100
Or do a digital only release or something, save yourself the fucking trouble.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:13.300
I think this is literally the last game that they have slated for the Wii U right now.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300
Just Dance, I'm sure.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.700
Well yeah, Just Dance will be coming out because they make their money on the Wii U and Wii

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.380
for that but that's pretty much it.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:27.420
Well still though, this comes out after Just Dance 2015 or whatever it's called this year.

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:32.220
So it is technically the last Wii U game that they have slated right now.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.300
Maybe they're gonna go that way where they're just gonna, you know, they supported them

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.780
all this time but now they're just gonna cut support for the Wii U.

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.780
Which is sad.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.900
Well I'm just saying it's kind of their own damn fault.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.160
Yeah.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.540
When you set games up to fail, surprise, they're gonna fail.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.540
Why even bother at this point?

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:55.740
I mean, it's coming out so far after, you know, the launch of the, you know, Watchdog

01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.900
game on the other systems so I don't understand what's the point of running out.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:06.020
I mean, as much as I want to see Nintendo succeed and I want to see, I mean Nintendo's

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.260
got a lot of their own stuff that's gonna, you know, keep the Wii U afloat for a couple

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.260
of years, so whatever.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.940
I kind of just hope this game doesn't sell a single copy.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.460
That's not gonna happen, but yeah, it won't sell a lot of copies, you know, maybe a few

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.720
thousand.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.980
I think though, I mean that just kind of cements support that yeah, these games aren't gonna

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:27.980
do that well.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:31.380
But at the same time though, they're kind of, Ubisoft is kind of going this route where

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.300
they're doing these really huge games, aside from, you know, like the Assassin's Creed

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:41.820
and Far Cry franchises and stuff, but like they've got a few MMO-like games coming out

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.820
already.

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:47.260
They've got, was it The Division and they've also got The Crew coming out.

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:53.180
And both of those are gonna be these really vast multiplayer games, of which they're not

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.780
even gonna try to port that stuff over.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.140
I just, I don't know.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.060
Maybe they're just too ambitious in their, what they want to do on console I guess.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.360
But, indies, indies will save the day I guess because, you know, Nintendo's gonna save their

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.100
own stuff with first party stuff.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:14.060
I mean when the new Zelda next year comes out, it's gonna, you know, they've got enough

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.980
stuff to keep themselves afloat I think, but they're really probably gonna be thinking

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.500
on the drawing board how to get the third parties back with whatever they do next.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:29.940
And also, let's just say that, hypothetically speaking, VR, retail VR takes off, once again

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:36.220
they're gonna be behind the game, well, technically they were ahead of the game, but yeah, that

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.620
wasn't, you know, much of an attempt.

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.020
So I don't know.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:45.860
It's gonna be interesting to see what they do to, I mean Zelda will help, but let's just

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.580
say Zelda doesn't help enough, then what?

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.420
Then they rush that new system, I don't know.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.260
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VOG Network.com,

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.860
use the passphrase, Sunday.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.180
Alright, moving on to another game that won't be on Wii U, that's for sure, but it will

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.580
be on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.660
We talked a lot about this game last week, coming off Tokyo Game Show, that's Final Fantasy

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.940
15.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.180
And some more details have come out since Tokyo Game Show, just a little bit more about

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.180
it.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:22.300
Right now, the director, Hajime Tabata, estimates that Final Fantasy 15 is like 55% complete,

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:27.140
which I kind of sit there and go, it's been this long and it's only 55% complete, so when's

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.980
this game coming out, like 2020 or when?

01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.100
But obviously, it's, you know, the number's been held back a little bit because they've

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:40.260
had to reboot a few times, you know, and they say this is not the same game, the director's

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:43.700
different, the platform switched to the current gen, and because the platform changed, we

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.660
had to re-evaluate some things, so this is why, you know, it seems like the number's

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.340
so low, although it really does seem like we're gonna get this game next year, I mean,

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.820
we know the demo's coming in the early part of the year, so it may be a holiday release,

01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:01.700
we'll see, I don't know, 55% right now, it may or may not, who knows.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:07.540
Also, the road trip-like atmosphere is meant to inspire a sense of freedom in players,

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:12.580
and the open world elements are restrained a little bit for the sake of narrative, so

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.020
don't expect the game to be completely open world, but I'm assuming it's not gonna be

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:21.660
quite as bad as Final Fantasy XIII's first 10 hours either, so we'll see with that.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.940
Combat, you do not just simply press a button once for a single action to happen, it's a

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.300
continuous flow of movement.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.560
You have to push it several times.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.220
It's more about the movements that are associated with the buttons and building upon them for

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:39.140
actions to go through the combat system, that, well, I mean, that really is gonna be different.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:43.180
That reminds me of, like, was it Xenogears, remember Xenogears, where they had, like,

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:48.180
a combo system where you would, you know, tap different button presses to do different

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.180
attacks?

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:50.180
That was kinda cool.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:55.460
So, uh, they are saying that Episode Duske, I don't know how to even say that word, this

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.900
is gonna be the demo that comes out for the game, and they're gonna say it's an hour's

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.860
worth of narrative content, but three to four hours of gameplay if you fully explore the

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.060
game's world.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.220
And the demo.

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.060
That's a pretty impressive thing.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:13.500
That's longer than fuckin' ground zeroes, so, bravo to you for giving that away for

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.500
free.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.500
Well, free in quotes, because it's with the Final Fantasy Type 0.

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.340
But they are also gonna have the demo available afterwards, remember?

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.820
Oh, that's right, that's right.

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.480
Also, a lot of memes and things coming out about the Broad Trip that we saw in the Tokyo

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.940
Game Show trailer, I just kinda wanted to say on that, like, I'm sure that's probably

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.780
part of the story, but I think it's also one part, and I think we'd be a little silly

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:42.500
to assume that's gonna be the entire game, is Broad Trip, Final Fantasy Broad Trip, because

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:47.780
in that first trailer we saw for the game, where they announced that it changed from,

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:53.820
you know, versus 13 to 15, we saw a lot of other stuff that wasn't just that.

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:58.180
So, just kinda throwing that out there, that I would expect that maybe the Broad Trip is

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.820
what we'll see in the demo, but I imagine there's gotta be more to it.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:09.820
So, all right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane, back to a time where, you know,

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.220
you didn't have four hour demos of games, you read about them in Nintendo Power, that

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:20.100
was your option, because they're not gonna produce a cartridge with a four hour demo

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.100
in it.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.180
That's right, it's the classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer's gonna step into

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:27.940
the gaming vault and find a game, and she thinks, hey, you should check out this game

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:28.940
this week.

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:32.780
Forget all this new shit, this is all stupid.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.020
Check out this classic.

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:38.460
Dark Soccer, back on her CPS kick this week, yes?

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.460
CPS2.

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:46.140
The game is 1944 The Loop Master, which is a vertical scrolling shooter made by Capcom,

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:52.280
it came out in 2000, and this actually was not programmed by Capcom, but done by Rising.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:58.280
It's the fifth of a series of World War II shooters that Capcom made in the 19XX series.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:07.160
It actually is the sequel to 19XX The War Against Destiny, and it has a lot of the same

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:16.660
planes, including the P-38 Lightning and Mitsubishi A6M-0, but does not include the De Havilland

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.060
Mosquito and the Q-Shooter J7W.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.700
Those were replaced by others.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:29.260
So basically it's just your standard shooter, you know, you shoot planes, tanks, battleships,

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:35.820
other boats, other things, but it's a lot more like the earlier games as opposed to

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.060
19XX.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:43.500
You get the different stats for the planes, each of them operate equally, one is the first

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:48.820
or second player, and they do have the form change that was in 19XX.

01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:53.540
You hold the fire button, charge it until it's full, and then the plane will fly up

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.060
and become temporarily invincible.

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:59.620
It also has a bomb button that uses Tomahawk missiles.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:05.520
You also have the wingmen in the game as well, where you get a small golden plane icon that

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.900
comes down the screen that will release a wingman icon.

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:15.060
And that gives you firepower, but they are vulnerable to enemy fire, and in stage 8 they

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060
fire laser shots.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:20.340
There are 15 stages in the game.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.840
On the arcade board actually you get an option to start from 1, 6, or 11.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:31.380
If it's set to endless, then you can also choose 1, 2, or 3, and of course with different

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.200
difficulties you go through.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:41.020
And after destroying the level 15 boss, you actually get back to stage, the first stage,

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.020
it's a loop.

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.380
Therefore, you can play the game endlessly.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.320
And the enemies will fire more rapidly if it's set to endless.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.100
So it's the loop master for a reason.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.800
And that's it.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.660
So you do eventually master the loop when you beat the game, because everything comes

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.660
full circle.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.660
So there it is.

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.100
Alright, I forgot about this one.

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.540
I mean, I of course know the 1944 shooters.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:13.380
You know, one of them was on the NES, it was 1942, 43, maybe both of them, but I forgot

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:14.380
about 44.

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.380
Yeah.

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:21.840
Well, technically the big one that a lot of people do remember in the series is 19XX as

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:27.940
far as the arcade ones go, because that one got really big right around that time.

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:31.220
The loop master was a little bit, I'd say lesser known.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:35.220
Well, XX was also a little bit more like Raiden, I think, wasn't it?

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.220
It was.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:42.300
It had a lot more of that just sort of fantastical element to it.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:47.180
This is like fun though, and it does the widescreen thing too, which is a very different look

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.780
from the other 19 games, so.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.380
It's also on a arcade cabinet sitting right behind you.

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.380
Is it?

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.460
Is it really?

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:58.180
I gotta get my little booster thing that I was supposed to get this weekend and didn't,

01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.180
so.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.620
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, 1944, the loop master.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.300
There you go.

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:05.300
You master the loops.

01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:11.380
Just like you do at Cedar Point, apparently, there, in 1944.

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.140
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:16.820
When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come, including rapid fire

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:23.020
news, the FUGAL QUESTION OF THE WEEK, talk about Minecraft clones on some big consoles,

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:29.340
and it sounds like maybe League of Legends getting another Supernanny step for the very

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:35.180
naughty players, and, and, SCIENCE, when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.660
Alright, after this.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:48.500
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, September the

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:56.460
28th, 2014, our 569th show, already in progress, and we're gonna get to some rapid fire news.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.260
But let me, let me ask this question of, of Dark Soccer and Loki and, and all the folks

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:04.880
that are listening live tonight, do I, do I need to get Orange Lounge Radio and Ello?

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.320
Is that, is that where the, is that where the internet's going?

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.320
Do I need, does, do we need an O-L-R-L-O?

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320
No.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.320
Why not?

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320
Because we don't.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.320
Wouldn't it be like an O-L-O-R?

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320
O-L-O-R?

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh, I like that one.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That's good.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Uh, but, no, I mean, I guess, I guess people have kind of had it with Facebook and, and

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.320
are talking to these other social networks, although I have an LO account.

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.320
If you want to follow me on LO, I'm Rob Roberts, it's not a video, you're not going to find

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320
anything.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.320
Mine's Dark Soccer.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.560
Yeah, you're not going to find anything on there that exciting.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.240
Maybe a selfie or two.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.040
I, I, uh, submitted a request to get one, just, oh, fuck of it.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.560
I'm sure her, I could get you an invite if you really want one.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.560
I don't really care.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.440
I just, you know, put myself on there.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440
I mean, whatever.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.120
But here's, okay, so here's the thing with that is that, like, everybody's talking like,

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:57.360
oh, you know, Facebook's screwed because everybody's going to LO, but like, LO isn't Facebook.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.800
LO is missing a lot that Facebook has, and not that I'm saying, you know, we should all

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.840
kneel and worship at the altar of Facebook, because believe me, there's a lot about Facebook

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.280
that pisses me off.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.600
And that whole rabble rabble you're hearing with the drag queens about the real name policy,

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.600
guess what?

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.860
It doesn't just affect drag queens.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.480
It affects roller derby girls.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.320
It affects transgender individuals.

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.780
It affects people that are trying to hide from stalkers.

01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:30.320
It affects sassy internet podcasters who don't feel like using their real name to keep their

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.920
online life separate, you know?

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.960
It affects the luchador industry.

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.440
It affects a lot of people.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:41.100
And so I think people are, and what really pissed me off personally is when Zuckerberg

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:46.600
in some, some interview or something had the audacity to say, if you don't use your real

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.440
name, you don't have integrity or something like that.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.320
And like, I don't have a middle finger big enough for that guy after hearing that because

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.480
it's like, okay, says the guy who literally wrote a business after, you know, using people's

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.800
personal information and profiting off that.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800
Wait a second.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.800
I don't have integrity because I use the name that people know me by on my Facebook.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.520
People are convinced this is my name, which I'm fine with.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.280
I completely forgot this.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.680
So the website's L O dot co or L loco.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680
Yeah, it is.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.680
It is.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680
It's perfect for the luchadors.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:18.680
It's perfect.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.680
L loco.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.880
I love it.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.040
And then, uh, let's see.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.940
So, uh, and then, uh, VXJ's next V links to one of those articles that talks about the

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:31.320
dark side of L O, which I always am going to anticipate whenever something starts to

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.600
grab momentum, there's always going to be that article about the dark side.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.780
I'm calling it L loco from now on.

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:44.960
It's seriously, it's L loco and act, act deaf actually says he, it's a real thing.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.620
Even though I was joking about it and he has luchador friends.

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620
That's awesome.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.920
And, uh, VXJ's next V says the food glow question of the week.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.280
Uh, probably not.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.720
I don't, unless L O really catches some more steam and fixes some of these other things

01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.720
they've got going on.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.780
I don't really see us.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:06.880
My weekly O L R is on today post on L O. Did you see it?

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.480
I did, but I couldn't, I couldn't retweet it and I couldn't favorite it.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.880
That's why I removed the retweet or repost or whatever, because whatevs.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.880
Yeah.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:17.880
All right.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:18.920
So anyway, there you go.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.520
A little, little L O talk.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.240
I'll be curious to see how L O is doing in seven days.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.240
We'll see.

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.520
In the meantime, let's talk about some other gaming news going on around the industry back

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520
to games.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.280
And I don't, I don't think I've seen any video game companies on L O yet.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.280
So we'll see.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280
All right.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280
Let's move on now.

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.280
Loki.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280
Hey, what do you know?

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.200
There's an actual guitar game coming out for PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200
Yes.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.000
They're porting Rocksmith 2014 to PlayStation four and Xbox one's going to be coming out

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.280
a little bit later this year.

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:54.200
And um, I guess this was outed through the ESRB listing for the game.

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.040
So cool.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.760
And uh, maybe the DLC will transfer as well for that stuff.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760
So I'm pretty cool.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:05.400
And I'm assuming that it comes with the, you know, the USB thing that plug into your guitar

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.400
too.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.360
So rock on.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.120
Um, so Xbox live games with gold for October, they've got a few games coming out, uh, for

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:18.920
Xbox three 60 members will get, uh, Darksiders two and battlefield bad company.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.080
Of course, battlefield bad company being the first game, um, that's available from October

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:28.280
first through the 15th and Darksiders two from the 16th through the 31st.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:36.520
Um, and then for Xbox one it, uh, for you, which, uh, chariots is going to be the game

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.960
that's going to be coming out.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.680
And that was actually a, one of the, uh, ID at Xbox games.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.920
So God love those indie games.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.000
I'm surprised we haven't seen an actual retail Xbox one game yet, or maybe we're just not

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.240
at that point yet since the system hasn't even been out for a year yet to be fair.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.400
We haven't had a retail PlayStation four game either on PlayStation plus yet.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.600
So there's, nobody's kind of broken that barrier yet, although I don't know what's, what's

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:08.200
happening with drive club because they're going to get, it's like a, uh, stripped down

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.360
version, I guess like a demo, it's like a Ridge racer Vita version of the game, if you

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.360
will.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:19.080
Um, you know where they're going to have a few cars, a few tracks, and you can purchase

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.000
the rest piecemeal, or you can purchase just an upgrade, the upgrade to the full version,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.840
but it's not going to be as much as buying the full version of the game, I guess.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.840
Interesting.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.320
Um, I mean, it's cool that they have that kind of a demo out there, um, and, uh, battlefield

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.480
bad company too, and dark sires, you haven't played those yet, despite the fact that dark

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.600
sires two has been sitting in my steam library forever now, but I still haven't played it

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600
shock.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.640
Um, such as the way of the steam library and, and you know, me, you know, I've just like

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.960
every month that they have free stuff, we're going to download that.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.920
I got download, I got download that I'm like, I'm not going to play these games on my X-Box

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920
got up.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920
I got them all.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.920
It's seriously.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.920
It's like, Oh God, I get that.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.480
Cause what, what if I want to play that one day then I'm going to, I need it, you know,

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480
so seriously.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.000
Um, but yeah, might as well, I mean, it's free, you know, and, and that's the thing

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.800
is like when I was, uh, you know, through my retail job and still not retail, but through

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:18.280
my job at work, um, I get Microsoft training and stuff that I do on my own.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.880
And each year they have a accreditation program for X-Box and what's the reward for finishing

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.880
that?

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880
You're alive.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.720
So I'm always, you know, got live gold aside.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.560
I wish they had that on Sony's end because I could use some PlayStation plus right now.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560
That's it.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.680
Um, Oh, and then, um, last but not least, um, even though it's already been announced

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.360
that, you know, Amazon is purchasing twist, they have finished their acquisitions.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:49.120
So money's changed hands or at least some of that and is now owned by Amazon.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:57.980
So cool is officially part of the Amazon collective, which is, I like Amazon well enough.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:01.200
So again, I'm curious to see if being a prime member is going to get me any perks.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.640
I, you know, I don't know if they will do anything because Amazon does own other companies,

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.400
like for example, Zappos, and they really haven't done anything with that.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.640
Aside from, you know, they own it, but nothing has really changed.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.640
Very true.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640
Very true.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.640
All right.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:18.480
Well, moving on to some other news, uh, you know, Super Smash Brothers 3DS is coming out

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.560
here in the States soon, but it's been out in Japan for about a week now and, uh, there's

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.460
some glitches that are being found inside the game.

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.600
And one of them, uh, is apparently there's a glitch in the game where you will hear a

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:38.200
cheer, uh, a taunter, not really cheer, but like an audience, um, demand or chant an audience

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.000
chant for the ice climbers.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.300
Well, as you know, the ice climbers are not in the new Smash Brothers game.

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.760
So, uh, that is very interesting.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.120
Uh, we've heard that, you know, they were supposed to be in there, but that the 3DS

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.000
didn't really have the processing power to keep them in.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.880
Maybe the Wii U will have it though.

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.880
Maybe the Wii U.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.520
Although isn't it supposed to be cross, can you play like, uh, versus someone on the Wii

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.520
U?

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.520
No, I don't think so.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:08.120
Although they wanted to really keep the games in parody, maybe DLC on, like, maybe DLC

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120
that only works with the new 3DS or something.

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.120
I mean, I don't know.

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.120
I'm getting really crazy with that.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.400
I just can't believe that that can't support, like, I don't even get that, that they can't...

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.120
I'm sorry, that character's too complex.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.120
I mean, why?

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.120
It's just two characters.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.280
Well, because the problem was with all four people playing ice climbers is when it was

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.280
a problem.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280
Oh.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.280
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.280
Yeah.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.280
So, anyhow.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.640
Uh, so yeah, you can, uh, hear that.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.640
That's pretty cool.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.160
Uh, anyhow.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:40.560
Um, also on Super Smash Brothers, uh, this will probably surprise nobody, uh, some people

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:46.560
finding in the Japanese version there's a stage DLC content in the ROM dump.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.040
So apparently, uh, there are some stages that will appear later on through DLC.

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:54.220
Well, I mean, that seems like a big duh, doesn't it?

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.960
Also a duh.

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.640
Content for LittleBigPlanet 3!

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:03.080
Uh, yes, LittleBigPlanet 3, of course, coming very soon to PlayStation 4, what, November

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.080
18th?

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.080
I believe is when the game's out.

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.460
And, uh, there will be some Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes Sackboy stuff.

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:14.280
So yeah, you can, uh, put a little eye patch on your Sackboy and you can have your little

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.480
Sackboy tank and all this other stuff.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480
So that's pretty cool.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.080
Skull Face, Miller Outfits, uh, the game releases on November 18th, of course, LittleBigPlanet.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.520
We don't know when these come out, but it will be soon.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.800
Also, um, Order 1886 costume is supposed to be a part of that too.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:32.800
That's pretty neat.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:38.040
And lastly, what would you say if I said Suikoden 6?

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.040
Hmm.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.080
I would say there's a lot of characters in it.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.080
That's right.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.200
Well, unfortunately, I'm not here to tell you that Suikoden 6 is happening.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.120
Uh, what I'm telling you is that, uh, Yuichi Haga, who's the online content producer for

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.840
Konami Digital Entertainment, was doing a livestream for Suikoden 2, and of course there

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.640
was a ton of questions about Suikoden 6.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:04.800
And no update, sadly, about this RPG being developed, but Japanese fans apparently associate

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:10.640
Suikoden with the Konami brand more than any other franchise, meaning Metal Gear, Pro Evo

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.480
Soccer, Castlevania, and yes, even DDR, uh, it gets, uh, not as associated as much as

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.480
Suikoden does.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.760
They tried to forget about Silent Hill lately.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.760
Apparently.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.760
Until the PT.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760
Yeah, until PT.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.080
And, uh, here in the US, I would think, oh my gosh, people have to think like Castlevania

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.080
before they would think of Suikoden.

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.040
Don't get me wrong, I love Suikoden, but, you know.

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.360
Castlevania and Gradius, maybe?

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.360
I don't know.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.800
But nowadays, I guess they would think Metal Gear, I would imagine.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.000
Metal Gear.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.880
By the way, Suikoden 5, eight years ago on the PlayStation 2, was the last entry in the

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.880
series.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.160
Uh, why was, why was Suikoden 2 being streamed?

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.560
Well, it was to show the head of honchos in Japan that fans are interested in the re-release

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.440
of the game as a digital offering on the Sony Entertainment Network store, because the game

01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.720
was rated for PS3 and PlayStation Portable, but it never actually came out, which kinda

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.720
sucks.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.560
And if Shane was in the studio, I'm sure he would be having a cry, because I know he loves

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560
Suikoden 2.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.840
But then he'd just be like, whatever, I can play my PSP version.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:16.040
I can't imagine there would be that much work to put, like, any of those games on the PlayStation

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.040
store.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040
I mean...

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.360
I have heard that it is incredibly easy to get a game on PlayStation 3.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.360
Just put everything.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.040
Fuck, if it doesn't sell, who cares?

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.080
Not on PS, but like, what are those, like, PS1 is incredibly easy process.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.240
Just like, yeah, just seriously put everything that you have.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.560
Why hold yourself back?

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.480
That, that, that, I mean, I guess the only re- that, that kind of boils it down, like,

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:41.320
with, uh, you know, the e-sh, I guess the eShop and the Virtual Console releases.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.600
Like, I never understood, I mean, they do a little bit more now, I guess, but I never

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.080
understood why, if it was so easy to put that stuff on there, why didn't you just dump a

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080
whole bunch of stuff?

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.600
I guess maybe, you know, they'd lose stuff, but I, they don't really have regular releases.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.160
It's like, maybe a couple games each week, if we're lucky, a few, a couple games each

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160
month.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160
I don't know, I just don't...

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.240
And now with PlayStation Now, but, I mean, I, I understand that PlayStation Now is supposed

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.360
to bring trophy support to old games and things like that, I mean, we're not seeing it yet.

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.360
That would be a little bit more complicated.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.600
That would be a little more complicated, but, um, hopefully some games will do it.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.760
Maybe that's something they're holding Suikoden for, who knows?

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.000
I mean, if they announce that Suikoden was, like, one of the first PS2 games on PlayStation

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.640
Now, it would definitely give that service a big kick in the butt, like, in the up direction,

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640
I think.

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.540
Whereas a lot of people are bitching about the price now and all that stuff, I mean,

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:34.680
if they sold Suikoden 2 at a flat fee with, like, trophy support and shit on PlayStation

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.580
Now, that's a huge boost for the service, I think.

01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:41.840
But of course, I'm being very tinfoil-hat with that, but, you know, could be a thing,

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.840
could be a thing.

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:43.840
Uh, DarkSakura.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:51.280
Well, uh, Sega 3D Classics was, uh, released, well, announced in Japan for a retail release,

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.360
which will include, uh, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Outrun, Streets of Rage, Shinobi II,

01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:02.480
Echo the Dolphin, um, Space Harrier, I already said Space Harrier, um, Outrun, uh, I already

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.480
said Outrun, too, didn't I?

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480
Yeah.

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480
Whatever.

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.240
Um, anyway, um, thank you, List, for being redundant.

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:14.480
Um, but anyway, it will be, uh, 3980 yen, um, and will be out December 18th for the

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.520
Nintendo 3DS, and hopefully we will hear about a US release before too long.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.800
But I can tell you, if it's the same one as the Sega Ages release that came out, um,

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.360
those 3D versions of Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone are really good.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:30.680
A bunch of fans have said, you know what, not having Mother 4 is shit, so they're making

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.680
it themselves.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:36.960
Um, there's a fan-made project that's going to be out on PC, Mac, and Linux for free,

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:42.160
and it will basically be faithful to the story and art style of the last Mother games.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.600
And last but not least, the bundle I just bought was the Humble Bundle weekly, uh, female

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.960
protagonist bundle.

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:56.720
It's called the Leading Ladies Bundle, and, um, so it has, uh, Ms. Splosion Man, uh, Lily

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:04.280
Looking Through, uh, RPG Defenders Quest, Valley of the Forgotten, um, and the Cat Lady,

01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:07.280
which I kind of wanted for a while, so I just got it just to get Cat Lady.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:15.000
Um, you can pay, uh, 6 bucks or more and get the Yogg and, or, uh, Long Live the Queen.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.320
If you pay 10 bucks or more, you get, uh, the, uh, Valda's Story, Abyssal City.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.800
So a good portion of the proceeds will go to Girls Make Games charity.

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.800
Go get it.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.640
Buy lots of it.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.640
I love the Humble Bundle.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.480
They have a lot of good stuff on there.

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:35.760
Oh, it's a great way to contribute to my Steam library of games that I intend on playing

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.760
at some point.

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.200
Yeah, see, like, I wanted to buy the new Humble Bundle, but there's just too many repeats

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.840
for stuff that I have already.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.960
Uh, SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, uh, responding to one of the other things

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.760
you talked about, DarkSakura, uh, SGA100Matt says, ETA to the shutdown order of that Mother

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:52.760
Project.

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.760
Yes.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:54.760
Sadly, with Nintendo involved.

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.040
That's why you don't announce those things.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.880
You just do it and release it.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.600
When it's on the internet, it's done.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.600
Exactly.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.080
Maybe they're, maybe they're trying to recruit help.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.480
That's probably part of the reason.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.560
And so they have to kind of put it out there to recruit the help because, you know, you

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.200
got to work for free with stuff like that.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.040
So that's why you use a project name and not, I don't know.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.040
Yeah.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.040
Might be hard though.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.040
All right.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.040
Uh, let's get to the foogle.

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.040
Sorry.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.480
Not the fugello, but the foogle.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480
The foogle question.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480
Someday maybe.

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480
I like that.

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:28.200
Foogle horn question of the week.

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:35.320
Did you ever play a foogle horn, DarkSakura?

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.840
I know you played a lot of instruments.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.840
No.

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.840
I've eaten bugles though.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.840
Does that count?

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.840
Delicious.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:42.840
Not quite.

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.840
They're very corny, I guess.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.840
Like your jokes.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.840
All right.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.440
Uh, you take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam those together, you get foogle plus

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.720
and the foogle question of the week.

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.080
Uh, let's get to it.

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:59.040
Every week we ask a question and this week is about PlayStation Home and we asked, will

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040
you miss it?

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040
Did you ever give it a try?

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.400
Are you sad to see it go?

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.400
Why or why not?

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.640
Uh, we'll start off over on Facebook with Burr who says, I always found it amusing when

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:11.760
people would compare Home to Second Life, only look at the graphics missing the point

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.080
late that the latter is all user created.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.720
Make some tired joke about flying dongs and declare Home superior.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.160
Meanwhile, Second Life is still alive and its graphics have improved to a point surpassing

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.160
Home.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.680
KJ says, I won't miss PlayStation Home.

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.280
Well, maybe the 49 cents I paid for a ninja costume.

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.240
I miss my 49 cents frown.

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.220
Are you going to miss your Santa Claus outfit, Logie?

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:39.120
My guy seriously looks like a drunken, uh, like hobo Santa.

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:42.840
So it'll be, it'll make sense if I'm PlayStation homeless.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.900
All right.

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.440
Let's go to Segg next who gave us two answers.

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.120
He gave us a TLDR version, but to be honest, I liked the long form answer, so I'm going

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.120
to read it.

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:57.960
In conversations about this in the past few weeks, the like dislike had a very interesting

01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.600
gender overtone to it.

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.360
My friends who identify as male either liked it enough to enjoy what was there for free

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.780
or didn't care about it.

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.840
My female friends tried it out.

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.560
Get sexually harassed by men via the chat and character actions, never to return.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.360
Home is best remembered by learning from the flaws.

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.880
The platform decisions you make in a game will directly affect the society it creates.

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.360
Playing with friends was hard if not impossible.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.800
Even with all the premium housing, costumes, items, et cetera, there wasn't a good way

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:25.720
to show that off to people you know.

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.840
There was no way to make a better environment for yourself.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.160
We all lived in public.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.600
This leaves one with a sea of random people, abuse and all where flagging the behavior

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.320
was a journey in itself.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.360
There were games that I enjoyed in the home platform.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.360
Sure.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.080
There were low level and basic, but some were fun, especially for free.

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.200
Ultimately, Sony didn't place their investments in the right way to make home better.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.400
What we've left is what we're left with is a mediocre or less experience, which we can

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.080
learn lessons from in the future.

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.920
I think Destiny learned a bit of home's problems with the fire team functions.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.600
Easy to add friends in a group, then everyone's always in the same instance of gameplay.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.600
When you play with randoms, you don't see, you don't hear or see them speak.

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.160
Still, I'll take Uru missed online any day.

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.920
Note a friend of mine worked on home and is losing his job with his closure.

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.200
Thankfully, it's known with a timeline, so he's in a much better position to find his

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.560
next job.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:19.400
So I know that was a long answer, but it definitely brought an interesting thing to light with

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.920
that whole gender issue.

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.920
It's not.

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:23.920
Yeah.

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.520
I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily a gender issue.

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.640
It's more of a people are anonymous on the Internet and they act like assholes issue.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:35.520
And this has been something ever since voice chat on the Internet was not even voice chat.

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.520
Like chatting on the Internet was a thing.

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.360
Oh, my God, a girl.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.360
Show me your boobs.

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.720
And it doesn't even be like it doesn't even have to be that you're a girl.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.640
And I mean, if you're a nature of people, if your avatar is a girl in the game, you're

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.640
gonna get people acting like idiots because they can anonymously because there's no way

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.000
to get it tracked back to you.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yeah.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
We don't need feminism.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.600
Just saying slash sarcasm.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.280
But I like to play.

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.780
My character in Destiny's female.

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.960
Of course, I got punched in the face the other day, but I think that would have happened

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.160
no matter what.

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.680
But anyway, moving on.

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:12.520
Gaming nerd says I've never tried it myself and was always curious to check it out and

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.800
see what it was like.

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.400
Maybe some time before it shuts down for good, I'll have a look just to see what I've missed

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.760
out on.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.320
And Chiggers says they should give everyone a store credit if they spent real money on

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.920
clothes or accessories since they're shutting it down.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:28.720
See, Chiggers, I understand where that reaction comes from.

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.320
But the problem is this is something you have to understand when you buy gear in a virtual

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.320
game.

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:36.320
That game will go away.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.320
And it doesn't matter what it is.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.280
It's typically written into the terms of service as well.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.600
So you agreed that they have the right to do this.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.600
Exactly.

01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:46.400
And I know it kind of like sucks in retrospect, but like literally any game you've bought

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.680
digital content for, that's another reason why I get nervous buying digital games.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:54.840
I mean, sure, I can always redownload the game at a later date if I, you know, delete

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.180
the game off my system.

01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:01.640
But what if one day Microsoft shuts off Xbox Live?

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.520
I mean, someday that's going to happen.

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.760
That's going to suck for being Titanfall.

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.520
So that's just I mean, these are all things you have to consider is that it is unlimited

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.520
time.

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:17.520
Anyway, just the thing that people need to realize, though, is that it's not they forced

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.480
you to do this or this, that, the other.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.480
You agreed to it.

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.480
Yeah.

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.840
If you didn't agree to it, then you wouldn't be playing it right now.

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.540
It's also like a digital rental.

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.760
You know, you watch the movie and now it's gone.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.600
Well, you don't get your money back, you know, because you got the value out of it for that

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:35.440
limited time that you agreed to, I guess, is the closest comparison I can think of.

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.600
Anyway, I don't mean to poo poo your opinion, Chiggers, but I just I kind of go, I see

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:43.760
that what you're saying is kind of like a real kind of like gut reaction.

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:47.360
But if you really kind of like look at the bigger picture, it's like, oh, anything digital

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.000
is going to have this problem.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.680
And we hear this a lot with anything digital that shuts down.

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.680
All right.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:53.680
I am the laziest.

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:54.680
I love.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.400
No, I am the laziest.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.160
No, I am the I am the laziest one.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.560
I Dark Sakura just yawned.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.040
She is the laziest.

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.680
All right.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.680
Wow.

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:14.080
The man claiming to be the laziest says, I gave it a shot when I first got my PS3.

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.440
Then when I actually got games, I ignored it.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.240
S2100 Matt says, I think home was a great idea ahead of its time.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.280
That just didn't work out.

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:27.560
I think the next incarnation of it as possibly an onboard OS will be more useful and intuitive.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.840
I was really hyped for it when it was announced because I saw the possibility of it being

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.460
a cool gaming social network.

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:38.900
And I finally played it when I got a PS3 many years later, and it looked totally deserted.

01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:42.420
Over to Google Plus and getting some of our answers over there.

01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:46.900
I think we had just a couple of answers on Google Plus, and I'm waiting on Google Plus

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:48.460
to load and show me those answers.

01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:49.460
Here we go.

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.460
We have three comments tonight.

01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:52.580
I'll start with DNL.

01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.580
I love DNL.

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:58.420
DNL says, I used PlayStation Home and once upon a time was tapped to join the team.

01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.540
I turned them down.

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.020
Ultimately, the execution of the system was not self-sustaining, monetization of the content

01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:08.020
was non-existent, and integration into the home system was not seamless.

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:12.100
It was cumbersome to use at best, and I'm sad to say that the vision of the overall

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:13.540
product was shortchanged.

01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:16.140
I'll be sad to see it go.

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:20.620
A very respectful but very accurate read that I have to agree with.

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:25.820
I mean, I think she hits the nail on the head when she says, where is it?

01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.900
Integration into the home system was not seamless.

01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.620
It was cumbersome to use at best.

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:35.420
I mean, that's my biggest issue with it, is that like on paper, I love the idea of home,

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:41.380
but like, here's me with my big finger pointing up saying this.

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:48.180
Anyhow, Reddertainment says, I remember spending a couple of hours fooling around in PlayStation

01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:49.180
Home.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:52.020
I played some of the games, wandered around in some of the spaces, and even took in the

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:54.940
uncharted area of home that Naughty Dog had set up.

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.740
In the end, I didn't find enough compelling inside of home to spend and substantive time

01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.300
in it outside of the handful of times I briefly logged on.

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.560
Unfortunately, this is the experience that most people had with home.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:12.020
Much like 1 versus 100, home had the promise of potential that was never actually realized.

01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.460
Oh, kick me in the gut, why don't you?

01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:15.980
But see, here's where I would argue.

01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:23.500
One versus 100, I think was a little more realized in a way.

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:28.820
But anyway, I mean, can you imagine if they built something like 1 versus 100 into PlayStation

01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.820
Home?

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:34.260
The biggest hurdle to that would have just been that seamlessness that we heard about

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:35.260
in the other comment.

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:39.980
But anyway, one more answer from ActDeft who says, PS Home wasn't something that appealed

01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:42.500
to me or something that I had to get a PS3 for.

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:45.880
It had potential, but it lacked substance, so I can see why it failed and why it's getting

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.940
taken down.

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:50.420
Sucks for the people that actually enjoyed it and also had bought stuff for it, but in

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:54.160
this day and age of digital content, nothing lasts forever.

01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.160
True facts.

01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.160
Thanks for the answers.

01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.160
Appreciate it, guys.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:04.540
Again, you can friend us on Facebook and Google Plus and answer a future Google Question of

01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:05.540
the Week.

01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:08.220
Meanwhile, we get back into some long form news.

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.580
I usually ask for our perspectives on the question, but we kind of already talked about

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.420
that earlier in the show.

01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:16.220
My perspective is...

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.220
Did you ever really get to try it?

01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.100
I didn't care.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:22.440
I read it because this is how I do about everything.

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.300
I read up on it, decide if I want to do it or not.

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:26.300
I read up on it.

01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:29.780
It seemed like monumental waste of time to me.

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.200
I wouldn't call it a waste of time.

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.200
To me.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.860
To me, it would have been a waste of time.

01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.240
Some would say video games are a waste of time, but no, I understand everything's a

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.240
personal taste.

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:41.900
Keep in mind, I did try Second Life.

01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:42.900
Did you?

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:45.420
And I stayed with it for two whole weeks.

01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.420
Two whole weeks?

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.060
It was free.

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:53.100
It was when I was on my big Avatar kick.

01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.100
Like the movie Avatar.

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:55.100
The movie Avatar.

01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:56.100
Did people build pandorans?

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:57.100
Yeah, people did.

01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:58.420
It was actually really cool.

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:03.260
It was really neat going around and seeing what other people created and just seeing

01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:07.460
the different ways that people would try to interpret what they saw of their fandoms.

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.860
I saw some for various fantasy universes.

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:17.900
I kind of did avoid the sexy playground ones or whatever, but it was actually very robust.

01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:21.700
Going to chat room, because we have Gossipy Dish in our chat room, and I love me some

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:27.460
Gossipy Dish over at live.vognetwork.com, and yet again, the SEG, who said earlier in

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:29.940
the show he should have driven up tonight, and I'm starting to agree, SEG.

01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.140
You should have just been here tonight, because lots of great comments from SEG tonight.

01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:38.180
SEG says, one versus 100 only failed because the ad team didn't do their job.

01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.820
Talk to an engineer who worked on one versus 100 at GDC this year.

01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.580
That literally was the reason.

01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:46.820
Gold sales went up with one versus 100.

01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.540
Is it that the ad team didn't or couldn't?

01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:52.180
I mean, I'm just curious.

01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.900
Not that I don't think you don't know the difference, but I'm wondering, was it that

01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:56.900
people...

01:57:56.900 --> 01:58:00.260
Yeah, now that I think about it, I only ever saw Sprint commercials on that thing.

01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.500
That was the only company I ever saw back one versus 100.

01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:06.860
Did no one else get it, maybe?

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:07.860
I don't know.

01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:12.020
But SEG, if you haven't heard it, you got to hear last week's show because when we had

01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:16.780
Jackbox Games on, they talked about how You Don't Know Jack was almost game number two

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:20.380
for that whole thing, and that was a huge...

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:25.100
I'm surprised more people aren't talking about what he said last week on the show, but there

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:26.100
you go.

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:27.100
I thought it was very interesting.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.780
So anyway, let's move on.

01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:31.780
More news.

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.780
Loki.

01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:37.940
All right, I don't know how much news this really is, but apparently if you're digging,

01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:41.340
you really, really want to play Minecraft on the Wii U, well, you're not going to be

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:45.940
able to play Minecraft on the Wii U right now, but don't worry because someone's there

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:51.660
to fill the void, and they're making their own Minecraft clone called U-Craft, and it's

01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:58.220
by some anonymous developer, a licensed developer for the Wii U.

01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.740
And it's a UND game.

01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:05.320
I can totally tell, just screenshot, it's a UND game, but I don't know if you really

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:11.140
should be getting that excited about it because we've seen these kind of a dime a dozen on

01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.140
the Xbox Indie game.

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:16.700
I was going to say, I was like, well, I don't think I've really seen studios do just straight

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:20.540
up Minecraft clones, and I'm like, wait a minute, no, Xbox Live Indie games, oh my God,

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:22.400
there was 100 million billion of them.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:28.340
And even on mobile app stores, iTunes and Google Play, there's tons of them out there.

01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:31.580
There are, and I'm going to tell you right now, I mean, once you get one on there, it's

01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:37.260
not going to be the end of it, and especially now that the Wii U, you can export to the

01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:43.700
Wii U using Unity, I'm sure you're going to see a lot more of these types of games.

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:48.260
But I just hope it's not like a literal, because a lot of these Minecraft clones, like I've

01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:54.300
played, what was it, Castle Miner Z and stuff like that, and they're okay, I mean, they

01:59:54.300 --> 02:00:00.100
were like a buck, and it had, you know, it's just like really terrible graphics, and it's

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:04.420
Minecraft with zombies and skeletons and shit, and you have guns.

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.740
I mean, that was kind of the difference.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:10.100
And this right now, just in the screenshots, looks like it's very basic, I mean, they've

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:17.160
got the standard assets, you know, skybox in there, diffuse textures, it just looks

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:23.020
really basic, but they're claiming it's like an alpha, you know, the alpha images, but

02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:26.700
I don't know, whatever, I mean, hey, cool, if it's cheap enough, you know what, it might

02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:30.660
not be a bad thing to waste your time on, because there is a lot of those clones that

02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:36.620
came out on Xbox Indie games that people really liked, so, cool, I hope that does come out

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:41.020
and maybe at least shows, you know, Mojang or Microsoft or whoever, that there might

02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:43.060
be some interest on that platform.

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:49.300
Well, it's not gonna matter now, after Microsoft has no interest in building this on Nintendo,

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:53.540
well, I say that, but then I go back and think, oh yeah, there was a Viva Pinata 3DS game,

02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:58.740
so I guess anything is fucking possible, but I just, I really don't see it happening.

02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:05.820
I sort of think what needs to happen, if Nintendo really wants this to be a thing, then if this

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:10.580
hasn't already happened with whatever developer is making this, Nintendo needs to find the

02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:16.180
developer capable of doing it and Pope Nintendo needs to bless the game by saying, you can

02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:21.620
put Mario and Link in it, because if you can put Mario and Link in Minecraft or whatever,

02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:28.280
then, then it'll sell, like, Mario goes mining, will sell 11 billion copies.

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:33.980
Think about it, if you could marry the Minecraft world with Mario, I mean, there it is.

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.740
Mario or what about, like, Rosetti?

02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:43.060
Mr. Rosetti's Digging Adventure, and then he yells at you if you turn the game off too early.

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.300
I actually kind of love that idea.

02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:49.260
Have you ever actually been in Mr. Rosetti's house in, uh...

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.860
Didn't it only show up, like, once in a blue moon type of thing?

02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:53.300
I've managed to make it into his house.

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.300
Yeah, yeah.

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.860
He has a couple of toilets.

02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:57.860
That's awesome.

02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:58.860
Yeah.

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:01.420
What if the next Animal Crossing were to take elements of Minecraft?

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:02.420
I think they're actually...

02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:03.420
It's not.

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.420
Yeah, I don't know.

02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.420
I just...

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:06.420
Animal Crossing will never change.

02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:08.060
Yeah, Animal Crossing does kind of have a forest.

02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:10.540
The forest will always be the forest.

02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:13.900
But man, I think about, like, what those games would look like if they could get married

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:17.100
a little bit, and it's kind of awesome, but, I don't know, maybe it's a bit much.

02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:22.580
And I don't know, see, like, ironically enough, you know, for my game, I actually had to build

02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:27.180
something that basically is like Minecraft, you know, for my editor, and, you know, what

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:29.500
they have on the screen is actually not that difficult to make.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:35.140
I mean, there's tutorials out there that build that pretty easy, so, I don't know.

02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:38.500
Hopefully it's fun, because that's really, when it comes down to the end of it, I mean,

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:42.180
it can look like shit, but if it's fun, it doesn't matter.

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:46.820
All right, well, this game's doing very well, because it's a lot of fun for a lot of people,

02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.820
and that is League of Legends, but you know what makes this game not fun and really turns

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:54.060
some people off sometimes, like, you know, it's done with me and some other people I

02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.060
know?

02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:56.060
Assholes?

02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:57.060
Assholes, that's right.

02:02:57.060 --> 02:02:58.060
Toxic players.

02:02:58.060 --> 02:02:59.060
People that are dicks.

02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:03.460
Well, Riot Games has been doing, you know, to be fair, they've been trying to come up

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:07.980
with ways to sort of, you know, punish those toxic players and basically let them know

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.580
that they're not welcome inside League of Legends, and this is going to be interesting.

02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:16.660
There is a patch coming to League of Legends, and if a player is voted down for negative

02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:22.900
behavior, and they're already operating under a chat restriction, they will have to, I'm

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:27.860
sorry, what's happening in the game now, you are already operating under chat restriction

02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:30.300
if you're voted down for negative behavior.

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.320
You have to play a certain number of games, and then you can speak in the game again.

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.860
So being able to speak in League of Legends is something you earn, essentially, if, you

02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:43.220
know, you don't act like a jackass.

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:46.700
But here's another restriction that's coming with this patch.

02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:50.180
You will not be able to play ranked play.

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.180
That's right.

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:55.500
Ranked restricted players will have a certain number of games that you have to play before

02:03:55.500 --> 02:04:01.380
you can return to queuing for ranked matches, meaning, what's the only possible pool of

02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:02.380
players?

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:07.120
They'll have to play with new players in the basic pool to work their way back up to the

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:10.700
ranked pool, and not only do they have to play with the basic players, they have to

02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:14.660
act nice, because if they keep getting ranked down, they'll never get to see the ranked

02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:15.840
matches again.

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:17.140
This is kind of awesome.

02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.140
I love it.

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:19.820
I love it!

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:22.920
Good job, Riot Games.

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.920
If you are too deeply in negative territory and rank restricted at the end of a given

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:32.760
competitive season, you will be ineligible for receiving special rewards for ranked play.

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:37.660
So it's like, Riot Games is now written, you will not be a dick into the rules.

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:40.600
If you want to get rewards, you will not be a jerk.

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.240
Jerks do not get rewarded.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.360
Super Nanny is at work over at Riot Games, and I love this.

02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.320
What do you guys think in our chatroom over at live.volgnetwork.com?

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.480
I'm applauding it with my brain.

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:56.840
Let's see, Act F says, my brother plays League of Legends and just uses Skype instead

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.200
of the in-game chat.

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.680
When he's playing with friends, of course.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:02.320
When he isn't, he just doesn't talk.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:08.280
SSG100Matt says, hmm, I just wonder how people can abuse this, like an entire clan downvoting

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.360
one person just to be a jerk.

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:17.400
Ooh, I hope that isn't something that people can take advantage of.

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:22.040
The Segg says, I don't know if throwing the most toxic players to your new users is a

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:23.040
good idea.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.040
Ah, but at the same time.

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.400
As long as they can't talk to them.

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:29.760
If they can't talk to them, remember, they already got their right to talk stripped away.

02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:33.000
So if they don't shape up, they have to ship out.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.120
Bojikawa says, to be honest, I like that a lot.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:39.680
I never do ranked matches and usually just hush if someone wants to start talking out

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.840
of their butt.

02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:45.520
And Fifth Dream says, that should be the first line in any end user license agreement.

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.840
You agree to not be a jerk.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.040
That should be like the big font right at the top.

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.280
Loki, is the game you're making going to have online play?

02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:55.920
Because I think your EULA should have that in like 24 point font right at the top.

02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:01.320
I can put it on there anyways, but no, it's not, at least right now I'm not planning on

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.000
doing any sort of online stuff.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.680
It could pop up with a question.

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.640
Like when you start the game, are you a jerk?

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:07.640
Yes or no.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:08.640
And if they click yes, the game uninstalls.

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:10.640
It's kind of dumb.

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.640
No, I'm not going to do that.

02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.640
Ah, you're no fun at all.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:16.760
Alright, let's move on.

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:18.400
Dark Sakura.

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:24.160
This one actually, what gave me the decision to post this story was Becky's reaction to

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.160
it.

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.100
Because as you know, my best friend Becky has a seven year old.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:33.680
It's a game called Galaxies, G-A-L-X-Y-Z.

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:41.520
And it's put out, it actually has affiliation with the New York Academy of Sciences.

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:47.560
The game is launching in 2015, and it's going to be an online educational game for children.

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.320
Basically it's kindergarteners through 12th graders.

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:57.880
It was created because a dad saw his kids getting bored playing science education games.

02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:01.520
He wanted them to be challenging, which makes them more effective.

02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:08.440
And so his name is Osman Rashid, and he's the CEO of Galaxies.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:15.360
And this is a quote from him, students have more capacity to learn than we give them credit

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:16.360
for.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.520
They are naturally perceptive and will easily see through the products that seek to fool

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:22.280
them into thinking they're fun.

02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:28.320
So basically, the New York Academy of Sciences is going to be keeping an eye on students

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.040
as they play the game across the world that show more science aptitude.

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:38.960
And those that excel will be considered for free science education through an online talent

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.760
organization called the Junior Academy.

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.700
And so if they are let in, they will get mentoring, high-level online science courses, and opportunities

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:49.960
to participate on research teams.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:54.600
So they're starting with an initial pool of 500 students and are hoping to increase into

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:56.760
the thousands as the project goes on.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:59.840
So I think this is really awesome.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.440
Hooray for science.

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.520
We don't talk enough about like edutainment games on the show, really.

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:08.840
So it's kind of neat to always see how they kind of bridge education and gaming together,

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:09.840
you know.

02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:13.840
You can learn more about it at galaxies.com, g-a-l-y-x-z.com.

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:15.640
All right.

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:18.760
Do you think do you think lots of kids will learn about science thanks to this?

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.760
I hope so.

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:24.300
I'd really the thing is, this is not so much learning as seeing because I always think

02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:29.760
that when it's something that you can be engaged in, that's what makes it fun and interesting

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:30.760
to keep up with it.

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:36.840
And when you start participating with it and finding a reason to keep participating, then

02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:38.960
you're going to keep learning something.

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.520
It's going to be something new every time.

02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:44.240
It'll keep bringing you back instead of making it seem like just something they're shoving

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:47.880
down your throat, like, you know, linear algebra.

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:53.880
Tiger Claw in chat says, now only if these games had people perform actual science experiments.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:57.240
You mean like on Mr. Wizard's World, even though they would always have the disclaimer,

02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:58.240
don't try this at home?

02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:00.080
You know, you know, he hated children, right?

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.080
You know, you're going to do that at home.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:02.080
I've always heard.

02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:07.240
I always thought that was urban legend and not actually fact, but that's kind of like

02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.780
one of those, like the same urban legend that Mr. Rogers was like a trained sharpshooter

02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:14.440
in the military or something like that was completely not true.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:22.640
He was a Methodist minister, but still just people love the imagery of Mr. Rogers, like

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.240
carrying around a sniper rifle, just, you know, won't you be my neighbor?

02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.240
My dead neighbor.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.240
All right.

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.240
Moving on.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.240
Loki.

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:32.240
All right.

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:35.240
So there is a lawsuit against Activision.

02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:36.920
I don't even really remember this.

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:41.680
I think this was from a while ago, but there was a lawsuit where there was a, I guess,

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:48.160
regarding a patent that a company called them, was it McRoe Inc had, which was automatic

02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:53.120
animated lip synchronization and facial expressions of 3D characters.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.840
So basically they took a, you see a lot of this with like patent trolls where they took

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.800
the process for, you know, lip syncing something like you would do in like a cartoon or something

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:08.040
and add on a computer to the end of the patent.

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:14.880
And so like there was a precedent set with, was it Alice Corp versus a CLS bank international,

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:19.320
where I think it was the same type of situation where they were like, okay, we have a patent

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:25.040
for banking, you know, like something banking related, but on a computer, you know?

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:31.880
And so because the precedent was set by that case in which they invalidated those patents,

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:36.680
the same thing kind of happened here where the case was dismissed and those patents that

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:43.160
were owned by McRoe were actually invalidated because you can't just add on a computer at

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.700
the end of a patent and hope to have something brand new.

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:52.020
So hopefully, hopefully they did this a lot more with different, you know, uh, patents

02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:53.020
because there's a lot of them.

02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.020
Yeah, like the podcasting patent.

02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:56.780
That would be fantastic if that happened to this.

02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:01.940
Well, that one's tough because people keep settling with them when they, you know, win

02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:02.940
or lose.

02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:03.940
I don't know.

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:06.780
I don't think they've won any of them, but they keep settling.

02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:08.020
I think they keep settling.

02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:12.300
I think they're going to go after the NBC or yeah, NBC, CBS.

02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:14.920
They've basically said they're not going to go after like individual podcasters with these

02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:15.920
big companies.

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.280
Anyway, I'm starting to digress, but it is, it is obviously an issue that raises all of

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.940
our eyebrows because it's a little ridiculous.

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:29.720
If you ask me, it's like claiming to invent the RSS feed, but anyway, anyway, all right.

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.120
Another week, another lawsuit here on the program.

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:37.360
Uh, let's talk about something that, uh, probably would be a lawsuit except it's a Chinese bootleg

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:42.120
and there's really not a lot he can do about that because this happens all the time.

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:47.760
But it has to do with a hearthstone bootleg in China, but it's not what you think.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.960
It's not the computer version of hearthstone being bootlegged.

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.320
It's like an actual tangible version of hearthstone.

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:55.320
Yes.

02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:01.960
Uh, in, in China, they have actually made a like paper version of hearthstone with like

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.840
printed cards and everything and counters to keep track of life's and all this stuff.

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:09.080
It's a physical version of hearthstone.

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:16.000
So, uh, yeah, um, you can apparently track this down in China for about $50, uh, even

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.920
though the original is free to play, but, uh, there it is.

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:24.120
Uh, you can read more about this if you want games in Asia.com has a full rundown on this,

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:29.280
uh, real life hearthstone cards, and you can even see what some of these like little counters

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.160
that count down the life and so forth look like.

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.280
Um, but there was a, uh, there's no coin to flip to start the match at the beginning.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:41.240
They have a coin card itself though, which is part of the game.

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:48.440
So, uh, yeah, there it is hearthstone is available, um, tangibly overseas.

02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:49.600
Interesting.

02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.920
I wonder if there would be enough demand for this if Blizzard's interested at all in putting

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:53.920
out a physical version of this.

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.440
I would think probably not because they're making all their money off the, uh, you know,

02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.120
the, the cards and the mystery packs, the open and all that stuff.

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:05.280
But, uh, interesting, uh, fifth dream in chat says, I assume they were going to make a real

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.280
one.

02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.760
So, uh, Bochi Kawa says Wizards of the Coast needs to get on top of that market.

02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:13.760
So there it is.

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.120
All right.

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.540
Um, let's get into the mailbag.

02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:22.040
Every week you guys send us emails and, uh, we bootleg with your permission, your emails

02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.040
and read them on the show.

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:26.920
Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send your emails.

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.800
Darsakha will dive into the mailbag and, uh, pull out whatever emails there are and, uh,

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.880
make sure that they are fit for user consumption, that, you know, it's not like a penis enlargement

02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:39.880
email that somebody's sending the show.

02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:45.720
Uh, she will read it for all of our, uh, listeners and for us here in studio to respond to.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.640
So participate at orangelauntrader.com, Darsakha, what's in the mailbag tonight?

02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:50.640
One mail.

02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:51.640
One?

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.640
Hi, OLR.

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:53.880
Just a quick email for you guys.

02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.080
Please know Kim Kardashian Music.

02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.240
You mentioned last week something about who would name their company Skynet.

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.880
Funny story, the biggest telecom company in Belgium, Belgacom, calls their ISP Skynet.

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.640
According to Wikipedia, Skynet's operations are almost, uh, almost exclusively performed

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:16.520
by war machines, cyborg, usually a terminator, and, it gives a link, and other computer systems

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:18.600
with the goal of exterminating the human race.

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.720
This is fairly accurate as having to deal with their customer service will surely make

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.320
you want to kill the person on the other end of the phone, thus contributing to exterminating

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.320
the human race.

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:31.640
I hope you make it to episode 666, and thanks to Rob for posting the podcast promptly nowadays

02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.560
so your overseas listeners can enjoy it on Monday morning.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.720
All the best, Martin from Belgium.

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.120
Hooray, emails from overseas, and you're welcome, and, uh, yeah.

02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.120
Semi-chocolate.

02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:45.520
I've been a good boy about posting podcasts pretty promptly for a few years now.

02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:46.520
Martin, semi-chocolate.

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.960
I haven't had good Belgian chocolate in ages.

02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.920
No, seriously, Belgian chocolate is, like, the best chocolate in the world.

02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:55.520
Here's what I want to know.

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.320
And, Darsakar, I know you weren't here last week, but in a nutshell, um, Square Enix is

02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.320
going to be doing a cloud computing service called Shinra, which, you know, right?

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:05.920
Yeah, see?

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.160
And so I said, that would be like announcing a new computing service that you're calling

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.240
Skynet.

02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.880
And so that's why he sent in this email.

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:18.060
So my question is, is the terminator, like, a big part of pop culture in Belgium like

02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:19.060
it is here?

02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:22.760
Or is it, like, not really a, like, people don't know what that is?

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.280
That would explain that.

02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.280
I've actually never been to Belgium, Rob.

02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:27.280
Me neither.

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.280
Let's go.

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:29.280
Let's go right now.

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:30.280
Martin, we're going to come stay in your living room.

02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.280
That's right.

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:32.280
We're crashing.

02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:33.280
Clean off the couch.

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:35.400
Have some chocolate waiting for me.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.280
Have some fries waiting for me.

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.280
Loki, you want to come with?

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.280
We're going to Belgium.

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.600
What about fries in Belgium?

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:43.600
Waffles.

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:44.600
All right, waffles.

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:45.600
Waffles, fries, and chocolate.

02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:46.600
Hey, Rob.

02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.600
What?

02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:49.560
Penguins in sweaters.

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.560
That's not in the mailbag.

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:51.560
No, it's not.

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.560
But I just scrolled past it and I thought of you.

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.560
All right.

02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:00.800
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:02.480
And it can be from whatever country you want.

02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:05.640
We'll even take emails from Ohio, of which I'm expecting a few this week.

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:06.640
All right.

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.360
I have no fucking problem with Ohio.

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.040
Stop it.

02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:17.160
Every state has fucking boring shit in it.

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:20.040
Let's de- Especially New Jersey.

02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:21.840
Let's detail them all right now.

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:22.840
All right.

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:26.440
You can hear Dark Soccer is starting to get agitated and there's no better time during

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:44.440
the show to do the FUs of the Week.

02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.240
Fuck my headache.

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.760
Fuck my headache.

02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:53.480
I'm so just tired all the time, so fuck being tired too.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.480
I mean, okay.

02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:55.480
I really love what I do.

02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.480
Love it.

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.320
And no, I'm not telling any of you where I work, but I love it.

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:07.760
At the same time, holy shit, I just like to be home for an entire day, so.

02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:12.680
I love what I do too, but I also really love sitting on the couch and playing video games

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:13.680
all day.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.360
I love not wearing pants.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:19.240
That's why you work from home, if you can.

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.640
I like- Well, there's just some days I'll be like, it's lunchtime.

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:26.280
I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.280
It's my break.

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.080
I'd like to be home in my pajamas right now.

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:30.080
No.

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.680
No, I really- I like what I do.

02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:36.120
I am happy, happy, happy to dedicate the time that I do to it because this is the first

02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:41.240
place I've worked at in ages that I have actually really felt like I'm contributing.

02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.640
You know, like I'm a part of things and I really love it, but I'm really tired at the

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:51.320
same time and with just like a day where nobody asks me to draw something, I don't

02:17:51.320 --> 02:18:00.000
have to do flyers, I don't have to talk to people, I don't have to look at people, I

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:07.840
don't have to wear actual clothes or makeup or- my hair could be a big poofy rat's nest.

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:08.840
Don't care.

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:14.880
It's just me and the cat eating ice cream, both of us out of the same bowl, watching

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:15.880
YouTube.

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:18.040
It'd be great.

02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:19.040
Alright.

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:26.520
Look, I want to say something, but I can't talk about your job, so I'll say it off here.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.520
Alright, Loki.

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.960
Fuck you, the farmer's insurance, mainly all the independent farmer's insurance agents

02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.600
out there.

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:38.000
That seriously is such a pyramid scheme.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.840
You're looking for work that happened to be dumb enough to post your resume online publicly,

02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:48.100
you will get called by literally thousands of these people because for some reason there's

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:50.200
all these independent branches.

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.360
Can you imagine how the massive army of farmer's insurance people that are actually trying

02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:57.520
to get people to buy insurance from them?

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.720
No thanks.

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.680
My FU of the week goes to my lack of motivation to really buckle down and lose some weight

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:10.680
because I really want to get on that and I just keep falling off the wagon continuously

02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:14.560
over and over again and I know that the chips are so good.

02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:20.420
I need to channel the strength of Richard Simmons, who by the way tweeted me this week

02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:26.280
and I quit the internet because once you get Richard Simmons to tweet you, you win.

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:28.880
Are you going to glitter squat?

02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:31.840
That's the only way I'm going to lose weight is to glitter squat and if you don't know

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:34.840
what I'm talking about, you need to go to Richard Simmons Facebook page and if you hate

02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.560
Richard Simmons or you make fun of Richard Simmons, I'm coming for you.

02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:42.960
Ain't nobody got time for a Richard Simmons hater because seriously, what negative thing

02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:44.600
has that man ever done?

02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:45.600
He does nothing but help people.

02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.600
He's a good person.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.600
I love him.

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:54.920
Platonically, don't take it to a weird place, but he tweeted me and I win the internet and

02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.920
you lost.

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.920
Yeah.

02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:03.480
All right, let's get to a couple more stories for you guys and then we'll open up the

02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:10.440
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:13.280
Let's get to the last few news stories here.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.280
Loki.

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.280
All right.

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.440
So Steam has hit a milestone surpassing a hundred million users.

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:25.560
With that also, of course, they've added the whole curation system now.

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:30.840
So now you can actually, I believe if you have a Steam group, you can add your own curation

02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:36.360
page where you can recommend different games and give them reviews and that kind of stuff

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.720
and people can go visit that.

02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:41.440
And you may have been seeing a lot of this on like social media where they're talking

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:46.560
about like, hey, go like our curation page or go join it or something like that.

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:47.560
So they have that.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:52.640
And then of course, the Steam music player that was in beta for the longest time has

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:55.000
now been released.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.880
So you can actually use the Steam music player.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.320
It's integrated into Steam and use your own library with that.

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:07.800
So kind of one of the things that they're going to be using for the Steam OS and be

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:12.200
curious to see what other kind of non-gaming applications they have for Steam OS because

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:16.640
we don't really know too much about it yet.

02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:18.680
Yeah.

02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:21.240
What is the status of all that stuff with Steam?

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:25.680
I noticed though that Steam, like it looks a lot different now.

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.040
Like they did some weird, like it looks blue and they use some different fonts.

02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:31.160
Like I like its look.

02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:36.760
I like the blue look a lot because you know, blue is prettier than gray, but it definitely

02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:38.660
looks like they're like ramping up to something.

02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.520
But what was the last on this whole Steam OS?

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.100
I have no idea.

02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:46.080
Another cool thing about the Steam music player, if you do happen to check it out, you'll notice

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.460
if you own some Valve games that you'll have the soundtracks for said games.

02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:57.720
So like Half-Life, Portal, Portal 2, and also I guess was it they've got, I wonder if that's

02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:01.100
how Humble Bundle is going to do the soundtracks in the future.

02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:02.100
Possibly that'd be pretty cool.

02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:03.100
I bet it is.

02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:05.700
Have like a Steam code for the soundtrack.

02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.660
Have you tried Steam in big picture mode lately?

02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:09.380
It's a slick little interface.

02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:12.060
I haven't tried it lately, but I've used it in the past.

02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:15.740
I've looked at big picture mode, but you know, on my laptop, it's kind of useless.

02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:19.380
Yeah, no, it's a, I was actually just using it last night cause I was feeling lazy and

02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:23.060
I just kind of had the controller and I was like, well, it also, when you upgraded Steam,

02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:25.980
and I don't know if this is just because I'm opted into the beta program, a little picture

02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.700
of a controller now shows up in the upper right.

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:28.700
Yeah.

02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.700
And I was like, what's this do?

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:31.340
And I clicked it and it was like, oh, it's in big picture mode.

02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:35.880
And I was like, wow, this is like all splashy and blue and different from what I remember.

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:42.360
So yeah, it's, it feels very fluid and that that's what led me to playing things like

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:45.960
Crypt of the Necrodancer again and stuff that that's enabled for big picture mode.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:50.680
It's like, it's like playing a, playing a Xbox or something.

02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.320
It's great.

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:57.860
So fifth dream in chat says, how do I delete these valve albums from my Steam player?

02:22:57.860 --> 02:22:59.720
It's not like they gave you, you too.

02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:04.600
Come on, don't even start.

02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:05.600
Let's see.

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:07.120
Uh, what else?

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:11.240
Act F says Steam is blue da ba dee ba da ba dee ba ba dee.

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:12.240
Oh boy.

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:17.520
Uh, and, uh, Causton says Humble doesn't do Steam codes anymore.

02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:18.520
Unfortunately.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.360
Why did they link them to your Steam account?

02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:21.960
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.640
You link them to your account instead.

02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.640
That's okay.

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.640
That's not, that's the same thing.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:32.000
Not entirely true because I had to enter a Steam code in, I think for, um, road redemption.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.800
It might, it might depend on what it is you're getting through the Humble store and just

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.880
like what, you know, Kickstarter might be a different thing.

02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:39.880
Who knows?

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:41.520
Anyhow.

02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:46.240
I kind of like that I don't have to enter in Steam code sometimes, so I'm all in with

02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:47.240
that.

02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:50.640
Bobby Black Wolf is toying with what I said earlier about big picture mode and Xbox saying,

02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.720
you mean it's like playing a Steam box?

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:56.880
Well, yes, it is actually a lot like that, but it's cool that I can get the sense of

02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:59.640
what that would really feel like, like on my PC.

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:00.640
I don't know.

02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:04.000
It's just kind of, and that I didn't actually buy a damn Steam box.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.560
I just am using my PC to do it.

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:06.840
It's still kind of neat.

02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:14.800
So all right, let's move on with one more story here about speaking about consoles and

02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:17.000
what they really do.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.720
Game consoles are actually the most popular streaming device in most American homes.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:25.760
And a lot of you guys are probably sitting here going, well, I probably could have told

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:26.760
you that.

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:32.080
But this is important because this is research from Parks Associates, which was reported

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:37.960
on in Home Media Magazine, 46% of American households with broadband have a video game

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:43.760
console connected, and 38% use said console as their primary means of streaming entertainment

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:46.640
like Netflix or Hulu.

02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:47.840
But here's the thing.

02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:53.040
A comment from Barbara Krauss, who's the director of research, says, quote, gaming consoles

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:58.200
are the most frequently used connected CE device because of their high adoption rates.

02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:03.160
Of the broadband households that have only one connected CE device, nearly 60% have a

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:04.160
game console.

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:08.680
As the non-gaming capabilities of consoles have expanded, so too has the potential for

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.760
consoles to become an entertainment platform for online content such as video, music, and

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:14.760
apps.

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:21.080
So this means that right now consoles are bigger than Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Google

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:24.240
TV, Google Chromecast.

02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:28.560
Only 9% use a Blu-ray disc player that has all that stuff built into it.

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.280
I mean, gaming consoles really are becoming that all-in-one box.

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.360
So even more so than, you know, when I, it wasn't really till I heard this is bigger

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:42.880
than Roku and Apple TV when I was like, oh shit, gaming consoles like really are kind

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.200
of a big deal with the streaming stuff.

02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:50.760
So kind of neat to hear about, but also kind of shows you this is why sometimes Microsoft

02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:56.320
walks out on stage and has a press conference that is TV, TV, TV, TV, and why Sony might

02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.360
spend part of their E3 conference talking TV, TV, TV, because it is getting bigger.

02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:04.480
That's what these things do.

02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:10.600
And you know, another article I saw on this made the comparison to, oh, hey, remember

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.800
the PlayStation 2 and why it did so well because it played DVDs.

02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:21.520
So game consoles being an all-in-one media box, definitely not a new thing.

02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:24.040
So let's see.

02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.440
Brad from Pod Culture says the biggest missing feature from Xbox One for me was the connection

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.760
to Media Center.

02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:36.600
I comment from our chat over live.vognetwork.com along with Kane Shadow who says consoles is

02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.800
for media centers, not video games.

02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.280
Games are just the sideshow.

02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:43.280
That's it.

02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:46.440
This is a media box that happens to play games too.

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.440
That's where we're headed.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:48.440
All right.

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:52.380
Anyhow, that does it for our stories tonight.

02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:56.720
We are done with the stories, but that means now it's on to you guys and you can call us

02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:57.720
right now.

02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:02.760
Our Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.320
if there's something you want to give your thoughts on that we've talked about tonight

02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.840
or any other topic as well, maybe something we didn't get to, although I got to say just

02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:14.800
in trying to put together this week's show and everything, I was like, boy, it was kind

02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:16.240
of a slow news week.

02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.240
So I don't know.

02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:18.240
That's pretty slow.

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.120
I don't know what we might have missed, but maybe you guys are on something that, you

02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:27.440
know, or maybe there's like a project we overlooked or a funny YouTube or something that you want

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:30.160
to talk about or something else.

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:31.160
Who knows?

02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:32.160
Let's get to it though.

02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:33.160
The phone is ringing.

02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:34.160
Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.160
Who's this?

02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.160
Hey, guys.

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.160
It's Jason.

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:38.160
Hey, Jason, buddy.

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.160
How you doing?

02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.160
I'm doing pretty good.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:43.000
You are, but I understand you don't actually live in California.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Yeah.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.400
Well, after being on the show for like three months straight, you might think otherwise.

02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:48.400
Oh, come on.

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:49.400
We love to have you here.

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:50.600
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.840
So you made a comment earlier when we were talking about the esports arena.

02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:56.800
I like the fact that I've adopted the royal we.

02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:59.000
Well, that's the intro for you.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.400
You made the comment when talking about the story about the esports arena, and you said

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:08.960
that you feel that that should be getting put to use for things besides just gaming.

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:15.480
I think you named us a couple of artists and actually like that kind of a performance.

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:16.920
It was a little bit of a...

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.960
Not a joke, but more of a, you know, just to kind of show like, you know, there are

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:27.800
performers that do big arena shows that, you know, or the circus or Disney on ice or whatever

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:30.520
else an arena is used for.

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:35.640
And so I guess the question that I wanted to ask you though is, do you know how many

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:42.000
like, as far as Korea is concerned and like the legitimate, for lack of a better word,

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.360
esports circuit, do you know how many gaming events take place?

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.160
Yes, but we're not on Korea's level yet.

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:51.680
We're nowhere close to that.

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:54.400
But when should we actually take those same steps?

02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:58.800
Well, I'm not saying that the gaming arena is like a bad thing or anything.

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.960
I'm just surprised that they're not talking about a multipurpose arena, that this is like

02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:08.560
a gaming dedicated thing, because I wouldn't think that these huge gaming events happen

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:10.000
365 days a year.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.280
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:13.940
I think it is already there.

02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:17.920
And I think the fact that there is a dedicated venue for this, the problem is going to be

02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:23.160
like when you go to branch out into different games, how many like game facilities do they

02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:24.160
have?

02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:30.000
But like WCS, if I remember correctly, they stopped doing it in America.

02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:35.920
But there was some circuit that I was watching a Starcraft match in a New York tower that

02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:40.800
the view on stream, just like watch the players and then just look behind them, look out the

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.800
window.

02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:42.800
Gorgeous view.

02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:45.800
They were like 50, 60 stories up in some New York tower.

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:48.040
Anyways, it was good.

02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:51.600
You said something else about, you know, what would be, what's the problem or so forth.

02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:56.160
And I'm said, the problem is, and I'm going to get haters with this comment and I'm sorry,

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:59.720
but the problem is it's in Ohio.

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:04.080
But the only people that need to be there are the players.

02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:07.760
Like web streams are such that everybody can watch at home and it really doesn't matter

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:18.560
where they have to fill the arena to not necessarily, not except for the biggest like finals events.

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:21.400
So the, the point that I, the point that I was making about the New York tower thing

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:26.140
is that I was watching at like three or four in the morning local.

02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:32.840
So it was what, 7am New York and it was a bunch of overseas players, which was even

02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:35.580
crazier for like jet lag purposes and all that kind of stuff.

02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:39.540
But it was like crack of dawn first thing in the morning in a New York tower and American

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:41.940
circuit Starcraft matches.

02:30:41.940 --> 02:30:48.200
So the, my counterpoint is that there is already enough content that with a dedicated space,

02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:55.160
they can put the facility to use for everything to be set up correctly and then just add concessions

02:30:55.160 --> 02:31:00.800
and do everything else they need for the big grand arena, 16 player, semi-finals, quarter

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:04.160
finals, finals kind of thing.

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:05.160
I don't know.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.520
I mean, I get, we'll see.

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:11.080
It's just an arena seems like such a big, big undertaking and I'm just, again, I'm just

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:15.440
surprised we're talking about it only for gaming and not more of a community thing.

02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:20.720
But keep in mind too, here's where my perspective is that right now is that here in Sacramento,

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:24.440
they have been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena.

02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:26.680
And this really doesn't have anything to do with gaming, but just to show you where

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:31.240
my perspective is that they've been fighting tooth and nail for years to get a new arena

02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:36.520
downtown and they threatened to move our only professional sports team, uh, ma major league,

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:39.280
I should say, uh, the Sacramento Kings, part of the NBA, right?

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:44.000
They threatened to move them to Seattle and they literally almost left because their current

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.160
arena Arco arena is so, or whatever the fuck they call it now, but it's always be Arco

02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:52.080
arena to me, I guess they say is too damn old and falling apart or whatever.

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:57.800
So basically the NBA strong armed the town into building a new arena, but they had to

02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:03.960
kind of be like, it's not just about basketball, it's going to be the downtown spot for all

02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.960
these events.

02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:07.840
So we're going to lure all these, you know, artists and concerts.

02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:11.880
So I guess that's why Jason, and at the end of the day, my head is that, how did the community

02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:15.680
let them build this fucking arena just for games?

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:21.960
But again, 15 minutes outside of major city, Ohio and downtown Sacramento, I suppose are

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.040
much different, but yeah, and there's a lot of other details like the fact that it may

02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:29.960
not be quite as big as a multipurpose arena.

02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:34.280
Um, and they may have to concede to do that in the future to let other events in and do

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:36.420
that kind of thing just because it does make sense.

02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:44.080
But I, I, I don't follow esports, uh, esports games enough to say that I'm like gonna be

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:45.880
a fan and support this kind of stuff.

02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:49.100
I'm hopeful for it for the people that do this kind of thing.

02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:55.260
There is enough gaming variety, variety out there that things can be happening very perpetually.

02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:58.660
Every first person shooter, every strategy game, special events.

02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:03.400
I mean, they could eat not, not even just esports, but just gaming events in general,

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:11.220
like big, big debuts, uh, uh, uh, SDA speed run, uh, speed running events can take place

02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:12.220
there.

02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:17.120
Like the, the amount of content that's grown to such in the gaming world that a lot can

02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:22.460
be done with a dedicated, well-stocked, wired up venue, and I'm looking forward to that.

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:26.360
You know, you won't really be seeing me getting on a plane to Ohio anytime soon to, to go

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:30.280
to one of these events in person, unless they, they asked me to host one.

02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:32.040
Then I'd be, I'd be, I'd so be there.

02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:34.720
I'll be, I'll, I'll go to the Rock and Roll Museum.

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:36.720
I will go to Cedar Point and take some selfies.

02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:40.840
You'll be hosting this event with none other than Richard Simmons.

02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:42.960
Oh my, I would die.

02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:43.960
He's my hero.

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.360
I would, oh my God.

02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:51.480
I just, just, I could drop dead the next day and I would have lived a full life anyway.

02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:57.120
Why don't we have a Richard Simmons fitness video game?

02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:01.200
There's I, I was, you know, what got me the tweet on Twitter from Richard Simmons was

02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:04.320
I was asking, why doesn't Richard Simmons have a podcast?

02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:07.240
Because I would listen every day to a Richard Simmons podcast.

02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:09.880
And then my buddy Spike from Game Buoy said something to that.

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.960
And then I think I replied to that just with just something general that was like, um,

02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.120
I just think Richard Simmons is motivated by what he really does for people and not

02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:19.640
like by money.

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:24.320
And he, that's where Richard Simmons replied and said, thank you for your kind words, XO.

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:27.840
So because they haven't made a microphone, they could keep up with him.

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.840
Anyway.

02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:32.360
Um, well, Jason, thank you very much for the call.

02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.560
I'm going to let you go, but I just want to address one other thing you brought up, like

02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:38.440
just way in passing at the very beginning of your call and you probably didn't even

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.920
mean to go here, but I just want to make sure I clear the air on something.

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:47.100
I am totally fine with our callers using we that's totally fine because this is the

02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:51.400
show where every gamer has a voice and it is your show as well as our show.

02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:57.160
So when you call in and talk about, we talked about this or we, we did so we is fine anytime.

02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:58.160
We did.

02:34:58.160 --> 02:34:59.160
We, the community, we, the vogue.

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:00.160
All right.

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.160
Well now we're going to hang up on you.

02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:02.160
Absolutely.

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:03.160
All right.

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.160
Take care, buddy.

02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:05.160
Bye.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.160
One eight seven seven game OLR.

02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:08.400
Our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.740
Uh, if you'd like to get through, I was going to read some tweets, but I wasn't really

02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:18.460
seeing a whole lot on the Twitters this week, um, for questions or things like that.

02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:22.300
There's a lot of activity, but it was mostly just like some talking back and forth.

02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:25.380
That's how we got our guests for October 12th was through Twitter, but I'll talk more about

02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:26.380
that next week.

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:29.340
Um, Oh, I did see one quick little tweet here.

02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:30.740
There's the one I wanted to see, uh, from red.

02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:35.420
The Hayes had tweeted us saying, uh, S sky and dark soccer and OLR.

02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:37.740
This sounds like up y'all's alley.

02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:42.780
F zero meets audio surf and it's a game called specter game.

02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:47.460
The only issue I had with it is that it's like only available for like systems.

02:35:47.460 --> 02:35:53.100
I don't have like Xbox one and windows phone, but I think it said it was coming to, um,

02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:55.300
iOS at some point as well in Android.

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.300
So that's kind of cool.

02:35:56.300 --> 02:35:58.080
And chip Zell does the music to it.

02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.020
And you honestly sold me right there because, uh, she's great.

02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:04.020
Like super hexagons, like one of the greatest soundtracks out there.

02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:06.300
But anyway, we are getting other calls, so let's get to it.

02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:07.300
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:08.860
Who is this?

02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:09.860
Hey, it's Ron.

02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:10.860
What's up everyone?

02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:11.860
Hey, uh, not much.

02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:12.860
How are you?

02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:13.860
I am good.

02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:14.860
Rob, get the coffee.

02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:15.860
We got a dish.

02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:16.860
We got a dish.

02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:17.860
All right.

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:18.860
Well, we're going to dish more.

02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:19.860
We've got to dish so much tonight.

02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:20.860
I love it.

02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:21.860
What are we dishing about?

02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:22.860
Okay.

02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:27.020
I don't know if you remember, but two years ago I called in and did my review of Otacon

02:36:27.020 --> 02:36:33.000
and I talked about a particular fan game that was more or less based on the convention

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.080
itself called crisis heart brawlers.

02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:41.720
I mean, you talk about a lot of cons on this show, but I do remember this whole talk about

02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:42.720
like a game.

02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:43.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:44.720
I sort of remember this.

02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.720
Yeah.

02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:46.720
Yeah.

02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:50.840
Well, they had a Kickstarter to raise the funds and an article popped up recently.

02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:52.120
Like where are they now?

02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:54.320
Like what's going on?

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:59.740
Evidently, they, I think they hit their funds with the Kickstarter, but you know, as with

02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:06.400
most Kickstarters, when it comes to independent games, it's not enough to fill what they need

02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.520
to do.

02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:12.640
So pretty much, I think you have a pretty good idea where this went.

02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:14.160
Down the toilet?

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.160
More or less.

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:18.760
A couple of friends of mine who were voice acting in the game pretty much had to beg

02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.600
the studio to pay them pretty much.

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:22.600
Wow.

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:27.560
And when I had discussed this, a friend of a friend messaged me and pretty much told

02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:36.280
me before the Kickstarter, this guy who was behind the studio, he financially backed this

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:38.880
guy to get some of these projects off the ground.

02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:46.400
Pretty much this guy, I like to call him a poor man Steve Jobs cross PT Barnum.

02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.400
Wow.

02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:52.840
Well, the good news is, good in quotes, is that these types of Kickstarters aren't really

02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:55.920
going to work in the future because you know, Kickstarter changed their terms of service

02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:02.660
like two weeks ago and it can't legally retroactively apply to old Kickstarters, but moving forward,

02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:07.500
people that donate to Kickstarters that don't get anything as a result will have the rights

02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:11.260
to take legal action against the people that do the Kickstarter.

02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:17.140
So don't be going on Kickstarter planning to steal people's money because you're going

02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:18.140
to be hurting.

02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:20.780
Yeah, that's what it boils down to.

02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:25.780
And I've dealt with a few Kickstarters in the past, you know, I've covered where it

02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:28.160
gets quiet, nobody knows what's going on.

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.520
The people who backed it start raising hell and then the people behind the Kickstarter

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:37.840
just miraculously show up out of nowhere and just start, this is what we're going to do,

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:38.840
this is what we're going to do.

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:42.620
And they start sending out the gifts, the prizes and everything.

02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:48.600
As for this one, he appeared to say the game is still in production, but that's the last

02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:49.600
of it.

02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:52.840
No gifts or anything have been passed out in between you and me.

02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:57.440
If I had Kickstarted at $500 to this, I'd be ready to hang somebody.

02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:59.880
But how's the convention doing in spite of all this?

02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:03.640
I mean, did it have any type of official blessing of the convention or no?

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:04.640
They did.

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:09.560
But because there was no updates or changes or anything, they've pulled out of the project

02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:16.800
so the game is now called Crisis Heart Brawlers instead of like Otakon or whatever, you know.

02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:21.080
The Otakorp felt that they didn't want to be attached to it because there has been no

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:23.880
update and it kind of seems very unprofessional.

02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:24.880
It's vaporware.

02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:25.880
Yeah.

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:31.200
Actually the person that told me this information, he pretty much believes it's going to be vaporware

02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:36.960
because the same issue I see with Kickstarter, when people Kickstart video games and other

02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:44.020
projects and so forth, I tell people, start small and build your way up.

02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:48.000
This guy started out big and wanted to keep going bigger.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:51.400
He was trying to do something, he was trying to pretty much one-up Scott Pilgrim versus

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.160
the world of the game.

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:58.200
Well now, what about what Loki's doing because you know Loki refuses to build a Pong clone.

02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:02.560
He's going big on his first project but of course, he hasn't taken a dime from anybody

02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:03.560
either.

02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:06.000
Well, that's okay because this is his own money, so hey.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000
That's right.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I would.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.760
I mean, it will definitely help but no, I haven't done a Kickstarter yet.

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.160
I'm not saying that I wouldn't.

02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:14.240
I probably would actually.

02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.920
But you're waiting until you actually have something done and you want to Kickstart more

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:19.760
like the publishing of the title is what I'm getting right now.

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:22.360
Yeah, pretty much because I don't really need anything for the development because it's

02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.360
just my time.

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:26.600
I'm not going to hire like people coders and stuff like that.

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:31.280
I would need just, it's basically just music and any software that I have to pay for the

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:32.280
licensing for.

02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:33.840
You should get Marisa to do narration for you.

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:34.840
Well, yeah.

02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.240
I was thinking her and I have another friend that does voice acting too, so I've got people

02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:39.240
lined up.

02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:40.240
I want to be in it.

02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.280
I can use my wacky morning DJ voice.

02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:43.280
That's fine.

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:44.280
You're playing the Loki game.

02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.520
Hey, more talent the better, okay?

02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.520
I'm down with that.

02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:49.120
Otherwise, I don't want to tell the voice.

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:54.440
Marisa is true talent, but you know, I'll make your flyers.

02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:55.440
Everybody excels in something.

02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.440
We'll do video game posters.

02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:57.440
Everybody excels in something.

02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:58.440
We can all help.

02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.440
I'll do cabinet art.

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.440
There you go.

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:01.440
All right.

02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:03.680
That sounds pretty cool because that was one of the main problems with this.

02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:08.200
This guy who wanted to make this, he has no software experience.

02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:09.560
He was just a rep.

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:14.400
He was bringing people in to design this game based on his idea.

02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:15.560
Yeah.

02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:19.720
Well, it's going to be a lot harder to put those types of Kickstarters through in the

02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:20.720
future.

02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:21.720
That's for damn sure.

02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:22.720
That's good.

02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:23.720
All right.

02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:25.960
Well, Rama, I'm out of coffee now, so.

02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:30.360
Well, maybe Sailor Chibi Arthur can get you some.

02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:34.200
That thing has been posted to my Facebook wall three times now, but it's great.

02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:35.920
I believe in Sailor B.

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:37.280
Me too.

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:41.360
I would probably watch more Sailor Moon if it was the Golden Girls starring in it.

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:42.460
Let's be real.

02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:43.460
Not that I'm hating.

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:50.980
I know you're not hating because once all the DVDs come out through Viz, you know Alan's

02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:55.140
going to get them and he's going to sit you down and you're going to have a moon marathon.

02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:56.140
No, he'll be too busy playing.

02:41:56.140 --> 02:41:57.140
I was going to be on the left.

02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:58.140
No.

02:41:58.140 --> 02:41:59.140
Jamie's going to be on the right.

02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:00.140
You're going to be stuck in the middle.

02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:01.140
So enjoy.

02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:03.140
He'll be too busy playing Final Fantasy XIV.

02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:06.460
I'm still just going to kidnap Rob and sit him down with my Crunchyroll subscription.

02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:10.860
Now, I'm talking about the original 200 episodes, the classic, not Crystal.

02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:12.020
I like Crystal.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:15.300
I know, but I'm just saying the DVDs, I already have mine pre-ordered, so.

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:21.020
I'm not bothering because I've actually still got my fan subs, if that says anything.

02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:23.100
I still have my raw copies.

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:29.100
I still have my fan subs too, but I am really enjoying the dub so far, so I'm just-

02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:30.700
Refusal, refusal, refusal, refusal.

02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:31.900
All right, nerds.

02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:34.540
I'm ending this talk so we can get more calls.

02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:35.540
Pot Meets Kettle.

02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:36.540
Rob?

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:37.540
Well, yeah.

02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:38.540
Pot Meets Kettle?

02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:39.540
I know, right?

02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:41.540
Hey, did you go to the Hyrule Warriors thing at the Nintendo store?

02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:44.260
I would have, but there was something stopping me.

02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:45.260
It's called work.

02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:46.260
Dope.

02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.260
Yes.

02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:48.740
Hate it when we get foiled by work.

02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:49.740
Yes.

02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:50.740
And one more thing before I get out of here.

02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:54.500
I know people have given me shit for this on my own Facebook, but a deal is a deal.

02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:58.420
Lightning Returns, Final Fantasy XIII, 40 bucks at Target.

02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:00.700
You can't beat that.

02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:03.540
I'm going to hold out and maybe the Steam version will be even cheaper.

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:04.540
That's-

02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:08.220
I don't, like, the first one's like, what, 12 bucks on Steam right now?

02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:12.740
I have all three for the PS3, and much as I know everyone enjoys Steam, but I'd rather

02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:16.980
play a game like this in front of my 32-inch instead of my little inky dinky 21-inch.

02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:17.980
I completely understand.

02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:22.380
I like having my two monitors so that I can actually just jabber with people while I'm

02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:23.380
playing my game.

02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:24.620
Everybody's got their thing.

02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:25.620
And not hurt my hand.

02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.620
All right, Rom.

02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:27.620
I'm going to let you go.

02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:28.620
Take care, buddy.

02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:29.620
You got it, bro.

02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:30.620
All right.

02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:31.620
Anime Jam Session.

02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:32.620
Listen to it.

02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:33.620
Or I'll kick you in the foot.

02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:34.620
I want to be on it again.

02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.820
Listen to the show or else Mako-chan will come after you, and that's not going to be

02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:37.820
pretty.

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:39.820
Ron-chan, I want to be on again.

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:40.820
Working on it.

02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:41.820
Kay.

02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:42.820
All right.

02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:43.820
Bye.

02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:44.820
Bye.

02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:50.500
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:54.540
How about any- I don't- I doubt there is any, but I'm going to check with Loki anyway.

02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:56.060
Is there any last-minute stories?

02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:57.060
No.

02:43:57.060 --> 02:43:58.060
I had a feeling.

02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:00.460
I have a last-minute statement.

02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:03.020
There's cake waiting for me at Becky's house.

02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:04.020
Where's my cake?

02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:05.580
You can come with me.

02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:06.660
I'm sure she'd give you cake.

02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:09.100
I would, but I have to- It's pumpkin chocolate.

02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:14.660
I have to go pick up Alan, and I have to edit the show, and I have to take this phone call

02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:17.180
because we've got at least one more call coming in.

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:18.180
Let's get to it.

02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:19.180
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:20.180
Who's this?

02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:24.100
A seg enters OrangeLoungeRadio audio broadcast.

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:26.460
I'll throw a pester ball.

02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:27.460
Quick.

02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.460
Get up defensive shields.

02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:29.460
Red alert.

02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:32.460
Shucks, how are y'all doing?

02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:33.460
Great.

02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.460
You know what?

02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:35.460
I'll be here in person.

02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:37.460
This is the next best thing, right?

02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:38.460
Yeah.

02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:43.180
I was even thinking this afternoon, like, you know, I wonder ... Nah, I shouldn't ... Oh,

02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:44.180
well.

02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:45.180
You're always welcome.

02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:47.180
Just try to let me know in advance because- No, I know.

02:44:47.180 --> 02:44:49.820
That's why I figured I didn't let you know in advance.

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:50.820
Like, that's too late.

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:52.180
Well, honestly- You've gone too far.

02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:54.900
If you'd told me this afternoon, I would have been like, sure, I ain't got anything going

02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:55.900
on tonight.

02:44:55.900 --> 02:45:00.820
But anyway, seg, of all the many things you've commented on during the show tonight, I'm

02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:02.420
dying to know which one you called in about.

02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:03.420
What's up?

02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:12.820
Well, you know, just to bring back on home a little bit and to expand on that, first

02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:17.820
of all, I think it needs to be said that that was going on for five years?

02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:18.820
How long?

02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.820
It's been a while.

02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:25.180
And I think that's really a credit that it ran so long.

02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:32.140
Yes, because at least ... And I would credit Sony with that because Microsoft would have

02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:36.260
pulled the plug on it in nine months if their track record is any indication.

02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:37.260
Hello, game room.

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.260
Hello, one versus 100.

02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:40.260
Hello, Kinect.

02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:46.420
Anyway, so I actually credit Sony a little more for believing in that, and that's a good

02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:47.420
thing.

02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:48.420
That's a good thing.

02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:49.420
Yeah, exactly.

02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:54.580
And what I don't like to necessarily just go, oh, it's closing, therefore it was bad,

02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:57.260
but try to learn from it.

02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:03.660
And I think that's what we all should do is just celebrate what it was for all its good

02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:08.100
and bad and expand from it.

02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:11.620
And I don't think ... This is sort of something that was inevitable.

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:16.140
As PlayStation 3s come off of the living room shelves and get replaced with PlayStation

02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:23.340
4s, the real question became not when is PlayStation Home going to disappear from PlayStation 3,

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:26.060
but are they going to continue it on PlayStation 4?

02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:30.300
And unfortunately, it appears the answer is no if we're hearing about layoffs.

02:46:30.300 --> 02:46:33.780
Yeah, which is sad.

02:46:33.780 --> 02:46:41.940
But at least with this, they know it's coming and it's schedulable, and they have five years

02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:46.660
to look, to point at, so ... Yes, and which you can't always do in the

02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:47.660
games industry.

02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:54.020
I mean, we hear all these stories every day about, oh, Microsoft just axed 8,000 people

02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:56.940
today.

02:46:56.940 --> 02:47:00.740
So at least there's that sort of dignity with it, so that's really good.

02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:06.900
So the other pivot I want to make, and I know it's a little bit promotion-y, but there's

02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:13.620
a, well, actually a street fair for video games coming up, again, in the LA area called

02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:14.620
Indicade.

02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:16.100
Oh, I want to go to this so bad.

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:17.100
Oh, please do.

02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:18.100
I can't.

02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:20.420
I'm literally in Vegas the very next week.

02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:22.400
It's like this next weekend, right?

02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:27.160
What if I were to give you and your listeners a discount code for Indicade?

02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:28.440
Oh, you're killing me.

02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:29.440
You're killing me.

02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:32.440
Well, you can still get the listeners the code, because I know we have listeners in

02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:37.360
the LA area who would have a lot more realistic chance of going.

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:46.040
So ICF14-FF-Love is the weird code.

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:47.040
I love that.

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.040
One more time.

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.040
Warren, get your pen and paper, people.

02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:50.040
One more time.

02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:51.040
Yeah, it is ICF14-FF-Love.

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:59.320
Love, I love it.

02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:04.960
And the reason is that I'm going to be back there again, and I'm going to be professional

02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:12.440
extrovert again for Squinky, because their follow-up, I don't know, it's not really a

02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:20.200
follow-up piece, but the piece that they worked on after dominating Palpomus is up for awards.

02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:27.760
It's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and thank you, chat, for typing in the code in

02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.240
chat.

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:34.360
So it's called Coffee of Misunderstanding, and it's an interactive performing arts piece

02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:43.880
featuring the Performatron, because Squinky really is good at naming things.

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:53.600
And it's four people and whatever musicians decide to show up for it, and two people control

02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:59.000
the dialogue tree of a play that two other people are acting, and everyone has mobile

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.220
devices that are picking the lines or reading the lines, and there's dynamic sheet music

02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:05.220
to it.

02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:07.460
Oh, wait a minute, so this is like a multiplayer game?

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:08.460
You could say that, yeah.

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:13.000
Oh, this sounds, and it's mobile, like, we were just, again, you really have to listen

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.160
to last week's show, because we talked about Fibbage with Jackbox Games, and they're doing

02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:21.440
the whole mobile phone thing, and after having played that, I was like, oh my god, like,

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.040
why did it take this long for somebody to think to use a mobile phone as a controller?

02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.880
And now you're talking about this is now happening in the indie scene, too.

02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:28.880
Yep.

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:29.880
Amazing.

02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:35.280
So, if you're going to pick one day, pick the Saturday, because of night games, which,

02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:41.040
so IndieCade is a street festival for video games, I think it has a lot more heavy of

02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:44.240
a film festival vibe as far as its structure.

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.640
There's no films being shown there, but it has this sort of structure of a film festival,

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:53.600
and that all the games there were selected to be there.

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:59.320
It's not, I mean, there are a few sponsor booths, but the games that are there in general

02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:00.320
didn't pay to get in.

02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:03.560
They were picked, they applied to and got picked to showcase.

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:07.740
Yeah, it's very similar to a film festival, because I'm involved with a horror, even though

02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:10.280
I hate horror films, I'm still involved.

02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:14.480
I love cult films, and they kind of bleed together a little bit, pun intended.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:19.320
I'm involved with a horror film festival here in SAC, and it's a really big thing for NorCal,

02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:21.600
and it's a very similar process.

02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:22.600
Yes.

02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:28.480
So, during the day, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they're showing the selection, but

02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:33.280
on Saturday night, they close out those games, and out come the night games.

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:38.020
And I don't know what's going to be shown this year, except for one piece called Coffee

02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:46.500
and Misunderstanding, but games that are very much heavy installation pieces, or just have

02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:50.460
a lot of tech, or something strange and weird, get played.

02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:56.140
So if you go the Saturday, make sure you're going afternoon to play the stuff that's shown

02:50:56.140 --> 02:51:03.940
in the daytime, and then night games after, which starts, I want to say eight, but look

02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:07.500
on the website for the full details.

02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:10.420
If you see me there, please say hello.

02:51:10.420 --> 02:51:15.100
I don't mind you pimping at all, because even though, sadly, it's not going to work out

02:51:15.100 --> 02:51:19.100
for me to go to LA, because I'm literally taking a trip the very next week already,

02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:23.380
I did go by the IndieCade booth at E3, they had a really big presence at E3 this year,

02:51:23.380 --> 02:51:27.660
and it was one of my very favorites, because that was one of the only booths where I could

02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:30.260
just walk right up and talk to the person that made the game.

02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:35.980
You can't do that at any other booth at E3, and I don't care if your game is a triple

02:51:35.980 --> 02:51:41.140
A, multi-billion dollar Destiny title, or if it's a small thing that was made in your

02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:44.860
basement, you know, is it fun?

02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:49.880
And when I can talk to the people that made them and really feel that enthusiasm, it raises

02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:53.900
my enthusiasm tenfold.

02:51:53.900 --> 02:51:56.700
That's the great thing about something like this, with the street festival and everything,

02:51:56.700 --> 02:52:00.420
is that you'll be able to walk up and talk to people who are enthusiastic about the game,

02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:02.740
like Sake says, he's a paid professional extrovert.

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:10.860
Yes, and it's also, at least for IndieCade, it's such a refreshing vibe than, what I'll

02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:16.220
say, the conference, or the con scene, whether it be Comic-Con and all the various flavors,

02:52:16.220 --> 02:52:25.900
or PAX, or because there's a lot more non-game people that show up that really makes it a

02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:30.220
different tone of a place that you don't get anywhere else, so I highly recommend it if

02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:33.980
you're in the area, say hello.

02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:39.100
I hope Errol Flynn's always there.

02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:47.300
Which think PlayStation Move controllers in a, I think it was an 8x8 grid hanging from

02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:49.580
the ceiling.

02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:55.580
And then it's four players, you hold two of the controllers at the corners, that's where

02:52:55.580 --> 02:53:01.340
everyone starts, and your PlayStation Move controller will show a color of the ones that

02:53:01.340 --> 02:53:05.580
you're holding, and everyone has one of four colors, and then one of them turns off, and

02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:09.740
there's another one somewhere in the grid that you have to, quote unquote, swing over,

02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:15.740
it's not like American Gladiators where you're actually swinging, but you find your color

02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:20.980
and hold onto that one, and the moment you do, a few seconds later, the one that you

02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:27.220
were always holding turns off, and you have to find another one that has your color, and

02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:28.220
so on.

02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:34.340
And then as the game progresses, the time in which to do that increases, and so eventually

02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:38.380
people lose and get dropped out, and the last person standing wins.

02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:40.900
That sounds crazy expensive with all those Move controllers.

02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:48.380
Yeah, it's the same people who did, oh, I'm forgetting the name of it.

02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:49.380
Sports Friends?

02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:50.380
Is it Sports Friends?

02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:51.780
Yeah, it's in Sports Friends.

02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:57.780
Yeah, I know what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name of the game.

02:53:57.780 --> 02:54:01.580
Yeah, the one with the fencing.

02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:04.780
You'll think of it as soon as you hit the hang-up button, it's a way to go.

02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:05.780
Will do.

02:54:05.780 --> 02:54:10.340
All right, well, hey, so anybody in the LA area or even remotely close that's willing

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:15.420
to take the drive, check it out, indicate, and even though I can't go myself, just based

02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:19.940
on what I've seen previously at E3 and so forth, your time will not be wasted, and you're

02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:23.540
going to find games you haven't heard about before, and I think that's such a refreshing,

02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:24.540
great thing.

02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:25.540
Yes.

02:54:25.540 --> 02:54:32.940
So, and if you see me there, say hello, try to not make it as creepy.

02:54:32.940 --> 02:54:34.260
Say hi and don't be creepy.

02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:38.060
All right, Seg, thanks so much for calling in, I got to let you go so we can wrap up

02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:39.060
though.

02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:40.060
Yep, great hearing from you guys.

02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:41.060
It's John.

02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:44.260
It was Johan Sebastian Joust.

02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:45.860
Yes, that's it.

02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:47.420
Oh, I've heard about that.

02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:48.420
Okay.

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:49.420
Or maybe it's Johan.

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:51.900
That was the night games way back in the day too.

02:54:51.900 --> 02:54:52.900
Nice.

02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:56.300
All right, Seg, buddy, have fun and take lots of pictures because remember what they say,

02:54:56.300 --> 02:54:57.300
pics or it didn't happen.

02:54:57.300 --> 02:54:58.300
Yep, totally.

02:54:58.300 --> 02:54:59.300
Take care of my friends.

02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:00.300
Except for things that don't need to happen.

02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:04.300
All right, take care, folks.

02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:06.300
All right, that's awesome that Seg's going to be at IndieCade.

02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:09.300
Well, I knew he was going to IndieCade, but I wish I could go.

02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:12.740
It sounds like fun, but, you know, too many road trips.

02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:17.660
I'm already going to LA in November for BlizzCon, which I know is really Anaheim, and the SoCal

02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:22.580
people get pissed off when I call Orange County, LA, but you know what, when you're driving,

02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:23.580
it's LA.

02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:24.580
It's all just, it's one big blur.

02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:25.580
It's LA.

02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:30.500
Anyway, that is going to do it for the Skype line, and that is really going to just about

02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:31.500
wrap up our show.

02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:34.420
In fact, Dark Soccer, she had to head out, so she's already out of here.

02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:37.780
So sadly, we will not get to hear her final thought, but I'm sure it has something to

02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:38.780
do with cake.

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:41.140
I'm sure that's what her final thought was.

02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:42.140
But we'll go around.

02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:43.940
Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:47.820
My final thought is, last week I work.

02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:48.820
Wow.

02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:49.820
The last two days.

02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:51.540
Well, technically, I'm not working.

02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:57.060
I'm just showing up at work to clean my desk and eat pizza and whatever breakfast donuts

02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.860
that they bring in and then program in my game.

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:01.740
So I'm going to get lots of work done on my game.

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:04.900
Well, I'm going to apply for jobs too, but I'm also going to get lots of work done on

02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:12.260
my game in this time that I have off because I'm going to be home with the baby for most

02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:15.420
of the week, and then he's going to be going to daycare for the rest of it.

02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:19.220
And so, yeah, I'm just going to...

02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:22.660
But if you have a job lead for Loki, local people, if you have a job lead for Loki, let

02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:23.660
us know.

02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:24.660
Email the show.

02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:25.660
Customer service!

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:28.520
As long as it's not fucking direct sales, because I've gotten contacted, I am not going

02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:31.140
door to door or in a parking lot or something like that.

02:56:31.140 --> 02:56:35.740
If your only experience with Loki is this show, you may not believe that he's great

02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:39.660
with customer service, but think of this show as a release.

02:56:39.660 --> 02:56:41.860
He really is good with the customer service stuff.

02:56:42.700 --> 02:56:45.380
He had his job for a very long time and was very good at what he did.

02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:46.380
Fourteen and a half years.

02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:47.380
Oh my God.

02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:48.380
Well, you know what?

02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:50.460
In the distribution industry, what are you going to do?

02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:51.460
You know what?

02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:52.780
It'll lead to something better.

02:56:52.780 --> 02:56:53.780
It really will.

02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:54.780
Something with advancement.

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:55.780
All right.

02:56:55.780 --> 02:57:00.020
And my final thought for tonight is, oh my gosh, I don't know.

02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:01.440
I don't really have a final thought.

02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:06.480
My final thought is I'm going to IKEA to get this thing a stand to sit on so I can take

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:09.740
pictures of it and put it online and everybody can oogle this arcade cabinet.

02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:10.740
That'll be awesome.

02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:11.740
Not yet.

02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.620
In fact, the way I'm going to be working on it is a marquee.

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:16.900
I'll put my hand over the marquee so people can't see it.

02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:17.900
I'll make a new marquee.

02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:19.260
A new marquee looks awesome.

02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:22.060
I just haven't figured out what else to put in the background because I have some DDR

02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:26.740
arrows in there, but it's very much like a, was it a Street Fighter cross Tekken?

02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:29.060
But it's minimalist is okay.

02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:30.060
You don't have to go crazy.

02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:31.060
I know.

02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:32.060
I understand.

02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:35.500
I may take the DDR arrows and just do a gradient and then print.

02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:36.500
And then...

02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:37.500
Talk to Cody.

02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:38.500
That guy's great with graphics.

02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:39.500
Jamie's good too.

02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:40.500
They probably got a lot of...

02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:41.500
Can I say something real quick?

02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:46.700
Just to replace the, cause right now it says, you know, my company's name, was it a games

02:57:46.700 --> 02:57:49.780
arcade in there and it has, it's got a really cool background.

02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:53.420
I wish I'd saved it cause then I could just remove our company logo out of it and just

02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:54.580
put this.

02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:56.500
But the new one's pretty cool too.

02:57:56.500 --> 02:58:00.300
And I was like, I was all, damn, do I have colored buttons that match that?

02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:04.500
Because that would have been cool to do the orange and the purple buttons, but I don't.

02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:05.500
Oh well.

02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:06.500
Oh well.

02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:09.380

02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:33.940
That's all we ask here at orange launch radio and that'll do it.

02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:38.060
We will be back next week with another episode to recap the week's news.

02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:41.180
Smash Brothers 3DS will be out by then, so I'm sure we're going to have a lot of chatter

02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:42.180
with that.

02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:43.900
Maybe some matches during the show.

02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:44.900
Who knows?

02:58:44.900 --> 02:58:49.180
Uh, we'll be talking about the destiny patch and is the loot system bearable.

02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:53.160
We'll find out next week on another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:58:53.160 --> 02:58:54.160
See you then.

02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:55.160
Good night.

02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:58.380
