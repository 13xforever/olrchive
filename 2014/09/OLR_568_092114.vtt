Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, gaming has its head in the cloud as two new players enter the scene with their own video game and media streaming services. Also tonight, we're interviewing Mike Bilder from Jackbox Games about all things Fibbage and more. Get your trivia caps on and join us for all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 568 for September the 21st of 2014.

00:44.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Not here tonight unfortunately in studio, DarkSakura. She has the night off, a little bit unexpectedly slash last minute too.

00:58.000 --> 01:12.000
She threw out her voice, which obviously doing a radio show needs a voice. She said she would try to pop into chat a little later on, but unfortunately we will not be having our sakura until next week. So Jamie, if you're out there listening, feel better. We miss you.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Joining us in studio though, we do have of course, Techmaster Loki.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes, I don't misplace my voice.

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
Sadly, you still have yours to complain about who knows what tonight. No, I'm kidding. It's fantastic to have you here. Loki, you brought the studio a present this week, I notice.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
So I'm very excited to have this little arcadey machine thingy, I guess.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It's a bar top main cabinet.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
I love that. That's awesome. So I'm going to set that up in the studio somewhere and they'll be good times.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yep.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Good times.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Because it hasn't been getting any use at my work, so hopefully we'll get a lot more use here.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
We will definitely make use of it here. So folks in our chat room, again we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
vognetwork.com and Alan Alchemy in chat saying, let's play what drive-thru did Loki bring to the show.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Well you know we do always talk about food at the top of the show, so.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Well here's the thing, I didn't really want, I had to get something to eat, but I didn't really want, I wasn't that hungry, so I just stopped at McDonald's because it was on the way.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
It was the quickest thing I could get to and it's really not that good.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You literally settled tonight.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
It was like, I don't even really want to eat this, I'm just eating some of it just because I know I get hungry if I don't eat anything.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
So that's why, because it was literally the fastest thing I could find.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, well, so there you go, if you had McDonald's in the betting pool tonight, there you go, you win.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't know what the odds were on McDonald's, but there it is.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
Hey, I want to introduce this fine young man to our program filling in for Dark Soccer tonight, a little bit last minute, appreciate having him here.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
If you ever visit vognetwork.com, you've probably seen him around, he's like our number one fan and stuff.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Say hello everybody to Flaco Jones!

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Wait, I can't do the show if I throw out my voice.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
No, that sounded creepy.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, I know, that's scary.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
That was very scary.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Like Channing Batman.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Harvey Fierstein meets P.T.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't know.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, it's great to have you here in studio, how have you been since the last time we saw you?

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
I've been doing pretty well. My computer at home broke, so I can't like ever guess on Hoard House anymore, so I'll just show up live for this one.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, when you live in the same town, it's an easy thing to do, and when you're the brother-in-law of a co-host of mine on another show, it makes it, you know, you know where I live and stuff.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah, I always knew where you live. I slept on your couch one time when my house got flooded.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Actually, now we're making it sound a little creepy.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah, I know where you live.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Wait, my voice went out again.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I slept on your couch once and you didn't know about it. No, anyway.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I asked permission.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And you're getting lots of highs and hellos in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
ActDeaf says, Flaco Jones sounds like the lady from the anti-smoking commercials.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That is a little bit what it sounds like there.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'll take it as a compliment.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
There you go.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I don't know.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
So, hey.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
She's famous.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We got a really cool interview tonight.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm excited to bring Jackbox Games onto the show tonight, which they are the creators of You Don't Know Jack,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
which, you know, epic game show game, right?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
And then they have this new game that's out on PlayStation 4 was this past week.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I believe it's also on Xbox One, was out a couple weeks ago.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And I believe it's also an iOS game.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
And PS3.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, it's like a cross-buy thing, right?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
We'll get all the details on that.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
But you actually introduced me to this game.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
In a way, it's cool that you're here tonight because you introduced me to Fibbage,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
and now here we are interviewing the studio that made it.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, I think that's crazy how that worked out.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I watched your stream, and I saw you kind of hinted like, oh, we had a special guest.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Like, oh, who was it?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Shane?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I don't know.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Shane was the main guest.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Who else could it be?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And then you said, when I saw that they dropped in on that, I was like, that's amazing.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
You know what's funny is that I had actually sent my email off before that.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
But I noticed they were on Twitter, and I had been promoting the Fibbage stream.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And I saw that my thing was getting favorited and liked.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And I was like, or whatever, favorited and liked is really the same thing, isn't it?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Favorited and all that stuff.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Favorited and retweeted, yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
So I was like, oh, these guys are scouring.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
What's the worst that happens if I send off an email?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
What's going to happen?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, after we played that night, I replied to some of those tweets,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
and then they favorited and retweeted some of my tweets.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I was like, that's weird.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I love that one.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, I love when that happens.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I've also had communication, not communication,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
but just that same experience with when I played Unfinished Swan.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I played on Super Bowl Sunday like, hey, everyone's watching the big game,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
and I'm playing Unfinished Swan.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It's amazing.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
And the guy retweeted it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
That's awesome.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
That's awesome.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
How did you find out about Fibbage?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Because honestly, as much as I love You Don't Know Jack,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
this was not on my radar somehow.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I probably found out through Shane.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Like Shane told me a couple weeks ago, hey, the guys that made You Don't Know Jack

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
made a new game called Fibbage, but it's only on Xbox One right now.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
So I was like, well, I can't wait until that comes out on PS4,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
but I thought it'd be another long thing.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Like, I've been waiting for Peggle 2 forever,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
so I thought it'd be another long thing,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
but it was only a couple weeks, I guess, and he came over on a Tuesday.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
He's like, oh, by the way, that game I told you about is out today.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm like, I'm buying it right now.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
So I used the app.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I bought it, and then we played it right then and there,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
and Shane contacted you, you know, tried to get all the extra for her.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
We tried to get a little game going right there, and it was good.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It was fun.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
It was fun.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
They had a couple bugs on opening night,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
but it seems like it worked great since then.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, and I was just blown away by the fact that here you were

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
streaming it on Twitch TV, and I was playing the game with you,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and it's not even that technology Sony was talking about

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
when they first unveiled the PS4.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It wasn't even that.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It was just like I'm playing this game show,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and you know I love my game show games.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I never showed up on this show about Microsoft killing off one versus 100.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
You know what other game you're going to be able to do that with probably?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
That new Just Dance game that they have.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
What?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What are you talking about?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
You remember they have the Just Dance game with the cell phones?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
No, bring me up to speed on this.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, they have.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
It's a Just Dance game, and it uses cell phones.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
It's like the controller, so I think it interacts with the TV as well.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Like they have something displayed on the TV,

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
but you basically log into a website just like you do I guess on Fibbage,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
so like if you want to play over a stream.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I mean obviously playing a music rhythm music game over a Twitch stream

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
is not as good, but you know still it could be possible I guess.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Interesting, interesting.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
So Flaco, you're a big fan of all these like game show things.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
You have fond memories of You Don't Know Jack, which is another game.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah, You Don't Know Jack specifically because my friend Bobby back in high school

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
was like I've got these.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You knew Bobby Blackwolf in high school?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
No, different Bobby.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh, different Bobby.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't want to say his last name, but he was a really good friend of mine.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
We'll say Bobby B. No wait, Bobby C.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Bobby L. is appropriate. That's close enough.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
So yeah, he had these CD-ROM games, and he's like you got to come over

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and just play with me, and that's where you play on the keyboard,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
and everybody gets a key on the keyboard, and you press the button to ring in.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
If your buddy doesn't know it, you hit S after that to screw him,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
and we played all those things.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
We found all those Easter eggs.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You know, if you type in fuck you, it says fuck you too,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
and then it reduces your score, but like 1000 is like oh, did I say fuck you?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
I meant fuck you, and your score reduces by like 10,000 more.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's crazy. It was so much fun.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
And then if you play on New Year's Eve or Fourth of July,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
it has little things where Cookie will in the introductions

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
will rip you for playing on a holiday or mock you in your loneliness

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
for being antisocial on a very social holiday.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I remember some of that.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, it was great, and they still have trophies like that

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
in the last version of the Jack that was on consoles.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
They had trophies like that.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Like if you play on Fourth of July, it's like,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
oh, how unpatriotic of you is like the trophy that you get.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
That's awesome.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
All right, well, we will talk plenty more about you know Jack and Fibbage

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
and so forth with Mike when he comes on here in about 15 minutes.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So until we get to that, and by the way, you guys can, of course,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
participate if you guys have questions and memories and all that good stuff.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Live.vognetwork.com, of course, is the place to be.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's talk a little bit before we get into it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
We always do a kickoff topic at the top of the show

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
before we get into our gaming week,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and this will probably carry us to the interview.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So we'll get to our gaming weeks about 7 o'clock tonight.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But let's talk about Tokyo Game Show.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's obviously the big thing that everybody's talking about,

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
everybody's looking at, and we're seeing things from trickling in on the Internet.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And I know AkumaJP is probably there.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't even see him in chat, so he's probably recovering.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
But what about from this side of the ocean?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
What have you guys kind of been looking at that's been coming out of Tokyo Game Show?

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Have you guys seen any neat trailers or things for things coming out that look exciting?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm sure, Flaco, you got into this like everybody else.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
The PT teaser had to do something for you, right?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, I was about to say, I think I've mostly been focused on the Konami stuff

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
because I saw the teaser video for PT,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
which I don't know, maybe I understood this incorrectly,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
but I thought they said they made that before they made the playable demo,

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
and that was kind of like their video teaser or concept video that they had first.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And then from there, they kind of made the whole PT game demo

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
because they're pretty different, but I thought it was really cool.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I love the way it looked.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I mean, it didn't necessarily look like Silent Hill,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
but again, I think they're just playing with things.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They're trying to get moods. They're trying to see what works.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It was more Silent Hall.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's that whole aspect of it again,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
but I think it was a little bit more like straight-up horror

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
than Silent Hill's more kind of psychological horror.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I mean, I love the monster going down the hallway.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I thought that was very well done.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, and monster design has always been something people have really dug

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
about Silent Hill, that series,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
and we have iconic horror characters like the Red Pyramid,

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
like the nurses that carried through very well the cinema,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
and so I think that's why it was exciting to see, like,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
oh, the monster design in this game looks like it's going to be just as tremendous.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And if you haven't watched the trailer yet, keep the lights on

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
when you watch the little thing that came out of Tokyo Game Show.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
It's short and sweet.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
It's short, but it'll scare you, and that monster was awesome,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
that thing that was coming out of the office.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, that was my favorite part.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I was like, that looks like Silent Hill right there.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't know, bugs, like, guys barfing up bugs and stuff like that.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, I just like how it's kind of just almost like a creepy roller coaster,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
sort of, in a sense.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
It's like, just stuff is just going to keep, you know,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
ramping up as you're going through, and it's like, oh, fuck, fuck, oh, shit,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
oh, goddamn, what the hell is that?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, my favorite part of Downpour, the most recent game that came out,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
was there's a whole level where you're in this underground mine,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
and towards the end of that, you're literally on a roller coaster.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
You get in a mine cart, it goes up, and it does this whole experience thing.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
You see all these creepy images and monsters coming out of the ceiling,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and I thought that was my favorite part of Downpour,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
and that reminded me a lot of that.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And I know a lot of people don't like Downpour, but I like that element of it.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Not to talk about something even more ad nauseum

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
that we already discussed at great length a month ago,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
but I know you were really into it as well.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
What were your thoughts about that PT, the experience, the game,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
the demo that came out originally?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh, the actual demo?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, because you got really into this too.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, I loved it. I thought it was great.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I mean, I think I found pretty much every little part of it,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
every little Easter egg.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
The last thing I found was that when the glass breaks in one room,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
she's standing up on the balcony, and that freaked me out.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
But yeah, no, I played it a lot.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I was trying to figure out how to repeatedly get killed.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I thought I'd got it.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
There's so many things about that demo that freak you out,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
because you're like, how did they do this?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
How do you get it to repeat?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
It just seems like there's so much.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It feels like it's random, but you know it's not,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
but you can't figure out how to trigger these things.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And the ending was the hardest part.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And yeah, I think I had a pretty good method,

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
but then this other method came out with saying the name Jareth

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
when you played it, and it was just, there's so much going on.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I just think that's a good sign of things to come

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
that I think Kojima's really got his head in this one.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
He's not just phoning it in.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I guess some people would say maybe with the Castlevania reboots he did.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I was worried.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I was like, oh, I didn't mind the first Castlevania reboot game,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
but the second one didn't do well at all.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And then overall, I don't think fans liked it,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
but this one, he really seems like he's taking charge on it,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
and he's really taking ownership of it.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, then I don't know to what extent the role Guillermo del Toro

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
is going to play with this,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
but if it has anything to do with the monster design,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
that would certainly explain why it's so good.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
That's what I'm hoping.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I'm hoping it's pretty much the monster design,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
because when you watch Pan's Labyrinth,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
that looks like a Silent Hill monster,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
the one at the dinner table with the eyes in his hands.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
It's pretty awesome.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
this isn't the first time we've seen a PT type of thing.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I remember years ago if you played the PC version of Portal 2,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
it had a playable trailer that was promoting the movie Super 8.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
That's a little bit different,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
because that's kind of like unlocking,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
that's more like an Easter egg, I think, among anything else.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
But you did see Valve do a little bit of this in Steam,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
even leading up to the release of Portal 2,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
where I seem to remember there was a weekend,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
or it was like they would early release Portal 2 on Steam

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
if these certain conditions in other games were satisfied.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
And I remember Portal started leaking into these other games,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
like AudioSurf was the one I remember I was really into,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
because I like the music games.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And the device has been modified,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
that song from Portal suddenly showed up in AudioSurf,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
and if you beat this, you would contribute to the early release of Portal 2.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
So they have had those,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I don't want to call it an AR type of experience, but it sort of is.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
It's kind of like that.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
It's kind of almost like a viral marketing campaign to really get the word in.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
And they have that ability,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
because they have all the access to those games and that stuff.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
For PT, I think what works so well is because it was on a console,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
and they're like,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
oh, it's just go home and download this game and play it.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It's like this new game, it's a demo or whatever,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and then you play through it, and then you see the commercial at the end.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
And of course, that's viral marketing in a way, too.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
But I don't know,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I think just being on the home consoles is a little bit different

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
than something that's kind of like this PC integrated thing,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
where it's easy to change things on the fly.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
This one, they had pushed this thing out,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
and I hope everyone will just download it and play it.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, they probably knew the rumor would get out eventually,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
especially with it being a scary game.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Like you said, I think you said you thought it would take a week,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
but people beat it in a day.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I don't know why he would think it would take a week.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Why would it ever take the internet a week to figure out?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't know.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, we still don't know how to definitively beat it.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
It's true. It's a definitive ending, but you could beat it.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
There you go.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vog.com.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
It would have been even more hilarious if at the end it was Frog Fractions 2.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I would have still loved it.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
We contributed to the Kickstarter.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
All right.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
ActDef says Guillermo del Toro seems like he's going to be a creative consultant.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
That comes from ActDef in our chat room over at live.vog.com.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
So, yeah, I mean, can you imagine back in the day,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
like we used to get the demos on the discs that came with magazines for CDs, right?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Can you imagine if like there had been a demo on one of those discs

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
and then it was like, surprise, you just played the Final Fantasy 7 demo

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
or something, you know, like something crazy like that.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
That's why it's so weird.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's a PT thing we haven't really seen yet,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
because usually you know what demo you're playing, right?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
So it's kind of neat, kind of neat.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Quickly, I want to bring this up as well.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
I want to talk about Final Fantasy XV.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Did you guys see the trailer that came out for that, the new one?

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Not just the trailer, but there's this gameplay thing from XV that came out

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
that looks phenomenal.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I just saw the trailer. I didn't see the gameplay.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Although the trailer, I mean, a lot of people are calling it a Broad Trip Final Fantasy.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I mean, here's the thing, the graphics in the game look stellar,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
which is to be expected from a Final Fantasy game,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
but then it was like, this doesn't look like a Final Fantasy game.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It's like these dudes are in a car.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, we're driving under a Cadillac or a Buick or whatever it looks like.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
For what it was though, it looks so cool, like

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Grand Theft Auto, fancy you, woo!

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Just pop out of our car, kill some monsters, get back in, look at the sunset.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I thought it was a cool trailer. Did it get a lot of hate or something?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I saw some jokes about it. I don't know if people...

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
It seemed like I saw more people liking it than the gameplay trailer they had.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I didn't see.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
One thing I'm seeing on Twitter is, where's the women?

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Which I think Final Fantasy has brought us a lot of strong female characters,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
that series, so I think that is a fair question to pose.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Are there going to be any women in this game?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
There have been a couple that have been seen out there,

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
and I wouldn't necessarily accuse Square Enix of being incapable

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
of creating a Final Fantasy game with a strong female lead.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I mean, we just had three games with Lightning.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I was about to say, I think they've done their work on that.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Of course I want to see a strong female in this game.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Or Final Fantasy, was it X-2?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
X even kind of had a...

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Right, who doesn't love Lulu, right? From X and all that.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So I'm not worried about, can Square do it?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It certainly was just one of those things where I was like,

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
okay, this is definitely noticeable that it's a sausage fest, this game, so far.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
But I think we also have to remember what we might be seeing in that trailer

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
is one particular chapter, or one particular component

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
of what's probably a much larger game.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
If you go back and you look at the original teaser,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
when they announced it at E3, there were all these different sequences

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and other characters, like there was a child character,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
there was a female that was seen for a little bit.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
So I think what we saw was one piece of what's probably going to be

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
a much larger picture, right?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So, that's my thought.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
We've got Fifth Dream who says,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
OMG, I love Lulu.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
And Dungeon Buster says, Lulu was my clutch artillery mage.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Any other Tokyo game show things you guys caught a glimpse of

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
or anything you want to talk about before we move on here?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Earth Defense Force 4.1.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh yeah? What did they say about that?

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Well, it's just basically they're porting it to PlayStation 4

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
and they're adding some stuff to it.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
So one of the new things that they have is this giant mech

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
versus this giant kaiju type thing,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
which I don't know if it's really anything new.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I mean, the mech thing's new, but the giant monsters,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
they've had giant monsters in the game before.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
So I'm interested.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Are you just excited for the experience on, you know,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I'm trying to resist saying next-gen consoles

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
because they've been out for a year now.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Well, it's not technically a new game

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
because, you know, Earth Defense Force 4 is already out.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It's just they're adding kind of stuff to it

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
and then they're, you know, up-resing it or whatever.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Gotcha.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
And honestly, a game like that,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't know how that's really going to look

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
because it's not that complex to begin with.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah, but if you're going to buy Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
But that's a lot. That is way different.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
No, seriously, that is not even a correct comparison.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
You're talking about Earth Defense Force,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
which is a very basic-looking game,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
and then up-resing it.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It's really not going to change the way that looks

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
versus Grand Theft Auto that they're redoing

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
like all the engine for the game.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
They're redoing the whole, you know,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
foliage engine in there.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They're, you know, increasing the amount of cars in there,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
the lighting engines being redone.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Just all these improvements

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
make it look like a completely different game.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
All right.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, I hate to take the reins

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and take the car a different direction here,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
but it is that time.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
We're going to start our interview here.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
We're going to be talking to you tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Mike, a builder, he's a general manager at Jackbox Games.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Jackbox Games has the brand-new game Fibbage

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
that's out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
but you probably know Jackbox Games from that game

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
that kind of appears in their name.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
You don't know Jack, and we'll talk about those games

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
and who knows what else as we talk to Mike tonight.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
We're going to try to get him on the phone right now,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
and if you guys want to participate,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
live.vognetwork.com to get your questions in for Mike.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Mike, are you there?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm here. You hear me okay?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yes, we hear you just fine.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Excellent. Thanks for having me.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It is a pleasure to have you on,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and congratulations on the release of Fibbage.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I know it just hit PlayStation 4 this past week,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and you had it on Xbox One earlier this month, right?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah, that's right.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
We launched on PS3 and PS4 this week.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
We were out on Xbox One about three, three and a half weeks ago,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
and prior to that, we actually launched the game on Amazon Fire TV.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, okay.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Very cool.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
So four platforms right now.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
There you go.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
So we've talked about kind of our experiences with Fibbage,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
but how would you describe Fibbage?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
What is that game all about?

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Wow. Well, it's a bluffing party game.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You know, in the same vein that you don't know Jack

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
is a fun experience when you have everybody together in the same room.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Fibbage is similar.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
It's the most fun when you have a big party together.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
It's a trivia game, but it's a bluffing game as well.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
So we'll put up a question like the mayor of Rabbitash, Kentucky is blank,

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
and then everyone who's playing the game types in a fib or a lie on their phone,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and they're trying to fool other people,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
so you get rewarded if people pick your lies,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
and then we bring up everyone's lies as well as the truth,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
and then at that point, you're supposed to try and find the truth,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
so you'll get rewarded if you actually pick the correct answer.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
But as you can imagine, it becomes pretty fun.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It can become pretty saucy.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I mean, it all depends on the audience that you're playing with.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Definitely depends on that.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
What I find most hilarious is that when like two or even three people

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
will come up with the same saucy lie, and it's like,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
oh, your mind's in the gutter too.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That's right. That's right.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And those are usually kind of spit takes.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Your beer is usually flying across the room when that happens.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Now, the control style for Fibbage I thought was really unique,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
and that was definitely the first thing.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
I mean, I've loved these game show type games for forever,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
and I'm a big fan of You Don't Know Jack as well.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
We'll talk about that later.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But what definitely grabbed me about Fibbage

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
was that the control style was unique,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
and I don't think I've seen a game yet that uses smartphones

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and tablets as a controller.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Where did you guys get this idea from?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So some people have kind of toyed around with this in the past,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
but not on a main console.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
So, you know, we've seen and explored methods of multiplayer games.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
You know, the biggest hurdle that you have when you're playing on a console

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
is every controller is 50 bucks.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
And especially early in the life cycle of a console,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I mean, who has more than two of those?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
If you're spending four or five hundred bucks on a console,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
you're not going to go out and buy four controllers right away.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
So we benefited in the last generation by things like the big button controller,

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
and people who bought scene it, if they had four big buttons,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
they could immediately go play with those.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
And in this case, we wanted a way for many, many people to jump in and play the game.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
And we wanted to also explore game mechanics that you couldn't do with a controller.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
So in the case of Fibbage, you need privacy because you're lying.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
You need a keyboard because you're entering a lie.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
You know, with a console, you can't really do that.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
You could bring up the on-screen keyboard, but everyone would see it.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
You don't have ways to do that.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
So we prototyped some stuff about a year ago and really got excited about it.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And Fibbage kind of grew out of that.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
And it's our first game that utilizes mobile controllers in this way.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
But we have many, many more coming.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And we're pretty excited about what's yet to come.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Now, did you know that people would take this control style

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and use it to stream over Twitch TV?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Because that was the other thing that grabbed me,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
that the first night I ever played Fibbage, I was playing against Flaco Jones,

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
and he's at his house streaming on Twitch TV and we're able to play the game together.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
I mean, in a way, you beat Sony to the whole play over Twitch thing

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
that was supposed to be in the PS4, in a way.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Right. And we were paying close attention to Sony's tech.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And we're obviously aware of Twitch.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
And all of us are gamers as well, so we watch Twitch

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
and we partake and participate in that kind of stuff.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
We really didn't anticipate people playing Fibbage over Twitch on console

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
the way they're doing it.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
And thankfully, we put enough of the information on the controller

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
that even if there's a 30-second lag or a 20-second lag

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
in viewing the game over a Twitch stream and playing along,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
it's still totally playable.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
And we're pretty excited about that and we're obviously embracing it.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
And we're taking steps for future titles to embrace it even more and even better.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
So we can really do these multiplayer-type experiences with many, many people.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
For instance, one of the games we're working on connects with up to 100 people

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
in the game at a time.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
And you could kind of only do that over a thing like Twitch.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
I don't know that you could, even if you had online multiplayer with PlayStation or Xbox,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
connect that many boxes and have that many people playing in a meaningful way.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So we're pretty excited about it.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
I mean, we kind of admit that we backed into some of this with Twitch,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
but we certainly love it and we love to see it.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And we're constantly refreshing the page and seeing who's streaming

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
and paying attention to Twitter feeds when people are posting their room codes

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
and jumping in on games every now and then.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And it makes for a pretty fun experience.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Do you guys jump into some of those games?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean, a lot of times we'll jump in as Jackbox Games

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
so people will know it's us and we'll kind of,

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
especially if it's a larger subscription or there's many more people viewing

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
because then there's an active chat.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
So we can answer questions and we can kind of have some fun with it.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Sometimes we'll jump in just because somebody's looking to fill up a game

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
and they only have seven people, so one of us will jump in

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
and we probably don't jump in as you don't know Jack or as Jackbox Games.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
We jump in as our own names or something made up.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
So yeah, we're kind of trolling around there too.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Well, now, when I was streaming on Twitch the other night,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
and I don't even know if this is something you can comment on,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
but I have to ask it.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I have to ask it because this is just something that just gets at me.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But when I was streaming, Jackbox Games or somebody joined my Twitch channel

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
and I was talking about how I really liked Fibbage

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
because it was filling a void that was left by the absence of 1 versus 100

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
on Microsoft platform, and I couldn't believe that Microsoft

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
still has not brought that back, but that's beside the point.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
But I had heard that you don't know Jack was being considered for that spot

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
at one point. Is that true?

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Yeah, that's true. That's actually around the time.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
So I joined the company in 2008, and that was around the time

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
that 1 versus 100 was really starting and growing.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
And we were kind of in some involved discussions with Microsoft

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
to be the next big multiplayer title.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I think the service was primetime at the time.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
And unfortunately, that model just kind of didn't sustain.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
And I know there was a rabid fan base of it,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
and we obviously would have loved to have been a title on that platform.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
But I know there were some challenges with sponsorships,

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
and it was kind of an expensive production because it was half live, half not,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
and it just unfortunately didn't come together.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
But we liked the idea of it, and we kind of liked the idea of many people playing together,

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
so we're trying to explore that with our own products going forward.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Maybe not in the same sense of primetime and kind of how that was a scheduled event,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
but nowadays people schedule their own events, right?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
It's true.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
They have DVRs and they record TV. They don't get home from work and make sure at 7 o'clock

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
they can tune in to whatever they want to watch.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
They watch it at their leisure because they record it.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
And Twitch and things like that allow people to do the exact same thing with gaming.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Absolutely. Even though we're a live show, we have many, many more that listen on the podcast.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
That's just podcasting was really how people were even able to find our own show.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
So you're absolutely right. People kind of want to do things at their own convenience with that.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
So, man, though, just thinking about what could have happened.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
And then to know, Microsoft went and paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft, but they couldn't keep...

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
All right, I'm not going to get there, but I just...

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Hey, listen, if Microsoft wants to come and pay $2 billion for Jackbox games, we're totally open.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I love that you just openly admit that. That's fine.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
They could probably give us just $1 million for VOG Network. We'd take that.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Oh, yeah?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You don't sell yourself short.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Man, it just has me thinking, though, I don't know if you personally were involved with any of this,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
but I know like Berkeley Systems had published the original You Don't Know Jack.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
And when I think about these game shows, you know, the granddaddy to 1 vs. 100 on Microsoft was really, to me, like Acrophobia.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And what were those other games that Berkeley did? Cosmic Consensus was that one?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Were you involved with any of that?

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
So that stuff predates me. I obviously played all that kind of stuff, and I was a big fan of it.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
But my involvement with that in the company, that predates me.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
Now, you know, obviously we have a lot of history with Berkeley and then Sierra and a number of people publishing

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
You Don't Know Jack on CD-ROM, and then in the console space, there was a PlayStation SKU,

29:24.000 --> 29:34.000
and then we did a deal in 2011 when we launched on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Wii and all those platforms with a publisher as well.

29:34.000 --> 29:41.000
But yeah, I mean, there's also, Acrophobia is one of those titles that people always ask us to make, but we don't own that IP.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
So, you know, if we can get a hold of that IP, we'd be happy to make it.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
And there are a lot of folks that work at Jackbox Games that have been involved with the company, you know,

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
since it was Jellyvision back then, and since it did the first You Don't Know Jack.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
So there's a fondness in the studio as well for titles like that.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
And so, you know, no doubt we could do some wordplay games like that, but if people actually want Acrophobia, the game, the brand,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
we don't own it, and we would need to find a way to get it.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
So we're stuck with IRC bots until then, basically.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Unfortunately, yeah.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Hey, we're going to get to your questions over at live.vognetwork.com if you have a question for Mike and Jackbox Games.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
And also, I'm going to get to some other listener questions.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But there's some other questions here in studio, too.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Flaco, who introduced me to Fibid, do you have a question for Mike?

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah, mine's more along the lines of You Don't Know Jack and just kind of the future of these types of games.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
Now that you're using the tablets and the mobile devices, would you use those in You Don't Know Jack?

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And if so, could we see a return to the gibberish question?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
What's that in the 2011 release?

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah, that's a great question.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
So we moved away. I'll give you a little bit of history.

30:54.000 --> 31:02.000
We moved away from console space after we did the deal with THQ and re-released You Don't Know Jack on all those consoles.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
And we moved into self-publishing and kind of went into the social gaming space and the mobile space.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And we did a number of products in the mobile space.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
We put You Don't Know Jack on Facebook and on mobile and kind of linked those together.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
We certainly learned a whole lot in the process.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
But one of the things is people loved the gibberish question.

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
So that was present in the mobile and the social game, the Facebook game, because everybody's got a keyboard or has a virtual keyboard on their phone.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
So in the console space, tricky if you still want to support controllers.

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
So what I can tell you is we have finished a new version of You Don't Know Jack.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
And it's called You Don't Know Jack 2015.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
And we will have more to say on all of that next month.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
So if you're a big fan of the game and the franchise, you can look for it on next-gen consoles.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
And you can look for some more messaging around all of that real soon.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Awesome. I was going to say there was a tweet I caught from the Fibbage account just a couple days ago where I was like, oh, something's coming, something's coming.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
So that's excellent. Good luck with that.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah, I think the guys shared a segue video, a question 10 segue video.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
Which in some ways are one of the best parts of the new You Don't Know Jack game. Those segues are hilarious.

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
My favorite one is when it's slightly different, like something changes in the segue. That was my favorite part.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah, that kind of goes into the Easter egg stuff, which you guys were talking about at the beginning of your show.

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
That's kind of a big thing for us, either dated things or text entry things.

32:36.000 --> 32:44.000
If you tell the host in a gibberish question or in your player name, fuck you, obviously you get some quick response from him.

32:44.000 --> 32:53.000
If you play on certain dates, if you find the wrong answer to the game, if you play enough and you see alternates to the segue videos.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
There's always little mystery things that we like to hide in You Don't Know Jack.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
Awesome. I'm so looking forward to the 2015 version. What other little clever things you might have in there?

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
I actually have a Facebook question that's along these lines. This question is submitted from SSG100Matt on our Facebook.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
What's the writing process like when you guys and gals are writing questions for You Don't Know Jack and Fibbage?

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
I would imagine the brainstorming sessions are hilarious.

33:19.000 --> 33:29.000
I've worked in the games industry for quite a while, and I've got to tell you, the writers and the designers and the people that I work with in the Jackbox game.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
There isn't a day that I don't laugh out loud at work, so it's pretty awesome.

33:34.000 --> 33:44.000
We have full-time people, we have an editor. It's actually quite a big process and probably very underestimated by the people that play our game.

33:44.000 --> 33:56.000
And other people that even work in the gaming industry. They probably completely underestimate what it takes to write and source and edit and punch up and throw out and re-record and record.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
For a game like You Don't Know Jack, the majority of production, I don't want to underestimate the engineering and all the other effort that goes into it,

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
but there's just a small little army that has to create all that content.

34:08.000 --> 34:17.000
And Fibbage is pretty much the same. It's slightly easier content to write, but all of it still needs to be doubly sourced and it has to go through reviews,

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
and they get thrown out and edited, so we only put the best stuff in there and not duplicates of things.

34:24.000 --> 34:33.000
And then it all gets voice recorded. Cookie's on staff, and so he has to voice record all that stuff as well. So it's quite a big process.

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
I did not realize until I was doing some research for this week's interview and some text messages with my own announcer here, Jason, at the top of the show,

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
Jason was saying, did you know that Cookie is like a pseudonym for somebody that works there? And I was like, oh my gosh, I thought Cookie was a real person.

34:48.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah, so the founder of the company, Harry Gottlieb, his brother Tom actually works for the company as well, and so he's Cookie.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
And he actually works out of his house in New York, and he's got a recording booth set up there.

35:02.000 --> 35:11.000
And we've got some pretty great tools where we can in real time kind of communicate with all of the content of our game, and he can record directly into it.

35:11.000 --> 35:21.000
And so it's a pretty sophisticated process, but as you know, we've been making this game for quite a while, so we've kind of got a pretty robust toolset and pretty honed pipeline at this point.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, fifth dream in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, I've been playing You Don't Know Jack for like 15 years, maybe more.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Yep, well, that's about right.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
That's about right, I remember playing it about that long ago as well.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah, 95 was the first time it came out, so we're getting close to our 20th anniversary here.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Flocko, you got another question?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah, yeah, does Chalky the Chipmunk work on staff too?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Somebody on Facebook asked about that too.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
The voice-off does, yes.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
That's awesome.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
And Act Deaf says, I knew Cookie was a pseudonym, but Fibbage Funfest says Cookie is very real.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, Cookie was on the short-lived ABC TV show they had of You Don't Know Jack, right? Didn't they have Cookie on that?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Yeah, I think just as a voice though.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Yeah, he was the host.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
But yes, he was, Tom was on the show.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Yeah, I know, Peter Herman was the host.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
Let's see, going to our chatroom for another question, this is from our live chatroom at live.vognetware.com.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
Act Deaf asking about some other platforms potentially for Fibbage, saying how about a Wii U version and an Android version?

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Wii U version would seem like a good fit. Are you looking at any other platforms?

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
So we're always looking at it. The tricky thing for us is we're still a small developer,

36:31.000 --> 36:38.000
so we kind of have to pick and choose our battles and go after where the largest network and the biggest adoption might be.

36:38.000 --> 36:47.000
Wii U is a possibility. Android and iOS are probably more likely than Wii U,

36:47.000 --> 36:56.000
just because of the size of the audience and the fact that we kind of migrated from console into social mobile and now back into console.

36:56.000 --> 37:05.000
And so the way that we're developing and some of the tools and middleware and things that we're using allow us to rapidly prototype and even develop still on mobile.

37:05.000 --> 37:12.000
So what we'll do, even the Fire TV, which is an Android-based box, we're able to run the games and make builds and bring them home

37:12.000 --> 37:21.000
and play them with friends and family over the weekend in prototype states and just get real-world feedback on what's working and what's not and bring them back.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
And so it's more likely that kind of iOS, Android-type environment than maybe the Wii platforms.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
But we'll look. I mean, the other kind of stuff that we're hearing a lot of right now is when is it coming to UK?

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
When is it coming to Australia? And we're certainly looking at all of those as well.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
Again, we're a small developer, so there are costs involved with all of that besides just getting ratings.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
There's whole production and QA cycles because you have to go through submissions with all the first-party guys, again, with Microsoft, Sony, all of that.

37:48.000 --> 37:56.000
It's not just you flip a switch and a dashboard and suddenly you release in Europe, which is kind of how it works on the iOS and Android platform.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
If you just want to sell in every market, you check a box and the next thing you know, it's propagated in every market.

38:00.000 --> 38:07.000
It's very different in the console space. So we're looking at it and if the audience is big enough and the demand is big enough, we'll do that type of thing.

38:07.000 --> 38:14.000
But we're also small and we're also working on a whole bunch of other stuff and we want to make sure that we can get some more games and new games out as well.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
So it's a tricky thing to answer. I know it's probably not the best answer people want to hear, but yes, we're looking at all that stuff.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
And it's likely that we will make some moves to bring additional platforms online and some additional territories online.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
I think there's a lot of people that imagine that the release thing looks like one of the scenic controllers where you just, oh, this button releases it in the UK?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Why would they push the button? Why would they do it?

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
You know, it's kind of that way in the mobile space. Once you make the game, you just check the boxes where you want it to go and it goes.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
But not the same in the console space, no.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
There you go. All right, another question from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
DarkTetsuya says, what was the inspiration for Fibbage? Cards Against Humanity, maybe, speaking of minds in the gutter?

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Well, we obviously love that game. And those guys are in Chicago. We know some of those guys.

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
So we kind of like to support that type of play. It's party play. We like that.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
We like being in the same room and playing with friends and family.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
We play lots of kind of games. We bring in board games and card games all the time.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
We play parlor type games like Murder and things like that.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Werewolf, people know it as Werewolf.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
So we're kind of always getting inspiration from that kind of stuff.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Baldur Dash is obviously some type of inspiration for Fibbage.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Just the idea of bluffing.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
And again, it kind of came out of doing a bunch of prototypes.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
So we do these internal RFPs.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
So if you're ever working with a publisher, they may say,

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
we've got an RFP request for proposal for a family game and it's trying to go after this demographic and here's how we want it to work.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
And they put it out to bid with all different kinds of studios.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
And if you have time and effort and you're interested, you put a proposal back to them and maybe you'll be lucky enough to get the gig.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Well, we do that internally. So we do internal RFPs.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
And we do these every couple months.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
And we'll kind of look at the marketplace or we'll look at our product portfolio and try to round out where we want to go with things.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
And Fibbage is one of the prototypes that kind of came out of that process.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
So we break up the studio into small groups of a couple people.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
We do it over a week or two.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
And they spend a good amount of time kind of prototyping, rapidly prototyping games.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And then we present them internally to each other.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And other people critique them.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
And then we kind of slice them on different verticals of if we think it's unique, if we think it'll sell, if we think, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
And ultimately, Fibbage just came out of a really fun demo of a bluffing game.

40:30.000 --> 40:39.000
And then when we kind of extrapolated that into the mobile space's controller, which is obviously how it had to be if we were going to allow keyboard entry and whatnot,

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
you know, then it turned into, well, what other unique ways can we use the controller?

40:44.000 --> 40:52.000
Besides it just acting as a joystick alternative or as an alternative to a big buzzer or a big button, what else could you do with it?

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
And so some of our newer games that we're working on will work in a similar manner to Fibbage.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
But others will use a touch screen in a unique way as well.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
So we're pretty excited about that.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Awesome. Now we're running out of time here.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
I got to start to wrap things up.

41:08.000 --> 41:16.000
But I need to make sure you heard this tweet, because we got a tweet when we announced you as a guest from our pal, Peter Uno, who's actually overseas in the UK.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
You were talking a little bit ago about the international releases and Peter Uno says, top guest, top company.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm a very firm believer in the Jack principles. Great for educational interactives.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
I say this because the site I work for is famous for our educational interactives, which were influenced strongly by you don't know Jack.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
So so even if if even if the game can't release over there, you're still influencing people over there.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
That's awesome. Great to hear. That's great.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Before I let you go, I always like to ask our guests that come on the show, what types of video games are you playing right now?

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
And you can't name the you can't name the stuff your own company's making.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
What are the types of video games you play?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I can't because those are great.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
They are great. They are great.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
I bring them home every weekend and we play them.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
We we we plug those for you, though, Mike.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
I don't. What do you plan?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
I have I have a 10 year old and I have an eight year old.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
So we play a lot of Minecraft, Minecraft, Disney, Infinity, Skylanders.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Those are kind of the go to games when I'm playing with my kids.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
My own affinity is in the arcade space.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
So I play I've got some coin apps in my house. I play those quite a bit.

42:25.000 --> 42:31.000
And when I get time, I get about five percent through every major game.

42:31.000 --> 42:40.000
So I've got every major released game on last gen and a number of the good ones on current gen, although I don't have destiny yet.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
And I managed to play through five percent of them before I have time to switch to the next one.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
So one of these days I'll be able to sit through, start to finish.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
But I feel like that hasn't happened in quite a while because I have kids.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Mike, I sympathize with you and I don't even have the excuse that I have kids.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
I just we call it here at OLR Gamer ADD.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
You got to play everything. You got to know what's out there.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
Some of them you wish you could play through entirely, but then something new comes out and that's just how it works.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Exactly right. Well, Mike, I do want to give us an ample opportunity to plug Fibbage here.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
Everybody, Fibbage is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Amazon Fire, Xbox One.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Where can they find more information online or on Twitter and all that, Mike?

43:23.000 --> 43:30.000
Well, you can follow us, JackBoxGames, on Twitter. There's also a Fibbage handle on Twitter as well.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
You can go to our website, JackBoxGames.com.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And then we're also pretty active on Facebook as well.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
But you can find everything out about our games and what we're working on.

43:39.000 --> 43:51.000
We do have a blog on our website and we're hoping in the next week or two to start doing some Twitch streaming slash kind of video podcasting on Fridays.

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
And we may actually start teasing, since Twitch is such a great vehicle for people joining games and playing our games,

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
we may start teasing a couple of our new games and letting other people join in and play them.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
So keep your eye out for that over the next couple of weeks.

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
That's quite the little tease there. You honestly could probably show us some of those brainstorming sessions and get a lot of viewers for that too, though.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah, or prototypes. We have a lot of prototypes that are great and we have a lot of prototypes that just didn't cut it.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And I feel like those would be even fun to show to just laugh at some of them.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Oh, I bet, except the creative funny guys. You're going to get all those people to come in and say,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Why didn't you release that?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Right, exactly.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
So be prepared for that.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
Or maybe we'll get some grassroots Kickstarters going so we can release them.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
All right, you never know. You never know.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
Mike Bilder, General Manager at JackBoxGames, thank you so much for taking the time out of your Sunday night to come here on Orange Launch Radio Live.

44:42.000 --> 44:49.000
Best of luck to you with the continued rollout of Fibbage and You Don't Know Jack 2015 and whatever else you guys have in the future.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Well, thank you guys very much. Thanks for having me and thanks for all the support.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
You're welcome very much. Anytime. Take care.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
All right, you too. Bye-bye.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
Bye-bye. Mike Bilder with JackBoxGames, everybody. So great to have him on the show. What did you guys think of that?

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
See, that's the problem. If you put those prototypes out there, then that...

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
See, do you want Goat Simulator? Because that's how you get Goat Simulator.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I thought Goat Simulator was awesome.

45:10.000 --> 45:20.000
It was awesome, yes, exactly. But, I mean, it's like if you really want to work towards a specific thing, you're going to be making Goat Simulator because people are going to like the stupidest thing that you have.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
And that's great, though, because it sells.

45:23.000 --> 45:31.000
All right. Flaco, as a fan of what they've done since they were Jellyvision and all that stuff, what did you think of that? Good stuff, huh?

45:31.000 --> 45:38.000
I thought it was a great interview. I was really excited to hear a lot of that stuff. I was like, yes, I can't wait to play You Don't Know Jack next year.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm a little curious to see what that game he's talking about, or teasing the 100 players.

45:43.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah, when he said that, my mind went to like, wait a minute, I was just about to ask a question about 1 versus 100. Are you telling me you're going to take this on your own terms? I don't know.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
You could see Rob light up.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Yeah, you could see me here in studio. I was like, what did he say?

45:57.000 --> 46:04.000
So, all right, anyway, big thanks to them for coming on, and I actually wasn't expecting to get them on here as fast as we did.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
I thought, oh, I'll schedule something in October, but no, they were like, oh, sure, I'll come in on Sunday.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
So, big thanks to them for being flexible and answering your questions, and we wish them the best of luck.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
That's always great to see such a small studio who makes those big landmark games do so well.

46:18.000 --> 46:29.000
All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on with, let's get into our gaming weeks. I told you about 7 o'clock we'd finally get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

46:29.000 --> 46:38.000
And then we'll get into some gaming news, more stuff from Tokyo Game Show, and of course, later in the show, your emails and live phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, salad.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
First, our gaming weeks. Loki, what do you even up to?

46:47.000 --> 46:58.000
I didn't play any games, per se. I did redeem a ton of Steam codes, though, because, one, I purchased a Humbundle 12, because, you know, I didn't have enough games in my backlog.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
But they had some games that I kind of wanted, so I just figured out what the hell, I'll go ahead and buy that.

47:03.000 --> 47:10.000
But with that, though, Humble Bundle has, in your library, it now has a section of unredeemed Steam codes.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
And I was like, holy crap, I haven't redeemed half of these? There's like Humble Bundle 9 on there?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
I'm like, did I just not, I bought this and just didn't do anything with it?

47:20.000 --> 47:27.000
So, I went in and redeemed a bunch of my stuff and redeemed all my Origin codes that I had that had been sent there from the Humble Origin thing back when.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I was like, I'm never going to download Origin.

47:29.000 --> 47:42.000
So, I did all that, and then also redeemed my early access for Road Redemption, so I'm going to try to play some stuff this week.

47:43.000 --> 47:51.000
I installed Road Redemption, I installed Race of Sun and Earth Defense Force, because I was starting that a little bit.

47:51.000 --> 48:01.000
So, I'll try to play something. In fact, I just helped someone get on our Minecraft server, and that kind of reminded me, I was like, crap, I should really go dust that thing off.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
You know, it needs a little work.

48:04.000 --> 48:11.000
I've been dabbling in the Minecraft again, thanks to the PlayStation 4 release, so I could be talked into coming on the PC version and having a little fun with there.

48:11.000 --> 48:23.000
What I was working on before I stopped working on it was adding weapons to the game, like guns and stuff, so we'll see.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
I'm kind of curious to see what their official modding, when they do add that official modding support, what that's going to do.

48:29.000 --> 48:44.000
They really do need, I mean, Java's cool and all, but they really do need a better client, something that actually utilizes your GPUs and stuff, because that would really help speed that game up and be able to do some cool stuff with it.

48:44.000 --> 48:52.000
Alright, well, I know you haven't been playing a lot lately, because you are writing your own game, and best of luck with that.

48:52.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm just about back to where I was before I decided to rewrite everything again, so I just finished testing, or I should say my son was testing, because he was playing with it, testing the object editor stuff.

49:07.000 --> 49:18.000
So now I've got it to delete and rotate and change color correctly for one of the primitives, and now I just need to add the code to add to the rest of them.

49:18.000 --> 49:26.000
That should be pretty quick. And then I've got to build on top of that to be able to do levels and stuff.

49:26.000 --> 49:36.000
So once I finish that, then I'm going to start finishing the actual game code for the actual gameplay and stuff, and then I have to make some actual assets for it.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
TalkingMinecraft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Good2Know says,

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
I tried so hard to like console Minecraft, but I had been too spoiled by the PC version.

49:46.000 --> 49:55.000
You know, I can sympathize with that, because obviously the PC version is the modding and all that, which makes it fun, but I love the simplified crafting interface that's on the console version.

49:55.000 --> 50:02.000
That's a big selling point for me, because I'm not really super into the, like, I like just the menu, and do you have the items in your inventory, yes, do it.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
That takes one of the, for me, boring parts out of the game.

50:06.000 --> 50:17.000
I 100% agree on that, and if they had a way to plug that into Minecraft, well, you know, they do have different interfaces you can get, but it's all client-side stuff, so.

50:17.000 --> 50:24.000
But they had that, because I play with the, I always play with the controller, even on the PC version, and a lot of people don't play that way.

50:24.000 --> 50:32.000
And before we get to Flaco's week, BlackWolf asks Loki, how many weeks before Loki quits the gaming industry because social media is too suffocating?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Never, because it's stupid.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
Well, if some of the other crap in this show's history hasn't broken you, I don't think that little game's gonna...

50:41.000 --> 50:53.000
There is so much. And here's the thing, though, I don't know if it's just because I'm, it's like, almost like a soap opera or something, but I am watching all that gamergate stuff and reading everything about that, and both sides.

50:53.000 --> 50:59.000
It's just a big ol' fuckin' mess right now, and we're not even gonna get into it, but it's a big ol' fuckin' mess.

50:59.000 --> 51:13.000
And be glad that we're indie, and we don't have to, you know, the only secret club we have is when we sometimes spoil, you know, stuff that we shouldn't be saying about certain games and stuff, but that's...

51:14.000 --> 51:24.000
I would consider it a privilege to be considered part of the gaming illuminati, like when that, or as I've been calling it, the galluminati, because you take the gaming and illuminati and throw it together.

51:24.000 --> 51:36.000
I would've taken it as a privilege to have my picture on one of those, like, don't believe this person, I would've been like, wow, somebody thinks I'm important enough to be in the know on that stuff, that's awesome.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, but I, none of us are, unfortunately we're just people that, you know, we just do a podcast, and...

51:43.000 --> 52:02.000
Every, look, all I'm saying is that, and I have said in the past, I don't really want to get into it, but I'm kind of side skirting it is what I'm doing, because what I'm saying is that all this crap everybody's talking about, there's corruption, and it's a clique, and all this stuff, like, we told you that, like, eight years ago.

52:02.000 --> 52:19.000
I will never forget one of these events that, Loki, you and I went to, and you could just, man, how we got, we got NDA'd out of being able to announce things before the big sites, because we signed an NDA, and these other websites didn't have to, like, they got to each announce their own little thing, right, remember that?

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
And just like, you know, because all these guys go to all these different shows, they all know each other.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Yeah, it was the first Konami event we went to.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
And we were getting...

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Yes, I'm calling you out, Konami. It was your Konami event.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
The reason, the reason why I, is because they're all like that.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Oh, yes.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
They're all like that.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
I'm not singling out Konami here, I'm sure that everybody does that, and probably some to a worse extent.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
But then, like, you know, you and I were getting all those stares from people, like, who the hell are these guys? Like, I was just like, oh my god.

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
So anyway, I'm just telling, that stuff's existed forever. I don't know why just now y'all are finally like, oh hey, go ahead.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
I have no problem with them being friends with each other.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Yeah.

52:58.000 --> 53:11.000
That's fine, it's, but when you go on like a private forum and start like, you know, plotting, you know, here, oh, this is going on, how are we going to communicate this to, how are we going to, you know, send the message out about this.

53:11.000 --> 53:23.000
That's a little weird, unless, I mean, if it was like, say, oh, this developer has cancer and you want to raise funds for them or something like that, that's something.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
But it, I don't know, it wasn't the case here, and it's just, it's still weird, I guess.

53:28.000 --> 53:42.000
And then, then, then the problem here is too, that the message of that corruption gets muddled with all these people that are there, and I'm using my quotey fingers for the lulz, to just, just be awful to other people.

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
And you know I don't, I don't stand for that shit. Like, don't, don't be a dick. We always say that here on OLR, if you're going to be playing games online, don't be a dick.

53:49.000 --> 54:00.000
That includes Twitter, that includes, let people have their opinions. You can think they are wrong, wrongo, wrongy, wrong, wrongerson, but they're entitled to that opinion and human decency.

54:00.000 --> 54:18.000
To boil it down, it's like this, okay, yeah, there's some corruption in game journalism, yeah, there's some people out there that are gamers that are also misogynistic, but don't lump everybody into that because not all gamers are misogynistic, not all press, you know, gaming press are corrupt.

54:18.000 --> 54:29.000
And so that's the problem, is you have people making these over generalizations, and shame on these websites for even making those broad generalizations come on. I mean, it's ridiculous.

54:29.000 --> 54:39.000
And it only makes you look bad. And on top of that, you know, these people on both sides that are doxing people or swatting people, that's ridiculous.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
That's what I'm talking about. With the whole being a dick stuff. Stop it.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
That is absolutely ridiculous. They should not be doing that at all to anybody.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
We went way further down that rabbit hole than we intended to.

54:47.000 --> 54:57.000
But there's people, there's people that are rabid fans of these, you know, celebrities or whatever, and they will literally do whatever because they think it's going to gain them some favor with them.

54:57.000 --> 55:09.000
And so, yeah, there are crazy people. And this kind of goes back to Xbox Live, honestly, because Xbox Live is full of, you know, young anonymous people that, you know, they're immature and they act immature.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
And because they're anonymous, they think they can get away with it. And so you have these people doing the same shit online.

55:14.000 --> 55:22.000
So, yeah, of course you're going to run into these misogynistic dicks and stuff, but it's just, it's the internet, goddammit!

55:22.000 --> 55:30.000
They're everywhere! In every hobby that you're, I bet you there is a fucking Bobby Flay forum with some misogynist dicks in there, okay?

55:30.000 --> 55:40.000
Or there's like, you know, or some forum dedicated to like Hello Kitty that has misogynistic dicks in it. I mean, it's seriously, it doesn't matter. It's the goddamn internet.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
That's all right. It's the internet. It's full of misogynistic dicks and nice people.

55:45.000 --> 55:53.000
Demix in our chair. I hope I said that right. Demix in our chair over at live.voguenetwork.com said, just some kids who watch too many episodes of Boardwalk Empire. Yeah, maybe a little.

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
All right, look, we're moving on. Loki, I gotta, I gotta keep the show going. It's already an hour in. We're not even to a headline yet.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
So Flaco, how was your gaming week?

56:01.000 --> 56:15.000
Mine was pretty good. I played a lot of games this week. On mobile, I was playing Plants vs. Zombies 2 and I've kind of stopped on that and gone back to another game that I had given up on, but I'm back to again, which is Marvel Puzzle Quest.

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
So I've been playing that and I'm doing pretty well on it. I just checked and I'm like number one in this current tournament.

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
I've been a very bad boy at Marvel Puzzle Quest. I was, I was playing it hardcore for like three weeks and then it was like the 5% thing that Mike was talking about.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Yeah, yeah. It was something shiny, something else to play.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
And you really have to play that game to get, to really like excel at it.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It's fun. I mean, it's really fun.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
It's Puzzle Quest, which was a great series. It's basically Puzzle Quest, so.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
I was really turned off by one of the recent patches, but I've gotten used to the changes they made and they made a couple of fixes to the changes.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
It's just that they put the changes out right around Comic-Con because they had a panel there and they kind of changed how a lot of the game works and I got burned by it.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
But I still logged in every day and at least did one game to help out my alliance.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Aww, that's more than I did.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Because if you just play, everybody gets a little reward.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Gets a little bit.

57:04.000 --> 57:11.000
I did that. So that's it for my mobile stuff. Oh, I just beat Infamous Second Son finally, which I got for my birthday in June.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
So I finished that. That was really fun.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Did you touch the DLC at all yet?

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
Uh, no. The one that came with it, yeah, but not the one that just got released.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
There was like a little bonus one that kind of tied back to the previous games, Cole's Legacy.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
I played through that, but that's like interwoven in the game. I think the DLC is standalone, the new one.

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
Yeah, which is cool because they did that before with their Halloween DLC for Infamous 2.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
I really like that. So I'm definitely going to get it.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
But I'm also thinking about playing the game again, playing Evil. I played good. I always play good.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
But I've always rented Infamous games before. I never actually owned one.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
So now that I own it, I'm like, well, I guess I could play it again. I don't have to send it back to gameplay or anything this time.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
And let's see, outside of that, what else did I play?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Oh, Velocity 2X. That's a really fun game.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
That's one of the free games that came out at the beginning of this month for PlayStation Plus.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Oh, right, right. I haven't checked that out.

58:04.000 --> 58:12.000
It's really awesome. I'm not usually into those kind of games, but it's got the spaceship levels, and it's got these levels where you go and you fight on the ground.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
And I'm like, these guys must have really liked Guardian Legend or something because they're kind of making their own little indie spin on that.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Oh, now you just made my eyes light up like, ooh, I'm missing something.

58:21.000 --> 58:29.000
You fight a ship, you shoot stuff up, and then every once in a while you have to dock, and they're 2D side-scroller levels.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
And you have pretty much the same powers as your spaceship, which is pretty cool.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
So you do teleporting, you can shoot things, you run around.

58:36.000 --> 58:43.000
And the whole object through doing that is usually to open up these gates, and you have to shoot the gates in different orders all the time.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
So maybe gates one and three are outside.

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
Well, that means you have to go dock the ship after you blow up gate number one, or lock number one, whatever you call it.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
And then go inside the dock, and then on foot you find lock number two, you blow that one up.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
And then you go back outside, you blow up lock number three, and then the shield is down, and you can go rescue survivors and stuff.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.000
And it's got a really cool story that's worked in it, and I don't think I actually played the first Lost game.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I watched my nephew play it, and I was like, oh, that looks okay.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
But it's just the ship stuff. They added all this other stuff to it now, and it's a really cool game.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
And I think it got really great reviews too.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Check that out.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's definitely worth checking out, and the music's fantastic as well.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Is it?

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Because if somebody made a next-gen Guardian Legend, I am here for that.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
It's an indie game, so it's not quite that, but I can tell these guys are definitely like, they like that game.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
They're inspired.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Okay, good enough for me.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
And it's got a female protagonist, she's really good, and it's a well-written game. I like it a lot.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Anything else for you, Mike?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
I think that's it.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
Mike Emu Week I'll talk about quickly, besides some of the stuff we talked about earlier in the show with the fibbage and so forth,

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
which certainly that was a couple of my nights right there on that.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
But I've been playing some other things as well, including continuing on Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny and Diablo.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
Yes, I'm playing all those games with some frequency.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Not a lot of Destiny, actually. That kind of died down.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'm only level 13 in Destiny. I don't really have anything against it.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's just trying to juggle all this other stuff I want to play, right?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Including the one that's been taking up most of my time this week.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
New on the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Theatrythm. Final Fantasy Theatrythm Curtain Call came out this week, which of course is the music game from Square Enix

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that incorporates all of the different music in the Final Fantasy series.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It is the second Theatrythm game to come out that basically completely eliminates the need to ever have the first game,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
because the second game is just the first game. It's literally everything that was in the first game and more.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And now you can play online against people, and now you've got this quest mode instead of a tower mode,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and a different DLC, and more 14, and side games like Mystic Quest, and Tactics,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and games that you weren't sure if Square was going to bring up again.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So I really enjoy Theatrythm Curtain Call.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Looking back on my original review of Theatrythm, some of the things that I had called the game out for,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
for being a little bit weak on, I think they've improved definitely in some areas.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Especially the song list, with it being so vast, feels a lot stronger.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
There's just so much more that you can kind of get into and play in the song list.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And I love now that you can do the online battles, even if it's maybe not completely in balance.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I still feel like I could play against friends and still have a pretty decent good time with that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I love that there's all these unlockable characters.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
There's a lot of micromanagement type of things in the game, which it can almost be overwhelming.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
These characters have good spirit, and spirit will get you through the field stages,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and you have these stats that can boost spirit, but then you'll lose something in this stat.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
So I can see where min-maxers are going to have a field day, customizing their characters in Theatrythm.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But at its core, the music game itself, I mean, again, there's so many songs in the game

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
that I don't feel the repetition of playing the same stuff over and over.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And in the quest mode, some of these quests are very long,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and I find it a good way to play shuffle songs that maybe I wouldn't think to choose otherwise.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And I did a long quest the other night, 23 stages.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Luckily, I didn't have to do it all in one sitting.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But I mean, if you think about it, at two minutes a song, that's a good, like, hour's worth of gameplay right there.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So, yeah, there you go.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
FOM has the Theatrythm.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If you are a fan of music games or Final Fantasy, you're going to have a lot to like here.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You probably already have it, honestly, if that sounds like it's up your alley or it's on order or something.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So that's where I've been spending most of my week is Theatrythm curtain call.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So, all right.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Let's move on to some quick housekeeping, and then we'll get into the news tonight.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Don't forget, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio and YouTube.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We are also on YouTube, username Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And you can check out previous episodes of our show there because, you know, YouTube is on everything,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
every smartphone, every DS and so forth.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So we like to put our archives up there on YouTube as well.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
There will not be a live show October 19th.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
We will not be here live.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Again, that's October 19th.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I will be in Las Vegas for, speaking of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Fan Fest is going on in Vegas.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I'm going to be there representing O-L-R and VoG, and I really honestly have no idea what to expect.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I'm also going to BlizzCon this year, and I have a pretty good idea what to expect at BlizzCon.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
But Final Fantasy Fan Fest, it might be the most fun I've ever had in my life.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It might be the biggest hot mess I've ever experienced.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I don't know, but we'll find out that weekend in October.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Trying to work it out with Loki and Dark Sakura so we can tape a show in advance that week,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
as we, you know, with that in October and BlizzCon in early November,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
we don't want to have too many weeks where we're not giving you Monday podcast listeners

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and Sunday Night Live listeners something to listen to.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But I do want to warn you, for those of you that make it a point to be here live every Sunday,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
we will not be here live Sunday the 19th.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Alright, let's move into some news.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
We've got a lot of news to get into, so let's get started. Loki.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Alright, so this is kind of neat.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We've been hearing that, more I think on the Microsoft side than anything,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
that they're going to be trying to create some sort of internet TV.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I think that was the kind of thought when they were doing the whole Xbox Entertainment stuff,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
is that they were trying to go that route.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But now, the news is coming out that Sony, apparently the games division,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
is set to launch some sort of internet TV by the end of this year.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And I guess they're saying the Wall Street Journal's basically launching some sort of internet television service,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
which I'm all down for, especially if it's tied into the PlayStation Plus,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
because in that way I don't have to pay for cable or something like that.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And also will work to stream to other mobile devices other than Sony's own, I guess, the Vita.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And I'm assuming any other stuff that's compatible with the remote play stuff.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And that's kind of it. They didn't really say what content's going to be on there,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
if it's going to be just, you know...

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Granted, Sony does have their own television and movie studio.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The thing they talked way too much about at E3.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The...

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Powers?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Yeah.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That's got to be part of this, right?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Yeah, I would imagine that's part of it as well.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But just kind of what else is on there.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Are they doing more seasons of The Tester?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I think that might be done. I think that might be done, finally.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But I don't know. I think that's cool if they're going to be doing some original content and stuff on there.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Check it out.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
To me it seems like about as appealing as even any of the Netflix original shows or something like that.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
If it's that quality, that'd be pretty cool.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And as much as we poke fun at The Tester and all that, it wasn't awful.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
It wasn't as bad as you might think.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I mean, it was clearly low budget, but it was decent enough.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
With all the eSports competitions and things that go on in the world,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000
maybe Sony could put together something kind of neat for not too expensive to put out there that people would really want to watch.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I'd be down with that.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah, it'd be nice if some of these companies...

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The thought is that...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I heard that HBO was thinking of going basically direct to consumer instead of going through cable and stuff.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
They're just going to start selling their content to consumers and just cut out the middleman.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:49.000
So it would be interesting if other stations would do that, although a lot of them are tied with some of these cable companies.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I love this comment in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com from fibbagefunfest,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
who says,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Twenty-four hour network of CAS saying Ridge Racer on an endless loop.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Why not?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I believe you'll probably find that on YouTube already.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:13.000
That would be sandwiched in between the giant enemy crab hour and the $599 US dollar auction site.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I would totally be down for...

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And I know this is absolutely ridiculous, but I'd be totally down for a live action Ridge Racer.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I mean, whatever. They tried it with Knee for Speed.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Why not?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Let's do it again. I don't care if it's terrible.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Because it's all drifting. It's unbelievable drifting.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Because that's all you do in Ridge Racer.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I shouldn't be able to drift around the corner that way, but I just did.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I think there'd be an audience for that.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Especially if you just played really loud Eurobeat during the whole thing.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You know there'd be a lot of people who'd just get high and watch that.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Let's be real. There'd be quite a few people that would do that.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I'm not saying I'm one of them. I'm just saying.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Just make it exciting. It doesn't matter what's on TV.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
As long as you make it exciting, people will watch it.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Alright. Moving on over to the Microsoft side.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
We've heard a lot about this, but we want to acknowledge it here in our news segment.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It is official after we reported on this as a rumor last week.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But officially Mojang was sold to Microsoft this week.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
$2.5 billion.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Mojang going to be joining the internal game studio over at Microsoft.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Not joining them.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Notch, who basically wrote a letter to the industry that I'm really paraphrasing here.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
This has been too much fucking pressure and I'm never going through this again. Peace out.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
That's basically the sentence summary I got from Notch's letter.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's more like he's not going to develop official stuff anymore.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He's going to do the game jams and stuff like that.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
The fun stuff. But he's not going to try to create the next Minecraft.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And he says even anything he creates, if it does end up getting that sort of viral success.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
He's just going to nip it in the butt.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Which I can kind of understand. Put yourself in Notch's shoes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Despite all the questionable things he might have said on Twitter or so forth.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Just put yourself in his shoes.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And think like you're making this little game, this little fun project that you don't think is any big deal.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And then all of a sudden it is the biggest thing in gaming.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Literally the biggest thing in gaming.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And it is on backpacks and blankets.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And you know, Loki and I just bantered a little bit over the whole gaming illuminati and all this other stuff.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And how people act on the internet.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I mean, think about all the pressure he must have had and all the stuff that he went through.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I can see where he probably cracked.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Not everybody is made out to be famous.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's like, fuck it, I got 2.5 billion dollars. I don't need this shit.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You're reminding me on a larger scale of what the guy who did Flappy Bird was complaining about. Remember?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It's too much pressure. It's too big. I don't know what to do.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And Dong Nguyen, I believe he had felt personally responsible for people that became addicted to the game.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
He was hearing stories about people losing their job and he was kind of like, I don't want to be responsible for that.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'm a game developer. I'm not an executive. I'm not a CEO.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I don't know. I don't buy that.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Honestly, if I made a game and people lost jobs over it because they were so addicted to it, first off, I'd be very complimented by that.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And second, I would be like, well, if you're fucking dumb enough to lose your job over this and playing this game, then too bad. You're just dumb.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I mean, you're going to lose your job playing something or doing something. You're just an idiot.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So I wouldn't feel pressure by that.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I could see where you're getting a flack from social media and stuff just over whatever, people sending death threats and crap.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Yeah, I could see how that could get a little bit annoying.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But just saying, oh, well, I feel bad because these people are addicted to the game.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I would not feel any remorse whatsoever for people being addicted to anything I made.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Demix in our chat room says, I'm addicted to Sour Patch Kids, but I don't blame Sugar for it.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
All right. I want to carry over kind of a conversation that I was having on Hoard House on Wednesday because this story came up on Hoard House.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And I was talking about Microsoft paid way too much money for Minecraft.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
They paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And what kind of blew me away about it especially was that they didn't get notched with the deal.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It seems like what's to say they're going to get Lightning to strike twice?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Maybe they could try and do an exclusive Minecraft too, but who knows? It could go over like Farmville too, right?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But Flacco, you responded to the Hoard House episode and I thought what you said was a decent way of thinking.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So did Microsoft pay too much for Mojang?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
No way.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Okay. And why?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
They got a great deal.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Like, look at what they spent like $7 billion on Nokia and then they just laid all those people off this week.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The way I saw it, and I think I stole this probably from someone else I read on the internet, but it was just a commenter so I don't have to credit them.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
That's all right. That's what people on the internet do.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Yeah, I was like, that was a good point.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.000
If somebody offered the guys who made Legos like $2 billion at the peak of their popularity, you look back at them now and say,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
oh, those guys were crazy. Lego's worth way more than that.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And there's like a Minecraft movie coming out.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And like Mike, we just interviewed him.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
What's the first thing you said when you asked what games do you play right now?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I got two kids. I play Minecraft. It's right there. I think that's what Microsoft saw.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I knew you were going to use that as a weapon the minute he said that.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Oh, yeah. As soon as he said it, like, there you go.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Damn it. When I ask Flaco about this later, he's going to use that against me.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Yep. I think Minecraft is a huge thing.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And I actually think he just wanted to get rid of it.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And Microsoft pretty much just bought the IP.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I don't think they care about any of those other games that they're making there.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Because like you said, they're not getting the game creator.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They just want that IP. They want everything that comes with it.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
That movie makes a billion dollars. They're already getting close to making their money back.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I will admit, when I was talking about my stuff on Hoard House, I wasn't considering the merchandising.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Which, you're right. You walk into any hot topic, there's that whole mess of stuff.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And the toy section, Toys R Us, they've got a bunch of stuff there.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
My concern is, and still a little bit.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, you know who else does a lot of merchandising?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Rovio and Angry Birds.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
But I think they've been around longer than that now, right?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And they're making a movie with that, too. But is it as popular as it used to be? No.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Is this the point where Minecraft peaks and jumps the shark?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Is Minecraft going to continue to grow, or will the audience that made Minecraft big break it?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Isn't that kind of a concern, too?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I realize the audience has grown bigger than that. Now kids are into it, however.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But how long until the next big thing?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Yeah, I don't know. At least with this, it's not like the Wii, where once everybody grew out of the Wii,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
they're not going to obviously buy a thing that's that old.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000
But with Minecraft, it's already timeless, because it uses such low-res graphics to get everything going.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It's not like people got into it because it was the next great-looking thing.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So I think it could just really last forever. I think it's just got something that's going to go on.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
But yeah, you never know. It could die out, but anything that you consider a fad.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I just don't think Minecraft's a fad.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And this is going to result in, I've never played Minecraft. I'm just looking.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
What?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I've never played. I'm an outsider looking in, and I'm just looking at how this thing goes, and it's just taken over.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Like, this whole acid of culture.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Hold on, hold on. But why not?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I don't know. It's just not a feel to me.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
You say that now.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I like Legos. I say that now, but see, I have kids.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Here's the thing.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
My kids are two and four, and I have a feeling when they get into that age, and my wife is a teacher.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
She's a second-grade teacher. Her kids talk about Minecraft, and she sees it go through the school like crazy.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Once my kids are older, I'm going to be in that game.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I was there at one point. I was like, I don't get it. I don't get this game at all.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I played it on 360. This is pretty fun.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I played it on PC. I'm like, crap. I can't play the 360 version anymore because I've played it on PC, and I'm so spoiled with everything that's on here.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So, yeah. Just try it.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
For me, it was just like, I don't think I have the time to invest in.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I'm looking at videos of what people can build in Minecraft.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Like, how these large cities, full-scale enterprise replicas, all this crazy stuff they can do.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
There's ways you can speed things up, especially on PC.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
For me, personally, I just didn't think about putting that investment in, and I just probably never got into it.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
It just seemed like a huge undertaking.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I just want to make clear that I'm not one of those people that's like,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
just because Microsoft bought Minecraft means it will turn to total shit.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I'm actually not one of those people.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I have concerns. Will Minecraft still be as heavily moddable?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Especially when we talk Minecraft 2.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I'm not so much what's currently there, but you know Microsoft's going to make a Minecraft 2.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Come on. That will be a thing that will happen absolutely.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Has to happen.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Will it still be as moddable?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Will it still have a lot of the stuff that people are charmed with with the original Minecraft?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Or is it going to be really just targeted as a kids game?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But, all that being said, I'm not really bothered by the fact that a big company owns a cute little gaming franchise,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
because Nintendo owns Pokemon, and I don't know anybody that has a problem with that.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah, and Pokemon's still popular with kids. It's not gone away yet. It's not a fad.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
If Microsoft wants their own Pokemon, which is kind of what this is-ish,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000
they might not be the same game, but in a way, hasn't Microsoft really needed that killer franchise?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I mean, they have Halo, but they don't have anything for kids, right?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
They tried Viva Pinata.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I was like, Viva Pinata? No.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
They tried, well now they have Minecraft.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Connectimals?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Now they have Minecraft.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So to that extent, buying what Viva Pinata couldn't do, I can see that.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Where now, okay, maybe it was worth 2.5 billion.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Yeah, but I still think that's kind of small-scale stuff.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I think it's the overall franchise that's the big picture of just keeping that going, that brand.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I don't know. We'll see. We'll see how the movie does, and we'll see if-

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I don't know. I think if Microsoft makes a Minecraft too soon, it could leech from that other audience, and it could dilute it. I don't know.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
That's true.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I feel like you just got to let Minecraft do its thing.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Where is that sweet spot to make a Minecraft too, you know?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Yeah, I don't know. What would you do? Would you make better graphics? That's not what sold Minecraft.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Like I said, it's because it's- I don't know. It's its own thing.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It's like Lego blocks in your computer, and I don't know what you could change to make it better, but I don't know.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Maybe people who played it would know that.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Maybe more of the game elements itself, such as the monsters that you fight, and that part of it maybe can be expanded on, and how you go into other worlds.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I don't know. Don't take my words for it. I hope that Microsoft has tapped in enough to the Minecraft community to hear about what they want.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
What have they been begging Notch to do for forever? Loki, do you know more about that? What have people been begging Notch to do?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
You're more tapped into Minecraft than either of us.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Uh, fuck. I don't know. They're just adding a ton of stuff to it, but now I think the big thing is that the bucket support's discontinued, so that's a little disappointing, because that was a big modding thing.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's like, yeah, we want to do a lot more with Minecraft, and so use bucket to do all that stuff.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Whether it be just utility things like World Guard and stuff so people can't fuck up parts of your world, or doing the different scripting things and stuff to where you can have a mob arena, which is pretty awesome.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Or, you know, I want to have MP3s playing in my background, or I want to have guns in the game, or not necessarily guns, but cool projectile weapons, or I want to have magic spells, or whatever.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I think people are a little disappointed with that. Now, they're saying that Mojang is supposed to be carrying that on still.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And I guess they're supposed to have official mod support at some point, so once that happens, then maybe we won't need all this bucket stuff, and it'll just be kind of lumped in there and it'll work, hopefully.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I hope that includes also skin mods and stuff, not necessarily changing the skins because you can do that pretty easy, but adding new blocks and adding new things, like they have in Forge right now where you can add cars or planes and stuff.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It's not actually composed of stuff in the game, it's brand new geometry. I can take a picture or something like that.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Botakawa in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:32.000
The issue why we are saying Minecraft 2 is because we know that Microsoft wants to make a profit off this, and unless they sell a new game or more merchandise, what else could they do? I'd be afraid they are going to sell expansions or just large patches.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Don't underestimate the merchandising side of that, though. Again, walk into any hot topic, there's like a whole wall dedicated to Minecraft, you know, and that's just one store, but I do see your point.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Anyway, we could spend three hours hypothesizing about the future of Minecraft, but I want to keep things moving, so let's change gears a little bit here. Flaco, what do you have for us?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I have a Final Fantasy XV story. So Square announced that Tetsuya Nomura is going to be stepping away from Final Fantasy XV.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000
He'll be focusing on other projects, Type 0 and before Crysis Final Fantasy...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Type 0, that's the one he's going to be working on, right?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:28.000
The quote here is he's going to shift efforts to a production of titles that can only be made possible by Nomura himself, including the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:38.000
So that's what I'm excited about, because I'm more of a Kingdom Hearts fan now than Final Fantasy. I was a big Final Fantasy fan back in the day, but I haven't played a Final Fantasy game, a new one in a while, other than the MMO ones.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:50.000
So yeah, and then they also announced at the same time they're going to have a demo coming out for XV when Final Fantasy Type 0 HD comes out on the PS4 and the Xbox One.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And then there was a further update that it's going to be on the PS4 on March 20th. So it's not just going to be bundled in with the game, it sounds like it's also going to be on the store.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Of course I thought it was just going to be with the game.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000
That news makes me more excited than anything, because finally, what, nine years after they announced this game, you're like, a demo? It's happening!

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Yeah, that's a good sign, it's going to happen.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Finally! So that part's exciting. I mean, the part about Nomura leaving, that's not... I mean, I wondered how he was going to juggle both games with Kingdom Hearts 3 being a thing.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So that part I'm not so surprised with. But yeah, the fact that a demo will happen next year, they've pretty much confirmed that's happening, that's exciting.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah, and I wasn't super excited for XV until I started to see more stuff come out that looked like it was a lot more Kingdom Hearts-style play.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And that's something I think I'm more on now than the old-school RPG play. Like I said, I didn't really play XIII, I didn't play even XII.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So it's been a long time since I've gotten into Final Fantasy, so I'm excited to try the demo and see if it plays kind of like a Kingdom Hearts game.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Something not on the show world tonight, but about Final Fantasy XIII and stuff, is that they did announce the PC version of Final Fantasy XIII, XIII-2, and Lightning Returns. They're going to port all those to PC.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That is a thing they're doing. I don't know if that might be a bundle to end, or are they all separate games?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
They're going to be separate, but Final Fantasy XIII is the first one, and that's out in early October.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Steam sale.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Yeah, I know. Well, Square apparently really buffed up their Steam, because Final Fantasy IV, which I didn't talk about in my gaming week because I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But Final Fantasy IV, the DS version that was then ported to iOS and Android has now been ported to PC, and so that has been released on Steam.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Square, Final Fantasy VI, please.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Right? Well, here's the thing. The Final Fantasy VI that's on iPad and all that, they kind of outsource some of the graphical development.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
No, I want the one that was on PSP.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah, or I wouldn't mind the whole 3D remake, but I just don't see them doing any more of those.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And the problem is Final Fantasy V.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And I'm not saying Final Fantasy V is bad, but because of that weird place where Final Fantasy V kind of is, especially with US history, they would have to do that before they go to VI.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I don't think they have to, but I think there's this feeling they would need to.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I think they should just go straight to VI and make the 3D port of that, but maybe that ship sailed. I don't know.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I mean, you know, these were DS ports and now we're on new 3DS coming soon, so there you go.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Fifth Dream wants to point out in her chatroom at live.vognetware.com, Final Fantasy XIII is already on sale on Steam. It's 10% off if you pre-order. That's a good point.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And it wasn't, like, it's not like it was a $60 game. I think they were only going for what? Was it, like, $19.99 maybe?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Somebody has to look up that price and let me know real quick.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.000
But that is one perk about XIII on Steam is that because they know the game is so old, like, they're not going to charge $60 for it, so that's pretty good.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So, alright. Let's move on to release dates. We're going to travel the world and check out what games you can get right now.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You might have to wait a couple weeks for XIII on Steam and a few months for XV, but what can you get right now this week?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:23.000
You can get Disney Infinity 2.0, Marvel Super Heroes. They have the starter packs for Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:36.000
As well as all the, they have the collector's editions on the Playstation platforms and all the figures and shit you can get for, what is it, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers and Spider-Man.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
So, a ton of stuff, especially if you're a fan of Marvel.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:48.000
EA's got FIFA 15 coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:58.000
They're also doing the Legacy editions, which basically is taking, like, I think at this point FIFA 12 or something and updating the roster and just popping it back out, you know.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Selling it for the 3DS, the Wii, and the P, the Vita, I believe.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Also this week, if you want to buy the physical version of Killer Instinct, the combo breaker pack, they have that coming out on Xbox One.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And it gives you a bonus character for Season 2 as well.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And let's see here, R No Surge, Ode to an Unborn Star, coming out on Playstation 3.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And Arkana Heart 3 Love Max on Playstation 3 and Vita.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And let's see here, finally Hyrule Warriors on Wii U. That's it.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Excited about that one, definitely.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Looks pretty cool.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
An interesting case for Nintendo, where Europe got it first. Europe got it this weekend.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:56.000
We have to wait. That usually doesn't happen with Nintendo, so Nintendo finally giving the folks overseas a break there with the release dates, so that's interesting.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
They've gotten plenty of breaks from Nintendo. They got the last story and they got a...

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
That's true. I guess I can't feel too bad for them.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Yeah, they don't have to go to GameStop to buy that one.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Exactly.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Just a couple comments from our chat room. Dungeon Buster clarifying the price of Final Fantasy 13. It is $15.99, but for right now it is $14.39.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Oh, that's not bad.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
For Final Fantasy 13 on Steam. Yeah, that's really not that bad.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
What?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah. And DJ Rama S says there's no reason to charge $60 for Final Fantasy 13. Squeenix already made their money off it.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And Bochikawa says $16? No, really, that's worth it. If you've never played it, get it.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Let's see, also...

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Haven't finished it. I mean, does that count?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What games are on PC still? Is it just 6, 9, and...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
5, 6, 9, 10, 12.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
10 and 12.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
So, we're getting there. Actually, 1 and 2, I don't believe, ever have an official PC release.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Oh, could have sworn they were on there too.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
No, I don't think so. I could be wrong.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
No, you're probably right.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
They were iOS.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I keep thinking about those ones, but yeah.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Those are the ports of the PSP games.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Yeah.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:07.000
So, anyway, let's see. Also, I know you don't usually cover digital distribution in your release dates, Loki, but folks in our chatroom are talking about Gauntlet, the remake reimagining or whatever of Gauntlet's out this week.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
So, as a fan of Diablo, that's up my alley, I think.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It's not Gauntlet. It's not like Legacy or Legends or whatever.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Not Legacy. Yeah, Legacy was crap. No, Gauntlet Legends or was it the...

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
What was the other one? Dark something? I don't remember what it was called.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Dark Legacy, right?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Dark Legacy.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Anyway, going to Japan and checking out some of the release dates over there.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
While I horribly mispronounce some of their release dates, they have a few things on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You then Setsu Sen no Kisuke 2 in a regular and limited CD bundle set.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And then Kamisama to Unmei Kasuke, or sorry, Kakusei no Cross Thesis.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And Tears to Tiara 2, Hao no Matsue comes out this week on PlayStation 3.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I have no idea what any of those games are.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Tears to Tiara 2 is coming out here next month, actually.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You play a princess and...

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Yay!

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yes.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It's Heir to the... I forget what the subtitle is.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Heir to something, Heir to the King or I don't remember what it was called.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
The Wii U has a game out this week on the 27th called Zero.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Norigarasu no Miku comes out this week.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
This is not... Oh, this is Fatal Frame is what this is over in Japan.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
That's right, this is the Wii U Fatal Frame that's coming out over there.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I thought Japan had Bayonetta 2 this week, and I don't see it on my list here.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Maybe that was this past week and I just missed the boat on that.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
But I know Bayonetta 2 is very, very soon in Japan.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And lastly, PlayStation Vita. There's a whole lot of crap on the Vita this week in Japan.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Bakumatsu Rock Ultra Soul, Dungeon Travelers 2, Farming Simulator 14,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Monobeno Pier Smile, and Zetai Zetsubo Shouju Danganronpa, another episode comes out.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I believe that's Danganronpa 2, maybe. No, no, they wouldn't be getting that after us.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
That must be the third one then.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And quickly, the 3DS release is Tenkai Nights Brave Battle.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Haiku Tsunage Iidadake no Kishike in regular and limited edition.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And lastly, oh boy, this is Kukei Zaidan Hojin Nippon Kanji Norioku Kentei Kayokai Kanken Training.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I'm thinking this is a learn kanji game, is what it looks like from the screenshots.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Because you can actually draw and all that good stuff.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
So, there you go.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Flaco, I know Dark Soccer usually does the UK dates, but maybe you can help us out?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Sure, we have Gauntlet, I believe it's the Gauntlet reboot on PC, September 23.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Let's see, Stronghold Crusader 2 on PC, I don't know what that is.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Anna, the extended edition on Xbox 360, sounds exciting.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
FIFA 15 on everything on September 25th.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Vita, 3DS, Wii, even the Wii. PlayStation 4.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And that's like a Madden game coming out here.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
So, it's kind of a big deal over there.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Xbox One, 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And then The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, another PC game.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And also on PS4.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And then, let's see, there's one other game on September 26, Fantasy Life on the 3DS.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And then the classic game of the week, which I'll give you a little hint to think about this.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
In honor of the guests that we had tonight.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
No, I didn't pick any of their games, although I was tempted.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
But I decided to pick another one of my favorite.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I don't even know if you can call it a game show, but a game-esque.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
We'll leave it at that, a game-esque sort of thing.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I know, a video game that's a game, go figure.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
But you'll know what I mean when we get there, it feels like a game show when you play it.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
So just a couple more news stories and I'll tell you what it is. Loki.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Alright, so this is pretty cool.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000
PlayStation now joins Microsoft and Nintendo, or I should say Sony, I guess, joins them.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And basically giving out Unity Pro for free to any developers of the PlayStation platform.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So, if you're a licensed PlayStation developer, you can get Unity for free.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.000
It normally costs $1500 to get the Pro version, or $75 per month if you go that route.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And that's pretty awesome, because yeah, originally Microsoft made that offer as well.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
If you're going to do the ID at Xbox stuff, you get Unity Pro.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And then Nintendo also offering the same thing.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So, that's awesome if you've got a track record of releasing games and stuff,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and you happen to be an official licensed developer, save some cash there.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Because if you're an indie, you're going to need all the cash you can get.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And then of course, came out during their, was it the Oculus VR?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
They had some sort of Oculus Connect event.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And it came out that Unity 5 is going to have a target platform, which will be the Oculus Rift.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And you'll be able to build for that, which is pretty awesome.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And that, unlike it is now, will be available in Unity free as well, instead of just Unity Pro as it is right now.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, looking forward to that too, whenever 5 comes out, because 5 is going to be amazing.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Will you be porting your project to the Oculus?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I don't think it really fits for the Oculus.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I could just do 3D, but other than that, it wouldn't really benefit from it.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Alright. I think Oculus will really be here in our little hands as a consumer device next year.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
They said, by the summer.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
That's exciting, if that happens.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
It's going to be expensive though.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It will be expensive, but it's going to have the Morpheus potentially next holiday.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
But here's my problem.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It's going to be a very interesting VR year.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I like the idea of the Oculus Rift.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I like the idea of the Morpheus a little bit better, only because, and not because...

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Well, the only reason I like the Morpheus a little bit better is it's plug and play.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Having played neither.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Having played neither. No.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
This doesn't have anything to do with the capabilities of the system.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I'm talking about the fact that it has that separate box that does all the processing.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
So, for example, if I bought the Oculus Rift for my laptop, that thing would run like shit.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Because my laptop is not powerful enough to be able to run that.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000
See, if they had some sort of external box that did the extra processing and worked that out,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
if it was just plug and play like a mouse or something, that would be fantastic.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Knowing that there's that baseline that Morpheus is going to have, that it's all going to be the same,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I totally get that allure there.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Although, I do understand Oculus has their, like we talked about that headset last week or the week before,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
where there's going to be certain standards as well.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I can see what you're talking about with that, where it's like you know it has the processing power it needs.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
That's the only thing I think is going to be the biggest hurdle with getting that mainstream,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
is just that your average mom and pop are thinking about,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
oh, that's kind of cool, like say they develop something for social media or browsing the internet or some shit like that,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
you know, that really catches on.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
You're going to need a pretty powerful PC to be able to utilize that.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And a lot of these people just have a fucking basic ass computer or whatever to just browse the internet.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And so it's just, I know it's not necessarily for everyone, but I kind of wish it was a little bit easier to utilize.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Well, maybe this last story here will have the processing power needed to play all this stuff on VR.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And it's something that Square Enix announced this week, you know, Tokyo Game Show, they had a lot of announces this week.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And they're going to be rolling out a cloud-based gaming service, and it's called Shinra Technologies.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Yes. After that, Final Fantasy VII, which is interesting, a way to go with it.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Wasn't Shinra the bad guys in Final Fantasy VII?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Yes, they were the company harnessing the power of, was it the Mako?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Like, what was the company in Terminator? Would you really want to call your company that?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Skynet.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Skynet. Would you really want to call your company Skynet? But all right, whatever.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So they're going to have Shinra Technologies. It's going to be helmed by Yoshi Wada, who used to be president.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And it's an evolution of what we were seeing was Project Flare.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And it's going to be a separate subsidiary. And it will be doing cloud gaming with a virtual supercomputer.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:37.000
The tech will be pooling hundreds or thousands of CPUs and GPUs in a data center to boost processing power and deliver higher quality games.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
It's like one super-powered game console.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And they give an example here, Director of Partnerships Colin Williamson saying,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
So let's say you're fighting in a city block doing all this damage.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
In a traditional game, if you drive a few blocks in the other direction and come back, everything is magically reset.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Shinra Technology allows the worlds to change dynamically and have permanence.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It also takes the burden off the developers to figure out tricks and workarounds to give the illusion of a persistent world.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Our worlds can truly have history.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:16.000
You know, I remember Square talking about something like this before with the whole, and maybe it was that Project Flare thing, but it's interesting to see this continue.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So I'm wondering, it doesn't sound like they're trying to put out a service, like they're not trying to compete with PlayStation Now or something like that.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It sounds like they're developing this for their own games.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:42.000
It just sounds a lot like Microsoft's Azure servers, where they're doing that same shit with Crackdown and stuff, where you can dynamically destroy buildings and stuff like that, and they don't have to worry about calculating everything in-game because it does it on the server side.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It just sounds like that's kind of what they're doing. They already have things that can do that already. I don't know. Whatever. It'd be interesting to see what they do with it.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:05.000
No date for when the service will be launching, but beta tests for the US and Japan expect it to start early 2015, so this could be another thing that we're going to see for the holidays. Who knows?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Alright, well, let's go back to a time when gaming was a little simpler.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:19.000
You didn't have cloud computing, you didn't have headsets and VR. Well, I guess maybe you sorted it. You had the Virtual Boy.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
But this is even before that. We're going to do the classic game of the week. Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura...

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Technically, they did have a headset for the Vectrex.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:41.000
That's true. Alright, shut up. Alright. Every week, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking this out. Forget all this new stuff. Worship this classic.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And since she's not here tonight, I'm here to pick the classic game of the week, and I'm going to break her streak of the CPS2 game she's been doing.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000
This is because you wouldn't pick Quiz N' Dragons, which, by the way, she told me in an email, well, that was a CPS1 game.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So, you know what? DarkSakura, if you're out there listening, I just broke your streak.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
But with good reason, because, you know what? Darn it. This game here is a true classic. It's from the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And let's see if anybody can recognize it from the music. I already told you it's a Game Show-esque type of game. Here it is.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.000
That's right. The classic game of the week this week is Anticipation. Anticipation for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:35.000
That's right. The board game that you could play as a trumpet, a teddy bear, an ice cream cone, or a pair of high heels.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Guess which one I always picked. The ice cream cone. What were you thinking?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Uh, because I like ice cream. So there it is. Anticipation is the classic game of the week.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And, yes, again, it was a rare game for the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Released in the North America in November of 1988, Europe got a release October 25th, 1989. I don't believe it was ever released in Japan.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:12.000
You might know this game from the epic box art of all these affluent white people having fun is what the box art is.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
It's just like, oh, we just, you know, we... White people having fun.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Yeah, exactly. We took a little trip to the countryside and, you know, found some sweaters and pillows and got these people having fun.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So, okay, if you don't know what Anticipation is, it's basically a board game. It's a board game slash Pictionary type game.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.000
So you pick a piece in the game. Like I said, the shoes, the horn, the ice cream cone, or the teddy bear.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And as you go around the board and land on a square, the game, not another user, because, remember, the NES controller could only do so much.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So the computer would slowly draw a picture on the screen.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And as the picture's being drawn on the screen, the dice would count down from six to five to four to three, two to one.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So if you wanted to get a high roll, or if you're thinking the strategery behind the game, which is what color do I need to finish up all the colors for level,

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
then you have to buzz in at a certain time and hope nobody beats you to it.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.000
So, yeah, you buzz in when you know the answer, and then you put in your guess for what is being drawn on the screen at that moment.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So, which, in the YouTube, we just saw a fishing hook being drawn, and the little high heels won a yellow piece for guessing that it was a...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That totally looks like Trivial Pursuit.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
As I say, this is Trivial Pursuit meets Connect the Dots with E.B. Herman.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
It sort of is. It's like Trivial Pursuit slash... And look, I already know this one. This is Sausage that's being drawn right there.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I have played so much of this game, I just...

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
That would not have been my guess.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It's Sausage. Look, I know this is horrible radio, but just trust me, y'all, it was drawn to Sausage.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
They were totally not drawing a penis.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It does look a little bit like a penis. But anyway, in the earlier levels there's dots on the screen to help you know what it is.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
But in the later levels... Oh, there's no dots. There's no dots.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And later levels on the board will start to mess with you too, like you get to gray squares that are feature squares,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
where if you land on them a little bit of disco music plays while your piece flies around the board and you have to hit the button to land on a particular spot.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And then on the fourth level, there are gaps present where spaces have been removed,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and if you land on one of the pitfall spaces, you fall to the third level and have to finish out your colors again.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
To ascend to the fourth level. So as you can imagine, this game took a little time to play.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:41.000
But remember, the dice count down. So if you know how many spaces you are away from the hole, you just know not to buzz in on that number, right?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So that's how it works. So yeah, then once you fill up all the colors on the fourth level, then you win! Congratulations!

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
So there it is. I don't know if there's a lot else I could say about this game, because...

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I think you said it all.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I think I literally said it all. And that's a race car being drawn right now, I guess. See the big wheels with the dots? There it is.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:13.000
It's hard entering those words in with like 20 seconds to go back and forth on the letters, and you can only make one mistake.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
That's true.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
If you make your second mistake, it's like, you lose.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Does it let you screw up with the spelling?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I can't remember.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
One time, it will.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It'll let you screw up one time.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It'll let you do one mistake, yeah.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Oh my gosh.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So if you get one of those really hard to guess words...

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Yeah, or if you get a really long one, or one of those multiple words, it's tough to type all that in, just like you said.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
An NES controller on an alphabet that goes from the back. Luckily, it'll let you go back the other way, of course.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
A helicopter?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I believe that is a helicopter.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
That is a helicopter.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
See, Loki? You would've been a pro at this.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Did you ever play this, Loki?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
No.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Flanko, did you play this at all?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Yes, I did play this game.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Alright, at least I'm not the only one.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I love these kind of games.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I never owned it, but I read about it in Nintendo Power, and I was like, that sounds so cool.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Because that's what I sounded like as a kid.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It's so cool.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And so we rented it.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I got a bunch of hand-me-down games for my uncle, so I just got the most random games.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I just thought it was a little Trojan.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I had so many weird games.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Anticipation for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Good party fun. Party game.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Just like we had Fibbage earlier in the show.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Like a modern party game, so there you go.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
There is a part of me, though, that wishes they'd bring back Anticipation in some form or another.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I mean, think about it. You could draw on your smartphone now.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
You could do like a Pictionary thing.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Hey, the sketch game on...

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Oh, yeah, the Wario. The game in Wario.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Game in Wario, yeah.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
That sketch game is super fun.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Describe this real quick for the listeners, because you made me play this.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It's pretty much Pictionary, but what it is, everybody kind of takes their picture with the gamepad,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
you know, that's your icon to show your face,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
and then everybody takes a turn being the person who draws while everybody else guesses,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
and when somebody gets the correct guess, the person drawing clicks on their picture on the tablet

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
and gives them a point, and then it moves on to the next one.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And it's pretty much just Pictionary, but it works really well. It's super fun.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's weird what they choose for you to draw sometimes.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I can't think of anything at the top of my head, but some of them were so obscure.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Some of them were really like complicated, yeah.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
It's like, oh, here, draw a bucket, and now draw, I don't know, something with like a color.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Draw Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Yeah, something ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised, but something ridiculous, and it's like, wait a second.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It's like super long. It's like a big hard concept to get, so.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
But no, it's really fun.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
All right, so clearly Anticipation influenced all this stuff.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Of course, it influenced everything. It influenced You Don't Know Jack, it influenced Minecraft.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I should have asked Mike about that. How much were you influenced by Anticipation?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Because I know this show wouldn't exist without it. All right.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Anyhow, all right, we're going to take a break.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Demixton Chance's Platypus. I think that was one of them.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Platypus? Probably. All right, anyway.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I have a lot of stuff in there. I was actually impressed.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
All right, we're going to take a break, guys.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we've got some rapid fire news.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
The Fugal Question of the Week, we're going to talk about violent video games for ice cream.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
We talked about ice cream and Anticipation, and now this campaign that Anticipation has inspired

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
for trading in violent video games for ice cream.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
They better give me a lot of ice cream for that violent video game.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:14.000
The FUs of the Week and your calls at 1-877-GAMELR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday night, September the 21st of 2014

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000
with the 568th episode of our show already in progress.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And if you're just joining us, well, you've missed a lot.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I don't know what else to tell you. You have missed way too much.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
You're going to have to go back and listen on our podcast feed.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
It's a good thing that you can find this show on our podcast feed on Stitcher Radio, TuneIn Radio,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
whatever podcast app you use. You can find that early Monday morning

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
and always catch up with any part of the show you miss.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000
But tonight, obviously we had an interview with Jackbox Games on the program

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.000
talking about their new release, Fibbage, as well as talking about You Don't Know Jack.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And basically we got it confirmed that a 2015 version is coming, which is awesome.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And not only that, you missed Loki ranting on a topic you were wondering when he was going to rant about

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
in part A on the show. We got that tonight.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And most importantly, Anticipation.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
That's nothing. That's seriously nothing.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I may have to make a video at some point.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Alright. And the game that has influenced all games since, Anticipation, is our classic game of the week.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
We talked about that as well.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
But we have plenty more show to come and of course your calls a little later on in the program.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Maybe your emails, although I didn't see any when I went in there earlier, so we might not have that tonight.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And rapid fire news. Quickly though, you know, if there's one thing we talk about that's different than video games and gaming,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
one thing that we always talk about here on the program is food.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And Alan reminded me before we went live tonight that I had to talk about this restaurant that we went to on Friday night.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
So, did you guys know that out in, and Flaco, I'm looking at you because I know you're a big fan of this stuff,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
out in Roseville, they have a Brazilian grill place now.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I wanted to know what you guys thought of that.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It was, and I'll tell you this, it was not bad at all. I was very impressed.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
That's awesome. They had one on, I would like, I want to say it's Madison.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah, that one that used to be over on Madison.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It was there for like a month, I swear. It was not there for long, and it was okay.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
This place really felt like a rip-off of Aspertoons.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Okay, if you don't know what we're talking about, because obviously we're talking about local restaurants, Brazilian grill, right?

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000
That's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the sword, and then they're going to slice off something, like they ask,

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
or you have the little dial.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
You have like a stop sign or a dial, whatever.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
In this particular case, it's a coaster that you have on, like green is bring me more meat, and red is stop bringing me meat.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But then they bring something over to your table, like, do you want this, do you want this?

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
And so they've had-

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
The answer is always yes.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The answer is always yes, and they pretty much had everything that Aspertoons had.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
The one thing, though, and I know this will disappoint you guys, they did not have chicken hearts.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Yay!

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Actually, I don't like chicken hearts, but my wife loves them, and I always get them for me, and then I push them onto her place.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I don't like that stuff either, but I'll tell you what, that was some of the best top sirloin I have ever had.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Oh, man.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Was there. It was so good.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And then they have like the garlic steaks and the chicken wrapped in bacon and all this.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Sorry if I'm making you hungry, but oh my god, it was so good.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I have to try that place. It sounds awesome.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And then they had the full salad thing with like-

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I like that, too, even though it ends up kind of ripping you off, because you're like, oh, but it's so good.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You got to fill up on these little things, and you're like, oh, now I have less room for meat.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I just like to think there needs to be some kind of balance in there, though, right?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It also just sits like a brick in your stomach.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
That's what I always feel.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
So I grab a little bit of everything from the salad bar, not everything, but stuff that I know I'd like, and then I definitely get all the meats just rolling in.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And then they have the fried banana, which I never knew this until our waitress said it.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
The reason why they bring you fried banana is because it resets your palate.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Oh, okay.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And she says, we want you to experience all the different meat flavors that we have.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I'm like, I am here to experience them.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So that will not be a problem.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
So, yeah, so they have that, and then the little cheese bread.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000
But this place, for some reason, brings you mashed potatoes, too, which, you know, what else goes great with steak?

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Mashed potatoes, right?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Oh, that'll really fill you up.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
See, they're trying to make their money back.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Because then this place was, what, I think it's, what, 45 bucks a plate?

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Is it, as I was saying, what is it price-wise?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Okay, so that's about the same as Aspetues. 45, 50 bucks, I think, is what Aspetues is now.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
But talk to me off air, because I might have gotten a little thingy for 15% off.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Oh, yeah, more meat.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
More meat.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I got to try this place out.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000
So, anyhow, all right, sorry for the food deviation, but I knew Flaco would have to know about the Brazilian Grill trip.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
And, Loki, I'm sure you've got to be one to go to this.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Yeah, we drove past it while they were building it, because we wanted to go there one time, but it wasn't open yet, so.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And I forgot the name. You guys are asking me what it's called, and I forgot the name.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It was like Fire and Flames or something like that. Flames and Fire, something like that.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:59.000
It didn't have a fancy sounding name like Aspetues in San Francisco, which, you know, they don't pay me to talk about how freaking great that food is.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
It's so good. It's so expensive.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
It's expensive.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
That's how they get you.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
That's a celebration dinner place.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Yeah.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000
All right. Anyhow, Alan Alchemy's in chat. He woke up to talk about this.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:18.000
He says that, Alan said, there were some things that weren't great. The filet mignon and the plain pork roast was mad, but the top sirloin and bacon-wrapped chicken and the pork sausage.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Oh, my God.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And Alan says, flame and fire.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture, saying it would not be OLR without food-related sidetracks.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Absolutely.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Food is what gives me the fuel to play video games all night long.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Speaking of Brad from Pod Culture, stay tuned to what they're doing over there.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And Pod Culture, also on the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, Monday night.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
He was just at a convention this weekend.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
And you won't believe the interviews these guys get at conventions.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
They talk to everybody.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
They talk to everybody at these conventions.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And all I'm going to say is, if you're a Doctor Who fan, you might want to go check out Pod Culture's feed, like ASAP.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
That's all I'm telling you guys.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Check them out on Monday here at VOG Network.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
All right. We got to get back into video games.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
We are having a long show tonight, but with good reason.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
There's lots to talk about.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
But we do have some rapid-fire news coming at you.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Loki.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
All right. So this is pretty exciting, although I don't think my phone's going to be able to run it.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
But Goat Simulator is now out on iOS and Android.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Five bucks.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
And you can play the game.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
It has all the bugs they say from the PC version.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Your phone won't run it? What, Loki?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
You mean you weren't out there getting an iPhone 6 on Friday? The 6 Plus?

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
No, I don't.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Because, see, I've got this nice plan through T-Mobile where I don't have to pay.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
It's basically not on any sort of yearly contract thing.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And it's cheap because I can't afford more expensive phone plans.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
And you don't get service anywhere on T-Mobile.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I don't get service anywhere.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
That's okay because I don't have a lot of minutes.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So it's all right.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
But I get unlimited data.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And that's why I use more anyways.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
So who gives a shit about, you know, fucking, you know, phone minutes.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Anyways.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
But yeah. So I don't have a very...

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
It's just a Galaxy 2. So it's, you know, slow.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
But yeah. So you can check it out.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And of course, you know, the Xbox One version will be coming out later on.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
But it doesn't look bad actually.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
It just looks a little bit, you know, mobilized.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
But pretty cool.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
And then this is kind of neat.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Borderlands Online is coming back to the original game.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I remember it originally had GameSpy as its online provider.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
But now they've converted that over to Steamworks.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So patched.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And now you can play multiplayer online as well.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So that's pretty sweet.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I like how they did that when Destiny is the big thing right now.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Like, hey, come back to Borderlands.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Because we just patched it so you can do that again.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I don't know if that was intentional.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000
They also have that pre-sequel coming out.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Yeah. I think it's just, you know, just fixing a problem that they had, you know,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
with the GameSpy networks and stuff.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And last but not least, Harmonix has announced that they are closing their submissions for Rock Band Network.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
So basically, effective immediately.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
They are no longer allowing people to submit songs to the Rock Band Network.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Now, this doesn't mean that it's going away.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Apparently, though, that they are going to be, I think, still allowing you to check out those downloads.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I'd be curious, though, you know, they've kind of hinted that Rock Band will come back in some form at some point.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Like, there's been the polls and things like that.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
So I wonder how this might transfer over to that.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Or if it will. I mean, who knows?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I would think robust DLC is going to be a big part of Rock Band's future should it have one.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Yeah, I mean, I think it was kind of cool that this kind of carried on even beyond the fact that,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
or beyond, I guess, when they were offering the official DLC stuff.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And there was a lot of stuff in there that was, like, different genres that you couldn't even find elsewhere.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
And, God, I kind of wish I had checked out more of the tracks.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I mean, they had 2,000 tracks in there.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
So that's ridiculous.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Good times.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
All right, well, one game we talked about a lot last week because of the demo.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
And some of you guys, I'm sure, are really getting into this.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
This week, with the open to all demo having been released on Friday,

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Smash Bros. That's right, Smash Bros. for 3DS came out in Japan over this past week.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I'm sure you guys have seen people on Twitch playing this.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And you're seeing all the spoilers about what characters are unlocked in this.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And there's a lot of people playing Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
One million sold in Japan in the first two days.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
One million. That includes digital and physical sales.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Of course, as we all know, Nintendo absolutely ruined and going bankrupt as a company.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
That was said with tongue in cheek.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
One million copies of Smash Bros. for 3DS sold.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Good on them. Good on them.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Some people, though, missing ice climbers from the game.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Spoiler alert. Ice climbers are not in it.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
There is no ice climbers to be found in the game,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
although a lot of the other characters did come back.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Ice climbers did not.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Masahiro Sakurai explained in Famitsu why the ice climbers didn't come out.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And they were running on the Wii U version of the game,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
but due to technical limitations, probably with that 3DS version,

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
they were cut from both versions.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
And he said, you know, ice climbers as a franchise, it's just not really a thing.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I mean, this is a years old game. Nintendo has not revisited this franchise.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
It's probably not coming back.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:44.000
The delay between the two versions of Smash Bros. on the Wii U and the 3DS, though,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
was simply due to debugging, not because of character changes or anything like that.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Of course, I love that ice climber is so old, you know,

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
and people don't really think about it anymore,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
yet we're getting Duck Hunt Dog in the new Smash Bros.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
You know?

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Now, to be fair, though, I love that as a character.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Who has not wanted to shoot that fucking dog at some point in their life?

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Everybody remembers. Like, if you played Duck Hunt when you were a kid,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I know we have listeners of all ages, but we're all in this room around the same age.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
You played Duck Hunt as a kid, Flocko.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
How many times did you want to choke that fucking dog?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I shot that dog multiple times, but he's impervious. He's invincible.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
There was always that rumor that some kid in your elementary school shot the damn dog somehow.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Oh, I was able to shoot the dog. It's always that one guy who makes everything up.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That's right. Well, now that can be a reality.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000
But, see, Ice Climbers didn't really have any urban legends other than it sucked.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I haven't seen how the Duck Hunt Dog plays. Does it play like the Ice Climbers?

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Like, the two characters kind of...

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
No, it's just the duck, and the duck kind of follows him around.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
It's not like you can kind of... one part's the duck, and one part's the dog.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Okay, I wasn't sure, because I've been watching you.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Duck Dog.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
That was like Ice Climbers.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Apparently, other lightning gun things are used as well.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I think some of the things from Gyromite come out, too.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Just really obscure shit, which is awesome.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I love the really obscure shit. That's what makes it interesting.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Demix in our chat says,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I think Duck Hunt inspires more nostalgia than Ice Climbers.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Well, you know, that Nintendo set, the action set, or whatever it was called,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
that came with the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt combo cartridge?

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
That sold more than anything.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
So I think most people played Duck Hunt whether they liked it or not.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It was like, ooh, I have Mario Brothers.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Oh, and this other game.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
You know? Yeah.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000
And then it was World Class Track Meet in the later set that came with it, too.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Alright, anyway.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Moving on to other news.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
We've talked about this convention previously on the show.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
We actually had one of the organizers on a previous episode,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and maybe we'll have to have them back,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:50.000
because GX3, which used to be known as GamerX, that's G-A-Y-M-E-R-X,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
it is going to happen in 2015.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000
GX3 got its funding needed with 999 backers.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You've got to love that number.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
999 backers making GX3 a reality.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
We don't know the exact date in 2015,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000
but it will be happening November, December-ish in 2015.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000
By the way, one of the stretch goals that was passed for GX3 was GX Talks Season 2,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
which would have been all the panels at the last GamerX that happened.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I was fortunate enough to be a part of one of those panels,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
so look for that coming to YouTube soon at some point,

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
whenever that gets out there, and I'll be sure to promote that.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:37.000
By the way, VOG Network going to be a sponsor of GX3 officially,

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
so we're going to have a table at the show.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I have no idea what we're doing with it yet,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
but I have some ideas clicking around in my head,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.000
so this is exciting that, yeah, we're going to actually be sponsoring a convention next year.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
This might not be the only one either,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
but GX3 is definitely on our radar for 2015, so that's very exciting.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
So congrats to all of them over there.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Monster Hunter 4.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I know not a lot of people here in the US get really excited about Monster Hunter 4,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
but as it is the week of Tokyo Game Show,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Capcom's putting out a little more information about Monster Hunter 4,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
including some collaborations.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Taiko Drum Master being one of those random-ass cameos in the game,

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
the little happy face taiko drum showing up on one of the weapons.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
It's like a hunting horn is what they call it.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Sonic the Hedgehog as well.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Sonic the Hedgehog armor will be available in the game.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
That is a creepy fucking Sonic the Hedgehog, by the way, in this little picture.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:38.000
It looks like Sonic the Hedgehog in one of those really scary real-life drawings.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I don't know what to think of this, but that is available,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
which you also might get a kick out of.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Animal Crossing content in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000
You can dress up as Isabelle from Animal Crossing and Mr. Resetti,

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
so check that out in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I hope they bring some of that out over here.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
That might get me a little more excited about Monster Hunter, just saying.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
That would be awesome.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
All right, Flaco, what do you have for us?

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
It's my turn.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Forgive me, I'm reading this on my tiny phone.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Final Fantasy 1 is coming to Nintendo 3DS with 3D support.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Because they're releasing Final Fantasy Explorers in Japan,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
and the release date is December 18th,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
it just happens to fall on the anniversary of Final Fantasy 1.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
To commemorate this, the 3DS game will include a download code

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.000
for the first Final Fantasy game as part of its second first print bonus.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
The other bonus was Final Fantasy 3's Onion Knight equipment.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I still can't imagine that they won't release this somehow as a standalone.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Wasn't the Kid Icarus 3D thing supposed to be a pre-order bonus for the game?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
But it came out as a standalone.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Yeah, it'll come out. They've already got it.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
If there's money to be made, it will be made.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So there's that one.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Let's see, I gotta switch to the other stone.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
That can fill in the gap for you not having it on the PC.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Are you a 3DS owner?

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I am not a 3DS owner.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I thought you had one.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Nope.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
And I'm glad I waited, because I think I want the new 3DS.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
That's not announced for America yet?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
That's not announced for America, but it will be.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
It will be. They gotta fill those Nintendo directs somehow.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I know, I know. Alright.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
So let's see, my next quick story here is

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Nintendo's disabling images that were able to be posted in the Mario and Luigi community.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Now here's their quote.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the screenshot feature has been disabled in this community.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
We're looking into the cause of the problem. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So I guess they could actually post real pictures, I'm assuming, for reading this,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
onto the Mario and Luigi Miiverse community.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So of course...

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Who posted their penis on Miiverse?

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Who posted their penis on Miiverse and ruined it for everybody?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Or did they post a picture of their penis with a tiny little Mario hat on it?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
It's a me, a penis.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
So yeah, so that's unfortunate.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I got your magic mushroom right here, bitch.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Yeah, so that's that.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Only if it made the little sound.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Okay.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I just, when I first saw this, I thought maybe somebody was putting Mario and Luigi in compromising positions.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Well, that's what I thought, especially from the picture that accompanied that article.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I'm like, wait, is this what people are doing?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
No, it's just they could post images to the forum, I guess.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And of course they posted things they shouldn't post.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Pictures of Jennifer Lawrence, I don't know.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
No, it's Kardashian now, apparently, over the weekend.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Oh my gosh, I miss the news.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Is it one of the new girls?

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
One of the younger ones?

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Or is it actually...

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I think it's Kim.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I can't tell them apart.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Well, who would care about that?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
She already has a tape out.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Yeah.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Like, that's nothing new.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Well, and that whole thing is wrong anyway.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
It's wrong.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It's bad.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And you shouldn't be looking at those pictures, Rob.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
You shouldn't perpetuate them.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
So, my next story...

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I'm trying to think what was there.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
It's like, it was a movie or something like that.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
That's terrible.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Oh, it's always sunny.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
That's terrible.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That's wrong.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Like, I should tell that website, you know, take those down.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Which website was that again?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Because I need to go tell them to remove that.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
They're shameful.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
That's right.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yeah.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I do remember that.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000
As a reminder, I happen to be a homosexual.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.540
And the thing about that whole thing that cracks me up is that you have, like, all these

02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.200
women nudes that leaked, right?

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.960
You have, like, Jennifer Laura, all these women nudes leaked.

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.400
And then Dave Franco, like, there's one dude...

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.120
Don't forget Justin Verlander.

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:50.600
There's one dude in the whole list that is Dave fucking Franco.

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.600
There was a second one?

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.600
Well, yeah.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.600
But he's a baseball player, so.

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.600
Oh.

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.200
But yeah.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:57.200
Justin Verlander.

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.200
He's the one that's dating Kate Upton.

02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.200
Oh, okay.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.200
So that's how they got her pictures.

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:01.200
It was actually his phone that got hacked.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.200
How do you know that?

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.200
Oh.

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.200
Because I read Deadspin.

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.200
Oh.

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.200
I'm a sports fan.

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:07.200
That's right.

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.760
I'm a vog listener who likes sports.

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:09.760
Oh, that's right.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.000
You went to the whole video game night with Extifer.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
That's why you went to the Hoard House.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Yeah.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I was on gamer night.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
The Giants.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
That was really fun.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Awesome.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
It was a really fun night.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
He had a little giveaway.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Like an Assassin's Creed.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.480
And then after the second inning, we were able to wait in line and get it signed by

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.320
Todd McFarlane, you know, who's done, you know, all the spawn stuff, video games, movies,

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.320
all that.

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.940
And the funniest part was they make us wait in this line.

02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.920
We're kind of in the way, but that's the only place they told us to put the line in.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:39.360
And all these people walk in and he's like, all these dumb people standing in line for

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.440
this guy's autograph is ruining the game.

02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:45.320
It's like, sorry, that's what we're here for.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.320
All right.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.320
Sorry.

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:48.320
I didn't mean to derail your story.

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.320
That's okay.

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.320
That's okay.

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.240
There's a story left and it's about Koji Igarashi, is that how you say his name?

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240
Igarashi.

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.240
Igarashi.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.240
Sorry.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.240
I should know this.

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:00.240
I worked at Konami.

02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:02.480
Anyway, he's famous for being a co-director on Symphony of the Night.

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.800
I'm so bad with names.

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:06.560
I probably even met this guy at E3.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:12.520
Anyway, during the Mighty No. 9 panel at PAX, he was talking about how excited he was to

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.800
work on this new game that he calls it his dream game.

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.840
And now that game is on hold and he's going to focus his attention on his new job working

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.840
for a mobile developer.

02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:24.920
Isn't it sad to hear all these great game developers working for mobile?

02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:25.920
Or maybe it's good.

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:26.920
They're not unemployed.

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:32.280
Well, it could be good because maybe the next, like the reason why I will embrace mobile

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.640
gaming all of a sudden will come from one of these guys.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.640
You know what I mean?

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.640
Yeah, maybe.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.280
But I still don't think touch gaming is where it's at and that's the fundamental issue is

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:41.280
that there's no tactile control.

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.120
When you hear his dream project went on hold because he's got to go back to work.

02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:45.120
Yeah.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.120
Yeah, that's true.

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:47.480
I was like, no, work on your dream.

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:51.400
It's obviously his dream project isn't mobile.

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:55.200
I got to go take this job to pay the bills first, then I'll get back to what I want to

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.200
do.

02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.200
I understand that.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:58.320
But yeah, there's one quote.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.120
It's kind of an unusual agreement.

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.720
I have a special carve out that allows me to work with another publishing partner or

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:08.020
find another route, find other routes to fund my dream game.

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:11.000
So it sounds like it's kind of stuck in limbo right now.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
All right.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Yeah.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Good luck.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Cause you know, I miss Castlevania back when it used to be like super cool.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:22.280
So I guess the new games weren't awful, but it just, it wasn't symphony of the night.

02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:23.280
You know what I mean?

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.280
It wasn't that.

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.280
All right.

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:28.120
Anyhow, uh, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.120
That's right.

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:39.840
You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash those words together and you get FUGL.

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:44.380
And every week we ask these communities a question, uh, that you guys answer about what's

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:48.400
going on in the news or in this case, maybe something inspired by our guest.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:53.240
Uh, so, you know, earlier in the show we had Mike from Jackbox games on the show to talk

02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:55.580
about fibbage and you don't know Jack.

02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:59.120
So our question this week is about game show style video games and we want to know what

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.600
are your thoughts on game show video games?

02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.180
Do you enjoy playing them?

02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:04.560
What are your favorites?

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:08.520
And the most important question I believe out of this bunch, what is a game show that

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:11.000
you think would make a great video game?

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.580
So let's see what some of our listeners thought.

02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:17.200
Let's start on Google plus with actdeft who said, I think trivia games are the best of

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.160
this type of game, especially when the game can be funny.

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:21.160
Like you don't know Jack.

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:22.240
They're so good.

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.920
And I would love to see the weakest link done again in video game form.

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.600
I think there's already a video game based on it.

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:29.600
There were several.

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:30.600
Yes.

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:34.760
Uh, but I would love to see it done in a one versus a hundred style or at least online

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:38.840
only if they had, what was her name and what was her name?

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:44.600
The British lady that did all the insults, you know, which is missing the idiots that

02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:45.600
whole thing.

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.600
What was her name?

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.600
I don't remember.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:48.600
And some and Robinson.

02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:49.600
Oh wow.

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.600
That's it.

02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:51.600
And Robinson.

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:54.040
I keep thinking Ann Ramsey, but that's somebody different.

02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.680
Gordon Ramsey, somebody completely different.

02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.320
You donkey.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.320
Wasn't Ann Ramsey.

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.320
Also mama.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:07.960
When you say Ramsey and British, I just think of it's bollocks.

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:11.600
Uh, maybe that would be kitchen nightmares might make a good video game.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.640
If you can get Amy's baking company somehow involved.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.640
I don't know.

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.640
All right.

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640
Now you're going to get grandpa.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640
All right.

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.640
Or something.

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.120
Uh, entertainment says it's not exactly a game show, but I'm surprised there hasn't

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:23.880
been a video game based on survivor.

02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:29.120
Actually there have been several entertainment and they were all piss poor games.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:33.520
Uh, they right at the height of survivor popularity, there was one right around the

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:34.520
Australian outback.

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:35.520
I think.

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:40.280
So they pushed out a game in like less than a year and then there was, I never even played

02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:41.280
in these survivor games.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.280
I don't doubt it.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:45.000
There was one on the, we, I, okay, here's the funny thing.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.440
I have the survivor board game.

02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:52.120
I have two copies of it because that's how many of my friends knew I was obsessed with

02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:53.320
survivor when it first came out.

02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.720
I got it as the board game at least good.

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.040
It was a little silly.

02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:00.760
You had these little immunity challenge like questions and then you voted players out of

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:01.760
the game.

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:02.760
Ooh.

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:06.400
You know, which is basically like, you know, it's just like basically stab your friends

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.400
in the back.

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:08.400
That's all it is.

02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:11.320
Like it's just consistently, you could just play vote, vote friends out of the game could

02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:12.320
just be a game.

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.920
Isn't that kind of the wolf game in a way a little bit?

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:15.920
I don't know.

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:18.120
Yeah, I would be surprised if they just took some of that stuff.

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.120
All right.

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.120
Uh, let's see.

02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:23.060
Uh, anyway, entertainment continues though because I like the, the thought here.

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:26.640
I'm thinking an MMORPG where you play live against other players.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:30.540
It would be great to see different factions develop players backstab each other, poorly

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:34.860
utilized immunity idols and other common things that happen on that show survivor outwit outplay

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.640
outlast online.

02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:39.440
I will tell you this because I've actually participated in these.

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.840
I used to do this a lot on live journal, which you know, LOL, how old is that site now?

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:48.920
But there are fan run games where you do get to experience a lot of that and people get

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.600
really hardcore crazy about this stuff.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.880
I actually was really good at big brother online, uh, but on Facebook you can find like

02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.600
survivor fan run games that people run and they do a lot of the same stuff.

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:03.760
So I mean, it would be nice to see a little more structure to something like that in the

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:06.840
game, but it is kind of cool that that does exist out there one way or another.

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:07.840
All right.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.120
Let's go to our Facebook page and some of the answers over there.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:16.060
James a saying the only one I played continuously was classic concentration on the NES.

02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.640
It's still one of my favorite NES games.

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.640
Actually.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:19.640
I had that on the Commodore 64.

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:22.120
That was one of my favorite game shows back in the day.

02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:23.120
Trebek hoax did that.

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:24.120
Did he?

02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:25.120
That's like, they stole my answer.

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.360
Uh, did he always hosted or he just originally hosted?

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.400
I think he hosted the eighties revival.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.280
I think there was a version of it like in the sixties, but anyway, I love that game.

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:33.280
And I love that video game too.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.680
Uh, as far as today's game show video games go, I can't really say I hate them just that

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.040
none of them have interested in me.

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.360
Most of them seem to be in a really odd multiplayer niche where none of my friends really watched

02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.360
the actual show.

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.840
So they don't want to play the video game version when they come over.

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:48.440
But people who do watch the shows, my mom don't play video games.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.840
Hey, my mom played anticipation with me, just so you know, but since she wouldn't touch

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:55.520
the controller, she'd just yell out from her chair.

02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.880
You know, it's being drawn on the screen, Rob, buzz, buzz, buzz me.

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:08.280
It's a sausage, Rob, Rob, Rob, buzz, uh, dark Tetsuya says, well, it wasn't based on a real

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.280
show.

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.280
There was a game.

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.100
I'll never forget on the three D O twisted the game show.

02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:16.600
The game featured a ton of FMV segments and live actors and wacky costumes and several

02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:19.240
hilarious fake ads during the commercial breaks.

02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:20.500
I remember that game.

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:21.720
I do remember that game.

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.040
That was one of the reasons I wanted a three D O, uh, generate a plate that, yeah, right.

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.320
So we knew that one kid in the block that had a three.

02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:30.320
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.320
There was, yeah.

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:35.760
As a friend of a friend of mine that had that we played, I think it was, you know, no Jack

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.760
on there.

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.760
I don't remember.

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.560
There was, there was some party game we played that was like that on the three D O. I don't

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.560
know.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:43.560
Maybe it wasn't, you'd know.

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.560
No Jack.

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.560
There was something though.

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.560
Maybe it was twisted.

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.560
I don't know.

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:48.560
And then we played road rash.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.560
I just remember road rash.

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:50.560
Cause that was, that was a shit.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.440
Uh, degenerate Johnny says, I've always liked video games based on game shows such as family

02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:55.760
feud and wheel of fortune.

02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:59.600
However, I would have loved to play a game that placed player characters in danger.

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:05.240
Like the game show featured in stay tuned, starring John Ritter.

02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.460
I remember that movie.

02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:12.480
That was the first movie I ever saw in the theater on opening day was stay tuned.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.480
Believe it.

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.480
Really?

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.480
Yeah.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.480
John Ritter and Pam Dauber, right?

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.480
With the salt and pepper.

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.720
But it was the first movie I saw in the theater on opening day on opening day.

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:23.720
I know.

02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.720
Right.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:29.280
Cause usually because here's the thing in Roseville at the time where I grew up, Roseville,

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.720
California, it was a much smaller town.

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:34.840
If we wanted to go to the movie theater and see new movies, we had to drive all the way

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.880
to the next town over.

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.880
Oh wow.

02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.240
All we had in our town was a dollar theater.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.360
That's now a radio shack.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.720
I'll give you an idea how big that place was.

02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:44.720
Okay.

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:45.720
It was a dollar theater.

02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.680
The dollar theater was all the second run movies.

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.720
So that's why it took me so long to see something.

02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.720
Get it?

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.920
We just had a little two screen theater in our hometown and my hometown and it was, uh,

02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:57.480
it really would just play the same movies all summer.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:59.400
Like, Oh, Batman came out.

02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.400
Have fun watching Batman.

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.520
Also, they're not going to change the movie out.

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:03.760
All right.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.440
Peter Uno says, much like Rob, I used to love all the game shows on berserk.

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:10.280
You don't know Jack, Acrophobia, Cosmic Consensus.

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.420
And of course more recent ones like one versus a hundred.

02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:16.380
This one especially worked really well with hundreds of players all online at the same

02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.380
time.

02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:20.400
Uh, as she says, I'm a huge fan of the game show games.

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.380
Back when I was hosting game gaming parties, you don't know Jack and even the Xbox three

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:29.860
60 versions of the scenic games with the buzzer controller adaptions, uh, all went over well.

02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:33.620
My dream game show would be of course the match game with a digital version of Charles

02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.620
Nelson Riley.

02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:36.980
Yes.

02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:43.380
Fifth dream last and not least says I like to play some game show style games, though

02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.020
many of them are poorly done despite that I rented the crap out of some super Nintendo

02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:53.260
jeopardy games back in the day so I could prove to myself that I really could be a contender

02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:54.260
on the show.

02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:55.260
All right.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:59.380
Going around the room here real quick, your favorite game show esque game and what, what,

02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:01.140
what needs to be the next one?

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:04.460
I'll just say everybody's been taking all the great answers.

02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.140
I'll just say you don't know Jack movies.

02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:08.140
I liked it.

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.140
They did.

02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:11.900
They did special editions of like very focused additions back in the day.

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:15.140
It's almost a question I wish I could ask them again, but they probably aren't going

02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:16.140
to go that way again.

02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.940
But uh, yeah, like you don't know Jack movies.

02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:19.620
I like cause it was cool.

02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.620
They could do DLC.

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:21.620
Maybe.

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:22.620
I mean, I don't know how much money it costs.

02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:26.980
I mean, you know, he, he gave a very realistic answer about, you know, about that budget

02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:27.980
and all that.

02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:28.980
Yeah.

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.460
So I would think if there's money to be made, maybe like DLC could go there.

02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:36.180
And I think that's happened kind of in the, uh, on the app, like the app and the mobile

02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:39.940
and then the Facebook version now they kind of have themes and stuff like that.

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:40.940
It's around Superbowl Sunday.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:42.380
They had like a whole week of like sports stuff.

02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:43.380
There you go.

02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.380
That was pretty cool.

02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:45.380
And uh, Oh, let's see.

02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:48.060
So what are the other parts of the question?

02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:50.300
What game show do you want to see as, okay, okay, okay.

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:51.300
Yeah.

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:55.620
I got one that no one else will pick baggage with Jerry Springer.

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.140
I want that one.

02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:01.860
I want to try to guess with their packages and then, and then they come up to you and

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:07.540
like, yes, I'm a pickpocket, but I still want you to go on a date with me or whatever.

02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:08.540
I pick pocket.

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:09.540
It's like not someone's biggest baggage.

02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:10.540
Is anyone else?

02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:11.540
It's such trash.

02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:12.540
Yes.

02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:13.540
Okay.

02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:14.540
Yeah.

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:15.540
Someone else has seen baggage.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:16.540
I've seen it.

02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:17.540
It's trashy as hell.

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:18.540
It's so trashy.

02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:19.540
I love that show.

02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:20.540
Um, uh, Loki.

02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:21.540
I don't know.

02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:22.540
Are you, you don't strike me.

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:23.740
Well, you did the twisted and stuff.

02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:24.740
What was it?

02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:25.740
What was the favorite of yours growing up?

02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:27.780
Uh, favorite like game show.

02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:28.780
Oh, game show.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:29.780
God.

02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:34.300
Uh, you know, I, I, even though you don't know, Jack was technically not based on a

02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:35.300
game show.

02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.300
I still consider it one.

02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:37.300
You know what I mean?

02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.300
Uh, I don't know.

02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:39.940
I became one.

02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:41.380
I didn't watch a whole lot of game.

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:46.380
I mean just the traditional ones like wheel of fortune, uh, jeopardy, that kind of stuff.

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:48.700
But uh, double there.

02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:49.700
Yeah.

02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:52.460
I, you know, they did have an NES double there.

02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:53.460
Yeah.

02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:54.460
Yeah.

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:58.260
Um, God, um, I don't know.

02:15:58.260 --> 02:15:59.820
I didn't really play a whole ton of those.

02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:03.580
I think it just played a lot of the like wheel of fortune stuff, you know, on PC, like the

02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:06.380
old wheel of fortune games and stuff.

02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:10.580
Um, yeah, I never had like anticipation or anything like that.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:11.580
Right.

02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:13.780
Uh, and lastly, my answer would be my favorite ones growing up.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:18.720
I played a lot of different ones on the Commodore 64 and my very favorite, another listener

02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:21.300
already took it, but classic concentration was absolutely my favorite.

02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:24.440
Like, so trying to solve those puzzles was, was a lot of fun, but I had like family feuds

02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:27.980
and jeopardy wheel of fortune, which I can't believe nobody said that one, but wheel of

02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:28.980
fortune.

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:29.980
Yeah.

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.980
I had all that stuff on Commodore 64.

02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:31.980
That was always a lot of fun.

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:34.160
Now the game show that I believe needs to be a game.

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:40.180
I've said this time and time again on the show, RuPaul's drag race would make an excellent

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.180
video.

02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:42.180
All right.

02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:43.180
I guess that's more of a reality show than a game.

02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.180
It's a reality competition.

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:45.180
Sure.

02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.180
All right.

02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:47.180
So if survivor works, so does that.

02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:48.180
All right.

02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:49.180
I've got another answer.

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.180
I can't believe none of y'all said this.

02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:51.180
Cause everybody would play supermarket sweep.

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:52.180
Oh, that is a good one.

02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:53.180
Supermarket sweep.

02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:54.180
Come on.

02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:55.180
You could, you could run around.

02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.180
It could be like a first person shooter, but it's just a giant cart.

02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:57.180
And then like you get to the ham and it's like, you know, press a to ham, ham, ham,

02:16:57.180 --> 02:16:58.180
ham, ham, ham, ham.

02:16:58.180 --> 02:16:59.180
Just put it, stack your cart.

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:00.180
What?

02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.180
Loki say to the mic.

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:02.180
What?

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.180
I said, that's the only thing connect could work for is just like, you know, grabbing

02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:04.180
stuff off the shelf.

02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:05.180
Just flail to grab things off the shelves.

02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:06.180
Yeah.

02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:07.180
Yeah.

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.180
Yeah.

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.180
Yeah.

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:10.180
Yeah.

02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:12.180
That's the only reason to buy that game.

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:13.180
That's the reason right there.

02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.180
There it is.

02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:15.180
All right.

02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:16.180
Uh, thank you guys for answering our FUGO question of the week.

02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:17.180
We'll see you next week.

02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:18.180
Bye.

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:19.180
Bye.

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:20.180
Bye.

02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:21.180
Bye.

02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.180
Bye.

02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:23.180
Bye.

02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:24.180
Bye.

02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:25.180
Bye.

02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:26.180
Bye.

02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:27.180
Bye.

02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:28.180
Bye.

02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:29.180
Bye.

02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:30.180
Bye.

02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:31.180
Bye.

02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:32.180
Bye.

02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:33.180
Bye.

02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:34.180
Bye.

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:35.180
Bye.

02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.180
Bye.

02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:40.820
Thank you guys for answering our FUGO question of the week.

02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:43.000
Let's get into some more gaming news.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Loki.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
All right.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.100
So this is kind of good news, um, with every ... No.

02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:54.760
Well, they claim this wasn't the cause of the Xbox hacks a while back.

02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:00.100
Remember, people stealing other peoples' accounts and trying to charge up money and buying stuff,

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:06.140
you know, for the FIFA ultimate team including, you know, in game items and coins and stuff

02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.140
like that.

02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:14.820
Well now, I guess, FIFA 15, the ultimate team mode, they are removing the ability to use

02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:19.420
trade offers because that was the way, when people were stealing accounts, that they were

02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:24.160
offloading stuff to other accounts, I guess.

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:32.540
So this hopefully will at least de-incentivize people from stealing other peoples' accounts

02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:35.780
for FIFA 15 things or FIFA ultimate team things.

02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:40.260
It's about freaking time they do something to de-incentivize that whole thing.

02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:42.540
Well, how many years ago was that, that that happened?

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:45.580
I mean, are they really waiting this long?

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.580
I don't know.

02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:48.580
It just seems kind of stupid.

02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:52.700
But I'm glad they're doing something.

02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:54.700
I don't know.

02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:57.180
All right.

02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:00.940
I don't know a whole lot about ... I mean, I don't really play FIFA online, so it's hard

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.260
for me to speak a little more like about like, oh, well, they should be doing this or this.

02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:07.740
I just kind of know that, you know, my account information was hacked and that's exactly

02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.580
what they used it for, was all that stupid FIFA crap.

02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:14.140
So I'm glad they're putting some deterrence in there.

02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:15.140
That's good.

02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:16.500
About eight years after the fact, right?

02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:17.500
Yes.

02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:18.500
All right.

02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:22.420
Anyhow, let's move on to a story about Project Scissors.

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.700
And I'm not talking about Scissors Sisters.

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:28.820
I'm talking about Project Scissors.

02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:33.180
When you think of scissors in gaming, perhaps you think about Clock Tower, which, speaking

02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:34.180
of scary games.

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:35.180
Did you ever play Clock Tower?

02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:36.180
I did.

02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:37.180
Blocko?

02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:38.180
I like that game.

02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:39.180
That is the scariest game.

02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:42.180
When you look in a mirror and then the hands reach out and grab you, I'm like, oh, gosh.

02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:43.180
Right, right.

02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:50.060
So anyway, Hifume Kuno, who is the creator of Clock Tower, and his studio, Nude Maker,

02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:55.820
which that's ... Nude Maker is the name of the studio, which, okay, maybe we are talking

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.140
about scissoring in a different sense, but anyway, they have announced that they will

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:05.260
be developing a horror franchise for Vita, iOS, Android, and it is a spiritual successor

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:06.260
to Clock Tower.

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:07.620
It is called Project Scissors.

02:20:07.620 --> 02:20:09.740
That may not be the final name.

02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:14.000
This game will be on a luxury cruise liner in the middle of the ocean, so you're stuck

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
on it.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.820
And when the ship sails, a series of gruesome and mysterious murders begin to take place,

02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:26.100
including to the ship's crew, and the ship is soon basically sitting there at sea, and

02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:27.400
you've got nowhere else to go.

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:31.840
So as a passenger trapped on the ship, the player will be tasked with solving the murder

02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:36.640
mystery to ensure your survival and the innocent passengers.

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:41.880
By the way, because we talked earlier about creature designs in Silent Hill, well, Masahiro

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:46.220
Ito, who did the creature designs for the Silent Hill series, oh yeah, he's working

02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:49.320
on this too as a prop designer.

02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:56.400
And Takashi Shimizu, who directed Ju-On, which we know as The Grudge here, he is a creative

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:01.840
producer and directing a live-action teaser trailer for the game.

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:04.760
You will not be sleeping that night, it sounds like.

02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:06.920
That's already that premise right there.

02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:09.180
You are stuck on a boat at sea.

02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:11.080
That's a pretty clever premise for a horror.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:12.080
I'm surprised it hasn't been done.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:14.200
Maybe it has been done, but I haven't heard of it.

02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:15.200
I'm just glad.

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.280
It sounds like survival horror is really making a comeback, or at least horror games in general.

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.800
So I hope that's the case.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:24.160
Seems like the genre was kind of dying off for a while there.

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:31.040
Now the only weird thing about this is that it's, remember, it's Vita, iOS, and Android.

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.520
There's nothing in there about the modern consoles.

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.040
So this is more of, and Vita is essentially, it's probably an extension of the mobile development.

02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:44.480
So again, that means it's only touch controls, so who knows what that could all involve.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.040
It doesn't sound like it's going to be very action-y, but again, who knows?

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.040
I don't know.

02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:50.880
I hope it works like the Walking Dead games from Telltale.

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:53.800
If it works like those, then those are great, because those games have some good scares

02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:54.800
to them too.

02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:55.800
That's a good point.

02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:56.800
I hope it's that quality.

02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:57.800
Yeah.

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:02.240
Well, we'll see when more information comes out about Project Scissors, which may or may

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:03.240
not be the final name.

02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:05.680
Flacco, you got something for us?

02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:10.480
Yeah, the White House hosted a game jam focused on education.

02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:16.080
So let's see, there were like 100 developers there, and it was sponsored by the White House,

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:20.680
specifically focused on education, and there were also science and technology advisors

02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:22.760
from the Obama administration.

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:27.080
They hosted it, and the attendees included Far Cry 4 contributing developer Red Storm

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:31.880
Entertainment, Angry Birds developer Rovio, and Glass Lab, a collaborative effort which

02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:37.000
includes members from the Entertainment Software Association and EA.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.400
So let's see, it says they retain all rights to the concepts they cooked up during the

02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.320
jam, and while there doesn't seem to be an official gallery, there's plenty of photos

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:51.620
and stuff on the WH, for White House, game jam hashtag on Twitter.

02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:56.340
So I guess search the hashtag on Twitter, and you can see some photos and stuff from

02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:57.340
that.

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.780
That's something pretty neat though, when you hear that the White House is having a

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.780
video game jam.

02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:07.620
I mean, yeah, it's all about educational games, but think about all the educational games

02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:12.340
that we grew up on, like Number Munchers and Organ Trail.

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:15.740
There can be some pretty cool educational games, believe it or not.

02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:17.340
Carmen Sandiego, right?

02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:21.060
Or did you ever play Odell Lake?

02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:26.820
I know of Odell Lake, because that was by the, what was it, the Minnesota...

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:27.820
I don't remember.

02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:30.020
The same company that made all the Organ Trail.

02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:34.460
Again, like I said, I got all my games growing up, hand-me-downs from my uncles.

02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:37.260
This game was on, I think it was Converse 64.

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:41.220
And yeah, you get to play as a fish, if you had to go swim, like what kind of fish will

02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:46.740
eat you, and what fish you can eat, or what to avoid the hook, swim shallow.

02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:50.020
There was a crazy little, and I hope they came up with some interesting, you know, games

02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020
there.

02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:53.420
I remember that same group, I remember this one, nobody else has heard of this, called

02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:54.420
Rocky's Boots.

02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.420
Did you ever...

02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:56.420
Oh, no, I don't remember that one.

02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:58.340
It taught basic computer programming.

02:23:58.340 --> 02:23:59.340
Oh, that's awesome.

02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:00.740
It was about, it was like logic.

02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:05.820
I remember you would set up logic gates, and if, then, and, and, ors, and all this stuff,

02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.860
and it was like, you know, it was pretty heavy-duty stuff for a kid, but you know, if you were

02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:15.340
like a big nerd kid like me, like Rocky's Boots was awesome, because, you know, you

02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:19.500
got to learn a bit about programming, so hopefully the next generation of that may be somewhere

02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:20.500
here at this game jam.

02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:24.100
Yeah, and game jams turn out some pretty cool ideas, and like, I think Bobby just mentioned

02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:29.260
it, he, you know, covered that one for his show, the CDC one, and there were some really

02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:32.460
cool ideas in that, so I would hope that there'd be some cool ideas come out of this White

02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:33.460
House one too.

02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:37.460
Right, and you know, we talked earlier about GamerX being funded, and they're talking about

02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:44.820
doing a jam as well, which, you know, could present some very diverse ideas, like I thought,

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:49.020
you know, some of the games I saw at last year's GamerX, things like Triad, which is

02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:55.380
based around the concept of being in a three-way relationship, it was a puzzle game, you know,

02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:59.260
definitely not something you hear about every day as an idea for a game, so, you know, very

02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:03.740
diverse types of ideas, so yeah, I think you can get those out of the box ideas at a game

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:09.540
jam, it's pretty awesome, yeah, very cool, all right, let's move on, Loki, all right,

02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:15.540
and so they've, and I'm surprised that they have yet another dev kit coming up, but Oculus

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:20.300
has a new dev kit coming out called Crescent Bay, I believe this is gonna be the final

02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:25.240
dev kit that they have before the retail version comes out, but some improvements of it, it's

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:31.300
got a higher resolution, higher refresh rate, 360 degree tracking, because it has LEDs on

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:40.940
its back, and removable integrated audio, so that's pretty cool, and, I don't know,

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:48.740
is this available for pre-order, that's all I really wanna know, looks pretty cool, Bobby

02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:55.260
is in chat in all caps, wrong, it's not a dev kit, wrong, wrong, red light, red light,

02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:02.740
would you screw up, Loki, I don't know, I thought it was a dev kit, is this the final

02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:10.540
thing, is this what we're getting, fine, it's a prototype, whatever you wanna call it, prototype,

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:14.900
I think it's gonna be a dev kit, but it's a prototype.

02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:20.400
I can see where, I can see where people are kinda getting that idea, but also at the same

02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.660
time why it's not officially considered one, because there was, you know, very much those

02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:28.340
baseline kits that came out, and this is something different than that, but.

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:32.140
All right, fine, well if they start selling it as a dev kit in a couple months from now,

02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:38.820
then I told you so, but until then, you win this one, Bobby.

02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:48.140
All right, I was teasing we'd talk about this, so we'll move on to this, since Loki's clearly

02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:54.300
misinformed on the Oculus bit, here's the thing, I might be misinformed on this too,

02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:57.680
because this isn't something I super followed, but it's about something interesting that's

02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.080
happening in Marin, California, let me tell you about Marin County, California, all the

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:10.080
people you saw in the box art of anticipation probably came from Marin, California, which

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:16.080
is, let's just say it's home to a very affluent, it's north of San Francisco, it's the city's

02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:21.640
like what, San Rafael's there, right, and you know, the Sausalito, everyone's house

02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.640
is like on a cliff overlooking the ocean, they're looking at the beach, and it's very,

02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.600
I used to deliver TVs up there, I actually tore up someone's private elevator by accident.

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:36.600
Uh oh, how many brunches did you interrupt going over there to Marin County, well, in

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:43.600
Marin County, the district attorney held a buyback day for residents' toy guns and violent

02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:49.320
video games, and this was to highlight issues of domestic violence in October's Domestic

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:56.360
Violence Awareness Month, working with the Center for Domestic Peace and Ben & Jerry's

02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:01.480
Ice Cream for the event, the event is coming up, it's going to be October 4th at Novato,

02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:05.440
that's another city in Marin, Novato Police Headquarters, if you participate, you get

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:09.920
ice cream! Novato, you're kind of getting out of the swanky part at that point though.

02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:13.320
Yeah, that's true. You're getting close to Sonoma County. The district attorney said

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.920
in a written message, quote, as we know, domestic violence incidents almost always have children

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:22.720
present, and these children develop over time in printed images of the family violence.

02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.760
These children then carry those experiences into their adult lives, and often repeat the

02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:32.640
pattern of violence in their own family units. So, why get rid of all the guns in violent

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:39.640
video games? Because, quote, it's a chance to change today's modeling patterns. Okay.

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:46.240
There was previously a program that would buy back real guns, and 857 weapons that paid

02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:53.240
out more than $100,000. So, there you go. Again, violent video games, you know, I'm

02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:59.280
not trying to belittle what is a very real subject here of domestic violence and all

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:06.280
this other stuff, but at the same time, I'm not sure where violent video games, I mean,

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.200
I don't buy your kids violent video games. Well, at least you got, oh, sorry. Oh, go

02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:16.440
ahead. I was going to say, seriously though, how much ice cream am I getting for violent

02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:20.440
video games? Because that doesn't seem like a very, like if I'm getting like a free double

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.200
scoop for like, you know, turning Grand Theft Auto 5, that's not a very good ratio. Maybe

02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.840
a pint, and it's like, oh, come on. GameStop will give you a better trade. Exactly. Not

02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.120
that I ever... Well, you gotta like that at least they're not putting them on the same

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:37.600
level. Guns, they give you money. Video games, they give you ice cream. So, see, it's not

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:40.840
that bad. But here's what I want to know. What are they going to do with all the games

02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:47.880
they collect? Take them to the games. And the cycle continues. They're going to take

02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:54.920
them down to Oakland and sell them. Oh my gosh. Take them to another county and let

02:29:54.960 --> 02:30:00.480
it be their problem. Come on. Sonoma County. Come on. Well, here's the thing. If, I don't

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:04.800
want them to throw them away, so Novato, if anybody from Novato is out there listening,

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:10.280
I will, we volunteer to take all your violent video games. I would be, I'm like, yay, free.

02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:14.360
There's no kids here. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. I will happily play

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:17.840
all of your violent video games. Thirty years from now, we're going to be digging up that

02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:23.820
landfill in Novato. We're like, look at all these games. Microsoft will pay a lot of money

02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:28.040
to make a documentary about digging up the violent video games that were thrown away

02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:38.040
for ice cream. The Novato landfill. Oh my gosh. All right. Demix in our chat room at

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:44.800
live.vognetwork.com says, so if I kill and eat someone, can I blame Shakespeare? Apparently.

02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:49.600
Can I trade in copies of Shakespeare plays for like a milkshake? I mean, I don't know.

02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:54.640
I'll take McDonald's. All right. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:59.800
trying to give some insight to the story that Loki was talking about earlier. Saying it's

02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:04.880
a prototype that's going to lead to a future version. Crystal Cove was demoed at CES. It

02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:11.240
was never released. It led to the DK2. So Oculus regularly releases prototypes of hardware

02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:15.480
that they are building internally. There were two that were built between the DK1 and DK2,

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:20.660
the HD prototype and Crystal Grove. Crescent Bay is the first iteration of what's between

02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:26.740
DK2 and whatever's next. Either the third dev kit or the consumer version. There will

02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:31.320
most likely be another new prototype at CES. So there you go. This is, this is a little

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:38.360
stepping stone to whatever's next. The official prototype. So it could lead to a dev kit.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:42.560
It could possibly. Who knows? I'm hoping they're getting closer to the real thing. They are.

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:46.640
I mean, obviously if it's coming out, assuming that they're going to stick to the summer,

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:52.920
you know, timeframe, that's, you know, about a year away. All right. Nine months away.

02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:57.560
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's see. Back to the mailbag. That's right. This is the time

02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:02.200
of the show. We're going to open up the mailbag, uh, participate at orange lounge. Radio.com

02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:07.880
is the place to send us an email. And, uh, every week we dive into the mailbag and, uh,

02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:15.320
read some things that you have submitted to us. However, in the mailbag this week, nothing.

02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:19.760
That's right. We have no emails this week. Stop the music. You guys have failed to participate

02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:22.600
with our show this week. What is up with that? We were getting a lot of emails in the previous

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:29.000
week. Scared everyone away with her. A grammar threat. Guess what? Some weeks it's going

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.880
to be me and I don't care. They can't look any worse than my text message. I just kept

02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:39.280
the rolling thread of like, you know, playing more Kim Kardashian music. I should have shut

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:43.560
up. Damn. Yeah. That would be a great idea. Cause then when the break rolls around, you'll

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:51.320
know what's happened. It's like, it's like the canary in the coal mine. Kardashian music

02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:57.840
is playing fast. All right. So again, if you want to participate with a future episode

02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:01.640
of our show, participate at orange lounge radio.com perhaps you would like to send a

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:06.520
complete dissertation about Loki's, uh, a lack of knowledge on Oculus development. To

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:11.280
be fair. I was a little distracted because once, you know, it was mentioned that nudes

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:18.400
leaked out. I had to go find them on my, on my internet. I don't want the po po coming

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:22.560
over here. The authority is going to come after you. It's on, you know, I'm going to

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:26.360
be careful. You let into your house. There is a gay couple that lives here. We do not

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:32.120
care about Kardashian nudity. So which credit? I didn't care about Kardashian either. No,

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:39.720
seriously. I didn't is, but which one is it? It's Kim. It's okay. She has a sex tape. And

02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:47.880
it's, it's shit with Ray J. It's the fucking shit you already saw. Shame. Shame. Shame.

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:54.880
I've ever Levine on there. I mean, who cares? That's crazy. Any houses had to see as curious.

02:33:54.880 --> 02:34:00.880
Any dudes? Uh, yeah. Who? I don't know. I don't have her. Levine's nameless boyfriend.

02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:07.880
Zachary Quinto. No, I would let you know. I'd be like, dude, hold on. Stop the music. Rob's

02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:12.880
like, I'm suddenly contributing to this problem. This is so wrong. This is a very wrong thing

02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:19.880
you guys are doing. I just have to see how wrong this is. Exactly. This is, this is seven

02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:24.880
inches of wrong right here. All right. Um, let's move on to the F use of the week. Cause

02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:29.880
uh, every week, especially those when we don't get emails, we get a little bit angsty and

02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:49.880
uh, we let y'all know about it. I just want to point out Avril Lavigne's boyfriend is

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:54.880
the dude from Nickelback. Wait, their main dude from Nickelback? Yes. She married the

02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:02.880
guy from Nickelback. So if that leaked like all kinds of no, there isn't enough nope in

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:13.880
the house. Look at this leaked photograph. That's my scene. Ladies and gentlemen, Flaco's

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.880
last episode because he'll never be invited back. Just so you know. Uh, let's go to the

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:25.880
FUs of the week. Loki. Um, all right, so I guess FU2, uh, the complicated message is

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:31.880
Medi-Cal because signing up for government anything is just a pain in the ass. It's like

02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:37.880
hoop after hoop after hoop. Hopefully almost done. That's it. Let me know if you have any

02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:48.880
issues. All right. All right. Uh, let's see. Flaco FU to David Knight T on Marvel puzzle

02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:54.880
class. You're like two points behind me. I could tell you're about to pass me. So thanks a

02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.880
lot. I'll never get number one in one of these tournaments, but there's like an hour or

02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:04.880
something left. Everyone plays in the last hour. I'm going to get crushed. It's cool. I

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:10.880
didn't, I didn't even care to be top in here, but I did so well. Uh, my FU goes to my back

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.880
because it's been killing me all day because, uh, as my roommate likes to joke, we have

02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:20.880
Jumanji going on in the backyard and I finally decided to tackle that beast this week and

02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:26.880
I've been making progress on killing Jumanji back there and uh, I like hurt my back so

02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:32.880
bad and my arm like, Oh, that was a workout. That's not Jumanji. My backyard is fucking

02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:36.880
Jumanji. Well it isn't now. I took care of some of the worst of it. Well there's literally

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.880
like a vine growing. Like it was growing from one side of the yard over my patio to the

02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:45.880
other side and all I did was like, I'm going to turn that vine around and now it's going

02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:50.880
back to the other side of the yard again. But it's a stupid fucking, I don't even know what

02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:54.880
it is. I have a picture of it cause I took a picture of the whatever plant it is. I can't

02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.880
fucking kill this thing. I got a nuke it now. I think it's seriously, I'm going to have

02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:04.880
to go, you know, nuclear on this thing and just destroy everything in that lawn cause

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.880
I can't kill this vine. It just keeps coming back. I'm just, I'm just telling you, bless

02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:12.880
whoever invented a weed whackers cause those that you can clean up a yard real quick with

02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.880
one of those, but you'll also throw out your back. Yeah, those things are awesome though.

02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:22.880
I had a push mower. You want to talk about back pain manual. It's like, I'm going to

02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:26.880
be good for the environment. I'm going to buy a push mower. Oh my gosh, I want to die.

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:34.880
Screw mother earth. F you. All right, there it is. Your F use of the week in lieu of your

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:38.880
lack of emails. People. All right, just a couple more stories and then we're going to

02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.880
open up the Skype line. Hopefully we'll get a little more participation there at one eight

02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:46.880
seven seven game. O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. Uh, let's do a couple

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.880
more stories here. Loki. Well, if you're living in China and you wanted to get an Xbox one

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:54.880
while you're on the way a little longer, um, unfortunately it was supposed to come for

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.880
our large Chinese audience. You never know. You never know to me. Well, to be honest,

02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:03.880
do we have any listeners in China? I'd like to know to be honest. I mean, they haven't,

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:07.880
I mean they haven't had game consoles for a long time cause they were kind of banned.

02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:13.880
So now this being released in China is kind of hopefully a bigger thing than it was in

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:21.880
Japan. I mean, cause it's not so big in Japan, but um, it's cool that it's being released

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.880
in other parts of the world. So I, you know, props to them. But uh, yeah, unfortunately,

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:31.880
um, is not coming out on Tuesday like it was supposed to be, but sometime before the end

02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:35.880
of the year they're saying, um, can't they just redirect some of the consoles that didn't

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:40.880
sell in Japan? Like, can't they just kind of one possibly. I mean, but they were saying,

02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:44.880
you know, this would be the first foreign video game device officially sold on Chinese

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:51.880
soil in 14 years. Wow. So, um, yeah, it's kind of a fit. No, it's officially sold. Yes,

02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:55.880
officially. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure you could buy it elsewhere and import it. China where

02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:02.880
we got the V like the VI. That was the Chinese. They had a ton of those TV plug and play devices

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:08.880
that was, Oh yeah. The work around. Oh yeah. So well, if you are in China listening to

02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.880
this show, then I want to know about it because I just assumed we were firewalled over there.

02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:16.880
So if, uh, you can hear us in China, let us know. That'd be awesome. So, all right.

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:22.880
Uh, anyhow, uh, one more story for you guys. Speaking of culture, uh, I can't think of

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:29.880
any place more cultured than Texas. Okay. Maybe I can, but here's a, all joking aside,

02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:35.880
this is pretty neat. The video game history museum, uh, going to be having a static home

02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.880
and, uh, that home will be in Frisco, Texas. Not to be confused with San Francisco where

02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:47.880
a lot of game companies actually are Frisco, Texas, uh, had, uh, has approved a deal that

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:54.880
will grant the nonprofit museum, uh, a 10,400 square foot face space in the Frisco discovery

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:59.880
center. When you run the words Frisco and space together, you get face. Um, so there

02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.880
you go. In April, they're expecting the national video game museum. 1.0 should be ready for

02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.880
business. $800,000 for building improvements that Frisco is going to spend on this and

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.880
extra parking. Um, $100,000 in donations. Uh, the museum matched it with raised funds.

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.880
Uh, this is, you know, all joking aside about the location, that's a pretty cool that there

02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.880
will be like a space like that. You know, we have a pinball museum in the Bay area and

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:26.880
they still have yet to go. I really need to know. Yeah, it's an Alameda. I think it's

02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:29.880
an Alameda. So, uh, yeah, I gotta go check that out. But yeah, there's going to be a

02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:34.880
video game museum in, in Texas. Um, I doubt this is the same thing, but I know they were

02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:38.880
talking about doing one in Iowa, like where twin galaxies was born. They were going to

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:42.880
do one that remember where all the eighties contests and they all, there was like a time

02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:46.880
magazine shoot out there years ago and it's like an hour away from the nearest airport.

02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:50.880
I think my old boss was in that time magazine. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He used to hold the record

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.880
for pole position. That's like played it with his feet or something. I don't get why people

02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:01.880
do these things. I just know that. Why not? Uh, so there you go. Uh, yeah, that's going

02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:07.880
to be in Frisco, Texas. Now. I don't know. Uh, maybe, maybe Texas is a big place. How

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:12.880
far is this from Travis Donovan? Is this cause maybe he can go do a report on this. I don't

02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:15.880
know where Frisco, Texas is, but I know like the number one rule about San Francisco and

02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:21.880
its nicknames is you don't call it Frisco. I know that from living in the city for a

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:27.880
while or San Fran. You can call it San Fran. Anything but Frisco. I think anything but

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:31.880
Frisco or maybe this is why they don't want to be confused with the video game museum

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.880
maybe. All right. Uh, there you go. That is it for our news tonight. We're going to open

02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:39.880
up the Skype line now. One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:43.880
radio. Here's your chance to have a say on anything we've talked about tonight. Uh, you

02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.880
want to reminisce on game show games with us? That's fine. You want to talk about Minecraft

02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:51.880
or anything we've talked about. Now's a great time to do that. Let me go over to Loki real

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:57.880
quick and see if he has any last minute stories while I pull up Twitter. I did actually. Um,

02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:02.880
I had a story regarding the retron five. Apparently people have been digging into the code of

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:09.880
it and they found out, guess what? It's stealing a bunch of code from other emulators. They

02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:16.880
literally just stole literal code from different emulators out there to build it in there.

02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:20.880
And unfortunately those, you know, the other emulators that were out there releasing their

02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.880
GPL, um, viral license. But I don't know what to think because it's really not cool that

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.880
they stole somebody's code, but at the same time, what were emulators kind of built to

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.880
do? They're not built a steel code. They're built to emulate console. Yeah. All right.

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.880
I know. I know. But so I'm just saying there is a, I, and that may not be the popular thing

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.880
for me to say, I'm sorry, but you, I just, I see a little sliver of irony and there's

02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:49.880
just a little sliver, but is somebody taking that code and selling it for money isn't cool.

02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:53.880
And then they were also trying to change parts of it to hide the fact that they stole it.

02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:59.880
But you know, they did some comparisons and like there's, it's pretty much the exact,

02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:04.880
I'm going to keep it real though. I still kind of want one. I hear they're really shoddy.

02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:08.880
Are they? Yeah, that's too bad. Maybe I'll wait for somebody to perfect the technology

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:11.880
a little bit, but anyway, we got a call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:16.880
launch radio. Who's this? The one and only Rama. Hey Rama, how are you doing buddy?

02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:21.880
I'm doing pretty good. I'm stuffed from all the seafood and ribs and barbecue over the weekend.

02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:27.880
Hey, did you hear my discussion on a Brazilian meat cuisine? What?

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.880
I want you to know, not even five to 10 minutes from my job, there are at least two to three

02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:39.880
blocks full of Tarasco places. Oh, delicioso.

02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.880
Well, you know what makes it even much more delicious? When the company picks up the tab.

02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:51.880
Oh, indeed, indeed. Well, I'm just going to add that to my list of reasons to come back east.

02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:56.880
I'm overdue. Well, there you go. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.880
Let me tell you about anticipation. This is a game I used to play the living hell out of as a kid.

02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:06.880
I mean, it got to the point where I could play it on very hard and solve every single one of the puzzles.

02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:13.880
Can't do it now, but back then I could do it within like two dice roll. I knew exactly what it was.

02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:19.880
You would be surprised what you'll remember from your youth. Go watch one of these long plays on YouTube,

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.880
like we were doing in studio. And as the thing starts drawing, like you'll remember, you'll just be like,

02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:28.880
oh, it's this, like sausage. Rama, how did I know that? How did I know that? Because I remembered it from when I was a kid.

02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:34.880
Rob, the fact that you know that it was sausage, really? Shut up, shut up. Heart.

02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:42.880
Anyway, yeah, anticipation was a lot, a lot of fun. But yeah, that's the only thing is, is that, you know,

02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:47.880
you didn't have things like DLC expansion packs and additional questions and things like that on cartridges.

02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:51.880
So once you had them all memorized, the game was kind of done, right?

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:56.880
Yeah, it's sort of like the old pressure look because it was the same patterns over and over.

02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:58.880
And once you knew what it was, that was it, you know?

02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:03.880
But then again, you could say that about a lot of video games. Once you know the pattern, you can beat it, no problem.

02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:04.880
And the challenge is gone, right?

02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:09.880
Mm-hmm. See, anticipation is a game I would like to see updated and not for nothing.

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.880
That would probably be a convincing reason for me to get a Wii U.

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:15.880
Oh, look at that. Even so far to say the Wii U.

02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:19.880
Now, here's the most important question I'm going to ask you about your anticipation addiction, Rama.

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:24.880
Is it the trumpet, the heels, the ice cream or the teddy bear?

02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.880
Trumpet.

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:28.880
Oh, you're a trumpet fan. I can see that. I can see that.

02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:29.880
Yes.

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:30.880
All right.

02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.880
And what's interesting when you talk about the game shows is that I just remember one thing is,

02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.880
I have a friend who goes on a lot of anime and other conventions, and he runs game shows.

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:46.880
And he takes, like, classic concentration, Scrabble, match game.

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:51.880
He writes his own code and he makes it themed for whatever the convention is.

02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:57.880
And this is something that's pretty cool and it's, like, quite popular at most conventions.

02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.880
Yeah, there was a guy at All Games back when, and I don't know if he still does this,

02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:06.880
but he did that at Pinning Arcade Expo, like a video game-related thing.

02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:10.880
And Bobby probably knows more on that than I do because I never actually saw it happen.

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.880
But I know it exists in some form on the video game circuit as well,

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.880
but I know on the anime where there are more conventions to do that kind of stuff,

02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:22.880
you see it a little more.

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:23.880
Mm-hmm.

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:24.880
Yeah.

02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:25.880
And one more thing before I get out of here.

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:26.880
Yeah, of course.

02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:29.880
Now, one year I actually hosted a game show and I did match game.

02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:34.880
And what's cool about the conventions is they will always be two versions.

02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:39.880
You have the one for all audiences, daytime, and then you have the 18-plus stuff,

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:41.880
which is pretty much anything goes.

02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:42.880
Nice.

02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:47.880
I haven't filmed, I have the footage somewhere, but it got really raunchy.

02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:49.880
I mean, almost offensive.

02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:55.880
Let's just say to the point I was banned from hosting any game shows for two years.

02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.880
But what was funny is there were staffers in the room who were, like,

02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:02.880
loving every single minute of it.

02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:06.880
You know, it was my dream when I was in the fourth grade to be a game show host

02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:08.880
when they asked, you know, what do you want to do when you grow up?

02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:09.880
I said, I want to be a game show host.

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.880
I want to be like Bob Barker.

02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:14.880
And, yeah, I have this instead.

02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:17.880
But, you know, you have me thinking when you're talking about all this stuff

02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:21.880
on the anime convention circuit, you know, I could propose a panel for GamerX.

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:23.880
Well, yeah.

02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:24.880
I mean, why not?

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:27.880
I mean, code up a fun game and go for it.

02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:33.880
I mean, and you could get away with doing match game because that's just asking

02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:35.880
for it right there if you do match game.

02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:40.880
I think that would be a lot of fun to do a match game live like that or something.

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.880
Match game or a dating game.

02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:44.880
Those are two are really popular.

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.880
All right.

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:49.880
Well, my friend, do you have anything else on your mind tonight before we let you go?

02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:54.880
I hate the fact I have to work from 8 to 5 now.

02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:56.880
Aw.

02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:57.880
That means I have to get up at 6.

02:47:57.880 --> 02:47:59.880
You have a normal person's hours job.

02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:02.880
I've always had a normal person's hours job.

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.880
My schedule used to be 9 to 6, but now the tech department is down two people,

02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:09.880
so it has to come in and do the early shift.

02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:10.880
Oh.

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.880
Yeah.

02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:13.880
That means more coffee.

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:14.880
All right.

02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:15.880
Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:16.880
Good luck with the new shift.

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:17.880
Thanks a lot, bro.

02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:18.880
All right.

02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:19.880
See you later.

02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:20.880
Later.

02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:21.880
You know, you could be dark soccer.

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.880
I brought another part of the reason she isn't here tonight.

02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:25.880
Even if she was here, she's only going to be able to be here for the first half

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:28.880
because she's got a lot of stuff going on at work, I guess.

02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:32.880
And so in the morning, she has to be there early for some type of overtime thing.

02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:35.880
So she's probably in bed by now even if she was listening.

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:39.880
So I'm sure she can feel your pain there, Rama, a little bit.

02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:44.880
Anyway, if you have a call or some thoughts, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a user name on Skype,

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:45.880
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:49.880
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Rob, match game where you do your Charles Nelson Riley voice.

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:50.880
I'll think about it.

02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:53.880
I actually, now you've got my gears turning and I'm like,

02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:55.880
this might actually be a heck of a lot of fun to do something like that,

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.880
like a match game type of panel.

02:48:57.880 --> 02:48:59.880
That would be a lot of fun.

02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:01.880
All right.

02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:02.880
Let's see.

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:04.880
While we wait for some calls, any other last minute stories, Logan?

02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:05.880
Yes.

02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:10.880
There are some details about the new features in Grand Theft Auto 5 and online

02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:16.880
for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One PC that leaked out actually from Rockstar Games

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:19.880
and then they immediately deleted the page that it was on.

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:22.880
But of course, you know, the internet takes photos.

02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:25.880
So some of the features that they're going to be adding to the game,

02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.880
a brand new first person mode for vehicles that show in the interior of vehicles,

02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:33.880
including working speedometers, talkometers, dash lights and more.

02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:36.880
Brand new first person mode while on foot.

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:38.880
New Easter eggs in story mode.

02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:41.880
New animals roaming Los Santos.

02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:43.880
Animals in Grand Theft Auto online.

02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:48.880
And then of course, a newly overhauled character selection screen.

02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:52.880
You can transfer your stuff from the current gen to the next gen.

02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:56.880
Or last gen to current gen, I guess.

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:00.880
When do we officially stop saying next gen?

02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:02.880
It's current gen now.

02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:04.880
I don't know. When do we stop?

02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:07.880
Mike got it.

02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:09.880
You call it current gen.

02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:10.880
All right.

02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:13.880
1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, OrangeLaundrio.

02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:14.880
Just a few tweets tonight.

02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:16.880
Dark Tetsuya is sending us some tweets saying,

02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:20.880
I had to plug this Kickstarter for an epic game room bar here in town.

02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:22.880
Save Point Tavern.

02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:25.880
Imagine a bar restaurant with almost any game you can imagine,

02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:29.880
like video games, classic new RPGs, CCC board games, along with food and drinks.

02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:31.880
And yes, classic arcades too.

02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:33.880
So I'm looking at this Kickstarter.

02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:34.880
They made it.

02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:36.880
So I guess this is something that's going to happen.

02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:40.880
But yeah, they're going to make a tabletop and gaming bar in Sacramento.

02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:43.880
I will have to read more about this because I'm curious.

02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:46.880
I would like to know what is the other...

02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:50.880
Because I worry, like, this is a great idea,

02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:56.880
but sometimes making things happen is a little harder to actually do.

02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:58.880
That didn't seem like a lot of money.

02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:01.880
That doesn't seem like a lot of money.

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:02.880
So I don't know.

02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:04.880
I wonder what kind of space they're talking about there.

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:06.880
Well, now they're talking about stretch goals.

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:09.880
Like, for their stretch goal number one, $28,000.

02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:12.880
A 100-inch projection screen with surround.

02:51:12.880 --> 02:51:15.880
Aren't those a couple thousand dollars by themselves?

02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:16.880
I don't know.

02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:17.880
I don't know.

02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:19.880
Well, that's up from their, what is it?

02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:21.880
23 is their starting goal?

02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:23.880
So I guess, yeah, five grand more.

02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:24.880
Well, good luck.

02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:28.880
This is going to be a heck of an undertaking for you guys.

02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:32.880
Speaking of local stuff, a new game store just opened up in my neck of the woods.

02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:33.880
Oh, yeah?

02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:34.880
It's an independent game store.

02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:39.880
And they have, like, any of their used games you can pop in and play.

02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:45.880
They have some consoles right there you can play in one of these easy chairs that the speaker's built in.

02:51:45.880 --> 02:51:49.880
But you have to pay, like, per the time you play.

02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:50.880
I already figured what the prices were.

02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:53.880
We got to pay for, like, half-hour, hour, two-hour increments or something like that.

02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:56.880
They wouldn't want people to loiter there all day playing their games.

02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:58.880
Yeah, obviously they're going to charge for that.

02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:00.880
But it seemed like a nice little place.

02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:02.880
That was like that, um, what was it?

02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:06.880
That gaming place that we went to the first time at E3 or whatever.

02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:08.880
Was that the first E3?

02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:09.880
I think it was the first E3, remember?

02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:11.880
With all games and stuff.

02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:12.880
The place I was talking about?

02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:13.880
The place from the article?

02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:15.880
Oh, you're talking about the arena lounge or whatever that was.

02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:16.880
Yeah, the arena lounge.

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:20.880
Yeah, it sounds very much like the arena lounge because they have their custom, like, chairs with speakers built in.

02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:21.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:22.880
Stuff like that.

02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:27.880
It's mostly, it's a game store, but then they're like, you know, you can, you know, bring your own games in.

02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:28.880
You can play them right here if you wanted to.

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.880
Or, if anything that we have used, you can pay to check it out first before, you know, we sell it.

02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:36.880
So, I just wouldn't, I had to go in and check it out.

02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:37.880
Yeah.

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:39.880
It's interesting to see something that's not a GameStop, you know, opening up.

02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:40.880
Like an Instagram.

02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:44.880
And, like, how do these places stay alive when you hear that GameStop's such a behemoth, you know?

02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:45.880
Yeah.

02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:48.880
There's another one down a little bit further away in my neighborhood as well.

02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:50.880
And it's been open for a while.

02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:51.880
I forget what it's called.

02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:54.880
Well, I think there's some people that when they get really turned off, they're like, I'm never going to shop here again.

02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:57.880
You know, they mean it, and they want to go somewhere else.

02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:00.880
Yeah, good deal. They run, like, monthly specials.

02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:04.880
They had Infamous, Second Son for, like, 30 bucks, which is cheaper than you can get it on Amazon.

02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:08.880
So, I was like, hey, good for them if they're going to do specials like that on new games.

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:09.880
All right.

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:11.880
I'm going to put out one more call for phone calls.

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:13.880
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:14.880
Our username on Skype.

02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:15.880
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:15.880 --> 02:53:17.880
I don't know what's in the air this week.

02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:21.880
We didn't get e-mail. Like, some weeks we get flooded with e-mails and calls and can't get them all.

02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:24.880
And tonight it's like, no, we'll let you.

02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:25.880
Is there something on TV?

02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:27.880
Yes, there's something on TV tonight.

02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:28.880
Football. Football started.

02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:31.880
Oh, did, uh, fall TV's coming back this next week, right?

02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:34.880
Yeah. I think some shows have already started.

02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:38.880
I think some started and some are, like, and then you got, like, what, like, Survivor starts next week.

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:39.880
On Wednesday.

02:53:39.880 --> 02:53:40.880
Big Brothers finishing up.

02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:41.880
On Wednesday.

02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:42.880
Thank God Frankie didn't win, right?

02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:46.880
Yay! I was so happy.

02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:48.880
See, at least I know you like all those trashy reality shows.

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:49.880
I love them.

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:50.880
Yeah.

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:51.880
I don't watch as many as I used to.

02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:53.880
I've kind of narrowed it down to the ones I used to watch.

02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:54.880
I just keep watching them.

02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:56.880
I just can't grab anything new now.

02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:59.880
I mean, I did watch, um, Who Done It last year.

02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:00.880
That was great.

02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:01.880
Who Done It was great.

02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:02.880
I love that show.

02:54:02.880 --> 02:54:03.880
I thought Who Done It was better than The Quest.

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:06.880
I knew a lot of people were getting really excited about The Quest on ABC.

02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:07.880
I didn't watch that either.

02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:09.880
It was, um, it was silly.

02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:13.880
But, um, it was neat how they had it set up like a show.

02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:18.880
Uh, that was like a medieval thing that actually had a storyline, huh?

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:19.880
Was it like a LARP?

02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:24.880
Sort of, but I sort of felt like the story only existed in the very beginning and the

02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:28.880
very end of the show to tie the silly challenges in each show together.

02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:29.880
Okay.

02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:31.880
And so, and they still had that whole like voting thing that would happen at the end

02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:35.880
of the episode that kind of was, that's the drama right there and didn't really

02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:37.880
I do watch King of the Nerds as well.

02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:38.880
So there we go.

02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.880
I guess I do still watch everything.

02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:44.880
That show got a third season so I'm excited.

02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:45.880
King of the Nerds.

02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:48.880
You know, a member of the OL army was on King of the Nerds last season.

02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:49.880
I know that.

02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:52.880
Nicole, if you guys don't know, she was great on this season.

02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:55.880
She was a big threat because she was kind of one of those people that had knowledge

02:54:55.880 --> 02:54:57.880
of multiple different things.

02:54:57.880 --> 02:54:59.880
And so they took her out when they had a chance.

02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.880
But one of the spoilers we had her on when she was on the tester.

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:04.880
Yeah, I remember that.

02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:08.880
So I didn't, I never watched the tester, but I remember when she was on and then I'd

02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:12.880
watched the first season of King of the Nerds and then when, when,

02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:15.880
when she was on your show, I started following her Twitter and then I got,

02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:17.880
I saw the announcement that she's going to be on King of the Nerds season two.

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:18.880
That's awesome.

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:19.880
That had surprised me.

02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:21.880
She was definitely one of the more entertaining contestants.

02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:23.880
Well, that surprised me too, because I kind of thought after the tester,

02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:28.880
like we had her on the show before her episode aired and I got the feeling that

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:31.880
she wasn't too happy with the way things turned out on the tester.

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:32.880
So I kind of was surprised.

02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:34.880
And then she showed up on a King of the Nerds.

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:36.880
Did you watch like the first episode?

02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:39.880
Because she was singled out by her team, right?

02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:42.880
So I was like, Oh no, the curse continues.

02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:44.880
She's getting kicked off first before everybody.

02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:45.880
Yeah, yeah.

02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:47.880
No, they did a twist and a twist.

02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:49.880
It was stupid, but, but she saved herself.

02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:50.880
She got, I know.

02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:51.880
I mean, she's great.

02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:52.880
And it was a great show.

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:53.880
It's funny.

02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:54.880
Thanks to Twitter and things, you know,

02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:57.880
you start to kind of like really get to know people and you start to learn like

02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:00.880
reality TV really is like there's the one like narrow perception of somebody.

02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:01.880
Oh yeah.

02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:04.880
Like I never like buy into the fact that that's actually reality.

02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:05.880
You know, it's like, Oh yeah.

02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:09.880
Frankie wasn't fed any hints to go along further in the game because it's such a

02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:11.880
huge fan base watching the show on bigger brother.

02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:13.880
And you know, I'm friends with somebody that was on one of the shows.

02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:17.880
It was hated by everybody, but I'm like, he's a cool dude.

02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:19.880
And it's just like, this is the wave.

02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:21.880
Hey, he was one of my favorites that season.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:23.880
I don't know why people hated him.

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:24.880
I don't know either.

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:25.880
All right.

02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:26.880
Anyway, that's it.

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:29.880
I guess Flacco and I are left here to talk about reality television all night

02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:30.880
because you guys aren't calling in.

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.880
So I hope you're having fun, whatever you're doing.

02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:35.880
I guess just too many people standing in front of a cave on destiny,

02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.880
shooting it over and over again to get loot.

02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:38.880
I think that's what's happening.

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:41.880
There's everybody shooting the cave or they all ran off to get fibbage.

02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:42.880
I'm hoping that's what I hope.

02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:43.880
That's what it is.

02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:45.880
They're all like, we can't call in the show tonight because we all started

02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:47.880
playing fibbage and try to catch the podcast.

02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:48.880
That's right.

02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:49.880
We'll just catch the podcast.

02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:50.880
Awesome.

02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:51.880
All right.

02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:52.880
Well, uh, you know, it is a show where every gamer has a voice,

02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:56.880
so we encourage you to, uh, uh, lend us your voice at, um,

02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:59.880
participate at orange on twitter.com or of course on Twitter,

02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:01.880
twitter.com slash O L R.

02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:04.880
Check in with Loki one more time for any other stories.

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:07.880
No, I'm searching on how to kill the trumpet vine.

02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:09.880
Cause that is what is growing in my backyard.

02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:10.880
Oh no.

02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:11.880
And fuck that thing.

02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:12.880
Seriously.

02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:13.880
It's bad.

02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:16.880
Like if I'm lazy and I cut the vine off and just throw it on the ground,

02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:19.880
it'll fucking root up right there and just grow again.

02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.880
I'm like, it's like a fucking hydra or something.

02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:24.880
It's seriously terrible.

02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:25.880
All right.

02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.880
Well, good luck against the garden monster.

02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:28.880
All right.

02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:29.880
Uh, awesome.

02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:30.880
Uh, well fuck.

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.880
Oh, then I'm going to say thanks a lot for being here tonight.

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:34.880
Thanks for filling in for dark soccer at the last minute.

02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:38.880
I had to use your phone to do the stories, but it's okay.

02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:41.880
And I know she appreciates it too. Cause she had a, you know,

02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:43.880
she wasn't expecting to lose her voice and what have you,

02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.880
but you know, you're welcome. Despite me, uh,

02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:47.880
taunting you over your jokes. You're welcome here anytime.

02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:49.880
You're a great support for the network and we appreciate that.

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:51.880
And, uh, if you think about it,

02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:54.880
probably wouldn't have got that interview tonight if I hadn't been

02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:58.880
thought to looked at fibbage, thanks to you. So maybe not.

02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:01.880
And then, and it always goes back to Shane, doesn't it? In a way,

02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:04.880
in a way it always is. And then, um, yeah,

02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:08.880
Shane is a pusher. Oh, and then, and then my plug everybody,

02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:10.880
how many people are logged into chat right now? Well,

02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:13.880
if you're logged in the chat, maybe you're logged into vog. Go, uh,

02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:17.880
go look at my latest article, the fall movie preview. Plug, plug.

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:19.880
And uh, rank those movies.

02:58:19.880 --> 02:58:21.880
I think last I checked there's like seven or eight people ranking them.

02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:25.880
So I ranked a lot of people listening. Go, go rank the movies.

02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:27.880
Yeah. Free points. You get a link at three points.

02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:29.880
You were logging in or five points for logging in the show.

02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:31.880
I mean three points for doing that.

02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:34.880
So bonus points tonight from, uh,

02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:36.880
from when you guys, the dragon con,

02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:39.880
Bobby finally retconned the loot. I love that loot.

02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:40.880
I love the half here.

02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:44.880
That was the best. Did Bobby do that too?

02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:47.880
There's some funny, like, I know I like a lot of the loot.

02:58:47.880 --> 02:58:48.880
It's really funny.

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:51.880
I know we haven't done a lot of raffles lately cause we haven't had a lot of

02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:52.880
like prizes in the pool to give away.

02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:56.880
I'm going to really try to get stuff at fan fest and Blizzcon so we can try to

02:58:56.880 --> 02:58:58.880
bring back the raffles. I have a bunch of steam codes.

02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:00.880
I can do it. Well, maybe, okay,

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:02.880
maybe we'll set up a raffle for a next month, but anyway,

02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:06.880
you got to check out some of the loot cause we have a lot of funny in jokes on

02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:07.880
the loot and like little,

02:59:07.880 --> 02:59:11.880
like I actually sit there and think of funny shit to put on the loot and I

02:59:11.880 --> 02:59:13.880
don't like how many people have gotten the hashtag tag.

02:59:13.880 --> 02:59:16.880
Probably I got any five. So I love it.

02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:20.880
Check that out over at voggenetwork.com. Anyhow,

02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:22.880
thanks again Flaco for being here. Besides that plug,

02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:24.880
any other final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:28.880
Uh, no, not really. Just glad to be here.

02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:30.880
Glad to be the laugh track of the show.

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:31.880
Cause I can't stop laughing. I don't know.

02:59:31.880 --> 02:59:33.880
Well, last week we had a live studio audience. Somebody,

02:59:33.880 --> 02:59:36.880
I know that was great. I love commented on that to me.

02:59:36.880 --> 02:59:38.880
Like when, when, when Jonas and Diego are there,

02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:41.880
it's like you guys have a live studio audience here cause they have very big

02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:43.880
laughs. So you just got to bring me in next time. Dan's here.

02:59:43.880 --> 02:59:45.880
I'll sit in the background and I'll just laugh the whole time.

02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:49.880
I love when Dan's on. Dan's I crack up. I'm like laughing in my car.

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:55.880
It must look like an idiot. There's plenty of reasons why you look like an

02:59:55.880 --> 02:59:58.880
idiot Flaco. That's not why. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.

02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:03.880
Uh, Loki, thank you of course for being here as always.

03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:05.880
Uh, your final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:07.880
Uh, my final thought is I,

03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:14.880
maybe I'll take a break from working on my game to dust off the Minecraft server.

03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:16.880
You need to play one fucking game this week, Loki. Play one.

03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:21.880
I, well I, like I said, I downloaded a few games on my steam backlog cause I was

03:00:21.880 --> 03:00:24.880
like, I was going through and I'm like, what the fuck is half of this shit that

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:28.880
I have? Like when did I get sniper V2? Oh, that's right. It was free.

03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:31.880
Um, it's just like, you know, I keep downloading stuff.

03:00:31.880 --> 03:00:34.880
Like anytime I see an offer for a free steam come like, Oh,

03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:38.880
I'm gonna add it to my back. I have like 280 games on there. It's just,

03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:41.880
it's getting ridiculous. So, um,

03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:43.880
I'm going to try maybe playing some road redemption.

03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:48.880
Hopefully that runs okay on my system. And, um, I don't know.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:52.880
I'll see what else. I haven't, uh, console games.

03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:55.880
I think maybe the next console game I'll play is going to be Borderlands,

03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:58.880
I think. Borderlands is a pre-sequel. That looks kind of fun. Yep.

03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:01.880
Uh, and then Call of Duty after that, I,

03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:04.880
I'm actually looking forward to Call of Duty, so we'll see.

03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:06.880
I do, I wish I could get PlayStation four or something.

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:09.880
I need to get a job and money, so. Well, good luck on that.

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:12.880
By the way, if you are local and you have a job for Loki,

03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:15.880
you have a job for Loki. Uh, he could, he could use it, right? Yep.

03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:17.880
Do you, do you know your last day at your current place yet?

03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:21.880
Yeah, the 30th. Uh, so, uh, yeah, I know that already. Um,

03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:25.880
and actually I have, was it my coworker knows, um,

03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:27.880
someone that's a head hunter in the game industry.

03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:32.880
So she's wants me to contact this person. I'm like, okay, well,

03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:35.880
I don't think there's really only bummer is that if you get in the game

03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:39.880
industry, I might lose you to a conflict of interest. I hate that.

03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:41.880
I mean, I understand you gotta do what you gotta do for yourself and your

03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:45.880
family. But, uh, no, I don't, I honestly don't think it would be anything.

03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:48.880
I could, you know, I don't think there's anything really out there for that.

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:51.880
Not in this area. There's not, you never know. You've been,

03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:55.880
you've been on the side of, of, uh, the retail sales. There's,

03:01:55.880 --> 03:01:58.880
there's people at these companies that want people with your skillset

03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:01.880
working for them to get the get. So you never know. You never know.

03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:05.880
We'll see. We'll see. All right. Uh, anyhow, my final thought tonight,

03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:08.880
I just, uh, I want to, um, thank everybody for tuning in and listening.

03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:11.880
And as I always say on the show, uh, if you like what you heard here at

03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:14.880
orange on radio, please tell a friend or two or 17 about the show,

03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:17.880
even though we are the internet's longest running program about video games.

03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:20.880
It's a very small audience we have here because all we've got is word of mouth.

03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:24.880
So please tell a friend about the show and would really appreciate that.

03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:31.880
It does go a long way. A nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher radio

03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:34.880
or wherever it is that you heard about this show goes a long way as well.

03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:39.880
Uh, by the way, with iOS eight, uh, podcast is now a mandatory app again on there.

03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:43.880
So, uh, more everybody, everybody who's using an iPhone or whatever has a

03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:46.880
podcast app now. So just tell them to put orange launch radio in the search,

03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:51.880
uh, and they can find it. Um, the other thing I just want to say real quick

03:02:51.880 --> 03:02:55.880
for my personal final thought is that I'm going to be undertaking a project on

03:02:55.880 --> 03:02:58.880
my Twitch channel, which I know everybody's live streaming these days,

03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:01.880
but I'm hoping you'll take a minute to check out what I'm doing. Um,

03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:06.880
I am going to play final fantasy four. I'm going to challenge my gamer a D D

03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:08.880
and I don't know if I'll be successful or not,

03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:13.880
but my goal is to stream the entire thing. Start to finish.

03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:17.880
Not all in one sitting people, but I'm talking about when I stream games,

03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:21.880
I'm only going to stream from SC4 for the next couple of weeks until I play

03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:24.880
start to finish. That's my goal. I don't know if I'll do it.

03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:26.880
So I'm going to need a lot of encouragement if you guys even like it.

03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:28.880
But if you guys think it's stupid and you're like, no,

03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:31.880
go back to hardcore Diablo or whatever, then I'll do that too. So it's,

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:35.880
we'll see. So, all right, that's going to do it for another week here at orange

03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:38.880
launch radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.

03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:40.880
I really appreciate the support. We'll be back.

03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:42.880
Dark soccer ought to be back next week.

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:45.880
We'll catch up with her and more gaming news.

03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:49.880
Of course, next week on orange lounge radio. Have a great week, everybody.

03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:53.880
Uh, thanks to Mike from Jackbox games for being here tonight.

03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:56.880
Really appreciate it. And thanks to all you who tuned into the show,

03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:59.880
be it live or on the podcast feed. We couldn't do it without you.

03:03:59.880 --> 03:04:00.880
Have a great week.

03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:28.880
They were all still true.

03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:32.880
See you next week.

03:04:56.880 --> 03:04:58.880
Yeah.
