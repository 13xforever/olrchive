7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week, gaming has its head in the cloud as two new players enter the scene with their own video game and media streaming services. Also tonight, we're interviewing Mike Bilder from Jackbox Games about all things Fibbage and more. Get your trivia caps on and join us for all this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 568 for September the 21st of 2014.
44000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Not here tonight unfortunately in studio, DarkSakura. She has the night off, a little bit unexpectedly slash last minute too.
58000	72000	She threw out her voice, which obviously doing a radio show needs a voice. She said she would try to pop into chat a little later on, but unfortunately we will not be having our sakura until next week. So Jamie, if you're out there listening, feel better. We miss you.
73000	76000	Joining us in studio though, we do have of course, Techmaster Loki.
76000	78000	Yes, I don't misplace my voice.
78000	89000	Sadly, you still have yours to complain about who knows what tonight. No, I'm kidding. It's fantastic to have you here. Loki, you brought the studio a present this week, I notice.
89000	90000	Yes.
90000	95000	So I'm very excited to have this little arcadey machine thingy, I guess.
95000	97000	It's a bar top main cabinet.
97000	103000	I love that. That's awesome. So I'm going to set that up in the studio somewhere and they'll be good times.
103000	104000	Yep.
104000	105000	Good times.
105000	109000	Because it hasn't been getting any use at my work, so hopefully we'll get a lot more use here.
109000	118000	We will definitely make use of it here. So folks in our chat room, again we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network.
119000	124000	vognetwork.com and Alan Alchemy in chat saying, let's play what drive-thru did Loki bring to the show.
124000	127000	Well you know we do always talk about food at the top of the show, so.
127000	134000	Well here's the thing, I didn't really want, I had to get something to eat, but I didn't really want, I wasn't that hungry, so I just stopped at McDonald's because it was on the way.
134000	138000	It was the quickest thing I could get to and it's really not that good.
138000	139000	You literally settled tonight.
140000	146000	It was like, I don't even really want to eat this, I'm just eating some of it just because I know I get hungry if I don't eat anything.
146000	150000	So that's why, because it was literally the fastest thing I could find.
150000	155000	Alright, well, so there you go, if you had McDonald's in the betting pool tonight, there you go, you win.
155000	157000	I don't know what the odds were on McDonald's, but there it is.
157000	165000	Hey, I want to introduce this fine young man to our program filling in for Dark Soccer tonight, a little bit last minute, appreciate having him here.
165000	170000	If you ever visit vognetwork.com, you've probably seen him around, he's like our number one fan and stuff.
170000	173000	Say hello everybody to Flaco Jones!
173000	175000	Wait, I can't do the show if I throw out my voice.
175000	178000	No, that sounded creepy.
178000	180000	Yeah, I know, that's scary.
180000	181000	That was very scary.
181000	182000	Like Channing Batman.
182000	184000	Harvey Fierstein meets P.T.
184000	185000	I don't know.
185000	188000	Well, it's great to have you here in studio, how have you been since the last time we saw you?
189000	196000	I've been doing pretty well. My computer at home broke, so I can't like ever guess on Hoard House anymore, so I'll just show up live for this one.
196000	206000	Well, when you live in the same town, it's an easy thing to do, and when you're the brother-in-law of a co-host of mine on another show, it makes it, you know, you know where I live and stuff.
206000	211000	Yeah, I always knew where you live. I slept on your couch one time when my house got flooded.
211000	213000	Actually, now we're making it sound a little creepy.
213000	215000	Yeah, I know where you live.
215000	217000	Wait, my voice went out again.
217000	221000	I slept on your couch once and you didn't know about it. No, anyway.
221000	222000	I asked permission.
222000	227000	And you're getting lots of highs and hellos in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
227000	232000	ActDeaf says, Flaco Jones sounds like the lady from the anti-smoking commercials.
232000	234000	That is a little bit what it sounds like there.
234000	235000	I'll take it as a compliment.
235000	236000	There you go.
236000	237000	I don't know.
237000	238000	So, hey.
238000	239000	She's famous.
240000	242000	We got a really cool interview tonight.
242000	248000	I'm excited to bring Jackbox Games onto the show tonight, which they are the creators of You Don't Know Jack,
248000	251000	which, you know, epic game show game, right?
251000	255000	And then they have this new game that's out on PlayStation 4 was this past week.
255000	259000	I believe it's also on Xbox One, was out a couple weeks ago.
259000	261000	And I believe it's also an iOS game.
261000	262000	And PS3.
262000	264000	Yeah, it's like a cross-buy thing, right?
264000	265000	We'll get all the details on that.
265000	267000	But you actually introduced me to this game.
267000	272000	In a way, it's cool that you're here tonight because you introduced me to Fibbage,
272000	276000	and now here we are interviewing the studio that made it.
276000	278000	Yeah, I think that's crazy how that worked out.
278000	282000	I watched your stream, and I saw you kind of hinted like, oh, we had a special guest.
282000	283000	Like, oh, who was it?
283000	284000	Shane?
284000	285000	I don't know.
285000	286000	Shane was the main guest.
286000	287000	Who else could it be?
287000	290000	And then you said, when I saw that they dropped in on that, I was like, that's amazing.
290000	293000	You know what's funny is that I had actually sent my email off before that.
293000	297000	But I noticed they were on Twitter, and I had been promoting the Fibbage stream.
297000	299000	And I saw that my thing was getting favorited and liked.
299000	302000	And I was like, or whatever, favorited and liked is really the same thing, isn't it?
302000	303000	Favorited and all that stuff.
303000	305000	Favorited and retweeted, yeah.
305000	308000	So I was like, oh, these guys are scouring.
308000	310000	What's the worst that happens if I send off an email?
310000	311000	What's going to happen?
311000	314000	Yeah, after we played that night, I replied to some of those tweets,
314000	317000	and then they favorited and retweeted some of my tweets.
317000	318000	I was like, that's weird.
318000	319000	I love that one.
319000	320000	Yeah, I love when that happens.
320000	323000	I've also had communication, not communication,
323000	326000	but just that same experience with when I played Unfinished Swan.
326000	328000	I played on Super Bowl Sunday like, hey, everyone's watching the big game,
328000	330000	and I'm playing Unfinished Swan.
330000	331000	It's amazing.
331000	332000	And the guy retweeted it.
332000	333000	That's awesome.
333000	334000	That's awesome.
334000	336000	How did you find out about Fibbage?
336000	338000	Because honestly, as much as I love You Don't Know Jack,
338000	340000	this was not on my radar somehow.
340000	342000	I probably found out through Shane.
342000	346000	Like Shane told me a couple weeks ago, hey, the guys that made You Don't Know Jack
346000	349000	made a new game called Fibbage, but it's only on Xbox One right now.
349000	352000	So I was like, well, I can't wait until that comes out on PS4,
352000	354000	but I thought it'd be another long thing.
354000	356000	Like, I've been waiting for Peggle 2 forever,
356000	358000	so I thought it'd be another long thing,
358000	362000	but it was only a couple weeks, I guess, and he came over on a Tuesday.
362000	364000	He's like, oh, by the way, that game I told you about is out today.
364000	365000	I'm like, I'm buying it right now.
365000	366000	So I used the app.
366000	369000	I bought it, and then we played it right then and there,
369000	373000	and Shane contacted you, you know, tried to get all the extra for her.
373000	376000	We tried to get a little game going right there, and it was good.
376000	377000	It was fun.
377000	378000	It was fun.
378000	379000	They had a couple bugs on opening night,
379000	381000	but it seems like it worked great since then.
381000	383000	Yeah, and I was just blown away by the fact that here you were
383000	386000	streaming it on Twitch TV, and I was playing the game with you,
386000	388000	and it's not even that technology Sony was talking about
388000	390000	when they first unveiled the PS4.
390000	391000	It wasn't even that.
391000	393000	It was just like I'm playing this game show,
393000	395000	and you know I love my game show games.
395000	399000	I never showed up on this show about Microsoft killing off one versus 100.
399000	402000	You know what other game you're going to be able to do that with probably?
402000	405000	That new Just Dance game that they have.
405000	406000	What?
406000	407000	What are you talking about?
407000	410000	You remember they have the Just Dance game with the cell phones?
410000	412000	No, bring me up to speed on this.
412000	413000	Yeah, they have.
413000	417000	It's a Just Dance game, and it uses cell phones.
417000	421000	It's like the controller, so I think it interacts with the TV as well.
421000	423000	Like they have something displayed on the TV,
423000	428000	but you basically log into a website just like you do I guess on Fibbage,
428000	430000	so like if you want to play over a stream.
430000	434000	I mean obviously playing a music rhythm music game over a Twitch stream
434000	440000	is not as good, but you know still it could be possible I guess.
440000	441000	Interesting, interesting.
441000	444000	So Flaco, you're a big fan of all these like game show things.
444000	447000	You have fond memories of You Don't Know Jack, which is another game.
447000	451000	Yeah, You Don't Know Jack specifically because my friend Bobby back in high school
451000	452000	was like I've got these.
452000	454000	You knew Bobby Blackwolf in high school?
454000	455000	No, different Bobby.
455000	456000	Oh, different Bobby.
456000	459000	I don't want to say his last name, but he was a really good friend of mine.
459000	463000	We'll say Bobby B. No wait, Bobby C.
463000	467000	Bobby L. is appropriate. That's close enough.
467000	471000	So yeah, he had these CD-ROM games, and he's like you got to come over
471000	473000	and just play with me, and that's where you play on the keyboard,
473000	477000	and everybody gets a key on the keyboard, and you press the button to ring in.
477000	480000	If your buddy doesn't know it, you hit S after that to screw him,
480000	481000	and we played all those things.
481000	483000	We found all those Easter eggs.
483000	486000	You know, if you type in fuck you, it says fuck you too,
486000	489000	and then it reduces your score, but like 1000 is like oh, did I say fuck you?
489000	493000	I meant fuck you, and your score reduces by like 10,000 more.
493000	496000	It's crazy. It was so much fun.
496000	501000	And then if you play on New Year's Eve or Fourth of July,
501000	504000	it has little things where Cookie will in the introductions
504000	509000	will rip you for playing on a holiday or mock you in your loneliness
509000	511000	for being antisocial on a very social holiday.
511000	512000	I remember some of that.
512000	515000	Yeah, it was great, and they still have trophies like that
515000	518000	in the last version of the Jack that was on consoles.
518000	519000	They had trophies like that.
519000	521000	Like if you play on Fourth of July, it's like,
521000	524000	oh, how unpatriotic of you is like the trophy that you get.
524000	526000	That's awesome.
526000	527000	Yeah.
527000	530000	All right, well, we will talk plenty more about you know Jack and Fibbage
530000	533000	and so forth with Mike when he comes on here in about 15 minutes.
533000	536000	So until we get to that, and by the way, you guys can, of course,
536000	539000	participate if you guys have questions and memories and all that good stuff.
539000	542000	Live.vognetwork.com, of course, is the place to be.
542000	545000	Let's talk a little bit before we get into it.
545000	547000	We always do a kickoff topic at the top of the show
547000	548000	before we get into our gaming week,
548000	550000	and this will probably carry us to the interview.
550000	553000	So we'll get to our gaming weeks about 7 o'clock tonight.
553000	555000	But let's talk about Tokyo Game Show.
555000	557000	It's obviously the big thing that everybody's talking about,
557000	562000	everybody's looking at, and we're seeing things from trickling in on the Internet.
562000	565000	And I know AkumaJP is probably there.
565000	568000	I don't even see him in chat, so he's probably recovering.
568000	570000	But what about from this side of the ocean?
570000	573000	What have you guys kind of been looking at that's been coming out of Tokyo Game Show?
573000	578000	Have you guys seen any neat trailers or things for things coming out that look exciting?
578000	582000	I'm sure, Flaco, you got into this like everybody else.
582000	585000	The PT teaser had to do something for you, right?
585000	589000	Yeah, I was about to say, I think I've mostly been focused on the Konami stuff
589000	593000	because I saw the teaser video for PT,
593000	595000	which I don't know, maybe I understood this incorrectly,
595000	599000	but I thought they said they made that before they made the playable demo,
599000	606000	and that was kind of like their video teaser or concept video that they had first.
606000	609000	And then from there, they kind of made the whole PT game demo
609000	611000	because they're pretty different, but I thought it was really cool.
611000	612000	I love the way it looked.
612000	615000	I mean, it didn't necessarily look like Silent Hill,
615000	617000	but again, I think they're just playing with things.
617000	619000	They're trying to get moods. They're trying to see what works.
619000	621000	It was more Silent Hall.
621000	624000	Yeah, yeah. Well, it's that whole aspect of it again,
624000	626000	but I think it was a little bit more like straight-up horror
626000	628000	than Silent Hill's more kind of psychological horror.
628000	630000	I mean, I love the monster going down the hallway.
630000	632000	I thought that was very well done.
632000	635000	Well, and monster design has always been something people have really dug
635000	637000	about Silent Hill, that series,
637000	640000	and we have iconic horror characters like the Red Pyramid,
640000	645000	like the nurses that carried through very well the cinema,
645000	647000	and so I think that's why it was exciting to see, like,
647000	651000	oh, the monster design in this game looks like it's going to be just as tremendous.
651000	654000	And if you haven't watched the trailer yet, keep the lights on
654000	656000	when you watch the little thing that came out of Tokyo Game Show.
656000	657000	It's short and sweet.
657000	661000	It's short, but it'll scare you, and that monster was awesome,
661000	662000	that thing that was coming out of the office.
662000	664000	Yeah, that was my favorite part.
664000	666000	I was like, that looks like Silent Hill right there.
666000	669000	I don't know, bugs, like, guys barfing up bugs and stuff like that.
669000	673000	Well, I just like how it's kind of just almost like a creepy roller coaster,
673000	675000	sort of, in a sense.
675000	678000	It's like, just stuff is just going to keep, you know,
678000	681000	ramping up as you're going through, and it's like, oh, fuck, fuck, oh, shit,
681000	683000	oh, goddamn, what the hell is that?
683000	686000	Yeah, my favorite part of Downpour, the most recent game that came out,
686000	689000	was there's a whole level where you're in this underground mine,
689000	692000	and towards the end of that, you're literally on a roller coaster.
692000	695000	You get in a mine cart, it goes up, and it does this whole experience thing.
695000	698000	You see all these creepy images and monsters coming out of the ceiling,
698000	700000	and I thought that was my favorite part of Downpour,
700000	701000	and that reminded me a lot of that.
701000	704000	And I know a lot of people don't like Downpour, but I like that element of it.
704000	708000	Not to talk about something even more ad nauseum
708000	710000	that we already discussed at great length a month ago,
710000	712000	but I know you were really into it as well.
712000	716000	What were your thoughts about that PT, the experience, the game,
716000	717000	the demo that came out originally?
717000	718000	Oh, the actual demo?
718000	719000	Yeah, because you got really into this too.
719000	721000	Yeah, I loved it. I thought it was great.
721000	724000	I mean, I think I found pretty much every little part of it,
724000	725000	every little Easter egg.
725000	729000	The last thing I found was that when the glass breaks in one room,
729000	731000	she's standing up on the balcony, and that freaked me out.
731000	733000	But yeah, no, I played it a lot.
733000	736000	I was trying to figure out how to repeatedly get killed.
736000	737000	I thought I'd got it.
737000	739000	There's so many things about that demo that freak you out,
739000	741000	because you're like, how did they do this?
741000	742000	How do you get it to repeat?
742000	743000	It just seems like there's so much.
743000	745000	It feels like it's random, but you know it's not,
745000	747000	but you can't figure out how to trigger these things.
747000	749000	And the ending was the hardest part.
749000	752000	And yeah, I think I had a pretty good method,
752000	756000	but then this other method came out with saying the name Jareth
756000	759000	when you played it, and it was just, there's so much going on.
759000	761000	I just think that's a good sign of things to come
761000	764000	that I think Kojima's really got his head in this one.
764000	765000	He's not just phoning it in.
765000	768000	I guess some people would say maybe with the Castlevania reboots he did.
768000	769000	I was worried.
769000	772000	I was like, oh, I didn't mind the first Castlevania reboot game,
772000	774000	but the second one didn't do well at all.
774000	776000	And then overall, I don't think fans liked it,
776000	779000	but this one, he really seems like he's taking charge on it,
779000	780000	and he's really taking ownership of it.
780000	783000	Well, then I don't know to what extent the role Guillermo del Toro
783000	784000	is going to play with this,
784000	786000	but if it has anything to do with the monster design,
786000	787000	that would certainly explain why it's so good.
787000	788000	That's what I'm hoping.
788000	789000	I'm hoping it's pretty much the monster design,
789000	791000	because when you watch Pan's Labyrinth,
791000	794000	that looks like a Silent Hill monster,
794000	796000	the one at the dinner table with the eyes in his hands.
796000	798000	It's pretty awesome.
798000	800000	Tigerclaw in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,
800000	803000	this isn't the first time we've seen a PT type of thing.
803000	806000	I remember years ago if you played the PC version of Portal 2,
806000	809000	it had a playable trailer that was promoting the movie Super 8.
809000	810000	That's a little bit different,
810000	812000	because that's kind of like unlocking,
812000	815000	that's more like an Easter egg, I think, among anything else.
815000	818000	But you did see Valve do a little bit of this in Steam,
818000	820000	even leading up to the release of Portal 2,
820000	822000	where I seem to remember there was a weekend,
822000	826000	or it was like they would early release Portal 2 on Steam
826000	829000	if these certain conditions in other games were satisfied.
829000	832000	And I remember Portal started leaking into these other games,
832000	835000	like AudioSurf was the one I remember I was really into,
835000	836000	because I like the music games.
836000	838000	And the device has been modified,
838000	841000	that song from Portal suddenly showed up in AudioSurf,
841000	845000	and if you beat this, you would contribute to the early release of Portal 2.
845000	846000	So they have had those,
846000	849000	I don't want to call it an AR type of experience, but it sort of is.
849000	850000	It's kind of like that.
850000	853000	It's kind of almost like a viral marketing campaign to really get the word in.
853000	854000	And they have that ability,
854000	856000	because they have all the access to those games and that stuff.
856000	859000	For PT, I think what works so well is because it was on a console,
859000	860000	and they're like,
860000	863000	oh, it's just go home and download this game and play it.
863000	865000	It's like this new game, it's a demo or whatever,
865000	867000	and then you play through it, and then you see the commercial at the end.
867000	870000	And of course, that's viral marketing in a way, too.
870000	871000	But I don't know,
871000	874000	I think just being on the home consoles is a little bit different
874000	877000	than something that's kind of like this PC integrated thing,
877000	878000	where it's easy to change things on the fly.
878000	880000	This one, they had pushed this thing out,
880000	883000	and I hope everyone will just download it and play it.
883000	886000	Well, they probably knew the rumor would get out eventually,
886000	887000	especially with it being a scary game.
887000	889000	Like you said, I think you said you thought it would take a week,
889000	890000	but people beat it in a day.
890000	892000	I don't know why he would think it would take a week.
892000	894000	Why would it ever take the internet a week to figure out?
894000	895000	I don't know.
895000	898000	Well, we still don't know how to definitively beat it.
898000	901000	It's true. It's a definitive ending, but you could beat it.
901000	902000	There you go.
902000	904000	Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vog.com.
904000	909000	It would have been even more hilarious if at the end it was Frog Fractions 2.
909000	910000	I would have still loved it.
910000	912000	We contributed to the Kickstarter.
912000	913000	All right.
913000	916000	ActDef says Guillermo del Toro seems like he's going to be a creative consultant.
916000	920000	That comes from ActDef in our chat room over at live.vog.com.
920000	922000	So, yeah, I mean, can you imagine back in the day,
922000	926000	like we used to get the demos on the discs that came with magazines for CDs, right?
926000	929000	Can you imagine if like there had been a demo on one of those discs
929000	933000	and then it was like, surprise, you just played the Final Fantasy 7 demo
933000	935000	or something, you know, like something crazy like that.
935000	936000	Yeah, yeah.
936000	937000	That's why it's so weird.
937000	939000	It's a PT thing we haven't really seen yet,
939000	941000	because usually you know what demo you're playing, right?
941000	942000	Yeah.
942000	944000	So it's kind of neat, kind of neat.
944000	946000	Quickly, I want to bring this up as well.
946000	950000	I want to talk about Final Fantasy XV.
950000	954000	Did you guys see the trailer that came out for that, the new one?
954000	958000	Not just the trailer, but there's this gameplay thing from XV that came out
958000	960000	that looks phenomenal.
960000	962000	I just saw the trailer. I didn't see the gameplay.
962000	966000	Although the trailer, I mean, a lot of people are calling it a Broad Trip Final Fantasy.
966000	969000	I mean, here's the thing, the graphics in the game look stellar,
969000	971000	which is to be expected from a Final Fantasy game,
971000	974000	but then it was like, this doesn't look like a Final Fantasy game.
974000	976000	It's like these dudes are in a car.
976000	979000	Yeah, we're driving under a Cadillac or a Buick or whatever it looks like.
982000	986000	For what it was though, it looks so cool, like
986000	989000	Grand Theft Auto, fancy you, woo!
989000	993000	Just pop out of our car, kill some monsters, get back in, look at the sunset.
994000	999000	I thought it was a cool trailer. Did it get a lot of hate or something?
999000	1001000	I saw some jokes about it. I don't know if people...
1001000	1005000	It seemed like I saw more people liking it than the gameplay trailer they had.
1005000	1006000	I didn't see.
1006000	1009000	One thing I'm seeing on Twitter is, where's the women?
1009000	1014000	Which I think Final Fantasy has brought us a lot of strong female characters,
1014000	1018000	that series, so I think that is a fair question to pose.
1018000	1020000	Are there going to be any women in this game?
1020000	1023000	There have been a couple that have been seen out there,
1023000	1028000	and I wouldn't necessarily accuse Square Enix of being incapable
1028000	1030000	of creating a Final Fantasy game with a strong female lead.
1030000	1033000	I mean, we just had three games with Lightning.
1033000	1036000	I was about to say, I think they've done their work on that.
1036000	1040000	Of course I want to see a strong female in this game.
1040000	1043000	Or Final Fantasy, was it X-2?
1043000	1045000	X even kind of had a...
1045000	1048000	Right, who doesn't love Lulu, right? From X and all that.
1048000	1051000	So I'm not worried about, can Square do it?
1051000	1053000	It certainly was just one of those things where I was like,
1053000	1059000	okay, this is definitely noticeable that it's a sausage fest, this game, so far.
1059000	1063000	But I think we also have to remember what we might be seeing in that trailer
1063000	1067000	is one particular chapter, or one particular component
1067000	1068000	of what's probably a much larger game.
1068000	1071000	If you go back and you look at the original teaser,
1071000	1074000	when they announced it at E3, there were all these different sequences
1074000	1076000	and other characters, like there was a child character,
1076000	1078000	there was a female that was seen for a little bit.
1078000	1082000	So I think what we saw was one piece of what's probably going to be
1082000	1083000	a much larger picture, right?
1083000	1085000	So, that's my thought.
1085000	1088000	Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1088000	1089000	We've got Fifth Dream who says,
1089000	1091000	OMG, I love Lulu.
1091000	1095000	And Dungeon Buster says, Lulu was my clutch artillery mage.
1095000	1098000	Any other Tokyo game show things you guys caught a glimpse of
1098000	1100000	or anything you want to talk about before we move on here?
1100000	1102000	Earth Defense Force 4.1.
1102000	1104000	Oh yeah? What did they say about that?
1104000	1108000	Well, it's just basically they're porting it to PlayStation 4
1108000	1109000	and they're adding some stuff to it.
1109000	1112000	So one of the new things that they have is this giant mech
1112000	1115000	versus this giant kaiju type thing,
1115000	1117000	which I don't know if it's really anything new.
1117000	1121000	I mean, the mech thing's new, but the giant monsters,
1121000	1123000	they've had giant monsters in the game before.
1123000	1125000	So I'm interested.
1125000	1127000	Are you just excited for the experience on, you know,
1127000	1130000	I'm trying to resist saying next-gen consoles
1130000	1132000	because they've been out for a year now.
1132000	1134000	Well, it's not technically a new game
1134000	1136000	because, you know, Earth Defense Force 4 is already out.
1136000	1138000	It's just they're adding kind of stuff to it
1138000	1140000	and then they're, you know, up-resing it or whatever.
1140000	1141000	Gotcha.
1141000	1142000	And honestly, a game like that,
1142000	1144000	I don't know how that's really going to look
1144000	1146000	because it's not that complex to begin with.
1146000	1149000	Yeah, but if you're going to buy Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4.
1149000	1151000	But that's a lot. That is way different.
1151000	1154000	No, seriously, that is not even a correct comparison.
1154000	1156000	You're talking about Earth Defense Force,
1156000	1158000	which is a very basic-looking game,
1158000	1159000	and then up-resing it.
1159000	1161000	It's really not going to change the way that looks
1161000	1163000	versus Grand Theft Auto that they're redoing
1163000	1165000	like all the engine for the game.
1165000	1167000	They're redoing the whole, you know,
1167000	1168000	foliage engine in there.
1168000	1170000	They're, you know, increasing the amount of cars in there,
1170000	1173000	the lighting engines being redone.
1173000	1174000	Just all these improvements
1174000	1176000	make it look like a completely different game.
1176000	1177000	All right.
1177000	1180000	Well, I hate to take the reins
1180000	1182000	and take the car a different direction here,
1182000	1183000	but it is that time.
1183000	1185000	We're going to start our interview here.
1185000	1188000	We're going to be talking to you tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
1188000	1192000	Mike, a builder, he's a general manager at Jackbox Games.
1192000	1196000	Jackbox Games has the brand-new game Fibbage
1196000	1200000	that's out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3,
1200000	1204000	but you probably know Jackbox Games from that game
1204000	1206000	that kind of appears in their name.
1206000	1209000	You don't know Jack, and we'll talk about those games
1209000	1211000	and who knows what else as we talk to Mike tonight.
1211000	1213000	We're going to try to get him on the phone right now,
1213000	1214000	and if you guys want to participate,
1214000	1217000	live.vognetwork.com to get your questions in for Mike.
1217000	1218000	Mike, are you there?
1218000	1220000	I'm here. You hear me okay?
1220000	1221000	Yes, we hear you just fine.
1221000	1222000	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
1222000	1224000	Excellent. Thanks for having me.
1224000	1226000	It is a pleasure to have you on,
1226000	1228000	and congratulations on the release of Fibbage.
1228000	1231000	I know it just hit PlayStation 4 this past week,
1231000	1233000	and you had it on Xbox One earlier this month, right?
1233000	1235000	Yeah, that's right.
1235000	1237000	We launched on PS3 and PS4 this week.
1237000	1241000	We were out on Xbox One about three, three and a half weeks ago,
1241000	1245000	and prior to that, we actually launched the game on Amazon Fire TV.
1245000	1246000	Oh, okay.
1246000	1247000	Very cool.
1247000	1248000	So four platforms right now.
1248000	1249000	There you go.
1249000	1252000	So we've talked about kind of our experiences with Fibbage,
1252000	1254000	but how would you describe Fibbage?
1254000	1256000	What is that game all about?
1256000	1260000	Wow. Well, it's a bluffing party game.
1260000	1262000	You know, in the same vein that you don't know Jack
1262000	1266000	is a fun experience when you have everybody together in the same room.
1266000	1268000	Fibbage is similar.
1268000	1272000	It's the most fun when you have a big party together.
1273000	1276000	It's a trivia game, but it's a bluffing game as well.
1276000	1282000	So we'll put up a question like the mayor of Rabbitash, Kentucky is blank,
1282000	1288000	and then everyone who's playing the game types in a fib or a lie on their phone,
1288000	1290000	and they're trying to fool other people,
1290000	1293000	so you get rewarded if people pick your lies,
1293000	1296000	and then we bring up everyone's lies as well as the truth,
1296000	1300000	and then at that point, you're supposed to try and find the truth,
1300000	1303000	so you'll get rewarded if you actually pick the correct answer.
1303000	1307000	But as you can imagine, it becomes pretty fun.
1307000	1309000	It can become pretty saucy.
1309000	1311000	I mean, it all depends on the audience that you're playing with.
1311000	1312000	Definitely depends on that.
1312000	1316000	What I find most hilarious is that when like two or even three people
1316000	1320000	will come up with the same saucy lie, and it's like,
1320000	1322000	oh, your mind's in the gutter too.
1322000	1324000	That's right. That's right.
1324000	1326000	And those are usually kind of spit takes.
1326000	1329000	Your beer is usually flying across the room when that happens.
1329000	1332000	Now, the control style for Fibbage I thought was really unique,
1332000	1334000	and that was definitely the first thing.
1334000	1337000	I mean, I've loved these game show type games for forever,
1337000	1339000	and I'm a big fan of You Don't Know Jack as well.
1339000	1340000	We'll talk about that later.
1340000	1342000	But what definitely grabbed me about Fibbage
1342000	1343000	was that the control style was unique,
1343000	1346000	and I don't think I've seen a game yet that uses smartphones
1346000	1348000	and tablets as a controller.
1348000	1351000	Where did you guys get this idea from?
1351000	1354000	So some people have kind of toyed around with this in the past,
1354000	1357000	but not on a main console.
1357000	1362000	So, you know, we've seen and explored methods of multiplayer games.
1362000	1365000	You know, the biggest hurdle that you have when you're playing on a console
1365000	1368000	is every controller is 50 bucks.
1368000	1370000	And especially early in the life cycle of a console,
1370000	1372000	I mean, who has more than two of those?
1372000	1374000	If you're spending four or five hundred bucks on a console,
1374000	1377000	you're not going to go out and buy four controllers right away.
1377000	1381000	So we benefited in the last generation by things like the big button controller,
1381000	1385000	and people who bought scene it, if they had four big buttons,
1385000	1387000	they could immediately go play with those.
1387000	1393000	And in this case, we wanted a way for many, many people to jump in and play the game.
1393000	1398000	And we wanted to also explore game mechanics that you couldn't do with a controller.
1398000	1401000	So in the case of Fibbage, you need privacy because you're lying.
1401000	1405000	You need a keyboard because you're entering a lie.
1405000	1407000	You know, with a console, you can't really do that.
1407000	1410000	You could bring up the on-screen keyboard, but everyone would see it.
1410000	1412000	You don't have ways to do that.
1412000	1417000	So we prototyped some stuff about a year ago and really got excited about it.
1417000	1419000	And Fibbage kind of grew out of that.
1419000	1423000	And it's our first game that utilizes mobile controllers in this way.
1423000	1426000	But we have many, many more coming.
1426000	1428000	And we're pretty excited about what's yet to come.
1428000	1432000	Now, did you know that people would take this control style
1432000	1435000	and use it to stream over Twitch TV?
1435000	1437000	Because that was the other thing that grabbed me,
1437000	1441000	that the first night I ever played Fibbage, I was playing against Flaco Jones,
1441000	1445000	and he's at his house streaming on Twitch TV and we're able to play the game together.
1445000	1450000	I mean, in a way, you beat Sony to the whole play over Twitch thing
1450000	1452000	that was supposed to be in the PS4, in a way.
1452000	1457000	Right. And we were paying close attention to Sony's tech.
1457000	1459000	And we're obviously aware of Twitch.
1459000	1463000	And all of us are gamers as well, so we watch Twitch
1463000	1466000	and we partake and participate in that kind of stuff.
1466000	1471000	We really didn't anticipate people playing Fibbage over Twitch on console
1471000	1473000	the way they're doing it.
1473000	1477000	And thankfully, we put enough of the information on the controller
1477000	1481000	that even if there's a 30-second lag or a 20-second lag
1481000	1485000	in viewing the game over a Twitch stream and playing along,
1485000	1487000	it's still totally playable.
1487000	1491000	And we're pretty excited about that and we're obviously embracing it.
1491000	1495000	And we're taking steps for future titles to embrace it even more and even better.
1495000	1500000	So we can really do these multiplayer-type experiences with many, many people.
1500000	1505000	For instance, one of the games we're working on connects with up to 100 people
1505000	1506000	in the game at a time.
1506000	1509000	And you could kind of only do that over a thing like Twitch.
1509000	1513000	I don't know that you could, even if you had online multiplayer with PlayStation or Xbox,
1513000	1517000	connect that many boxes and have that many people playing in a meaningful way.
1517000	1519000	So we're pretty excited about it.
1519000	1523000	I mean, we kind of admit that we backed into some of this with Twitch,
1523000	1525000	but we certainly love it and we love to see it.
1525000	1529000	And we're constantly refreshing the page and seeing who's streaming
1529000	1532000	and paying attention to Twitter feeds when people are posting their room codes
1532000	1534000	and jumping in on games every now and then.
1534000	1536000	And it makes for a pretty fun experience.
1536000	1538000	Do you guys jump into some of those games?
1538000	1540000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
1540000	1543000	I mean, a lot of times we'll jump in as Jackbox Games
1543000	1545000	so people will know it's us and we'll kind of,
1545000	1550000	especially if it's a larger subscription or there's many more people viewing
1550000	1552000	because then there's an active chat.
1552000	1555000	So we can answer questions and we can kind of have some fun with it.
1555000	1558000	Sometimes we'll jump in just because somebody's looking to fill up a game
1558000	1561000	and they only have seven people, so one of us will jump in
1561000	1566000	and we probably don't jump in as you don't know Jack or as Jackbox Games.
1566000	1569000	We jump in as our own names or something made up.
1569000	1571000	So yeah, we're kind of trolling around there too.
1571000	1573000	Well, now, when I was streaming on Twitch the other night,
1573000	1575000	and I don't even know if this is something you can comment on,
1575000	1577000	but I have to ask it.
1577000	1580000	I have to ask it because this is just something that just gets at me.
1580000	1584000	But when I was streaming, Jackbox Games or somebody joined my Twitch channel
1584000	1587000	and I was talking about how I really liked Fibbage
1587000	1591000	because it was filling a void that was left by the absence of 1 versus 100
1591000	1595000	on Microsoft platform, and I couldn't believe that Microsoft
1595000	1597000	still has not brought that back, but that's beside the point.
1597000	1602000	But I had heard that you don't know Jack was being considered for that spot
1602000	1604000	at one point. Is that true?
1604000	1607000	Yeah, that's true. That's actually around the time.
1607000	1611000	So I joined the company in 2008, and that was around the time
1611000	1615000	that 1 versus 100 was really starting and growing.
1615000	1619000	And we were kind of in some involved discussions with Microsoft
1619000	1623000	to be the next big multiplayer title.
1623000	1625000	I think the service was primetime at the time.
1625000	1631000	And unfortunately, that model just kind of didn't sustain.
1631000	1634000	And I know there was a rabid fan base of it,
1634000	1637000	and we obviously would have loved to have been a title on that platform.
1637000	1641000	But I know there were some challenges with sponsorships,
1641000	1647000	and it was kind of an expensive production because it was half live, half not,
1647000	1650000	and it just unfortunately didn't come together.
1650000	1657000	But we liked the idea of it, and we kind of liked the idea of many people playing together,
1657000	1661000	so we're trying to explore that with our own products going forward.
1661000	1665000	Maybe not in the same sense of primetime and kind of how that was a scheduled event,
1665000	1668000	but nowadays people schedule their own events, right?
1668000	1669000	It's true.
1669000	1673000	They have DVRs and they record TV. They don't get home from work and make sure at 7 o'clock
1673000	1675000	they can tune in to whatever they want to watch.
1675000	1677000	They watch it at their leisure because they record it.
1677000	1681000	And Twitch and things like that allow people to do the exact same thing with gaming.
1681000	1685000	Absolutely. Even though we're a live show, we have many, many more that listen on the podcast.
1685000	1689000	That's just podcasting was really how people were even able to find our own show.
1689000	1693000	So you're absolutely right. People kind of want to do things at their own convenience with that.
1693000	1696000	So, man, though, just thinking about what could have happened.
1696000	1701000	And then to know, Microsoft went and paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft, but they couldn't keep...
1701000	1703000	All right, I'm not going to get there, but I just...
1703000	1707000	Hey, listen, if Microsoft wants to come and pay $2 billion for Jackbox games, we're totally open.
1710000	1713000	I love that you just openly admit that. That's fine.
1713000	1717000	They could probably give us just $1 million for VOG Network. We'd take that.
1717000	1718000	Oh, yeah?
1718000	1720000	You don't sell yourself short.
1720000	1722000	Well, thank you. I appreciate that.
1722000	1726000	Man, it just has me thinking, though, I don't know if you personally were involved with any of this,
1726000	1730000	but I know like Berkeley Systems had published the original You Don't Know Jack.
1730000	1738000	And when I think about these game shows, you know, the granddaddy to 1 vs. 100 on Microsoft was really, to me, like Acrophobia.
1738000	1742000	And what were those other games that Berkeley did? Cosmic Consensus was that one?
1742000	1743000	Were you involved with any of that?
1743000	1748000	So that stuff predates me. I obviously played all that kind of stuff, and I was a big fan of it.
1748000	1752000	But my involvement with that in the company, that predates me.
1752000	1758000	Now, you know, obviously we have a lot of history with Berkeley and then Sierra and a number of people publishing
1758000	1764000	You Don't Know Jack on CD-ROM, and then in the console space, there was a PlayStation SKU,
1764000	1774000	and then we did a deal in 2011 when we launched on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Wii and all those platforms with a publisher as well.
1774000	1781000	But yeah, I mean, there's also, Acrophobia is one of those titles that people always ask us to make, but we don't own that IP.
1781000	1786000	So, you know, if we can get a hold of that IP, we'd be happy to make it.
1786000	1791000	And there are a lot of folks that work at Jackbox Games that have been involved with the company, you know,
1791000	1796000	since it was Jellyvision back then, and since it did the first You Don't Know Jack.
1796000	1800000	So there's a fondness in the studio as well for titles like that.
1800000	1808000	And so, you know, no doubt we could do some wordplay games like that, but if people actually want Acrophobia, the game, the brand,
1808000	1810000	we don't own it, and we would need to find a way to get it.
1810000	1813000	So we're stuck with IRC bots until then, basically.
1813000	1815000	Unfortunately, yeah.
1815000	1817000	Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.
1817000	1822000	Hey, we're going to get to your questions over at live.vognetwork.com if you have a question for Mike and Jackbox Games.
1822000	1824000	And also, I'm going to get to some other listener questions.
1824000	1826000	But there's some other questions here in studio, too.
1826000	1829000	Flaco, who introduced me to Fibid, do you have a question for Mike?
1829000	1835000	Yeah, mine's more along the lines of You Don't Know Jack and just kind of the future of these types of games.
1835000	1840000	Now that you're using the tablets and the mobile devices, would you use those in You Don't Know Jack?
1840000	1845000	And if so, could we see a return to the gibberish question?
1845000	1848000	What's that in the 2011 release?
1848000	1851000	Yeah, that's a great question.
1851000	1854000	So we moved away. I'll give you a little bit of history.
1854000	1862000	We moved away from console space after we did the deal with THQ and re-released You Don't Know Jack on all those consoles.
1862000	1868000	And we moved into self-publishing and kind of went into the social gaming space and the mobile space.
1868000	1870000	And we did a number of products in the mobile space.
1870000	1876000	We put You Don't Know Jack on Facebook and on mobile and kind of linked those together.
1876000	1878000	We certainly learned a whole lot in the process.
1878000	1881000	But one of the things is people loved the gibberish question.
1881000	1889000	So that was present in the mobile and the social game, the Facebook game, because everybody's got a keyboard or has a virtual keyboard on their phone.
1889000	1894000	So in the console space, tricky if you still want to support controllers.
1894000	1901000	So what I can tell you is we have finished a new version of You Don't Know Jack.
1901000	1904000	And it's called You Don't Know Jack 2015.
1904000	1908000	And we will have more to say on all of that next month.
1908000	1914000	So if you're a big fan of the game and the franchise, you can look for it on next-gen consoles.
1914000	1918000	And you can look for some more messaging around all of that real soon.
1918000	1925000	Awesome. I was going to say there was a tweet I caught from the Fibbage account just a couple days ago where I was like, oh, something's coming, something's coming.
1925000	1927000	So that's excellent. Good luck with that.
1927000	1932000	Yeah, I think the guys shared a segue video, a question 10 segue video.
1932000	1938000	Which in some ways are one of the best parts of the new You Don't Know Jack game. Those segues are hilarious.
1938000	1944000	My favorite one is when it's slightly different, like something changes in the segue. That was my favorite part.
1944000	1949000	Yeah, that kind of goes into the Easter egg stuff, which you guys were talking about at the beginning of your show.
1949000	1956000	That's kind of a big thing for us, either dated things or text entry things.
1956000	1964000	If you tell the host in a gibberish question or in your player name, fuck you, obviously you get some quick response from him.
1964000	1973000	If you play on certain dates, if you find the wrong answer to the game, if you play enough and you see alternates to the segue videos.
1973000	1978000	There's always little mystery things that we like to hide in You Don't Know Jack.
1978000	1984000	Awesome. I'm so looking forward to the 2015 version. What other little clever things you might have in there?
1984000	1989000	I actually have a Facebook question that's along these lines. This question is submitted from SSG100Matt on our Facebook.
1989000	1994000	What's the writing process like when you guys and gals are writing questions for You Don't Know Jack and Fibbage?
1994000	1999000	I would imagine the brainstorming sessions are hilarious.
1999000	2009000	I've worked in the games industry for quite a while, and I've got to tell you, the writers and the designers and the people that I work with in the Jackbox game.
2009000	2014000	There isn't a day that I don't laugh out loud at work, so it's pretty awesome.
2014000	2024000	We have full-time people, we have an editor. It's actually quite a big process and probably very underestimated by the people that play our game.
2024000	2036000	And other people that even work in the gaming industry. They probably completely underestimate what it takes to write and source and edit and punch up and throw out and re-record and record.
2036000	2043000	For a game like You Don't Know Jack, the majority of production, I don't want to underestimate the engineering and all the other effort that goes into it,
2043000	2048000	but there's just a small little army that has to create all that content.
2048000	2057000	And Fibbage is pretty much the same. It's slightly easier content to write, but all of it still needs to be doubly sourced and it has to go through reviews,
2057000	2064000	and they get thrown out and edited, so we only put the best stuff in there and not duplicates of things.
2064000	2073000	And then it all gets voice recorded. Cookie's on staff, and so he has to voice record all that stuff as well. So it's quite a big process.
2073000	2080000	I did not realize until I was doing some research for this week's interview and some text messages with my own announcer here, Jason, at the top of the show,
2080000	2088000	Jason was saying, did you know that Cookie is like a pseudonym for somebody that works there? And I was like, oh my gosh, I thought Cookie was a real person.
2088000	2096000	Yeah, so the founder of the company, Harry Gottlieb, his brother Tom actually works for the company as well, and so he's Cookie.
2096000	2102000	And he actually works out of his house in New York, and he's got a recording booth set up there.
2102000	2111000	And we've got some pretty great tools where we can in real time kind of communicate with all of the content of our game, and he can record directly into it.
2111000	2121000	And so it's a pretty sophisticated process, but as you know, we've been making this game for quite a while, so we've kind of got a pretty robust toolset and pretty honed pipeline at this point.
2121000	2127000	Yeah, fifth dream in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says, I've been playing You Don't Know Jack for like 15 years, maybe more.
2127000	2129000	Yep, well, that's about right.
2129000	2132000	That's about right, I remember playing it about that long ago as well.
2132000	2137000	Yeah, 95 was the first time it came out, so we're getting close to our 20th anniversary here.
2137000	2139000	Flocko, you got another question?
2139000	2142000	Yeah, yeah, does Chalky the Chipmunk work on staff too?
2144000	2146000	Somebody on Facebook asked about that too.
2146000	2148000	The voice-off does, yes.
2149000	2151000	That's awesome.
2151000	2157000	And Act Deaf says, I knew Cookie was a pseudonym, but Fibbage Funfest says Cookie is very real.
2157000	2164000	Well, Cookie was on the short-lived ABC TV show they had of You Don't Know Jack, right? Didn't they have Cookie on that?
2164000	2166000	Yeah, I think just as a voice though.
2166000	2167000	Yeah, he was the host.
2167000	2169000	But yes, he was, Tom was on the show.
2169000	2171000	Yeah, I know, Peter Herman was the host.
2171000	2175000	Let's see, going to our chatroom for another question, this is from our live chatroom at live.vognetware.com.
2175000	2181000	Act Deaf asking about some other platforms potentially for Fibbage, saying how about a Wii U version and an Android version?
2181000	2186000	Wii U version would seem like a good fit. Are you looking at any other platforms?
2186000	2191000	So we're always looking at it. The tricky thing for us is we're still a small developer,
2191000	2198000	so we kind of have to pick and choose our battles and go after where the largest network and the biggest adoption might be.
2198000	2207000	Wii U is a possibility. Android and iOS are probably more likely than Wii U,
2207000	2216000	just because of the size of the audience and the fact that we kind of migrated from console into social mobile and now back into console.
2216000	2225000	And so the way that we're developing and some of the tools and middleware and things that we're using allow us to rapidly prototype and even develop still on mobile.
2225000	2232000	So what we'll do, even the Fire TV, which is an Android-based box, we're able to run the games and make builds and bring them home
2232000	2241000	and play them with friends and family over the weekend in prototype states and just get real-world feedback on what's working and what's not and bring them back.
2241000	2247000	And so it's more likely that kind of iOS, Android-type environment than maybe the Wii platforms.
2247000	2252000	But we'll look. I mean, the other kind of stuff that we're hearing a lot of right now is when is it coming to UK?
2252000	2257000	When is it coming to Australia? And we're certainly looking at all of those as well.
2257000	2262000	Again, we're a small developer, so there are costs involved with all of that besides just getting ratings.
2262000	2268000	There's whole production and QA cycles because you have to go through submissions with all the first-party guys, again, with Microsoft, Sony, all of that.
2268000	2276000	It's not just you flip a switch and a dashboard and suddenly you release in Europe, which is kind of how it works on the iOS and Android platform.
2276000	2280000	If you just want to sell in every market, you check a box and the next thing you know, it's propagated in every market.
2280000	2287000	It's very different in the console space. So we're looking at it and if the audience is big enough and the demand is big enough, we'll do that type of thing.
2287000	2294000	But we're also small and we're also working on a whole bunch of other stuff and we want to make sure that we can get some more games and new games out as well.
2294000	2300000	So it's a tricky thing to answer. I know it's probably not the best answer people want to hear, but yes, we're looking at all that stuff.
2300000	2306000	And it's likely that we will make some moves to bring additional platforms online and some additional territories online.
2306000	2313000	I think there's a lot of people that imagine that the release thing looks like one of the scenic controllers where you just, oh, this button releases it in the UK?
2313000	2316000	Why would they push the button? Why would they do it?
2316000	2321000	You know, it's kind of that way in the mobile space. Once you make the game, you just check the boxes where you want it to go and it goes.
2321000	2324000	But not the same in the console space, no.
2324000	2328000	There you go. All right, another question from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2328000	2334000	DarkTetsuya says, what was the inspiration for Fibbage? Cards Against Humanity, maybe, speaking of minds in the gutter?
2335000	2340000	Well, we obviously love that game. And those guys are in Chicago. We know some of those guys.
2340000	2346000	So we kind of like to support that type of play. It's party play. We like that.
2346000	2349000	We like being in the same room and playing with friends and family.
2349000	2353000	We play lots of kind of games. We bring in board games and card games all the time.
2353000	2357000	We play parlor type games like Murder and things like that.
2357000	2359000	Werewolf, people know it as Werewolf.
2359000	2362000	So we're kind of always getting inspiration from that kind of stuff.
2363000	2366000	Baldur Dash is obviously some type of inspiration for Fibbage.
2366000	2368000	Just the idea of bluffing.
2368000	2371000	And again, it kind of came out of doing a bunch of prototypes.
2371000	2373000	So we do these internal RFPs.
2373000	2377000	So if you're ever working with a publisher, they may say,
2377000	2383000	we've got an RFP request for proposal for a family game and it's trying to go after this demographic and here's how we want it to work.
2383000	2386000	And they put it out to bid with all different kinds of studios.
2386000	2391000	And if you have time and effort and you're interested, you put a proposal back to them and maybe you'll be lucky enough to get the gig.
2391000	2394000	Well, we do that internally. So we do internal RFPs.
2394000	2397000	And we do these every couple months.
2397000	2402000	And we'll kind of look at the marketplace or we'll look at our product portfolio and try to round out where we want to go with things.
2402000	2405000	And Fibbage is one of the prototypes that kind of came out of that process.
2405000	2409000	So we break up the studio into small groups of a couple people.
2409000	2410000	We do it over a week or two.
2410000	2416000	And they spend a good amount of time kind of prototyping, rapidly prototyping games.
2416000	2418000	And then we present them internally to each other.
2418000	2420000	And other people critique them.
2420000	2426000	And then we kind of slice them on different verticals of if we think it's unique, if we think it'll sell, if we think, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2426000	2430000	And ultimately, Fibbage just came out of a really fun demo of a bluffing game.
2430000	2439000	And then when we kind of extrapolated that into the mobile space's controller, which is obviously how it had to be if we were going to allow keyboard entry and whatnot,
2439000	2444000	you know, then it turned into, well, what other unique ways can we use the controller?
2444000	2452000	Besides it just acting as a joystick alternative or as an alternative to a big buzzer or a big button, what else could you do with it?
2452000	2458000	And so some of our newer games that we're working on will work in a similar manner to Fibbage.
2458000	2462000	But others will use a touch screen in a unique way as well.
2462000	2464000	So we're pretty excited about that.
2464000	2467000	Awesome. Now we're running out of time here.
2467000	2468000	I got to start to wrap things up.
2468000	2476000	But I need to make sure you heard this tweet, because we got a tweet when we announced you as a guest from our pal, Peter Uno, who's actually overseas in the UK.
2476000	2481000	You were talking a little bit ago about the international releases and Peter Uno says, top guest, top company.
2481000	2486000	I'm a very firm believer in the Jack principles. Great for educational interactives.
2486000	2492000	I say this because the site I work for is famous for our educational interactives, which were influenced strongly by you don't know Jack.
2492000	2497000	So so even if if even if the game can't release over there, you're still influencing people over there.
2497000	2500000	That's awesome. Great to hear. That's great.
2500000	2506000	Before I let you go, I always like to ask our guests that come on the show, what types of video games are you playing right now?
2506000	2510000	And you can't name the you can't name the stuff your own company's making.
2510000	2511000	What are the types of video games you play?
2511000	2514000	I can't because those are great.
2514000	2515000	They are great. They are great.
2515000	2518000	I bring them home every weekend and we play them.
2518000	2521000	We we we plug those for you, though, Mike.
2521000	2524000	I don't. What do you plan?
2524000	2527000	I have I have a 10 year old and I have an eight year old.
2527000	2533000	So we play a lot of Minecraft, Minecraft, Disney, Infinity, Skylanders.
2533000	2537000	Those are kind of the go to games when I'm playing with my kids.
2537000	2541000	My own affinity is in the arcade space.
2541000	2545000	So I play I've got some coin apps in my house. I play those quite a bit.
2545000	2551000	And when I get time, I get about five percent through every major game.
2551000	2560000	So I've got every major released game on last gen and a number of the good ones on current gen, although I don't have destiny yet.
2560000	2565000	And I managed to play through five percent of them before I have time to switch to the next one.
2565000	2568000	So one of these days I'll be able to sit through, start to finish.
2568000	2572000	But I feel like that hasn't happened in quite a while because I have kids.
2572000	2575000	Mike, I sympathize with you and I don't even have the excuse that I have kids.
2575000	2578000	I just we call it here at OLR Gamer ADD.
2578000	2582000	You got to play everything. You got to know what's out there.
2582000	2587000	Some of them you wish you could play through entirely, but then something new comes out and that's just how it works.
2587000	2593000	Exactly right. Well, Mike, I do want to give us an ample opportunity to plug Fibbage here.
2593000	2599000	Everybody, Fibbage is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Amazon Fire, Xbox One.
2599000	2603000	Where can they find more information online or on Twitter and all that, Mike?
2603000	2610000	Well, you can follow us, JackBoxGames, on Twitter. There's also a Fibbage handle on Twitter as well.
2610000	2613000	You can go to our website, JackBoxGames.com.
2613000	2615000	And then we're also pretty active on Facebook as well.
2615000	2619000	But you can find everything out about our games and what we're working on.
2619000	2631000	We do have a blog on our website and we're hoping in the next week or two to start doing some Twitch streaming slash kind of video podcasting on Fridays.
2631000	2637000	And we may actually start teasing, since Twitch is such a great vehicle for people joining games and playing our games,
2637000	2643000	we may start teasing a couple of our new games and letting other people join in and play them.
2643000	2646000	So keep your eye out for that over the next couple of weeks.
2646000	2652000	That's quite the little tease there. You honestly could probably show us some of those brainstorming sessions and get a lot of viewers for that too, though.
2652000	2657000	Yeah, or prototypes. We have a lot of prototypes that are great and we have a lot of prototypes that just didn't cut it.
2657000	2661000	And I feel like those would be even fun to show to just laugh at some of them.
2661000	2665000	Oh, I bet, except the creative funny guys. You're going to get all those people to come in and say,
2665000	2667000	Why didn't you release that?
2667000	2668000	Right, exactly.
2668000	2669000	So be prepared for that.
2669000	2673000	Or maybe we'll get some grassroots Kickstarters going so we can release them.
2673000	2675000	All right, you never know. You never know.
2675000	2681000	Mike Bilder, General Manager at JackBoxGames, thank you so much for taking the time out of your Sunday night to come here on Orange Launch Radio Live.
2682000	2689000	Best of luck to you with the continued rollout of Fibbage and You Don't Know Jack 2015 and whatever else you guys have in the future.
2689000	2692000	Well, thank you guys very much. Thanks for having me and thanks for all the support.
2692000	2694000	You're welcome very much. Anytime. Take care.
2694000	2695000	All right, you too. Bye-bye.
2695000	2701000	Bye-bye. Mike Bilder with JackBoxGames, everybody. So great to have him on the show. What did you guys think of that?
2701000	2705000	See, that's the problem. If you put those prototypes out there, then that...
2705000	2708000	See, do you want Goat Simulator? Because that's how you get Goat Simulator.
2708000	2710000	I thought Goat Simulator was awesome.
2710000	2720000	It was awesome, yes, exactly. But, I mean, it's like if you really want to work towards a specific thing, you're going to be making Goat Simulator because people are going to like the stupidest thing that you have.
2720000	2723000	And that's great, though, because it sells.
2723000	2731000	All right. Flaco, as a fan of what they've done since they were Jellyvision and all that stuff, what did you think of that? Good stuff, huh?
2731000	2738000	I thought it was a great interview. I was really excited to hear a lot of that stuff. I was like, yes, I can't wait to play You Don't Know Jack next year.
2738000	2743000	I'm a little curious to see what that game he's talking about, or teasing the 100 players.
2743000	2752000	Yeah, when he said that, my mind went to like, wait a minute, I was just about to ask a question about 1 versus 100. Are you telling me you're going to take this on your own terms? I don't know.
2752000	2754000	You could see Rob light up.
2754000	2757000	Yeah, you could see me here in studio. I was like, what did he say?
2757000	2764000	So, all right, anyway, big thanks to them for coming on, and I actually wasn't expecting to get them on here as fast as we did.
2764000	2768000	I thought, oh, I'll schedule something in October, but no, they were like, oh, sure, I'll come in on Sunday.
2768000	2773000	So, big thanks to them for being flexible and answering your questions, and we wish them the best of luck.
2773000	2778000	That's always great to see such a small studio who makes those big landmark games do so well.
2778000	2789000	All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on with, let's get into our gaming weeks. I told you about 7 o'clock we'd finally get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.
2789000	2798000	And then we'll get into some gaming news, more stuff from Tokyo Game Show, and of course, later in the show, your emails and live phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2799000	2805000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, salad.
2805000	2807000	First, our gaming weeks. Loki, what do you even up to?
2807000	2818000	I didn't play any games, per se. I did redeem a ton of Steam codes, though, because, one, I purchased a Humbundle 12, because, you know, I didn't have enough games in my backlog.
2818000	2823000	But they had some games that I kind of wanted, so I just figured out what the hell, I'll go ahead and buy that.
2823000	2830000	But with that, though, Humble Bundle has, in your library, it now has a section of unredeemed Steam codes.
2830000	2836000	And I was like, holy crap, I haven't redeemed half of these? There's like Humble Bundle 9 on there?
2836000	2840000	I'm like, did I just not, I bought this and just didn't do anything with it?
2840000	2847000	So, I went in and redeemed a bunch of my stuff and redeemed all my Origin codes that I had that had been sent there from the Humble Origin thing back when.
2847000	2849000	I was like, I'm never going to download Origin.
2849000	2862000	So, I did all that, and then also redeemed my early access for Road Redemption, so I'm going to try to play some stuff this week.
2863000	2871000	I installed Road Redemption, I installed Race of Sun and Earth Defense Force, because I was starting that a little bit.
2871000	2881000	So, I'll try to play something. In fact, I just helped someone get on our Minecraft server, and that kind of reminded me, I was like, crap, I should really go dust that thing off.
2881000	2884000	You know, it needs a little work.
2884000	2891000	I've been dabbling in the Minecraft again, thanks to the PlayStation 4 release, so I could be talked into coming on the PC version and having a little fun with there.
2891000	2903000	What I was working on before I stopped working on it was adding weapons to the game, like guns and stuff, so we'll see.
2903000	2909000	I'm kind of curious to see what their official modding, when they do add that official modding support, what that's going to do.
2909000	2924000	They really do need, I mean, Java's cool and all, but they really do need a better client, something that actually utilizes your GPUs and stuff, because that would really help speed that game up and be able to do some cool stuff with it.
2924000	2932000	Alright, well, I know you haven't been playing a lot lately, because you are writing your own game, and best of luck with that.
2932000	2947000	I'm just about back to where I was before I decided to rewrite everything again, so I just finished testing, or I should say my son was testing, because he was playing with it, testing the object editor stuff.
2947000	2958000	So now I've got it to delete and rotate and change color correctly for one of the primitives, and now I just need to add the code to add to the rest of them.
2958000	2966000	That should be pretty quick. And then I've got to build on top of that to be able to do levels and stuff.
2966000	2976000	So once I finish that, then I'm going to start finishing the actual game code for the actual gameplay and stuff, and then I have to make some actual assets for it.
2976000	2981000	TalkingMinecraft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Good2Know says,
2981000	2986000	I tried so hard to like console Minecraft, but I had been too spoiled by the PC version.
2986000	2995000	You know, I can sympathize with that, because obviously the PC version is the modding and all that, which makes it fun, but I love the simplified crafting interface that's on the console version.
2995000	3002000	That's a big selling point for me, because I'm not really super into the, like, I like just the menu, and do you have the items in your inventory, yes, do it.
3002000	3006000	That takes one of the, for me, boring parts out of the game.
3006000	3017000	I 100% agree on that, and if they had a way to plug that into Minecraft, well, you know, they do have different interfaces you can get, but it's all client-side stuff, so.
3017000	3024000	But they had that, because I play with the, I always play with the controller, even on the PC version, and a lot of people don't play that way.
3024000	3032000	And before we get to Flaco's week, BlackWolf asks Loki, how many weeks before Loki quits the gaming industry because social media is too suffocating?
3033000	3035000	Never, because it's stupid.
3035000	3041000	Well, if some of the other crap in this show's history hasn't broken you, I don't think that little game's gonna...
3041000	3053000	There is so much. And here's the thing, though, I don't know if it's just because I'm, it's like, almost like a soap opera or something, but I am watching all that gamergate stuff and reading everything about that, and both sides.
3053000	3059000	It's just a big ol' fuckin' mess right now, and we're not even gonna get into it, but it's a big ol' fuckin' mess.
3059000	3073000	And be glad that we're indie, and we don't have to, you know, the only secret club we have is when we sometimes spoil, you know, stuff that we shouldn't be saying about certain games and stuff, but that's...
3074000	3084000	I would consider it a privilege to be considered part of the gaming illuminati, like when that, or as I've been calling it, the galluminati, because you take the gaming and illuminati and throw it together.
3084000	3096000	I would've taken it as a privilege to have my picture on one of those, like, don't believe this person, I would've been like, wow, somebody thinks I'm important enough to be in the know on that stuff, that's awesome.
3096000	3103000	Yeah, but I, none of us are, unfortunately we're just people that, you know, we just do a podcast, and...
3103000	3122000	Every, look, all I'm saying is that, and I have said in the past, I don't really want to get into it, but I'm kind of side skirting it is what I'm doing, because what I'm saying is that all this crap everybody's talking about, there's corruption, and it's a clique, and all this stuff, like, we told you that, like, eight years ago.
3122000	3139000	I will never forget one of these events that, Loki, you and I went to, and you could just, man, how we got, we got NDA'd out of being able to announce things before the big sites, because we signed an NDA, and these other websites didn't have to, like, they got to each announce their own little thing, right, remember that?
3139000	3143000	And just like, you know, because all these guys go to all these different shows, they all know each other.
3143000	3145000	Yeah, it was the first Konami event we went to.
3145000	3146000	And we were getting...
3146000	3149000	Yes, I'm calling you out, Konami. It was your Konami event.
3149000	3154000	The reason, the reason why I, is because they're all like that.
3154000	3155000	Oh, yes.
3155000	3156000	They're all like that.
3156000	3160000	I'm not singling out Konami here, I'm sure that everybody does that, and probably some to a worse extent.
3160000	3166000	But then, like, you know, you and I were getting all those stares from people, like, who the hell are these guys? Like, I was just like, oh my god.
3166000	3174000	So anyway, I'm just telling, that stuff's existed forever. I don't know why just now y'all are finally like, oh hey, go ahead.
3174000	3177000	I have no problem with them being friends with each other.
3177000	3178000	Yeah.
3178000	3191000	That's fine, it's, but when you go on like a private forum and start like, you know, plotting, you know, here, oh, this is going on, how are we going to communicate this to, how are we going to, you know, send the message out about this.
3191000	3203000	That's a little weird, unless, I mean, if it was like, say, oh, this developer has cancer and you want to raise funds for them or something like that, that's something.
3203000	3208000	But it, I don't know, it wasn't the case here, and it's just, it's still weird, I guess.
3208000	3222000	And then, then, then the problem here is too, that the message of that corruption gets muddled with all these people that are there, and I'm using my quotey fingers for the lulz, to just, just be awful to other people.
3222000	3229000	And you know I don't, I don't stand for that shit. Like, don't, don't be a dick. We always say that here on OLR, if you're going to be playing games online, don't be a dick.
3229000	3240000	That includes Twitter, that includes, let people have their opinions. You can think they are wrong, wrongo, wrongy, wrong, wrongerson, but they're entitled to that opinion and human decency.
3240000	3258000	To boil it down, it's like this, okay, yeah, there's some corruption in game journalism, yeah, there's some people out there that are gamers that are also misogynistic, but don't lump everybody into that because not all gamers are misogynistic, not all press, you know, gaming press are corrupt.
3258000	3269000	And so that's the problem, is you have people making these over generalizations, and shame on these websites for even making those broad generalizations come on. I mean, it's ridiculous.
3269000	3279000	And it only makes you look bad. And on top of that, you know, these people on both sides that are doxing people or swatting people, that's ridiculous.
3279000	3281000	That's what I'm talking about. With the whole being a dick stuff. Stop it.
3281000	3285000	That is absolutely ridiculous. They should not be doing that at all to anybody.
3285000	3287000	We went way further down that rabbit hole than we intended to.
3287000	3297000	But there's people, there's people that are rabid fans of these, you know, celebrities or whatever, and they will literally do whatever because they think it's going to gain them some favor with them.
3297000	3309000	And so, yeah, there are crazy people. And this kind of goes back to Xbox Live, honestly, because Xbox Live is full of, you know, young anonymous people that, you know, they're immature and they act immature.
3310000	3314000	And because they're anonymous, they think they can get away with it. And so you have these people doing the same shit online.
3314000	3322000	So, yeah, of course you're going to run into these misogynistic dicks and stuff, but it's just, it's the internet, goddammit!
3322000	3330000	They're everywhere! In every hobby that you're, I bet you there is a fucking Bobby Flay forum with some misogynist dicks in there, okay?
3330000	3340000	Or there's like, you know, or some forum dedicated to like Hello Kitty that has misogynistic dicks in it. I mean, it's seriously, it doesn't matter. It's the goddamn internet.
3340000	3345000	That's all right. It's the internet. It's full of misogynistic dicks and nice people.
3345000	3353000	Demix in our chair. I hope I said that right. Demix in our chair over at live.voguenetwork.com said, just some kids who watch too many episodes of Boardwalk Empire. Yeah, maybe a little.
3353000	3359000	All right, look, we're moving on. Loki, I gotta, I gotta keep the show going. It's already an hour in. We're not even to a headline yet.
3359000	3361000	So Flaco, how was your gaming week?
3361000	3375000	Mine was pretty good. I played a lot of games this week. On mobile, I was playing Plants vs. Zombies 2 and I've kind of stopped on that and gone back to another game that I had given up on, but I'm back to again, which is Marvel Puzzle Quest.
3375000	3381000	So I've been playing that and I'm doing pretty well on it. I just checked and I'm like number one in this current tournament.
3381000	3389000	I've been a very bad boy at Marvel Puzzle Quest. I was, I was playing it hardcore for like three weeks and then it was like the 5% thing that Mike was talking about.
3389000	3391000	Yeah, yeah. It was something shiny, something else to play.
3391000	3395000	And you really have to play that game to get, to really like excel at it.
3395000	3397000	It's fun. I mean, it's really fun.
3397000	3401000	It's Puzzle Quest, which was a great series. It's basically Puzzle Quest, so.
3401000	3407000	I was really turned off by one of the recent patches, but I've gotten used to the changes they made and they made a couple of fixes to the changes.
3407000	3415000	It's just that they put the changes out right around Comic-Con because they had a panel there and they kind of changed how a lot of the game works and I got burned by it.
3415000	3418000	But I still logged in every day and at least did one game to help out my alliance.
3418000	3420000	Aww, that's more than I did.
3420000	3423000	Because if you just play, everybody gets a little reward.
3423000	3424000	Gets a little bit.
3424000	3431000	I did that. So that's it for my mobile stuff. Oh, I just beat Infamous Second Son finally, which I got for my birthday in June.
3431000	3433000	So I finished that. That was really fun.
3433000	3435000	Did you touch the DLC at all yet?
3435000	3439000	Uh, no. The one that came with it, yeah, but not the one that just got released.
3439000	3444000	There was like a little bonus one that kind of tied back to the previous games, Cole's Legacy.
3444000	3450000	I played through that, but that's like interwoven in the game. I think the DLC is standalone, the new one.
3450000	3455000	Yeah, which is cool because they did that before with their Halloween DLC for Infamous 2.
3455000	3458000	I really like that. So I'm definitely going to get it.
3458000	3463000	But I'm also thinking about playing the game again, playing Evil. I played good. I always play good.
3463000	3466000	But I've always rented Infamous games before. I never actually owned one.
3466000	3471000	So now that I own it, I'm like, well, I guess I could play it again. I don't have to send it back to gameplay or anything this time.
3471000	3474000	And let's see, outside of that, what else did I play?
3474000	3477000	Oh, Velocity 2X. That's a really fun game.
3477000	3482000	That's one of the free games that came out at the beginning of this month for PlayStation Plus.
3482000	3484000	Oh, right, right. I haven't checked that out.
3484000	3492000	It's really awesome. I'm not usually into those kind of games, but it's got the spaceship levels, and it's got these levels where you go and you fight on the ground.
3492000	3498000	And I'm like, these guys must have really liked Guardian Legend or something because they're kind of making their own little indie spin on that.
3498000	3501000	Oh, now you just made my eyes light up like, ooh, I'm missing something.
3501000	3509000	You fight a ship, you shoot stuff up, and then every once in a while you have to dock, and they're 2D side-scroller levels.
3509000	3513000	And you have pretty much the same powers as your spaceship, which is pretty cool.
3513000	3516000	So you do teleporting, you can shoot things, you run around.
3516000	3523000	And the whole object through doing that is usually to open up these gates, and you have to shoot the gates in different orders all the time.
3523000	3525000	So maybe gates one and three are outside.
3525000	3530000	Well, that means you have to go dock the ship after you blow up gate number one, or lock number one, whatever you call it.
3530000	3535000	And then go inside the dock, and then on foot you find lock number two, you blow that one up.
3535000	3540000	And then you go back outside, you blow up lock number three, and then the shield is down, and you can go rescue survivors and stuff.
3540000	3545000	And it's got a really cool story that's worked in it, and I don't think I actually played the first Lost game.
3545000	3547000	I watched my nephew play it, and I was like, oh, that looks okay.
3547000	3552000	But it's just the ship stuff. They added all this other stuff to it now, and it's a really cool game.
3552000	3554000	And I think it got really great reviews too.
3554000	3555000	Check that out.
3555000	3557000	It's definitely worth checking out, and the music's fantastic as well.
3557000	3558000	Is it?
3559000	3562000	Because if somebody made a next-gen Guardian Legend, I am here for that.
3562000	3568000	It's an indie game, so it's not quite that, but I can tell these guys are definitely like, they like that game.
3568000	3569000	They're inspired.
3569000	3571000	Okay, good enough for me.
3571000	3576000	And it's got a female protagonist, she's really good, and it's a well-written game. I like it a lot.
3576000	3578000	Anything else for you, Mike?
3578000	3579000	I think that's it.
3579000	3584000	Mike Emu Week I'll talk about quickly, besides some of the stuff we talked about earlier in the show with the fibbage and so forth,
3584000	3587000	which certainly that was a couple of my nights right there on that.
3587000	3593000	But I've been playing some other things as well, including continuing on Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny and Diablo.
3593000	3596000	Yes, I'm playing all those games with some frequency.
3596000	3599000	Not a lot of Destiny, actually. That kind of died down.
3599000	3602000	I'm only level 13 in Destiny. I don't really have anything against it.
3602000	3605000	It's just trying to juggle all this other stuff I want to play, right?
3605000	3608000	Including the one that's been taking up most of my time this week.
3608000	3610000	New on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
3610000	3617000	Theatrythm. Final Fantasy Theatrythm Curtain Call came out this week, which of course is the music game from Square Enix
3617000	3620000	that incorporates all of the different music in the Final Fantasy series.
3620000	3626000	It is the second Theatrythm game to come out that basically completely eliminates the need to ever have the first game,
3626000	3632000	because the second game is just the first game. It's literally everything that was in the first game and more.
3632000	3637000	And now you can play online against people, and now you've got this quest mode instead of a tower mode,
3637000	3643000	and a different DLC, and more 14, and side games like Mystic Quest, and Tactics,
3643000	3646000	and games that you weren't sure if Square was going to bring up again.
3646000	3650000	So I really enjoy Theatrythm Curtain Call.
3650000	3656000	Looking back on my original review of Theatrythm, some of the things that I had called the game out for,
3656000	3660000	for being a little bit weak on, I think they've improved definitely in some areas.
3660000	3665000	Especially the song list, with it being so vast, feels a lot stronger.
3665000	3668000	There's just so much more that you can kind of get into and play in the song list.
3668000	3675000	And I love now that you can do the online battles, even if it's maybe not completely in balance.
3675000	3680000	I still feel like I could play against friends and still have a pretty decent good time with that.
3680000	3683000	I love that there's all these unlockable characters.
3683000	3688000	There's a lot of micromanagement type of things in the game, which it can almost be overwhelming.
3688000	3692000	These characters have good spirit, and spirit will get you through the field stages,
3692000	3697000	and you have these stats that can boost spirit, but then you'll lose something in this stat.
3697000	3703000	So I can see where min-maxers are going to have a field day, customizing their characters in Theatrythm.
3703000	3708000	But at its core, the music game itself, I mean, again, there's so many songs in the game
3708000	3711000	that I don't feel the repetition of playing the same stuff over and over.
3711000	3714000	And in the quest mode, some of these quests are very long,
3714000	3720000	and I find it a good way to play shuffle songs that maybe I wouldn't think to choose otherwise.
3720000	3725000	And I did a long quest the other night, 23 stages.
3725000	3727000	Luckily, I didn't have to do it all in one sitting.
3727000	3731000	But I mean, if you think about it, at two minutes a song, that's a good, like, hour's worth of gameplay right there.
3731000	3733000	So, yeah, there you go.
3733000	3735000	FOM has the Theatrythm.
3735000	3741000	If you are a fan of music games or Final Fantasy, you're going to have a lot to like here.
3741000	3747000	You probably already have it, honestly, if that sounds like it's up your alley or it's on order or something.
3747000	3751000	So that's where I've been spending most of my week is Theatrythm curtain call.
3751000	3753000	So, all right.
3753000	3757000	Let's move on to some quick housekeeping, and then we'll get into the news tonight.
3757000	3761000	Don't forget, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3761000	3765000	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus,
3765000	3770000	google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio and YouTube.
3770000	3774000	We are also on YouTube, username Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.
3774000	3780000	And you can check out previous episodes of our show there because, you know, YouTube is on everything,
3780000	3782000	every smartphone, every DS and so forth.
3782000	3786000	So we like to put our archives up there on YouTube as well.
3786000	3790000	There will not be a live show October 19th.
3790000	3792000	We will not be here live.
3792000	3794000	Again, that's October 19th.
3794000	3800000	I will be in Las Vegas for, speaking of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Fan Fest is going on in Vegas.
3800000	3807000	I'm going to be there representing O-L-R and VoG, and I really honestly have no idea what to expect.
3807000	3811000	I'm also going to BlizzCon this year, and I have a pretty good idea what to expect at BlizzCon.
3811000	3815000	But Final Fantasy Fan Fest, it might be the most fun I've ever had in my life.
3815000	3818000	It might be the biggest hot mess I've ever experienced.
3818000	3821000	I don't know, but we'll find out that weekend in October.
3821000	3826000	Trying to work it out with Loki and Dark Sakura so we can tape a show in advance that week,
3826000	3830000	as we, you know, with that in October and BlizzCon in early November,
3830000	3835000	we don't want to have too many weeks where we're not giving you Monday podcast listeners
3835000	3838000	and Sunday Night Live listeners something to listen to.
3838000	3842000	But I do want to warn you, for those of you that make it a point to be here live every Sunday,
3842000	3846000	we will not be here live Sunday the 19th.
3846000	3849000	Alright, let's move into some news.
3849000	3852000	We've got a lot of news to get into, so let's get started. Loki.
3852000	3856000	Alright, so this is kind of neat.
3856000	3861000	We've been hearing that, more I think on the Microsoft side than anything,
3861000	3865000	that they're going to be trying to create some sort of internet TV.
3865000	3870000	I think that was the kind of thought when they were doing the whole Xbox Entertainment stuff,
3870000	3872000	is that they were trying to go that route.
3872000	3876000	But now, the news is coming out that Sony, apparently the games division,
3876000	3881000	is set to launch some sort of internet TV by the end of this year.
3881000	3890000	And I guess they're saying the Wall Street Journal's basically launching some sort of internet television service,
3890000	3893000	which I'm all down for, especially if it's tied into the PlayStation Plus,
3893000	3896000	because in that way I don't have to pay for cable or something like that.
3896000	3902000	And also will work to stream to other mobile devices other than Sony's own, I guess, the Vita.
3902000	3909000	And I'm assuming any other stuff that's compatible with the remote play stuff.
3910000	3918000	And that's kind of it. They didn't really say what content's going to be on there,
3918000	3920000	if it's going to be just, you know...
3920000	3925000	Granted, Sony does have their own television and movie studio.
3925000	3928000	The thing they talked way too much about at E3.
3928000	3929000	The...
3929000	3930000	Powers?
3930000	3931000	Yeah.
3931000	3933000	That's got to be part of this, right?
3933000	3935000	Yeah, I would imagine that's part of it as well.
3935000	3937000	But just kind of what else is on there.
3938000	3940000	Are they doing more seasons of The Tester?
3940000	3942000	I mean, I don't know.
3942000	3945000	I think that might be done. I think that might be done, finally.
3945000	3951000	But I don't know. I think that's cool if they're going to be doing some original content and stuff on there.
3951000	3953000	Check it out.
3953000	3958000	To me it seems like about as appealing as even any of the Netflix original shows or something like that.
3958000	3960000	If it's that quality, that'd be pretty cool.
3960000	3964000	And as much as we poke fun at The Tester and all that, it wasn't awful.
3964000	3966000	It wasn't as bad as you might think.
3966000	3970000	I mean, it was clearly low budget, but it was decent enough.
3970000	3975000	With all the eSports competitions and things that go on in the world,
3975000	3981000	maybe Sony could put together something kind of neat for not too expensive to put out there that people would really want to watch.
3982000	3984000	I'd be down with that.
3984000	3987000	Yeah, it'd be nice if some of these companies...
3987000	3989000	The thought is that...
3989000	3995000	I heard that HBO was thinking of going basically direct to consumer instead of going through cable and stuff.
3995000	4001000	They're just going to start selling their content to consumers and just cut out the middleman.
4001000	4009000	So it would be interesting if other stations would do that, although a lot of them are tied with some of these cable companies.
4009000	4015000	I love this comment in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com from fibbagefunfest,
4015000	4016000	who says,
4016000	4020000	Twenty-four hour network of CAS saying Ridge Racer on an endless loop.
4020000	4021000	Why not?
4021000	4024000	I believe you'll probably find that on YouTube already.
4024000	4033000	That would be sandwiched in between the giant enemy crab hour and the $599 US dollar auction site.
4033000	4035000	I would totally be down for...
4035000	4039000	And I know this is absolutely ridiculous, but I'd be totally down for a live action Ridge Racer.
4039000	4041000	I mean, whatever. They tried it with Knee for Speed.
4041000	4042000	Why not?
4042000	4044000	Let's do it again. I don't care if it's terrible.
4044000	4047000	Because it's all drifting. It's unbelievable drifting.
4047000	4049000	Because that's all you do in Ridge Racer.
4049000	4053000	I shouldn't be able to drift around the corner that way, but I just did.
4053000	4055000	I think there'd be an audience for that.
4055000	4058000	Especially if you just played really loud Eurobeat during the whole thing.
4058000	4061000	You know there'd be a lot of people who'd just get high and watch that.
4061000	4065000	Let's be real. There'd be quite a few people that would do that.
4065000	4067000	I'm not saying I'm one of them. I'm just saying.
4067000	4073000	Just make it exciting. It doesn't matter what's on TV.
4073000	4077000	As long as you make it exciting, people will watch it.
4077000	4080000	Alright. Moving on over to the Microsoft side.
4080000	4084000	We've heard a lot about this, but we want to acknowledge it here in our news segment.
4084000	4089000	It is official after we reported on this as a rumor last week.
4089000	4093000	But officially Mojang was sold to Microsoft this week.
4093000	4096000	$2.5 billion.
4096000	4101000	Mojang going to be joining the internal game studio over at Microsoft.
4101000	4103000	Not joining them.
4103000	4107000	Notch, who basically wrote a letter to the industry that I'm really paraphrasing here.
4108000	4113000	This has been too much fucking pressure and I'm never going through this again. Peace out.
4113000	4117000	That's basically the sentence summary I got from Notch's letter.
4117000	4122000	It's more like he's not going to develop official stuff anymore.
4122000	4125000	He's going to do the game jams and stuff like that.
4125000	4129000	The fun stuff. But he's not going to try to create the next Minecraft.
4129000	4134000	And he says even anything he creates, if it does end up getting that sort of viral success.
4134000	4136000	He's just going to nip it in the butt.
4136000	4140000	Which I can kind of understand. Put yourself in Notch's shoes.
4140000	4145000	Despite all the questionable things he might have said on Twitter or so forth.
4145000	4147000	Just put yourself in his shoes.
4147000	4152000	And think like you're making this little game, this little fun project that you don't think is any big deal.
4152000	4156000	And then all of a sudden it is the biggest thing in gaming.
4156000	4158000	Literally the biggest thing in gaming.
4158000	4162000	And it is on backpacks and blankets.
4162000	4167000	And you know, Loki and I just bantered a little bit over the whole gaming illuminati and all this other stuff.
4167000	4169000	And how people act on the internet.
4169000	4173000	I mean, think about all the pressure he must have had and all the stuff that he went through.
4173000	4176000	I can see where he probably cracked.
4176000	4179000	Not everybody is made out to be famous.
4179000	4183000	It's like, fuck it, I got 2.5 billion dollars. I don't need this shit.
4183000	4188000	You're reminding me on a larger scale of what the guy who did Flappy Bird was complaining about. Remember?
4189000	4192000	It's too much pressure. It's too big. I don't know what to do.
4192000	4198000	And Dong Nguyen, I believe he had felt personally responsible for people that became addicted to the game.
4198000	4204000	He was hearing stories about people losing their job and he was kind of like, I don't want to be responsible for that.
4204000	4211000	I'm a game developer. I'm not an executive. I'm not a CEO.
4211000	4213000	I don't know. I don't buy that.
4213000	4221000	Honestly, if I made a game and people lost jobs over it because they were so addicted to it, first off, I'd be very complimented by that.
4221000	4230000	And second, I would be like, well, if you're fucking dumb enough to lose your job over this and playing this game, then too bad. You're just dumb.
4230000	4235000	I mean, you're going to lose your job playing something or doing something. You're just an idiot.
4235000	4237000	So I wouldn't feel pressure by that.
4237000	4244000	I could see where you're getting a flack from social media and stuff just over whatever, people sending death threats and crap.
4244000	4246000	Yeah, I could see how that could get a little bit annoying.
4246000	4251000	But just saying, oh, well, I feel bad because these people are addicted to the game.
4251000	4256000	I would not feel any remorse whatsoever for people being addicted to anything I made.
4256000	4261000	Demix in our chat room says, I'm addicted to Sour Patch Kids, but I don't blame Sugar for it.
4261000	4268000	All right. I want to carry over kind of a conversation that I was having on Hoard House on Wednesday because this story came up on Hoard House.
4268000	4272000	And I was talking about Microsoft paid way too much money for Minecraft.
4272000	4277000	They paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft.
4277000	4282000	And what kind of blew me away about it especially was that they didn't get notched with the deal.
4282000	4286000	It seems like what's to say they're going to get Lightning to strike twice?
4286000	4293000	Maybe they could try and do an exclusive Minecraft too, but who knows? It could go over like Farmville too, right?
4293000	4299000	But Flacco, you responded to the Hoard House episode and I thought what you said was a decent way of thinking.
4299000	4302000	So did Microsoft pay too much for Mojang?
4302000	4303000	No way.
4303000	4304000	Okay. And why?
4304000	4305000	They got a great deal.
4305000	4311000	Like, look at what they spent like $7 billion on Nokia and then they just laid all those people off this week.
4312000	4318000	The way I saw it, and I think I stole this probably from someone else I read on the internet, but it was just a commenter so I don't have to credit them.
4318000	4320000	That's all right. That's what people on the internet do.
4320000	4322000	Yeah, I was like, that was a good point.
4322000	4329000	If somebody offered the guys who made Legos like $2 billion at the peak of their popularity, you look back at them now and say,
4329000	4332000	oh, those guys were crazy. Lego's worth way more than that.
4332000	4334000	And there's like a Minecraft movie coming out.
4334000	4336000	And like Mike, we just interviewed him.
4336000	4339000	What's the first thing you said when you asked what games do you play right now?
4339000	4344000	I got two kids. I play Minecraft. It's right there. I think that's what Microsoft saw.
4344000	4346000	I knew you were going to use that as a weapon the minute he said that.
4346000	4348000	Oh, yeah. As soon as he said it, like, there you go.
4348000	4351000	Damn it. When I ask Flaco about this later, he's going to use that against me.
4351000	4354000	Yep. I think Minecraft is a huge thing.
4354000	4358000	And I actually think he just wanted to get rid of it.
4358000	4361000	And Microsoft pretty much just bought the IP.
4361000	4363000	I don't think they care about any of those other games that they're making there.
4363000	4365000	Because like you said, they're not getting the game creator.
4365000	4368000	They just want that IP. They want everything that comes with it.
4368000	4372000	That movie makes a billion dollars. They're already getting close to making their money back.
4372000	4378000	I will admit, when I was talking about my stuff on Hoard House, I wasn't considering the merchandising.
4378000	4382000	Which, you're right. You walk into any hot topic, there's that whole mess of stuff.
4382000	4385000	And the toy section, Toys R Us, they've got a bunch of stuff there.
4385000	4388000	My concern is, and still a little bit.
4388000	4391000	Yeah, you know who else does a lot of merchandising?
4391000	4393000	Rovio and Angry Birds.
4393000	4396000	But I think they've been around longer than that now, right?
4396000	4400000	And they're making a movie with that, too. But is it as popular as it used to be? No.
4400000	4404000	Is this the point where Minecraft peaks and jumps the shark?
4404000	4411000	Is Minecraft going to continue to grow, or will the audience that made Minecraft big break it?
4411000	4414000	Isn't that kind of a concern, too?
4414000	4417000	I realize the audience has grown bigger than that. Now kids are into it, however.
4417000	4419000	But how long until the next big thing?
4419000	4424000	Yeah, I don't know. At least with this, it's not like the Wii, where once everybody grew out of the Wii,
4424000	4427000	they're not going to obviously buy a thing that's that old.
4427000	4433000	But with Minecraft, it's already timeless, because it uses such low-res graphics to get everything going.
4433000	4438000	It's not like people got into it because it was the next great-looking thing.
4438000	4442000	So I think it could just really last forever. I think it's just got something that's going to go on.
4442000	4446000	But yeah, you never know. It could die out, but anything that you consider a fad.
4446000	4448000	I just don't think Minecraft's a fad.
4448000	4450000	And this is going to result in, I've never played Minecraft. I'm just looking.
4450000	4451000	What?
4451000	4456000	I've never played. I'm an outsider looking in, and I'm just looking at how this thing goes, and it's just taken over.
4456000	4458000	Like, this whole acid of culture.
4458000	4460000	Hold on, hold on. But why not?
4460000	4462000	I don't know. It's just not a feel to me.
4462000	4464000	You say that now.
4464000	4467000	I like Legos. I say that now, but see, I have kids.
4467000	4468000	Here's the thing.
4468000	4473000	My kids are two and four, and I have a feeling when they get into that age, and my wife is a teacher.
4473000	4478000	She's a second-grade teacher. Her kids talk about Minecraft, and she sees it go through the school like crazy.
4478000	4481000	Once my kids are older, I'm going to be in that game.
4481000	4484000	I was there at one point. I was like, I don't get it. I don't get this game at all.
4484000	4486000	I played it on 360. This is pretty fun.
4486000	4493000	I played it on PC. I'm like, crap. I can't play the 360 version anymore because I've played it on PC, and I'm so spoiled with everything that's on here.
4493000	4496000	So, yeah. Just try it.
4496000	4499000	For me, it was just like, I don't think I have the time to invest in.
4499000	4502000	I'm looking at videos of what people can build in Minecraft.
4502000	4507000	Like, how these large cities, full-scale enterprise replicas, all this crazy stuff they can do.
4507000	4510000	There's ways you can speed things up, especially on PC.
4510000	4515000	For me, personally, I just didn't think about putting that investment in, and I just probably never got into it.
4515000	4517000	It just seemed like a huge undertaking.
4517000	4520000	I just want to make clear that I'm not one of those people that's like,
4520000	4524000	just because Microsoft bought Minecraft means it will turn to total shit.
4524000	4526000	I'm actually not one of those people.
4526000	4530000	I have concerns. Will Minecraft still be as heavily moddable?
4530000	4532000	Especially when we talk Minecraft 2.
4532000	4536000	I'm not so much what's currently there, but you know Microsoft's going to make a Minecraft 2.
4536000	4539000	Come on. That will be a thing that will happen absolutely.
4539000	4541000	Has to happen.
4541000	4543000	Will it still be as moddable?
4543000	4549000	Will it still have a lot of the stuff that people are charmed with with the original Minecraft?
4549000	4552000	Or is it going to be really just targeted as a kids game?
4552000	4559000	But, all that being said, I'm not really bothered by the fact that a big company owns a cute little gaming franchise,
4559000	4564000	because Nintendo owns Pokemon, and I don't know anybody that has a problem with that.
4564000	4568000	Yeah, and Pokemon's still popular with kids. It's not gone away yet. It's not a fad.
4568000	4573000	If Microsoft wants their own Pokemon, which is kind of what this is-ish,
4573000	4579000	they might not be the same game, but in a way, hasn't Microsoft really needed that killer franchise?
4579000	4581000	I mean, they have Halo, but they don't have anything for kids, right?
4581000	4583000	They tried Viva Pinata.
4583000	4585000	I was like, Viva Pinata? No.
4585000	4587000	They tried, well now they have Minecraft.
4587000	4588000	Connectimals?
4588000	4589000	Now they have Minecraft.
4589000	4596000	So to that extent, buying what Viva Pinata couldn't do, I can see that.
4596000	4599000	Where now, okay, maybe it was worth 2.5 billion.
4599000	4602000	Yeah, but I still think that's kind of small-scale stuff.
4602000	4607000	I think it's the overall franchise that's the big picture of just keeping that going, that brand.
4607000	4610000	I don't know. We'll see. We'll see how the movie does, and we'll see if-
4610000	4617000	I don't know. I think if Microsoft makes a Minecraft too soon, it could leech from that other audience, and it could dilute it. I don't know.
4617000	4618000	That's true.
4618000	4620000	I feel like you just got to let Minecraft do its thing.
4620000	4621000	Yeah.
4621000	4624000	Where is that sweet spot to make a Minecraft too, you know?
4624000	4628000	Yeah, I don't know. What would you do? Would you make better graphics? That's not what sold Minecraft.
4628000	4631000	Like I said, it's because it's- I don't know. It's its own thing.
4631000	4636000	It's like Lego blocks in your computer, and I don't know what you could change to make it better, but I don't know.
4636000	4639000	Maybe people who played it would know that.
4639000	4647000	Maybe more of the game elements itself, such as the monsters that you fight, and that part of it maybe can be expanded on, and how you go into other worlds.
4647000	4654000	I don't know. Don't take my words for it. I hope that Microsoft has tapped in enough to the Minecraft community to hear about what they want.
4654000	4660000	What have they been begging Notch to do for forever? Loki, do you know more about that? What have people been begging Notch to do?
4660000	4662000	You're more tapped into Minecraft than either of us.
4662000	4674000	Uh, fuck. I don't know. They're just adding a ton of stuff to it, but now I think the big thing is that the bucket support's discontinued, so that's a little disappointing, because that was a big modding thing.
4674000	4681000	It's like, yeah, we want to do a lot more with Minecraft, and so use bucket to do all that stuff.
4681000	4697000	Whether it be just utility things like World Guard and stuff so people can't fuck up parts of your world, or doing the different scripting things and stuff to where you can have a mob arena, which is pretty awesome.
4697000	4714000	Or, you know, I want to have MP3s playing in my background, or I want to have guns in the game, or not necessarily guns, but cool projectile weapons, or I want to have magic spells, or whatever.
4714000	4723000	I think people are a little disappointed with that. Now, they're saying that Mojang is supposed to be carrying that on still.
4724000	4734000	And I guess they're supposed to have official mod support at some point, so once that happens, then maybe we won't need all this bucket stuff, and it'll just be kind of lumped in there and it'll work, hopefully.
4734000	4751000	I hope that includes also skin mods and stuff, not necessarily changing the skins because you can do that pretty easy, but adding new blocks and adding new things, like they have in Forge right now where you can add cars or planes and stuff.
4751000	4757000	It's not actually composed of stuff in the game, it's brand new geometry. I can take a picture or something like that.
4757000	4760000	Botakawa in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
4760000	4772000	The issue why we are saying Minecraft 2 is because we know that Microsoft wants to make a profit off this, and unless they sell a new game or more merchandise, what else could they do? I'd be afraid they are going to sell expansions or just large patches.
4772000	4780000	Don't underestimate the merchandising side of that, though. Again, walk into any hot topic, there's like a whole wall dedicated to Minecraft, you know, and that's just one store, but I do see your point.
4780000	4789000	Anyway, we could spend three hours hypothesizing about the future of Minecraft, but I want to keep things moving, so let's change gears a little bit here. Flaco, what do you have for us?
4790000	4802000	I have a Final Fantasy XV story. So Square announced that Tetsuya Nomura is going to be stepping away from Final Fantasy XV.
4802000	4809000	He'll be focusing on other projects, Type 0 and before Crysis Final Fantasy...
4810000	4813000	Type 0, that's the one he's going to be working on, right?
4819000	4828000	The quote here is he's going to shift efforts to a production of titles that can only be made possible by Nomura himself, including the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 3.
4828000	4838000	So that's what I'm excited about, because I'm more of a Kingdom Hearts fan now than Final Fantasy. I was a big Final Fantasy fan back in the day, but I haven't played a Final Fantasy game, a new one in a while, other than the MMO ones.
4839000	4850000	So yeah, and then they also announced at the same time they're going to have a demo coming out for XV when Final Fantasy Type 0 HD comes out on the PS4 and the Xbox One.
4850000	4860000	And then there was a further update that it's going to be on the PS4 on March 20th. So it's not just going to be bundled in with the game, it sounds like it's also going to be on the store.
4860000	4862000	Of course I thought it was just going to be with the game.
4862000	4870000	That news makes me more excited than anything, because finally, what, nine years after they announced this game, you're like, a demo? It's happening!
4870000	4872000	Yeah, that's a good sign, it's going to happen.
4872000	4886000	Finally! So that part's exciting. I mean, the part about Nomura leaving, that's not... I mean, I wondered how he was going to juggle both games with Kingdom Hearts 3 being a thing.
4886000	4896000	So that part I'm not so surprised with. But yeah, the fact that a demo will happen next year, they've pretty much confirmed that's happening, that's exciting.
4896000	4905000	Yeah, and I wasn't super excited for XV until I started to see more stuff come out that looked like it was a lot more Kingdom Hearts-style play.
4905000	4913000	And that's something I think I'm more on now than the old-school RPG play. Like I said, I didn't really play XIII, I didn't play even XII.
4913000	4920000	So it's been a long time since I've gotten into Final Fantasy, so I'm excited to try the demo and see if it plays kind of like a Kingdom Hearts game.
4920000	4931000	Something not on the show world tonight, but about Final Fantasy XIII and stuff, is that they did announce the PC version of Final Fantasy XIII, XIII-2, and Lightning Returns. They're going to port all those to PC.
4931000	4937000	That is a thing they're doing. I don't know if that might be a bundle to end, or are they all separate games?
4937000	4942000	They're going to be separate, but Final Fantasy XIII is the first one, and that's out in early October.
4942000	4943000	Steam sale.
4943000	4952000	Yeah, I know. Well, Square apparently really buffed up their Steam, because Final Fantasy IV, which I didn't talk about in my gaming week because I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.
4952000	4962000	But Final Fantasy IV, the DS version that was then ported to iOS and Android has now been ported to PC, and so that has been released on Steam.
4962000	4964000	Square, Final Fantasy VI, please.
4964000	4973000	Right? Well, here's the thing. The Final Fantasy VI that's on iPad and all that, they kind of outsource some of the graphical development.
4973000	4976000	No, I want the one that was on PSP.
4976000	4982000	Yeah, or I wouldn't mind the whole 3D remake, but I just don't see them doing any more of those.
4983000	4985000	And the problem is Final Fantasy V.
4985000	4997000	And I'm not saying Final Fantasy V is bad, but because of that weird place where Final Fantasy V kind of is, especially with US history, they would have to do that before they go to VI.
4997000	5001000	I don't think they have to, but I think there's this feeling they would need to.
5001000	5006000	I think they should just go straight to VI and make the 3D port of that, but maybe that ship sailed. I don't know.
5006000	5013000	I mean, you know, these were DS ports and now we're on new 3DS coming soon, so there you go.
5013000	5022000	Fifth Dream wants to point out in her chatroom at live.vognetware.com, Final Fantasy XIII is already on sale on Steam. It's 10% off if you pre-order. That's a good point.
5022000	5028000	And it wasn't, like, it's not like it was a $60 game. I think they were only going for what? Was it, like, $19.99 maybe?
5028000	5030000	Somebody has to look up that price and let me know real quick.
5030000	5038000	But that is one perk about XIII on Steam is that because they know the game is so old, like, they're not going to charge $60 for it, so that's pretty good.
5038000	5046000	So, alright. Let's move on to release dates. We're going to travel the world and check out what games you can get right now.
5046000	5053000	You might have to wait a couple weeks for XIII on Steam and a few months for XV, but what can you get right now this week?
5053000	5063000	You can get Disney Infinity 2.0, Marvel Super Heroes. They have the starter packs for Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.
5063000	5076000	As well as all the, they have the collector's editions on the Playstation platforms and all the figures and shit you can get for, what is it, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers and Spider-Man.
5076000	5079000	So, a ton of stuff, especially if you're a fan of Marvel.
5080000	5088000	EA's got FIFA 15 coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
5088000	5098000	They're also doing the Legacy editions, which basically is taking, like, I think at this point FIFA 12 or something and updating the roster and just popping it back out, you know.
5098000	5103000	Selling it for the 3DS, the Wii, and the P, the Vita, I believe.
5104000	5111000	Also this week, if you want to buy the physical version of Killer Instinct, the combo breaker pack, they have that coming out on Xbox One.
5111000	5116000	And it gives you a bonus character for Season 2 as well.
5116000	5124000	And let's see here, R No Surge, Ode to an Unborn Star, coming out on Playstation 3.
5124000	5130000	And Arkana Heart 3 Love Max on Playstation 3 and Vita.
5131000	5139000	And let's see here, finally Hyrule Warriors on Wii U. That's it.
5139000	5141000	Excited about that one, definitely.
5141000	5142000	Looks pretty cool.
5142000	5143000	Yeah, it's gonna be cool.
5143000	5148000	An interesting case for Nintendo, where Europe got it first. Europe got it this weekend.
5148000	5156000	We have to wait. That usually doesn't happen with Nintendo, so Nintendo finally giving the folks overseas a break there with the release dates, so that's interesting.
5156000	5159000	They've gotten plenty of breaks from Nintendo. They got the last story and they got a...
5159000	5162000	That's true. I guess I can't feel too bad for them.
5162000	5164000	Yeah, they don't have to go to GameStop to buy that one.
5164000	5165000	Exactly.
5165000	5166000	Alright, fair enough.
5166000	5174000	Just a couple comments from our chat room. Dungeon Buster clarifying the price of Final Fantasy 13. It is $15.99, but for right now it is $14.39.
5174000	5175000	Oh, that's not bad.
5175000	5177000	For Final Fantasy 13 on Steam. Yeah, that's really not that bad.
5177000	5178000	What?
5178000	5184000	Yeah. And DJ Rama S says there's no reason to charge $60 for Final Fantasy 13. Squeenix already made their money off it.
5184000	5188000	And Bochikawa says $16? No, really, that's worth it. If you've never played it, get it.
5188000	5190000	Let's see, also...
5190000	5192000	Haven't finished it. I mean, does that count?
5192000	5196000	What games are on PC still? Is it just 6, 9, and...
5196000	5200000	5, 6, 9, 10, 12.
5200000	5201000	10 and 12.
5201000	5207000	So, we're getting there. Actually, 1 and 2, I don't believe, ever have an official PC release.
5207000	5209000	Oh, could have sworn they were on there too.
5209000	5211000	No, I don't think so. I could be wrong.
5211000	5212000	No, you're probably right.
5212000	5213000	They were iOS.
5213000	5214000	I keep thinking about those ones, but yeah.
5214000	5216000	Those are the ports of the PSP games.
5216000	5217000	Yeah.
5217000	5227000	So, anyway, let's see. Also, I know you don't usually cover digital distribution in your release dates, Loki, but folks in our chatroom are talking about Gauntlet, the remake reimagining or whatever of Gauntlet's out this week.
5227000	5231000	So, as a fan of Diablo, that's up my alley, I think.
5232000	5236000	It's not Gauntlet. It's not like Legacy or Legends or whatever.
5236000	5241000	Not Legacy. Yeah, Legacy was crap. No, Gauntlet Legends or was it the...
5241000	5245000	What was the other one? Dark something? I don't remember what it was called.
5245000	5247000	Dark Legacy, right?
5247000	5248000	Dark Legacy.
5248000	5252000	Anyway, going to Japan and checking out some of the release dates over there.
5252000	5257000	While I horribly mispronounce some of their release dates, they have a few things on PlayStation 3 this week.
5257000	5261000	You then Setsu Sen no Kisuke 2 in a regular and limited CD bundle set.
5261000	5267000	And then Kamisama to Unmei Kasuke, or sorry, Kakusei no Cross Thesis.
5267000	5273000	And Tears to Tiara 2, Hao no Matsue comes out this week on PlayStation 3.
5273000	5275000	I have no idea what any of those games are.
5275000	5278000	Tears to Tiara 2 is coming out here next month, actually.
5278000	5281000	You play a princess and...
5281000	5282000	Yay!
5282000	5283000	Yes.
5284000	5287000	It's Heir to the... I forget what the subtitle is.
5287000	5291000	Heir to something, Heir to the King or I don't remember what it was called.
5291000	5295000	The Wii U has a game out this week on the 27th called Zero.
5295000	5298000	Norigarasu no Miku comes out this week.
5298000	5302000	This is not... Oh, this is Fatal Frame is what this is over in Japan.
5302000	5305000	That's right, this is the Wii U Fatal Frame that's coming out over there.
5305000	5311000	I thought Japan had Bayonetta 2 this week, and I don't see it on my list here.
5311000	5314000	Maybe that was this past week and I just missed the boat on that.
5314000	5317000	But I know Bayonetta 2 is very, very soon in Japan.
5317000	5322000	And lastly, PlayStation Vita. There's a whole lot of crap on the Vita this week in Japan.
5322000	5328000	Bakumatsu Rock Ultra Soul, Dungeon Travelers 2, Farming Simulator 14,
5328000	5339000	Monobeno Pier Smile, and Zetai Zetsubo Shouju Danganronpa, another episode comes out.
5339000	5344000	I believe that's Danganronpa 2, maybe. No, no, they wouldn't be getting that after us.
5344000	5346000	That must be the third one then.
5346000	5350000	And quickly, the 3DS release is Tenkai Nights Brave Battle.
5350000	5355000	Haiku Tsunage Iidadake no Kishike in regular and limited edition.
5355000	5366000	And lastly, oh boy, this is Kukei Zaidan Hojin Nippon Kanji Norioku Kentei Kayokai Kanken Training.
5366000	5370000	I'm thinking this is a learn kanji game, is what it looks like from the screenshots.
5370000	5372000	Because you can actually draw and all that good stuff.
5372000	5374000	So, there you go.
5374000	5378000	Flaco, I know Dark Soccer usually does the UK dates, but maybe you can help us out?
5378000	5385000	Sure, we have Gauntlet, I believe it's the Gauntlet reboot on PC, September 23.
5385000	5389000	Let's see, Stronghold Crusader 2 on PC, I don't know what that is.
5389000	5394000	Anna, the extended edition on Xbox 360, sounds exciting.
5394000	5397000	FIFA 15 on everything on September 25th.
5397000	5401000	Vita, 3DS, Wii, even the Wii. PlayStation 4.
5401000	5404000	And that's like a Madden game coming out here.
5404000	5407000	So, it's kind of a big deal over there.
5407000	5410000	Xbox One, 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
5410000	5413000	And then The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, another PC game.
5413000	5416000	And also on PS4.
5416000	5422000	And then, let's see, there's one other game on September 26, Fantasy Life on the 3DS.
5423000	5426000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
5426000	5430000	And then the classic game of the week, which I'll give you a little hint to think about this.
5430000	5433000	In honor of the guests that we had tonight.
5433000	5436000	No, I didn't pick any of their games, although I was tempted.
5436000	5439000	But I decided to pick another one of my favorite.
5439000	5443000	I don't even know if you can call it a game show, but a game-esque.
5443000	5446000	We'll leave it at that, a game-esque sort of thing.
5446000	5448000	I know, a video game that's a game, go figure.
5448000	5451000	But you'll know what I mean when we get there, it feels like a game show when you play it.
5451000	5453000	So just a couple more news stories and I'll tell you what it is. Loki.
5453000	5456000	Alright, so this is pretty cool.
5456000	5463000	PlayStation now joins Microsoft and Nintendo, or I should say Sony, I guess, joins them.
5463000	5471000	And basically giving out Unity Pro for free to any developers of the PlayStation platform.
5471000	5478000	So, if you're a licensed PlayStation developer, you can get Unity for free.
5478000	5485000	It normally costs $1500 to get the Pro version, or $75 per month if you go that route.
5485000	5491000	And that's pretty awesome, because yeah, originally Microsoft made that offer as well.
5491000	5496000	If you're going to do the ID at Xbox stuff, you get Unity Pro.
5496000	5499000	And then Nintendo also offering the same thing.
5499000	5504000	So, that's awesome if you've got a track record of releasing games and stuff,
5504000	5508000	and you happen to be an official licensed developer, save some cash there.
5508000	5511000	Because if you're an indie, you're going to need all the cash you can get.
5511000	5512000	So that's pretty cool.
5512000	5519000	And then of course, came out during their, was it the Oculus VR?
5519000	5522000	They had some sort of Oculus Connect event.
5522000	5530000	And it came out that Unity 5 is going to have a target platform, which will be the Oculus Rift.
5530000	5535000	And you'll be able to build for that, which is pretty awesome.
5535000	5542000	And that, unlike it is now, will be available in Unity free as well, instead of just Unity Pro as it is right now.
5542000	5546000	So, looking forward to that too, whenever 5 comes out, because 5 is going to be amazing.
5546000	5550000	Will you be porting your project to the Oculus?
5550000	5552000	I don't think it really fits for the Oculus.
5552000	5559000	I could just do 3D, but other than that, it wouldn't really benefit from it.
5559000	5564000	Alright. I think Oculus will really be here in our little hands as a consumer device next year.
5564000	5566000	They said, by the summer.
5566000	5568000	That's exciting, if that happens.
5568000	5569000	It's going to be expensive though.
5569000	5574000	It will be expensive, but it's going to have the Morpheus potentially next holiday.
5574000	5575000	But here's my problem.
5575000	5578000	It's going to be a very interesting VR year.
5578000	5580000	I like the idea of the Oculus Rift.
5580000	5585000	I like the idea of the Morpheus a little bit better, only because, and not because...
5586000	5590000	Well, the only reason I like the Morpheus a little bit better is it's plug and play.
5590000	5592000	Having played neither.
5592000	5594000	Having played neither. No.
5594000	5597000	This doesn't have anything to do with the capabilities of the system.
5597000	5602000	I'm talking about the fact that it has that separate box that does all the processing.
5602000	5606000	So, for example, if I bought the Oculus Rift for my laptop, that thing would run like shit.
5606000	5610000	Because my laptop is not powerful enough to be able to run that.
5610000	5615000	See, if they had some sort of external box that did the extra processing and worked that out,
5615000	5618000	if it was just plug and play like a mouse or something, that would be fantastic.
5618000	5623000	Knowing that there's that baseline that Morpheus is going to have, that it's all going to be the same,
5623000	5624000	I totally get that allure there.
5624000	5629000	Although, I do understand Oculus has their, like we talked about that headset last week or the week before,
5629000	5631000	where there's going to be certain standards as well.
5631000	5636000	I can see what you're talking about with that, where it's like you know it has the processing power it needs.
5636000	5640000	That's the only thing I think is going to be the biggest hurdle with getting that mainstream,
5640000	5644000	is just that your average mom and pop are thinking about,
5644000	5649000	oh, that's kind of cool, like say they develop something for social media or browsing the internet or some shit like that,
5649000	5651000	you know, that really catches on.
5651000	5656000	You're going to need a pretty powerful PC to be able to utilize that.
5656000	5663000	And a lot of these people just have a fucking basic ass computer or whatever to just browse the internet.
5663000	5673000	And so it's just, I know it's not necessarily for everyone, but I kind of wish it was a little bit easier to utilize.
5673000	5679000	Well, maybe this last story here will have the processing power needed to play all this stuff on VR.
5679000	5684000	And it's something that Square Enix announced this week, you know, Tokyo Game Show, they had a lot of announces this week.
5684000	5689000	And they're going to be rolling out a cloud-based gaming service, and it's called Shinra Technologies.
5689000	5695000	Yes. After that, Final Fantasy VII, which is interesting, a way to go with it.
5695000	5698000	Wasn't Shinra the bad guys in Final Fantasy VII?
5698000	5703000	Yes, they were the company harnessing the power of, was it the Mako?
5703000	5707000	Like, what was the company in Terminator? Would you really want to call your company that?
5707000	5708000	Skynet.
5708000	5711000	Skynet. Would you really want to call your company Skynet? But all right, whatever.
5711000	5716000	So they're going to have Shinra Technologies. It's going to be helmed by Yoshi Wada, who used to be president.
5716000	5722000	And it's an evolution of what we were seeing was Project Flare.
5722000	5729000	And it's going to be a separate subsidiary. And it will be doing cloud gaming with a virtual supercomputer.
5729000	5737000	The tech will be pooling hundreds or thousands of CPUs and GPUs in a data center to boost processing power and deliver higher quality games.
5737000	5741000	It's like one super-powered game console.
5742000	5746000	And they give an example here, Director of Partnerships Colin Williamson saying,
5746000	5750000	So let's say you're fighting in a city block doing all this damage.
5750000	5755000	In a traditional game, if you drive a few blocks in the other direction and come back, everything is magically reset.
5755000	5759000	Shinra Technology allows the worlds to change dynamically and have permanence.
5759000	5765000	It also takes the burden off the developers to figure out tricks and workarounds to give the illusion of a persistent world.
5765000	5767000	Our worlds can truly have history.
5767000	5776000	You know, I remember Square talking about something like this before with the whole, and maybe it was that Project Flare thing, but it's interesting to see this continue.
5776000	5784000	So I'm wondering, it doesn't sound like they're trying to put out a service, like they're not trying to compete with PlayStation Now or something like that.
5784000	5787000	It sounds like they're developing this for their own games.
5787000	5802000	It just sounds a lot like Microsoft's Azure servers, where they're doing that same shit with Crackdown and stuff, where you can dynamically destroy buildings and stuff like that, and they don't have to worry about calculating everything in-game because it does it on the server side.
5802000	5814000	It just sounds like that's kind of what they're doing. They already have things that can do that already. I don't know. Whatever. It'd be interesting to see what they do with it.
5814000	5825000	No date for when the service will be launching, but beta tests for the US and Japan expect it to start early 2015, so this could be another thing that we're going to see for the holidays. Who knows?
5825000	5830000	Alright, well, let's go back to a time when gaming was a little simpler.
5830000	5839000	You didn't have cloud computing, you didn't have headsets and VR. Well, I guess maybe you sorted it. You had the Virtual Boy.
5839000	5845000	But this is even before that. We're going to do the classic game of the week. Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura...
5845000	5849000	Technically, they did have a headset for the Vectrex.
5849000	5861000	That's true. Alright, shut up. Alright. Every week, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking this out. Forget all this new stuff. Worship this classic.
5861000	5869000	And since she's not here tonight, I'm here to pick the classic game of the week, and I'm going to break her streak of the CPS2 game she's been doing.
5869000	5876000	This is because you wouldn't pick Quiz N' Dragons, which, by the way, she told me in an email, well, that was a CPS1 game.
5876000	5883000	So, you know what? DarkSakura, if you're out there listening, I just broke your streak.
5883000	5890000	But with good reason, because, you know what? Darn it. This game here is a true classic. It's from the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5890000	5897000	And let's see if anybody can recognize it from the music. I already told you it's a Game Show-esque type of game. Here it is.
5901000	5908000	That's right. The classic game of the week this week is Anticipation. Anticipation for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5908000	5915000	That's right. The board game that you could play as a trumpet, a teddy bear, an ice cream cone, or a pair of high heels.
5915000	5920000	Guess which one I always picked. The ice cream cone. What were you thinking?
5920000	5925000	Uh, because I like ice cream. So there it is. Anticipation is the classic game of the week.
5925000	5929000	And, yes, again, it was a rare game for the original Nintendo Entertainment System.
5930000	5942000	Released in the North America in November of 1988, Europe got a release October 25th, 1989. I don't believe it was ever released in Japan.
5942000	5952000	You might know this game from the epic box art of all these affluent white people having fun is what the box art is.
5952000	5956000	It's just like, oh, we just, you know, we... White people having fun.
5956000	5963000	Yeah, exactly. We took a little trip to the countryside and, you know, found some sweaters and pillows and got these people having fun.
5963000	5969000	So, okay, if you don't know what Anticipation is, it's basically a board game. It's a board game slash Pictionary type game.
5969000	5975000	So you pick a piece in the game. Like I said, the shoes, the horn, the ice cream cone, or the teddy bear.
5975000	5983000	And as you go around the board and land on a square, the game, not another user, because, remember, the NES controller could only do so much.
5983000	5988000	So the computer would slowly draw a picture on the screen.
5988000	5995000	And as the picture's being drawn on the screen, the dice would count down from six to five to four to three, two to one.
5995000	6004000	So if you wanted to get a high roll, or if you're thinking the strategery behind the game, which is what color do I need to finish up all the colors for level,
6004000	6008000	then you have to buzz in at a certain time and hope nobody beats you to it.
6008000	6014000	So, yeah, you buzz in when you know the answer, and then you put in your guess for what is being drawn on the screen at that moment.
6014000	6024000	So, which, in the YouTube, we just saw a fishing hook being drawn, and the little high heels won a yellow piece for guessing that it was a...
6024000	6026000	That totally looks like Trivial Pursuit.
6026000	6030000	As I say, this is Trivial Pursuit meets Connect the Dots with E.B. Herman.
6030000	6036000	It sort of is. It's like Trivial Pursuit slash... And look, I already know this one. This is Sausage that's being drawn right there.
6036000	6039000	I have played so much of this game, I just...
6039000	6041000	That would not have been my guess.
6041000	6048000	It's Sausage. Look, I know this is horrible radio, but just trust me, y'all, it was drawn to Sausage.
6048000	6052000	They were totally not drawing a penis.
6052000	6059000	It does look a little bit like a penis. But anyway, in the earlier levels there's dots on the screen to help you know what it is.
6059000	6063000	But in the later levels... Oh, there's no dots. There's no dots.
6063000	6069000	And later levels on the board will start to mess with you too, like you get to gray squares that are feature squares,
6069000	6076000	where if you land on them a little bit of disco music plays while your piece flies around the board and you have to hit the button to land on a particular spot.
6076000	6082000	And then on the fourth level, there are gaps present where spaces have been removed,
6082000	6088000	and if you land on one of the pitfall spaces, you fall to the third level and have to finish out your colors again.
6088000	6093000	To ascend to the fourth level. So as you can imagine, this game took a little time to play.
6093000	6101000	But remember, the dice count down. So if you know how many spaces you are away from the hole, you just know not to buzz in on that number, right?
6101000	6109000	So that's how it works. So yeah, then once you fill up all the colors on the fourth level, then you win! Congratulations!
6109000	6114000	So there it is. I don't know if there's a lot else I could say about this game, because...
6114000	6116000	I think you said it all.
6116000	6123000	I think I literally said it all. And that's a race car being drawn right now, I guess. See the big wheels with the dots? There it is.
6123000	6133000	It's hard entering those words in with like 20 seconds to go back and forth on the letters, and you can only make one mistake.
6133000	6134000	That's true.
6134000	6136000	If you make your second mistake, it's like, you lose.
6136000	6138000	Does it let you screw up with the spelling?
6138000	6139000	I can't remember.
6139000	6140000	One time, it will.
6140000	6141000	It'll let you screw up one time.
6141000	6142000	It'll let you do one mistake, yeah.
6142000	6143000	Oh my gosh.
6143000	6146000	So if you get one of those really hard to guess words...
6146000	6152000	Yeah, or if you get a really long one, or one of those multiple words, it's tough to type all that in, just like you said.
6152000	6158000	An NES controller on an alphabet that goes from the back. Luckily, it'll let you go back the other way, of course.
6158000	6159000	A helicopter?
6159000	6161000	I believe that is a helicopter.
6161000	6162000	That is a helicopter.
6162000	6163000	See, Loki? You would've been a pro at this.
6163000	6165000	Did you ever play this, Loki?
6165000	6166000	No.
6166000	6167000	Flanko, did you play this at all?
6167000	6168000	Yes, I did play this game.
6168000	6169000	Alright, at least I'm not the only one.
6169000	6170000	I love these kind of games.
6170000	6175000	I never owned it, but I read about it in Nintendo Power, and I was like, that sounds so cool.
6175000	6177000	Because that's what I sounded like as a kid.
6177000	6178000	It's so cool.
6178000	6180000	And so we rented it.
6180000	6184000	I got a bunch of hand-me-down games for my uncle, so I just got the most random games.
6184000	6186000	I just thought it was a little Trojan.
6186000	6188000	I had so many weird games.
6188000	6191000	Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week.
6191000	6194000	Anticipation for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
6195000	6197000	Good party fun. Party game.
6197000	6200000	Just like we had Fibbage earlier in the show.
6200000	6202000	Like a modern party game, so there you go.
6203000	6207000	There is a part of me, though, that wishes they'd bring back Anticipation in some form or another.
6207000	6209000	I mean, think about it. You could draw on your smartphone now.
6209000	6210000	You could do like a Pictionary thing.
6210000	6213000	Hey, the sketch game on...
6213000	6215000	Oh, yeah, the Wario. The game in Wario.
6215000	6216000	Game in Wario, yeah.
6216000	6218000	That sketch game is super fun.
6218000	6220000	Describe this real quick for the listeners, because you made me play this.
6220000	6224000	It's pretty much Pictionary, but what it is, everybody kind of takes their picture with the gamepad,
6224000	6226000	you know, that's your icon to show your face,
6226000	6230000	and then everybody takes a turn being the person who draws while everybody else guesses,
6230000	6234000	and when somebody gets the correct guess, the person drawing clicks on their picture on the tablet
6234000	6236000	and gives them a point, and then it moves on to the next one.
6236000	6240000	And it's pretty much just Pictionary, but it works really well. It's super fun.
6240000	6243000	It's weird what they choose for you to draw sometimes.
6244000	6247000	I can't think of anything at the top of my head, but some of them were so obscure.
6247000	6248000	Some of them were really like complicated, yeah.
6248000	6252000	It's like, oh, here, draw a bucket, and now draw, I don't know, something with like a color.
6252000	6254000	Draw Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
6254000	6258000	Yeah, something ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised, but something ridiculous, and it's like, wait a second.
6258000	6261000	It's like super long. It's like a big hard concept to get, so.
6261000	6262000	But no, it's really fun.
6262000	6265000	All right, so clearly Anticipation influenced all this stuff.
6265000	6270000	Of course, it influenced everything. It influenced You Don't Know Jack, it influenced Minecraft.
6270000	6273000	I should have asked Mike about that. How much were you influenced by Anticipation?
6273000	6276000	Because I know this show wouldn't exist without it. All right.
6276000	6279000	Anyhow, all right, we're going to take a break.
6279000	6282000	Demixton Chance's Platypus. I think that was one of them.
6283000	6285000	Platypus? Probably. All right, anyway.
6285000	6287000	I have a lot of stuff in there. I was actually impressed.
6287000	6289000	All right, we're going to take a break, guys.
6289000	6292000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we've got some rapid fire news.
6292000	6297000	The Fugal Question of the Week, we're going to talk about violent video games for ice cream.
6297000	6302000	We talked about ice cream and Anticipation, and now this campaign that Anticipation has inspired
6302000	6305000	for trading in violent video games for ice cream.
6305000	6308000	They better give me a lot of ice cream for that violent video game.
6308000	6314000	The FUs of the Week and your calls at 1-877-GAMELR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
6314000	6317000	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6323000	6330000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday night, September the 21st of 2014
6330000	6334000	with the 568th episode of our show already in progress.
6334000	6337000	And if you're just joining us, well, you've missed a lot.
6337000	6340000	I don't know what else to tell you. You have missed way too much.
6340000	6342000	You're going to have to go back and listen on our podcast feed.
6342000	6348000	It's a good thing that you can find this show on our podcast feed on Stitcher Radio, TuneIn Radio,
6348000	6351000	whatever podcast app you use. You can find that early Monday morning
6351000	6353000	and always catch up with any part of the show you miss.
6353000	6358000	But tonight, obviously we had an interview with Jackbox Games on the program
6358000	6363000	talking about their new release, Fibbage, as well as talking about You Don't Know Jack.
6363000	6367000	And basically we got it confirmed that a 2015 version is coming, which is awesome.
6367000	6372000	And not only that, you missed Loki ranting on a topic you were wondering when he was going to rant about
6372000	6374000	in part A on the show. We got that tonight.
6374000	6377000	And most importantly, Anticipation.
6377000	6381000	That's nothing. That's seriously nothing.
6381000	6384000	I may have to make a video at some point.
6384000	6391000	Alright. And the game that has influenced all games since, Anticipation, is our classic game of the week.
6391000	6392000	We talked about that as well.
6392000	6396000	But we have plenty more show to come and of course your calls a little later on in the program.
6396000	6401000	Maybe your emails, although I didn't see any when I went in there earlier, so we might not have that tonight.
6401000	6408000	And rapid fire news. Quickly though, you know, if there's one thing we talk about that's different than video games and gaming,
6408000	6411000	one thing that we always talk about here on the program is food.
6411000	6418000	And Alan reminded me before we went live tonight that I had to talk about this restaurant that we went to on Friday night.
6418000	6424000	So, did you guys know that out in, and Flaco, I'm looking at you because I know you're a big fan of this stuff,
6424000	6428000	out in Roseville, they have a Brazilian grill place now.
6428000	6430000	I wanted to know what you guys thought of that.
6430000	6434000	It was, and I'll tell you this, it was not bad at all. I was very impressed.
6434000	6439000	That's awesome. They had one on, I would like, I want to say it's Madison.
6439000	6440000	Yeah, that one that used to be over on Madison.
6440000	6444000	It was there for like a month, I swear. It was not there for long, and it was okay.
6444000	6446000	This place really felt like a rip-off of Aspertoons.
6446000	6450000	Okay, if you don't know what we're talking about, because obviously we're talking about local restaurants, Brazilian grill, right?
6450000	6456000	That's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the sword, and then they're going to slice off something, like they ask,
6456000	6457000	or you have the little dial.
6457000	6460000	You have like a stop sign or a dial, whatever.
6460000	6465000	In this particular case, it's a coaster that you have on, like green is bring me more meat, and red is stop bringing me meat.
6465000	6468000	But then they bring something over to your table, like, do you want this, do you want this?
6468000	6469000	And so they've had-
6469000	6471000	The answer is always yes.
6471000	6474000	The answer is always yes, and they pretty much had everything that Aspertoons had.
6474000	6477000	The one thing, though, and I know this will disappoint you guys, they did not have chicken hearts.
6477000	6479000	Yay!
6479000	6485000	Actually, I don't like chicken hearts, but my wife loves them, and I always get them for me, and then I push them onto her place.
6485000	6490000	I don't like that stuff either, but I'll tell you what, that was some of the best top sirloin I have ever had.
6490000	6491000	Oh, man.
6491000	6492000	Was there. It was so good.
6492000	6496000	And then they have like the garlic steaks and the chicken wrapped in bacon and all this.
6496000	6498000	Sorry if I'm making you hungry, but oh my god, it was so good.
6498000	6500000	I have to try that place. It sounds awesome.
6500000	6502000	And then they had the full salad thing with like-
6502000	6506000	I like that, too, even though it ends up kind of ripping you off, because you're like, oh, but it's so good.
6506000	6510000	You got to fill up on these little things, and you're like, oh, now I have less room for meat.
6510000	6512000	I just like to think there needs to be some kind of balance in there, though, right?
6512000	6514000	It also just sits like a brick in your stomach.
6514000	6516000	That's what I always feel.
6516000	6522000	So I grab a little bit of everything from the salad bar, not everything, but stuff that I know I'd like, and then I definitely get all the meats just rolling in.
6522000	6525000	And then they have the fried banana, which I never knew this until our waitress said it.
6525000	6528000	The reason why they bring you fried banana is because it resets your palate.
6528000	6529000	Oh, okay.
6530000	6533000	And she says, we want you to experience all the different meat flavors that we have.
6533000	6535000	I'm like, I am here to experience them.
6535000	6537000	So that will not be a problem.
6537000	6540000	So, yeah, so they have that, and then the little cheese bread.
6540000	6545000	But this place, for some reason, brings you mashed potatoes, too, which, you know, what else goes great with steak?
6545000	6546000	Mashed potatoes, right?
6546000	6548000	Oh, that'll really fill you up.
6548000	6549000	See, they're trying to make their money back.
6549000	6550000	Yeah, yeah.
6550000	6553000	Because then this place was, what, I think it's, what, 45 bucks a plate?
6553000	6555000	Is it, as I was saying, what is it price-wise?
6555000	6559000	Okay, so that's about the same as Aspetues. 45, 50 bucks, I think, is what Aspetues is now.
6559000	6562000	But talk to me off air, because I might have gotten a little thingy for 15% off.
6562000	6564000	Oh, yeah, more meat.
6564000	6565000	More meat.
6565000	6566000	I got to try this place out.
6566000	6573000	So, anyhow, all right, sorry for the food deviation, but I knew Flaco would have to know about the Brazilian Grill trip.
6573000	6577000	And, Loki, I'm sure you've got to be one to go to this.
6577000	6582000	Yeah, we drove past it while they were building it, because we wanted to go there one time, but it wasn't open yet, so.
6582000	6585000	And I forgot the name. You guys are asking me what it's called, and I forgot the name.
6585000	6589000	It was like Fire and Flames or something like that. Flames and Fire, something like that.
6589000	6599000	It didn't have a fancy sounding name like Aspetues in San Francisco, which, you know, they don't pay me to talk about how freaking great that food is.
6599000	6601000	It's so good. It's so expensive.
6601000	6602000	It's expensive.
6602000	6603000	That's how they get you.
6603000	6605000	That's a celebration dinner place.
6605000	6606000	Yeah.
6606000	6611000	All right. Anyhow, Alan Alchemy's in chat. He woke up to talk about this.
6611000	6618000	He says that, Alan said, there were some things that weren't great. The filet mignon and the plain pork roast was mad, but the top sirloin and bacon-wrapped chicken and the pork sausage.
6618000	6619000	Oh, my God.
6619000	6621000	And Alan says, flame and fire.
6621000	6626000	Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture, saying it would not be OLR without food-related sidetracks.
6626000	6627000	Absolutely.
6627000	6630000	Food is what gives me the fuel to play video games all night long.
6630000	6635000	Speaking of Brad from Pod Culture, stay tuned to what they're doing over there.
6635000	6639000	And Pod Culture, also on the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, Monday night.
6639000	6641000	He was just at a convention this weekend.
6641000	6644000	And you won't believe the interviews these guys get at conventions.
6644000	6645000	They talk to everybody.
6645000	6647000	They talk to everybody at these conventions.
6647000	6653000	And all I'm going to say is, if you're a Doctor Who fan, you might want to go check out Pod Culture's feed, like ASAP.
6653000	6654000	That's all I'm telling you guys.
6654000	6656000	Check them out on Monday here at VOG Network.
6656000	6658000	All right. We got to get back into video games.
6658000	6661000	We are having a long show tonight, but with good reason.
6661000	6662000	There's lots to talk about.
6662000	6664000	But we do have some rapid-fire news coming at you.
6664000	6665000	Loki.
6665000	6668000	All right. So this is pretty exciting, although I don't think my phone's going to be able to run it.
6668000	6673000	But Goat Simulator is now out on iOS and Android.
6673000	6675000	Five bucks.
6675000	6676000	And you can play the game.
6676000	6679000	It has all the bugs they say from the PC version.
6679000	6681000	Your phone won't run it? What, Loki?
6681000	6685000	You mean you weren't out there getting an iPhone 6 on Friday? The 6 Plus?
6685000	6687000	No, I don't.
6687000	6692000	Because, see, I've got this nice plan through T-Mobile where I don't have to pay.
6692000	6696000	It's basically not on any sort of yearly contract thing.
6696000	6701000	And it's cheap because I can't afford more expensive phone plans.
6701000	6704000	And you don't get service anywhere on T-Mobile.
6704000	6706000	I don't get service anywhere.
6706000	6709000	That's okay because I don't have a lot of minutes.
6709000	6711000	So it's all right.
6711000	6713000	But I get unlimited data.
6713000	6715000	And that's why I use more anyways.
6715000	6719000	So who gives a shit about, you know, fucking, you know, phone minutes.
6719000	6720000	Anyways.
6720000	6722000	But yeah. So I don't have a very...
6722000	6726000	It's just a Galaxy 2. So it's, you know, slow.
6726000	6728000	But yeah. So you can check it out.
6728000	6731000	And of course, you know, the Xbox One version will be coming out later on.
6731000	6733000	But it doesn't look bad actually.
6733000	6735000	It just looks a little bit, you know, mobilized.
6735000	6737000	But pretty cool.
6737000	6739000	And then this is kind of neat.
6739000	6745000	Borderlands Online is coming back to the original game.
6745000	6750000	I remember it originally had GameSpy as its online provider.
6750000	6753000	But now they've converted that over to Steamworks.
6753000	6755000	So patched.
6755000	6759000	And now you can play multiplayer online as well.
6759000	6762000	So that's pretty sweet.
6762000	6765000	I like how they did that when Destiny is the big thing right now.
6765000	6767000	Like, hey, come back to Borderlands.
6767000	6769000	Because we just patched it so you can do that again.
6769000	6771000	I don't know if that was intentional.
6771000	6774000	They also have that pre-sequel coming out.
6774000	6779000	Yeah. I think it's just, you know, just fixing a problem that they had, you know,
6779000	6781000	with the GameSpy networks and stuff.
6781000	6790000	And last but not least, Harmonix has announced that they are closing their submissions for Rock Band Network.
6790000	6793000	So basically, effective immediately.
6793000	6798000	They are no longer allowing people to submit songs to the Rock Band Network.
6798000	6803000	Now, this doesn't mean that it's going away.
6803000	6809000	Apparently, though, that they are going to be, I think, still allowing you to check out those downloads.
6809000	6812000	So that's kind of cool.
6812000	6817000	I'd be curious, though, you know, they've kind of hinted that Rock Band will come back in some form at some point.
6817000	6819000	Like, there's been the polls and things like that.
6819000	6822000	So I wonder how this might transfer over to that.
6822000	6823000	Or if it will. I mean, who knows?
6823000	6829000	I would think robust DLC is going to be a big part of Rock Band's future should it have one.
6829000	6837000	Yeah, I mean, I think it was kind of cool that this kind of carried on even beyond the fact that,
6837000	6842000	or beyond, I guess, when they were offering the official DLC stuff.
6842000	6849000	And there was a lot of stuff in there that was, like, different genres that you couldn't even find elsewhere.
6849000	6852000	And, God, I kind of wish I had checked out more of the tracks.
6852000	6855000	I mean, they had 2,000 tracks in there.
6855000	6857000	So that's ridiculous.
6857000	6858000	Good times.
6858000	6862000	All right, well, one game we talked about a lot last week because of the demo.
6862000	6864000	And some of you guys, I'm sure, are really getting into this.
6864000	6868000	This week, with the open to all demo having been released on Friday,
6868000	6874000	Smash Bros. That's right, Smash Bros. for 3DS came out in Japan over this past week.
6874000	6876000	I'm sure you guys have seen people on Twitch playing this.
6876000	6879000	And you're seeing all the spoilers about what characters are unlocked in this.
6879000	6883000	And there's a lot of people playing Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 3DS.
6883000	6886000	One million sold in Japan in the first two days.
6886000	6890000	One million. That includes digital and physical sales.
6890000	6895000	Of course, as we all know, Nintendo absolutely ruined and going bankrupt as a company.
6895000	6897000	That was said with tongue in cheek.
6897000	6900000	One million copies of Smash Bros. for 3DS sold.
6900000	6902000	Good on them. Good on them.
6902000	6904000	Some people, though, missing ice climbers from the game.
6904000	6907000	Spoiler alert. Ice climbers are not in it.
6907000	6909000	There is no ice climbers to be found in the game,
6909000	6911000	although a lot of the other characters did come back.
6911000	6913000	Ice climbers did not.
6913000	6917000	Masahiro Sakurai explained in Famitsu why the ice climbers didn't come out.
6917000	6921000	And they were running on the Wii U version of the game,
6921000	6925000	but due to technical limitations, probably with that 3DS version,
6925000	6927000	they were cut from both versions.
6927000	6932000	And he said, you know, ice climbers as a franchise, it's just not really a thing.
6932000	6936000	I mean, this is a years old game. Nintendo has not revisited this franchise.
6936000	6938000	It's probably not coming back.
6938000	6944000	The delay between the two versions of Smash Bros. on the Wii U and the 3DS, though,
6944000	6948000	was simply due to debugging, not because of character changes or anything like that.
6948000	6952000	Of course, I love that ice climber is so old, you know,
6952000	6954000	and people don't really think about it anymore,
6954000	6958000	yet we're getting Duck Hunt Dog in the new Smash Bros.
6958000	6960000	You know?
6960000	6963000	Now, to be fair, though, I love that as a character.
6963000	6966000	Who has not wanted to shoot that fucking dog at some point in their life?
6966000	6969000	Everybody remembers. Like, if you played Duck Hunt when you were a kid,
6969000	6972000	I know we have listeners of all ages, but we're all in this room around the same age.
6972000	6974000	You played Duck Hunt as a kid, Flocko.
6974000	6976000	How many times did you want to choke that fucking dog?
6976000	6980000	I shot that dog multiple times, but he's impervious. He's invincible.
6980000	6985000	There was always that rumor that some kid in your elementary school shot the damn dog somehow.
6985000	6989000	Oh, I was able to shoot the dog. It's always that one guy who makes everything up.
6989000	6992000	That's right. Well, now that can be a reality.
6992000	6997000	But, see, Ice Climbers didn't really have any urban legends other than it sucked.
6997000	7001000	I haven't seen how the Duck Hunt Dog plays. Does it play like the Ice Climbers?
7001000	7003000	Like, the two characters kind of...
7003000	7008000	No, it's just the duck, and the duck kind of follows him around.
7008000	7011000	It's not like you can kind of... one part's the duck, and one part's the dog.
7011000	7013000	Okay, I wasn't sure, because I've been watching you.
7013000	7015000	Duck Dog.
7015000	7016000	That was like Ice Climbers.
7016000	7019000	Apparently, other lightning gun things are used as well.
7019000	7022000	I think some of the things from Gyromite come out, too.
7022000	7025000	Just really obscure shit, which is awesome.
7025000	7028000	I love the really obscure shit. That's what makes it interesting.
7028000	7029000	Demix in our chat says,
7029000	7032000	I think Duck Hunt inspires more nostalgia than Ice Climbers.
7032000	7037000	Well, you know, that Nintendo set, the action set, or whatever it was called,
7037000	7039000	that came with the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt combo cartridge?
7039000	7042000	That sold more than anything.
7042000	7045000	So I think most people played Duck Hunt whether they liked it or not.
7045000	7047000	It was like, ooh, I have Mario Brothers.
7047000	7048000	Oh, and this other game.
7048000	7049000	You know? Yeah.
7049000	7053000	And then it was World Class Track Meet in the later set that came with it, too.
7053000	7055000	Alright, anyway.
7055000	7057000	Moving on to other news.
7057000	7060000	We've talked about this convention previously on the show.
7060000	7062000	We actually had one of the organizers on a previous episode,
7062000	7064000	and maybe we'll have to have them back,
7064000	7070000	because GX3, which used to be known as GamerX, that's G-A-Y-M-E-R-X,
7070000	7072000	it is going to happen in 2015.
7072000	7078000	GX3 got its funding needed with 999 backers.
7078000	7080000	You've got to love that number.
7080000	7084000	999 backers making GX3 a reality.
7084000	7086000	We don't know the exact date in 2015,
7086000	7091000	but it will be happening November, December-ish in 2015.
7091000	7098000	By the way, one of the stretch goals that was passed for GX3 was GX Talks Season 2,
7098000	7102000	which would have been all the panels at the last GamerX that happened.
7102000	7105000	I was fortunate enough to be a part of one of those panels,
7105000	7108000	so look for that coming to YouTube soon at some point,
7108000	7111000	whenever that gets out there, and I'll be sure to promote that.
7111000	7117000	By the way, VOG Network going to be a sponsor of GX3 officially,
7117000	7119000	so we're going to have a table at the show.
7119000	7121000	I have no idea what we're doing with it yet,
7121000	7123000	but I have some ideas clicking around in my head,
7123000	7127000	so this is exciting that, yeah, we're going to actually be sponsoring a convention next year.
7127000	7129000	This might not be the only one either,
7129000	7134000	but GX3 is definitely on our radar for 2015, so that's very exciting.
7134000	7136000	So congrats to all of them over there.
7136000	7139000	Monster Hunter 4.
7139000	7144000	I know not a lot of people here in the US get really excited about Monster Hunter 4,
7144000	7146000	but as it is the week of Tokyo Game Show,
7146000	7149000	Capcom's putting out a little more information about Monster Hunter 4,
7149000	7152000	including some collaborations.
7153000	7158000	Taiko Drum Master being one of those random-ass cameos in the game,
7158000	7161000	the little happy face taiko drum showing up on one of the weapons.
7161000	7163000	It's like a hunting horn is what they call it.
7163000	7166000	Sonic the Hedgehog as well.
7166000	7169000	Sonic the Hedgehog armor will be available in the game.
7169000	7172000	That is a creepy fucking Sonic the Hedgehog, by the way, in this little picture.
7172000	7178000	It looks like Sonic the Hedgehog in one of those really scary real-life drawings.
7178000	7181000	I don't know what to think of this, but that is available,
7181000	7184000	which you also might get a kick out of.
7184000	7188000	Animal Crossing content in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.
7188000	7193000	You can dress up as Isabelle from Animal Crossing and Mr. Resetti,
7193000	7196000	so check that out in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.
7196000	7198000	I hope they bring some of that out over here.
7198000	7201000	That might get me a little more excited about Monster Hunter, just saying.
7201000	7203000	That would be awesome.
7203000	7205000	All right, Flaco, what do you have for us?
7205000	7207000	It's my turn.
7207000	7209000	Forgive me, I'm reading this on my tiny phone.
7209000	7216000	Final Fantasy 1 is coming to Nintendo 3DS with 3D support.
7216000	7221000	Because they're releasing Final Fantasy Explorers in Japan,
7221000	7223000	and the release date is December 18th,
7223000	7226000	it just happens to fall on the anniversary of Final Fantasy 1.
7226000	7231000	To commemorate this, the 3DS game will include a download code
7231000	7236000	for the first Final Fantasy game as part of its second first print bonus.
7236000	7241000	The other bonus was Final Fantasy 3's Onion Knight equipment.
7241000	7245000	I still can't imagine that they won't release this somehow as a standalone.
7245000	7249000	Wasn't the Kid Icarus 3D thing supposed to be a pre-order bonus for the game?
7249000	7251000	But it came out as a standalone.
7251000	7254000	Yeah, it'll come out. They've already got it.
7254000	7257000	If there's money to be made, it will be made.
7257000	7259000	So there's that one.
7259000	7262000	Let's see, I gotta switch to the other stone.
7262000	7265000	That can fill in the gap for you not having it on the PC.
7265000	7267000	Are you a 3DS owner?
7267000	7268000	I am not a 3DS owner.
7268000	7269000	I thought you had one.
7269000	7270000	Nope.
7270000	7273000	And I'm glad I waited, because I think I want the new 3DS.
7273000	7275000	That's not announced for America yet?
7275000	7277000	That's not announced for America, but it will be.
7277000	7281000	It will be. They gotta fill those Nintendo directs somehow.
7281000	7283000	I know, I know. Alright.
7283000	7286000	So let's see, my next quick story here is
7286000	7292000	Nintendo's disabling images that were able to be posted in the Mario and Luigi community.
7292000	7293000	Now here's their quote.
7293000	7297000	Due to unforeseen circumstances, the screenshot feature has been disabled in this community.
7297000	7301000	We're looking into the cause of the problem. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.
7301000	7306000	So I guess they could actually post real pictures, I'm assuming, for reading this,
7306000	7309000	onto the Mario and Luigi Miiverse community.
7309000	7310000	So of course...
7310000	7313000	Who posted their penis on Miiverse?
7313000	7317000	Who posted their penis on Miiverse and ruined it for everybody?
7317000	7321000	Or did they post a picture of their penis with a tiny little Mario hat on it?
7321000	7326000	It's a me, a penis.
7326000	7328000	So yeah, so that's unfortunate.
7328000	7331000	I got your magic mushroom right here, bitch.
7335000	7336000	Yeah, so that's that.
7336000	7338000	Only if it made the little sound.
7342000	7343000	Okay.
7343000	7348000	I just, when I first saw this, I thought maybe somebody was putting Mario and Luigi in compromising positions.
7348000	7351000	Well, that's what I thought, especially from the picture that accompanied that article.
7351000	7352000	I'm like, wait, is this what people are doing?
7352000	7356000	No, it's just they could post images to the forum, I guess.
7356000	7359000	And of course they posted things they shouldn't post.
7359000	7361000	Pictures of Jennifer Lawrence, I don't know.
7364000	7367000	No, it's Kardashian now, apparently, over the weekend.
7367000	7369000	Oh my gosh, I miss the news.
7369000	7370000	Is it one of the new girls?
7370000	7371000	One of the younger ones?
7371000	7372000	Or is it actually...
7372000	7374000	I think it's Kim.
7374000	7375000	I can't tell them apart.
7375000	7376000	Well, who would care about that?
7376000	7377000	She already has a tape out.
7377000	7378000	Yeah.
7378000	7379000	Like, that's nothing new.
7379000	7381000	Well, and that whole thing is wrong anyway.
7381000	7382000	It's wrong.
7382000	7383000	It's bad.
7383000	7384000	And you shouldn't be looking at those pictures, Rob.
7384000	7385000	You shouldn't perpetuate them.
7387000	7388000	So, my next story...
7388000	7390000	I'm trying to think what was there.
7390000	7392000	It's like, it was a movie or something like that.
7392000	7393000	That's terrible.
7393000	7395000	Oh, it's always sunny.
7395000	7396000	That's terrible.
7396000	7397000	That's wrong.
7397000	7400000	Like, I should tell that website, you know, take those down.
7400000	7402000	Which website was that again?
7402000	7404000	Because I need to go tell them to remove that.
7404000	7405000	They're shameful.
7405000	7406000	That's right.
7406000	7407000	Yeah.
7407000	7408000	I do remember that.
7408000	7412000	As a reminder, I happen to be a homosexual.
7412000	7416540	And the thing about that whole thing that cracks me up is that you have, like, all these
7416540	7418200	women nudes that leaked, right?
7418200	7420960	You have, like, Jennifer Laura, all these women nudes leaked.
7420960	7424400	And then Dave Franco, like, there's one dude...
7424400	7426120	Don't forget Justin Verlander.
7426120	7430600	There's one dude in the whole list that is Dave fucking Franco.
7430600	7431600	There was a second one?
7431600	7432600	Well, yeah.
7432600	7433600	But he's a baseball player, so.
7433600	7434600	Oh.
7435200	7436200	But yeah.
7436200	7437200	Justin Verlander.
7437200	7438200	He's the one that's dating Kate Upton.
7438200	7439200	Oh, okay.
7439200	7440200	So that's how they got her pictures.
7440200	7441200	It was actually his phone that got hacked.
7441200	7442200	How do you know that?
7442200	7443200	Oh.
7443200	7444200	Because I read Deadspin.
7444200	7445200	Oh.
7445200	7446200	I'm a sports fan.
7446200	7447200	That's right.
7447200	7448760	I'm a vog listener who likes sports.
7448760	7449760	Oh, that's right.
7449760	7453000	You went to the whole video game night with Extifer.
7453000	7454000	That's why you went to the Hoard House.
7454000	7455000	Yeah.
7455000	7456000	I was on gamer night.
7456000	7457000	The Giants.
7457000	7458000	That was really fun.
7458000	7459000	Awesome.
7459000	7460000	It was a really fun night.
7460000	7461000	He had a little giveaway.
7461000	7462000	Like an Assassin's Creed.
7462400	7465480	And then after the second inning, we were able to wait in line and get it signed by
7465480	7469320	Todd McFarlane, you know, who's done, you know, all the spawn stuff, video games, movies,
7469320	7470320	all that.
7470320	7472940	And the funniest part was they make us wait in this line.
7472940	7475920	We're kind of in the way, but that's the only place they told us to put the line in.
7475920	7479360	And all these people walk in and he's like, all these dumb people standing in line for
7479360	7482440	this guy's autograph is ruining the game.
7482440	7485320	It's like, sorry, that's what we're here for.
7485320	7486320	All right.
7486320	7487320	Sorry.
7487320	7488320	I didn't mean to derail your story.
7488320	7489320	That's okay.
7489320	7490320	That's okay.
7490640	7495240	There's a story left and it's about Koji Igarashi, is that how you say his name?
7495240	7496240	Igarashi.
7496240	7497240	Igarashi.
7497240	7498240	Sorry.
7498240	7499240	I should know this.
7499240	7500240	I worked at Konami.
7500240	7502480	Anyway, he's famous for being a co-director on Symphony of the Night.
7502480	7503800	I'm so bad with names.
7503800	7506560	I probably even met this guy at E3.
7506560	7512520	Anyway, during the Mighty No. 9 panel at PAX, he was talking about how excited he was to
7512520	7516800	work on this new game that he calls it his dream game.
7516800	7520840	And now that game is on hold and he's going to focus his attention on his new job working
7520840	7521840	for a mobile developer.
7521840	7524920	Isn't it sad to hear all these great game developers working for mobile?
7524920	7525920	Or maybe it's good.
7525920	7526920	They're not unemployed.
7526920	7532280	Well, it could be good because maybe the next, like the reason why I will embrace mobile
7532280	7534640	gaming all of a sudden will come from one of these guys.
7534640	7535640	You know what I mean?
7535640	7536640	Yeah, maybe.
7536640	7540280	But I still don't think touch gaming is where it's at and that's the fundamental issue is
7540280	7541280	that there's no tactile control.
7541280	7544120	When you hear his dream project went on hold because he's got to go back to work.
7544120	7545120	Yeah.
7545120	7546120	Yeah, that's true.
7546120	7547480	I was like, no, work on your dream.
7547480	7551400	It's obviously his dream project isn't mobile.
7551400	7555200	I got to go take this job to pay the bills first, then I'll get back to what I want to
7555200	7556200	do.
7556200	7557200	I understand that.
7557200	7558320	But yeah, there's one quote.
7558320	7560120	It's kind of an unusual agreement.
7560120	7563720	I have a special carve out that allows me to work with another publishing partner or
7563720	7568020	find another route, find other routes to fund my dream game.
7568020	7571000	So it sounds like it's kind of stuck in limbo right now.
7571000	7572000	All right.
7572000	7573000	Yeah.
7573000	7574000	Good luck.
7574000	7577000	Cause you know, I miss Castlevania back when it used to be like super cool.
7577000	7582280	So I guess the new games weren't awful, but it just, it wasn't symphony of the night.
7582280	7583280	You know what I mean?
7583280	7584280	It wasn't that.
7584280	7585280	All right.
7585280	7588120	Anyhow, uh, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
7588120	7589120	That's right.
7589120	7599840	You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash those words together and you get FUGL.
7599840	7604380	And every week we ask these communities a question, uh, that you guys answer about what's
7604380	7608400	going on in the news or in this case, maybe something inspired by our guest.
7608400	7613240	Uh, so, you know, earlier in the show we had Mike from Jackbox games on the show to talk
7613240	7615580	about fibbage and you don't know Jack.
7615580	7619120	So our question this week is about game show style video games and we want to know what
7619120	7621600	are your thoughts on game show video games?
7621600	7623180	Do you enjoy playing them?
7623180	7624560	What are your favorites?
7624560	7628520	And the most important question I believe out of this bunch, what is a game show that
7628520	7631000	you think would make a great video game?
7631000	7632580	So let's see what some of our listeners thought.
7632580	7637200	Let's start on Google plus with actdeft who said, I think trivia games are the best of
7637200	7640160	this type of game, especially when the game can be funny.
7640160	7641160	Like you don't know Jack.
7641160	7642240	They're so good.
7642240	7645920	And I would love to see the weakest link done again in video game form.
7645920	7648600	I think there's already a video game based on it.
7648600	7649600	There were several.
7649600	7650600	Yes.
7650600	7654760	Uh, but I would love to see it done in a one versus a hundred style or at least online
7654760	7658840	only if they had, what was her name and what was her name?
7658840	7664600	The British lady that did all the insults, you know, which is missing the idiots that
7664600	7665600	whole thing.
7665600	7666600	What was her name?
7666600	7667600	I don't remember.
7667600	7668600	And some and Robinson.
7668600	7669600	Oh wow.
7669600	7670600	That's it.
7670600	7671600	And Robinson.
7671600	7674040	I keep thinking Ann Ramsey, but that's somebody different.
7674040	7676680	Gordon Ramsey, somebody completely different.
7676680	7678320	You donkey.
7678320	7679320	Wasn't Ann Ramsey.
7679320	7680320	Also mama.
7680880	7687960	When you say Ramsey and British, I just think of it's bollocks.
7687960	7691600	Uh, maybe that would be kitchen nightmares might make a good video game.
7691600	7693640	If you can get Amy's baking company somehow involved.
7693640	7694640	I don't know.
7694640	7695640	All right.
7695640	7696640	Now you're going to get grandpa.
7696640	7697640	All right.
7697640	7698640	Or something.
7698640	7701120	Uh, entertainment says it's not exactly a game show, but I'm surprised there hasn't
7701120	7703880	been a video game based on survivor.
7703880	7709120	Actually there have been several entertainment and they were all piss poor games.
7709120	7713520	Uh, they right at the height of survivor popularity, there was one right around the
7713520	7714520	Australian outback.
7714520	7715520	I think.
7715520	7720280	So they pushed out a game in like less than a year and then there was, I never even played
7720280	7721280	in these survivor games.
7721280	7722280	I don't doubt it.
7722280	7725000	There was one on the, we, I, okay, here's the funny thing.
7725000	7727440	I have the survivor board game.
7727440	7732120	I have two copies of it because that's how many of my friends knew I was obsessed with
7732120	7733320	survivor when it first came out.
7733320	7735720	I got it as the board game at least good.
7735720	7737040	It was a little silly.
7737040	7740760	You had these little immunity challenge like questions and then you voted players out of
7740760	7741760	the game.
7741760	7742760	Ooh.
7742760	7746400	You know, which is basically like, you know, it's just like basically stab your friends
7746400	7747400	in the back.
7747400	7748400	That's all it is.
7748400	7751320	Like it's just consistently, you could just play vote, vote friends out of the game could
7751320	7752320	just be a game.
7752320	7754920	Isn't that kind of the wolf game in a way a little bit?
7754920	7755920	I don't know.
7755920	7758120	Yeah, I would be surprised if they just took some of that stuff.
7758120	7759120	All right.
7759120	7760120	Uh, let's see.
7760120	7763060	Uh, anyway, entertainment continues though because I like the, the thought here.
7763060	7766640	I'm thinking an MMORPG where you play live against other players.
7766640	7770540	It would be great to see different factions develop players backstab each other, poorly
7770540	7774860	utilized immunity idols and other common things that happen on that show survivor outwit outplay
7774860	7776640	outlast online.
7776640	7779440	I will tell you this because I've actually participated in these.
7779440	7783840	I used to do this a lot on live journal, which you know, LOL, how old is that site now?
7783840	7788920	But there are fan run games where you do get to experience a lot of that and people get
7788920	7790600	really hardcore crazy about this stuff.
7790600	7795880	I actually was really good at big brother online, uh, but on Facebook you can find like
7795880	7799600	survivor fan run games that people run and they do a lot of the same stuff.
7799600	7803760	So I mean, it would be nice to see a little more structure to something like that in the
7803760	7806840	game, but it is kind of cool that that does exist out there one way or another.
7806840	7807840	All right.
7807840	7810120	Let's go to our Facebook page and some of the answers over there.
7810120	7816060	James a saying the only one I played continuously was classic concentration on the NES.
7816060	7817640	It's still one of my favorite NES games.
7817640	7818640	Actually.
7818640	7819640	I had that on the Commodore 64.
7819640	7822120	That was one of my favorite game shows back in the day.
7822120	7823120	Trebek hoax did that.
7823120	7824120	Did he?
7824120	7825120	That's like, they stole my answer.
7825360	7827360	Uh, did he always hosted or he just originally hosted?
7827360	7829400	I think he hosted the eighties revival.
7829400	7832280	I think there was a version of it like in the sixties, but anyway, I love that game.
7832280	7833280	And I love that video game too.
7833280	7836680	Uh, as far as today's game show video games go, I can't really say I hate them just that
7836680	7838040	none of them have interested in me.
7838040	7841360	Most of them seem to be in a really odd multiplayer niche where none of my friends really watched
7841360	7842360	the actual show.
7842360	7844840	So they don't want to play the video game version when they come over.
7844840	7848440	But people who do watch the shows, my mom don't play video games.
7848440	7852840	Hey, my mom played anticipation with me, just so you know, but since she wouldn't touch
7852880	7855520	the controller, she'd just yell out from her chair.
7855520	7858880	You know, it's being drawn on the screen, Rob, buzz, buzz, buzz me.
7858880	7868280	It's a sausage, Rob, Rob, Rob, buzz, uh, dark Tetsuya says, well, it wasn't based on a real
7868280	7869280	show.
7869280	7870280	There was a game.
7870280	7872100	I'll never forget on the three D O twisted the game show.
7872100	7876600	The game featured a ton of FMV segments and live actors and wacky costumes and several
7876600	7879240	hilarious fake ads during the commercial breaks.
7879240	7880500	I remember that game.
7880500	7881720	I do remember that game.
7881720	7887040	That was one of the reasons I wanted a three D O, uh, generate a plate that, yeah, right.
7887040	7889320	So we knew that one kid in the block that had a three.
7889320	7890320	Yeah, yeah.
7890320	7891320	There was, yeah.
7891320	7895760	As a friend of a friend of mine that had that we played, I think it was, you know, no Jack
7895760	7896760	on there.
7896760	7897760	I don't remember.
7897760	7901560	There was, there was some party game we played that was like that on the three D O. I don't
7901560	7902560	know.
7902560	7903560	Maybe it wasn't, you'd know.
7903560	7904560	No Jack.
7904560	7905560	There was something though.
7905560	7906560	Maybe it was twisted.
7906560	7907560	I don't know.
7907560	7908560	And then we played road rash.
7908560	7909560	I just remember road rash.
7909560	7910560	Cause that was, that was a shit.
7910600	7914440	Uh, degenerate Johnny says, I've always liked video games based on game shows such as family
7914440	7915760	feud and wheel of fortune.
7915760	7919600	However, I would have loved to play a game that placed player characters in danger.
7919600	7925240	Like the game show featured in stay tuned, starring John Ritter.
7925240	7927460	I remember that movie.
7927460	7932480	That was the first movie I ever saw in the theater on opening day was stay tuned.
7932480	7933480	Believe it.
7933480	7934480	Really?
7934480	7935480	Yeah.
7935480	7936480	John Ritter and Pam Dauber, right?
7936480	7937480	With the salt and pepper.
7937680	7942720	But it was the first movie I saw in the theater on opening day on opening day.
7942720	7943720	I know.
7943720	7944720	Right.
7944720	7949280	Cause usually because here's the thing in Roseville at the time where I grew up, Roseville,
7949280	7951720	California, it was a much smaller town.
7951720	7954840	If we wanted to go to the movie theater and see new movies, we had to drive all the way
7954840	7956880	to the next town over.
7956880	7957880	Oh wow.
7957880	7960240	All we had in our town was a dollar theater.
7960240	7961360	That's now a radio shack.
7961360	7963720	I'll give you an idea how big that place was.
7963720	7964720	Okay.
7964720	7965720	It was a dollar theater.
7965760	7967680	The dollar theater was all the second run movies.
7967680	7969720	So that's why it took me so long to see something.
7969720	7970720	Get it?
7970720	7974920	We just had a little two screen theater in our hometown and my hometown and it was, uh,
7974920	7977480	it really would just play the same movies all summer.
7977480	7979400	Like, Oh, Batman came out.
7979400	7980400	Have fun watching Batman.
7980400	7982520	Also, they're not going to change the movie out.
7982520	7983760	All right.
7983760	7987440	Peter Uno says, much like Rob, I used to love all the game shows on berserk.
7987440	7990280	You don't know Jack, Acrophobia, Cosmic Consensus.
7990280	7992420	And of course more recent ones like one versus a hundred.
7992420	7996380	This one especially worked really well with hundreds of players all online at the same
7996380	7997380	time.
7997380	8000400	Uh, as she says, I'm a huge fan of the game show games.
8000400	8004380	Back when I was hosting game gaming parties, you don't know Jack and even the Xbox three
8004380	8009860	60 versions of the scenic games with the buzzer controller adaptions, uh, all went over well.
8009860	8013620	My dream game show would be of course the match game with a digital version of Charles
8013620	8015620	Nelson Riley.
8015620	8016980	Yes.
8017540	8023380	Fifth dream last and not least says I like to play some game show style games, though
8023380	8028020	many of them are poorly done despite that I rented the crap out of some super Nintendo
8028020	8033260	jeopardy games back in the day so I could prove to myself that I really could be a contender
8033260	8034260	on the show.
8034260	8035260	All right.
8035260	8039380	Going around the room here real quick, your favorite game show esque game and what, what,
8039380	8041140	what needs to be the next one?
8041140	8044460	I'll just say everybody's been taking all the great answers.
8044460	8047140	I'll just say you don't know Jack movies.
8047140	8048140	I liked it.
8048140	8049140	They did.
8049140	8051900	They did special editions of like very focused additions back in the day.
8051900	8055140	It's almost a question I wish I could ask them again, but they probably aren't going
8055140	8056140	to go that way again.
8056140	8057940	But uh, yeah, like you don't know Jack movies.
8057940	8059620	I like cause it was cool.
8059620	8060620	They could do DLC.
8060620	8061620	Maybe.
8061620	8062620	I mean, I don't know how much money it costs.
8062620	8066980	I mean, you know, he, he gave a very realistic answer about, you know, about that budget
8066980	8067980	and all that.
8067980	8068980	Yeah.
8068980	8071460	So I would think if there's money to be made, maybe like DLC could go there.
8071460	8076180	And I think that's happened kind of in the, uh, on the app, like the app and the mobile
8076180	8079940	and then the Facebook version now they kind of have themes and stuff like that.
8079940	8080940	It's around Superbowl Sunday.
8080940	8082380	They had like a whole week of like sports stuff.
8082380	8083380	There you go.
8083380	8084380	That was pretty cool.
8084380	8085380	And uh, Oh, let's see.
8085380	8088060	So what are the other parts of the question?
8088060	8090300	What game show do you want to see as, okay, okay, okay.
8090300	8091300	Yeah.
8091300	8095620	I got one that no one else will pick baggage with Jerry Springer.
8095620	8097140	I want that one.
8097140	8101860	I want to try to guess with their packages and then, and then they come up to you and
8101860	8107540	like, yes, I'm a pickpocket, but I still want you to go on a date with me or whatever.
8107540	8108540	I pick pocket.
8108540	8109540	It's like not someone's biggest baggage.
8109540	8110540	Is anyone else?
8110540	8111540	It's such trash.
8111540	8112540	Yes.
8112540	8113540	Okay.
8113540	8114540	Yeah.
8114540	8115540	Someone else has seen baggage.
8115540	8116540	I've seen it.
8116540	8117540	It's trashy as hell.
8117540	8118540	It's so trashy.
8118540	8119540	I love that show.
8119540	8120540	Um, uh, Loki.
8120540	8121540	I don't know.
8121540	8122540	Are you, you don't strike me.
8122540	8123740	Well, you did the twisted and stuff.
8123740	8124740	What was it?
8124740	8125740	What was the favorite of yours growing up?
8125740	8127780	Uh, favorite like game show.
8127780	8128780	Oh, game show.
8128780	8129780	God.
8129780	8134300	Uh, you know, I, I, even though you don't know, Jack was technically not based on a
8134300	8135300	game show.
8135300	8136300	I still consider it one.
8136300	8137300	You know what I mean?
8137300	8138300	Uh, I don't know.
8138300	8139940	I became one.
8139940	8141380	I didn't watch a whole lot of game.
8141380	8146380	I mean just the traditional ones like wheel of fortune, uh, jeopardy, that kind of stuff.
8146380	8148700	But uh, double there.
8148700	8149700	Yeah.
8149700	8152460	I, you know, they did have an NES double there.
8152460	8153460	Yeah.
8153460	8154460	Yeah.
8154500	8158260	Um, God, um, I don't know.
8158260	8159820	I didn't really play a whole ton of those.
8159820	8163580	I think it just played a lot of the like wheel of fortune stuff, you know, on PC, like the
8163580	8166380	old wheel of fortune games and stuff.
8166380	8170580	Um, yeah, I never had like anticipation or anything like that.
8170580	8171580	Right.
8171580	8173780	Uh, and lastly, my answer would be my favorite ones growing up.
8173780	8178720	I played a lot of different ones on the Commodore 64 and my very favorite, another listener
8178720	8181300	already took it, but classic concentration was absolutely my favorite.
8181300	8184440	Like, so trying to solve those puzzles was, was a lot of fun, but I had like family feuds
8184440	8187980	and jeopardy wheel of fortune, which I can't believe nobody said that one, but wheel of
8187980	8188980	fortune.
8188980	8189980	Yeah.
8189980	8190980	I had all that stuff on Commodore 64.
8190980	8191980	That was always a lot of fun.
8191980	8194160	Now the game show that I believe needs to be a game.
8194160	8200180	I've said this time and time again on the show, RuPaul's drag race would make an excellent
8200180	8201180	video.
8201180	8202180	All right.
8202180	8203180	I guess that's more of a reality show than a game.
8203180	8204180	It's a reality competition.
8204180	8205180	Sure.
8205180	8206180	All right.
8206180	8207180	So if survivor works, so does that.
8207180	8208180	All right.
8208180	8209180	I've got another answer.
8209180	8210180	I can't believe none of y'all said this.
8210180	8211180	Cause everybody would play supermarket sweep.
8211180	8212180	Oh, that is a good one.
8212180	8213180	Supermarket sweep.
8213180	8214180	Come on.
8214180	8215180	You could, you could run around.
8215180	8216180	It could be like a first person shooter, but it's just a giant cart.
8216180	8217180	And then like you get to the ham and it's like, you know, press a to ham, ham, ham,
8217180	8218180	ham, ham, ham, ham.
8218180	8219180	Just put it, stack your cart.
8219180	8220180	What?
8220180	8221180	Loki say to the mic.
8221180	8222180	What?
8222180	8223180	I said, that's the only thing connect could work for is just like, you know, grabbing
8223180	8224180	stuff off the shelf.
8224180	8225180	Just flail to grab things off the shelves.
8225180	8226180	Yeah.
8226180	8227180	Yeah.
8227180	8228180	Yeah.
8228180	8229180	Yeah.
8229180	8230180	Yeah.
8231180	8232180	That's the only reason to buy that game.
8232180	8233180	That's the reason right there.
8233180	8234180	There it is.
8234180	8235180	All right.
8235180	8236180	Uh, thank you guys for answering our FUGO question of the week.

8257180	8260820	Thank you guys for answering our FUGO question of the week.
8260820	8263000	Let's get into some more gaming news.
8263000	8264000	Loki.
8264000	8265000	All right.
8265000	8268100	So this is kind of good news, um, with every ... No.
8268100	8274760	Well, they claim this wasn't the cause of the Xbox hacks a while back.
8274760	8280100	Remember, people stealing other peoples' accounts and trying to charge up money and buying stuff,
8280100	8286140	you know, for the FIFA ultimate team including, you know, in game items and coins and stuff
8286140	8287140	like that.
8287140	8294820	Well now, I guess, FIFA 15, the ultimate team mode, they are removing the ability to use
8294820	8299420	trade offers because that was the way, when people were stealing accounts, that they were
8299420	8304160	offloading stuff to other accounts, I guess.
8304160	8312540	So this hopefully will at least de-incentivize people from stealing other peoples' accounts
8312540	8315780	for FIFA 15 things or FIFA ultimate team things.
8315780	8320260	It's about freaking time they do something to de-incentivize that whole thing.
8320260	8322540	Well, how many years ago was that, that that happened?
8322540	8325580	I mean, are they really waiting this long?
8325580	8326580	I don't know.
8326580	8328580	It just seems kind of stupid.
8328580	8332700	But I'm glad they're doing something.
8332700	8334700	I don't know.
8334700	8337180	All right.
8337180	8340940	I don't know a whole lot about ... I mean, I don't really play FIFA online, so it's hard
8340940	8344260	for me to speak a little more like about like, oh, well, they should be doing this or this.
8344260	8347740	I just kind of know that, you know, my account information was hacked and that's exactly
8347740	8350580	what they used it for, was all that stupid FIFA crap.
8350580	8354140	So I'm glad they're putting some deterrence in there.
8354140	8355140	That's good.
8355140	8356500	About eight years after the fact, right?
8356500	8357500	Yes.
8357500	8358500	All right.
8358500	8362420	Anyhow, let's move on to a story about Project Scissors.
8362420	8365700	And I'm not talking about Scissors Sisters.
8365700	8368820	I'm talking about Project Scissors.
8368820	8373180	When you think of scissors in gaming, perhaps you think about Clock Tower, which, speaking
8373180	8374180	of scary games.
8374180	8375180	Did you ever play Clock Tower?
8375180	8376180	I did.
8376180	8377180	Blocko?
8377180	8378180	I like that game.
8378180	8379180	That is the scariest game.
8379180	8382180	When you look in a mirror and then the hands reach out and grab you, I'm like, oh, gosh.
8382180	8383180	Right, right.
8383180	8390060	So anyway, Hifume Kuno, who is the creator of Clock Tower, and his studio, Nude Maker,
8390060	8395820	which that's ... Nude Maker is the name of the studio, which, okay, maybe we are talking
8395820	8399140	about scissoring in a different sense, but anyway, they have announced that they will
8399140	8405260	be developing a horror franchise for Vita, iOS, Android, and it is a spiritual successor
8405260	8406260	to Clock Tower.
8406260	8407620	It is called Project Scissors.
8407620	8409740	That may not be the final name.
8409740	8414000	This game will be on a luxury cruise liner in the middle of the ocean, so you're stuck
8414000	8415000	on it.
8415000	8419820	And when the ship sails, a series of gruesome and mysterious murders begin to take place,
8419820	8426100	including to the ship's crew, and the ship is soon basically sitting there at sea, and
8426100	8427400	you've got nowhere else to go.
8427400	8431840	So as a passenger trapped on the ship, the player will be tasked with solving the murder
8431840	8436640	mystery to ensure your survival and the innocent passengers.
8436640	8441880	By the way, because we talked earlier about creature designs in Silent Hill, well, Masahiro
8441880	8446220	Ito, who did the creature designs for the Silent Hill series, oh yeah, he's working
8446220	8449320	on this too as a prop designer.
8449320	8456400	And Takashi Shimizu, who directed Ju-On, which we know as The Grudge here, he is a creative
8456400	8461840	producer and directing a live-action teaser trailer for the game.
8461840	8464760	You will not be sleeping that night, it sounds like.
8464760	8466920	That's already that premise right there.
8466920	8469180	You are stuck on a boat at sea.
8469180	8471080	That's a pretty clever premise for a horror.
8471080	8472080	I'm surprised it hasn't been done.
8472080	8474200	Maybe it has been done, but I haven't heard of it.
8474200	8475200	I'm just glad.
8475200	8479280	It sounds like survival horror is really making a comeback, or at least horror games in general.
8479280	8480800	So I hope that's the case.
8480800	8484160	Seems like the genre was kind of dying off for a while there.
8484160	8491040	Now the only weird thing about this is that it's, remember, it's Vita, iOS, and Android.
8491040	8493520	There's nothing in there about the modern consoles.
8493520	8498040	So this is more of, and Vita is essentially, it's probably an extension of the mobile development.
8498040	8504480	So again, that means it's only touch controls, so who knows what that could all involve.
8504480	8507040	It doesn't sound like it's going to be very action-y, but again, who knows?
8507040	8508040	I don't know.
8508040	8510880	I hope it works like the Walking Dead games from Telltale.
8510880	8513800	If it works like those, then those are great, because those games have some good scares
8513800	8514800	to them too.
8514800	8515800	That's a good point.
8515800	8516800	I hope it's that quality.
8516800	8517800	Yeah.
8517800	8522240	Well, we'll see when more information comes out about Project Scissors, which may or may
8522240	8523240	not be the final name.
8523240	8525680	Flacco, you got something for us?
8525680	8530480	Yeah, the White House hosted a game jam focused on education.
8530480	8536080	So let's see, there were like 100 developers there, and it was sponsored by the White House,
8536080	8540680	specifically focused on education, and there were also science and technology advisors
8540680	8542760	from the Obama administration.
8542760	8547080	They hosted it, and the attendees included Far Cry 4 contributing developer Red Storm
8547080	8551880	Entertainment, Angry Birds developer Rovio, and Glass Lab, a collaborative effort which
8551880	8557000	includes members from the Entertainment Software Association and EA.
8557000	8561400	So let's see, it says they retain all rights to the concepts they cooked up during the
8561400	8565320	jam, and while there doesn't seem to be an official gallery, there's plenty of photos
8565320	8571620	and stuff on the WH, for White House, game jam hashtag on Twitter.
8571620	8576340	So I guess search the hashtag on Twitter, and you can see some photos and stuff from
8576340	8577340	that.
8577340	8580780	That's something pretty neat though, when you hear that the White House is having a
8580780	8582780	video game jam.
8582780	8587620	I mean, yeah, it's all about educational games, but think about all the educational games
8587620	8592340	that we grew up on, like Number Munchers and Organ Trail.
8592340	8595740	There can be some pretty cool educational games, believe it or not.
8595740	8597340	Carmen Sandiego, right?
8597340	8601060	Or did you ever play Odell Lake?
8601380	8606820	I know of Odell Lake, because that was by the, what was it, the Minnesota...
8606820	8607820	I don't remember.
8607820	8610020	The same company that made all the Organ Trail.
8610020	8614460	Again, like I said, I got all my games growing up, hand-me-downs from my uncles.
8614460	8617260	This game was on, I think it was Converse 64.
8617260	8621220	And yeah, you get to play as a fish, if you had to go swim, like what kind of fish will
8621220	8626740	eat you, and what fish you can eat, or what to avoid the hook, swim shallow.
8626740	8630020	There was a crazy little, and I hope they came up with some interesting, you know, games
8630020	8631020	there.
8631020	8633420	I remember that same group, I remember this one, nobody else has heard of this, called
8633420	8634420	Rocky's Boots.
8634420	8635420	Did you ever...
8635420	8636420	Oh, no, I don't remember that one.
8636420	8638340	It taught basic computer programming.
8638340	8639340	Oh, that's awesome.
8639340	8640740	It was about, it was like logic.
8640740	8645820	I remember you would set up logic gates, and if, then, and, and, ors, and all this stuff,
8645820	8649860	and it was like, you know, it was pretty heavy-duty stuff for a kid, but you know, if you were
8649860	8655340	like a big nerd kid like me, like Rocky's Boots was awesome, because, you know, you
8655340	8659500	got to learn a bit about programming, so hopefully the next generation of that may be somewhere
8659500	8660500	here at this game jam.
8660500	8664100	Yeah, and game jams turn out some pretty cool ideas, and like, I think Bobby just mentioned
8664100	8669260	it, he, you know, covered that one for his show, the CDC one, and there were some really
8669260	8672460	cool ideas in that, so I would hope that there'd be some cool ideas come out of this White
8672460	8673460	House one too.
8673460	8677460	Right, and you know, we talked earlier about GamerX being funded, and they're talking about
8677460	8684820	doing a jam as well, which, you know, could present some very diverse ideas, like I thought,
8684820	8689020	you know, some of the games I saw at last year's GamerX, things like Triad, which is
8689020	8695380	based around the concept of being in a three-way relationship, it was a puzzle game, you know,
8695380	8699260	definitely not something you hear about every day as an idea for a game, so, you know, very
8699260	8703740	diverse types of ideas, so yeah, I think you can get those out of the box ideas at a game
8703740	8709540	jam, it's pretty awesome, yeah, very cool, all right, let's move on, Loki, all right,
8709540	8715540	and so they've, and I'm surprised that they have yet another dev kit coming up, but Oculus
8715540	8720300	has a new dev kit coming out called Crescent Bay, I believe this is gonna be the final
8720300	8725240	dev kit that they have before the retail version comes out, but some improvements of it, it's
8725240	8731300	got a higher resolution, higher refresh rate, 360 degree tracking, because it has LEDs on
8731300	8740940	its back, and removable integrated audio, so that's pretty cool, and, I don't know,
8740940	8748740	is this available for pre-order, that's all I really wanna know, looks pretty cool, Bobby
8748740	8755260	is in chat in all caps, wrong, it's not a dev kit, wrong, wrong, red light, red light,
8755260	8762740	would you screw up, Loki, I don't know, I thought it was a dev kit, is this the final
8762740	8770540	thing, is this what we're getting, fine, it's a prototype, whatever you wanna call it, prototype,
8770540	8774900	I think it's gonna be a dev kit, but it's a prototype.
8774900	8780400	I can see where, I can see where people are kinda getting that idea, but also at the same
8780400	8784660	time why it's not officially considered one, because there was, you know, very much those
8784660	8788340	baseline kits that came out, and this is something different than that, but.
8788340	8792140	All right, fine, well if they start selling it as a dev kit in a couple months from now,
8792140	8798820	then I told you so, but until then, you win this one, Bobby.
8798820	8808140	All right, I was teasing we'd talk about this, so we'll move on to this, since Loki's clearly
8808140	8814300	misinformed on the Oculus bit, here's the thing, I might be misinformed on this too,
8814300	8817680	because this isn't something I super followed, but it's about something interesting that's
8817680	8823080	happening in Marin, California, let me tell you about Marin County, California, all the
8823080	8830080	people you saw in the box art of anticipation probably came from Marin, California, which
8830080	8836080	is, let's just say it's home to a very affluent, it's north of San Francisco, it's the city's
8836080	8841640	like what, San Rafael's there, right, and you know, the Sausalito, everyone's house
8841640	8845640	is like on a cliff overlooking the ocean, they're looking at the beach, and it's very,
8846600	8849600	I used to deliver TVs up there, I actually tore up someone's private elevator by accident.
8849600	8856600	Uh oh, how many brunches did you interrupt going over there to Marin County, well, in
8856600	8863600	Marin County, the district attorney held a buyback day for residents' toy guns and violent
8863600	8869320	video games, and this was to highlight issues of domestic violence in October's Domestic
8869360	8876360	Violence Awareness Month, working with the Center for Domestic Peace and Ben & Jerry's
8876480	8881480	Ice Cream for the event, the event is coming up, it's going to be October 4th at Novato,
8881480	8885440	that's another city in Marin, Novato Police Headquarters, if you participate, you get
8885440	8889920	ice cream! Novato, you're kind of getting out of the swanky part at that point though.
8889920	8893320	Yeah, that's true. You're getting close to Sonoma County. The district attorney said
8893320	8897920	in a written message, quote, as we know, domestic violence incidents almost always have children
8897960	8902720	present, and these children develop over time in printed images of the family violence.
8902720	8906760	These children then carry those experiences into their adult lives, and often repeat the
8906760	8912640	pattern of violence in their own family units. So, why get rid of all the guns in violent
8912640	8919640	video games? Because, quote, it's a chance to change today's modeling patterns. Okay.
8920640	8926240	There was previously a program that would buy back real guns, and 857 weapons that paid
8926240	8933240	out more than $100,000. So, there you go. Again, violent video games, you know, I'm
8934280	8939280	not trying to belittle what is a very real subject here of domestic violence and all
8939280	8946280	this other stuff, but at the same time, I'm not sure where violent video games, I mean,
8946320	8952200	I don't buy your kids violent video games. Well, at least you got, oh, sorry. Oh, go
8952240	8956440	ahead. I was going to say, seriously though, how much ice cream am I getting for violent
8956440	8960440	video games? Because that doesn't seem like a very, like if I'm getting like a free double
8960440	8964200	scoop for like, you know, turning Grand Theft Auto 5, that's not a very good ratio. Maybe
8964200	8969840	a pint, and it's like, oh, come on. GameStop will give you a better trade. Exactly. Not
8969840	8972120	that I ever... Well, you gotta like that at least they're not putting them on the same
8972120	8977600	level. Guns, they give you money. Video games, they give you ice cream. So, see, it's not
8977600	8980840	that bad. But here's what I want to know. What are they going to do with all the games
8980880	8987880	they collect? Take them to the games. And the cycle continues. They're going to take
8987920	8994920	them down to Oakland and sell them. Oh my gosh. Take them to another county and let
8994960	9000480	it be their problem. Come on. Sonoma County. Come on. Well, here's the thing. If, I don't
9000480	9004800	want them to throw them away, so Novato, if anybody from Novato is out there listening,
9004800	9010280	I will, we volunteer to take all your violent video games. I would be, I'm like, yay, free.
9010280	9014360	There's no kids here. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. I will happily play
9014360	9017840	all of your violent video games. Thirty years from now, we're going to be digging up that
9017840	9023820	landfill in Novato. We're like, look at all these games. Microsoft will pay a lot of money
9023820	9028040	to make a documentary about digging up the violent video games that were thrown away
9028040	9038040	for ice cream. The Novato landfill. Oh my gosh. All right. Demix in our chat room at
9038080	9044800	live.vognetwork.com says, so if I kill and eat someone, can I blame Shakespeare? Apparently.
9044800	9049600	Can I trade in copies of Shakespeare plays for like a milkshake? I mean, I don't know.
9049600	9054640	I'll take McDonald's. All right. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
9054640	9059800	trying to give some insight to the story that Loki was talking about earlier. Saying it's
9059800	9064880	a prototype that's going to lead to a future version. Crystal Cove was demoed at CES. It
9064880	9071240	was never released. It led to the DK2. So Oculus regularly releases prototypes of hardware
9071240	9075480	that they are building internally. There were two that were built between the DK1 and DK2,
9075480	9080660	the HD prototype and Crystal Grove. Crescent Bay is the first iteration of what's between
9080660	9086740	DK2 and whatever's next. Either the third dev kit or the consumer version. There will
9086740	9091320	most likely be another new prototype at CES. So there you go. This is, this is a little
9091320	9098360	stepping stone to whatever's next. The official prototype. So it could lead to a dev kit.
9098360	9102560	It could possibly. Who knows? I'm hoping they're getting closer to the real thing. They are.
9102560	9106640	I mean, obviously if it's coming out, assuming that they're going to stick to the summer,
9106640	9112920	you know, timeframe, that's, you know, about a year away. All right. Nine months away.
9112920	9117560	All right. Anyhow, uh, let's see. Back to the mailbag. That's right. This is the time
9117560	9122200	of the show. We're going to open up the mailbag, uh, participate at orange lounge. Radio.com
9122200	9127880	is the place to send us an email. And, uh, every week we dive into the mailbag and, uh,
9127880	9135320	read some things that you have submitted to us. However, in the mailbag this week, nothing.
9135320	9139760	That's right. We have no emails this week. Stop the music. You guys have failed to participate
9139760	9142600	with our show this week. What is up with that? We were getting a lot of emails in the previous
9142600	9149000	week. Scared everyone away with her. A grammar threat. Guess what? Some weeks it's going
9149000	9152880	to be me and I don't care. They can't look any worse than my text message. I just kept
9152880	9159280	the rolling thread of like, you know, playing more Kim Kardashian music. I should have shut
9159280	9163560	up. Damn. Yeah. That would be a great idea. Cause then when the break rolls around, you'll
9163560	9171320	know what's happened. It's like, it's like the canary in the coal mine. Kardashian music
9171320	9177840	is playing fast. All right. So again, if you want to participate with a future episode
9177840	9181640	of our show, participate at orange lounge radio.com perhaps you would like to send a
9181640	9186520	complete dissertation about Loki's, uh, a lack of knowledge on Oculus development. To
9186520	9191280	be fair. I was a little distracted because once, you know, it was mentioned that nudes
9191280	9198400	leaked out. I had to go find them on my, on my internet. I don't want the po po coming
9198400	9202560	over here. The authority is going to come after you. It's on, you know, I'm going to
9202560	9206360	be careful. You let into your house. There is a gay couple that lives here. We do not
9206360	9212120	care about Kardashian nudity. So which credit? I didn't care about Kardashian either. No,
9212120	9219720	seriously. I didn't is, but which one is it? It's Kim. It's okay. She has a sex tape. And
9219720	9227880	it's, it's shit with Ray J. It's the fucking shit you already saw. Shame. Shame. Shame.
9227880	9234880	I've ever Levine on there. I mean, who cares? That's crazy. Any houses had to see as curious.
9234880	9240880	Any dudes? Uh, yeah. Who? I don't know. I don't have her. Levine's nameless boyfriend.
9240880	9247880	Zachary Quinto. No, I would let you know. I'd be like, dude, hold on. Stop the music. Rob's
9247880	9252880	like, I'm suddenly contributing to this problem. This is so wrong. This is a very wrong thing
9252880	9259880	you guys are doing. I just have to see how wrong this is. Exactly. This is, this is seven
9259880	9264880	inches of wrong right here. All right. Um, let's move on to the F use of the week. Cause
9264880	9269880	uh, every week, especially those when we don't get emails, we get a little bit angsty and
9269880	9289880	uh, we let y'all know about it. I just want to point out Avril Lavigne's boyfriend is
9289880	9294880	the dude from Nickelback. Wait, their main dude from Nickelback? Yes. She married the
9294880	9302880	guy from Nickelback. So if that leaked like all kinds of no, there isn't enough nope in
9302880	9313880	the house. Look at this leaked photograph. That's my scene. Ladies and gentlemen, Flaco's
9313880	9318880	last episode because he'll never be invited back. Just so you know. Uh, let's go to the
9318880	9325880	FUs of the week. Loki. Um, all right, so I guess FU2, uh, the complicated message is
9325880	9331880	Medi-Cal because signing up for government anything is just a pain in the ass. It's like
9331880	9337880	hoop after hoop after hoop. Hopefully almost done. That's it. Let me know if you have any
9337880	9348880	issues. All right. All right. Uh, let's see. Flaco FU to David Knight T on Marvel puzzle
9348880	9354880	class. You're like two points behind me. I could tell you're about to pass me. So thanks a
9354880	9359880	lot. I'll never get number one in one of these tournaments, but there's like an hour or
9359880	9364880	something left. Everyone plays in the last hour. I'm going to get crushed. It's cool. I
9364880	9370880	didn't, I didn't even care to be top in here, but I did so well. Uh, my FU goes to my back
9370880	9375880	because it's been killing me all day because, uh, as my roommate likes to joke, we have
9375880	9380880	Jumanji going on in the backyard and I finally decided to tackle that beast this week and
9380880	9386880	I've been making progress on killing Jumanji back there and uh, I like hurt my back so
9386880	9392880	bad and my arm like, Oh, that was a workout. That's not Jumanji. My backyard is fucking
9392880	9396880	Jumanji. Well it isn't now. I took care of some of the worst of it. Well there's literally
9396880	9401880	like a vine growing. Like it was growing from one side of the yard over my patio to the
9401880	9405880	other side and all I did was like, I'm going to turn that vine around and now it's going
9405880	9410880	back to the other side of the yard again. But it's a stupid fucking, I don't even know what
9410880	9414880	it is. I have a picture of it cause I took a picture of the whatever plant it is. I can't
9414880	9418880	fucking kill this thing. I got a nuke it now. I think it's seriously, I'm going to have
9418880	9424880	to go, you know, nuclear on this thing and just destroy everything in that lawn cause
9424880	9428880	I can't kill this vine. It just keeps coming back. I'm just, I'm just telling you, bless
9428880	9432880	whoever invented a weed whackers cause those that you can clean up a yard real quick with
9432880	9437880	one of those, but you'll also throw out your back. Yeah, those things are awesome though.
9437880	9442880	I had a push mower. You want to talk about back pain manual. It's like, I'm going to
9442880	9446880	be good for the environment. I'm going to buy a push mower. Oh my gosh, I want to die.
9446880	9454880	Screw mother earth. F you. All right, there it is. Your F use of the week in lieu of your
9454880	9458880	lack of emails. People. All right, just a couple more stories and then we're going to
9458880	9461880	open up the Skype line. Hopefully we'll get a little more participation there at one eight
9461880	9466880	seven seven game. O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. Uh, let's do a couple
9466880	9470880	more stories here. Loki. Well, if you're living in China and you wanted to get an Xbox one
9470880	9474880	while you're on the way a little longer, um, unfortunately it was supposed to come for
9474880	9479880	our large Chinese audience. You never know. You never know to me. Well, to be honest,
9479880	9483880	do we have any listeners in China? I'd like to know to be honest. I mean, they haven't,
9483880	9487880	I mean they haven't had game consoles for a long time cause they were kind of banned.
9487880	9493880	So now this being released in China is kind of hopefully a bigger thing than it was in
9493880	9501880	Japan. I mean, cause it's not so big in Japan, but um, it's cool that it's being released
9501880	9506880	in other parts of the world. So I, you know, props to them. But uh, yeah, unfortunately,
9506880	9511880	um, is not coming out on Tuesday like it was supposed to be, but sometime before the end
9511880	9515880	of the year they're saying, um, can't they just redirect some of the consoles that didn't
9515880	9520880	sell in Japan? Like, can't they just kind of one possibly. I mean, but they were saying,
9520880	9524880	you know, this would be the first foreign video game device officially sold on Chinese
9524880	9531880	soil in 14 years. Wow. So, um, yeah, it's kind of a fit. No, it's officially sold. Yes,
9531880	9535880	officially. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure you could buy it elsewhere and import it. China where
9535880	9542880	we got the V like the VI. That was the Chinese. They had a ton of those TV plug and play devices
9542880	9548880	that was, Oh yeah. The work around. Oh yeah. So well, if you are in China listening to
9548880	9551880	this show, then I want to know about it because I just assumed we were firewalled over there.
9551880	9556880	So if, uh, you can hear us in China, let us know. That'd be awesome. So, all right.
9556880	9562880	Uh, anyhow, uh, one more story for you guys. Speaking of culture, uh, I can't think of
9562880	9569880	any place more cultured than Texas. Okay. Maybe I can, but here's a, all joking aside,
9569880	9575880	this is pretty neat. The video game history museum, uh, going to be having a static home
9575880	9581880	and, uh, that home will be in Frisco, Texas. Not to be confused with San Francisco where
9581880	9587880	a lot of game companies actually are Frisco, Texas, uh, had, uh, has approved a deal that
9587880	9594880	will grant the nonprofit museum, uh, a 10,400 square foot face space in the Frisco discovery
9594880	9599880	center. When you run the words Frisco and space together, you get face. Um, so there
9599880	9604880	you go. In April, they're expecting the national video game museum. 1.0 should be ready for
9604880	9609880	business. $800,000 for building improvements that Frisco is going to spend on this and
9609880	9614880	extra parking. Um, $100,000 in donations. Uh, the museum matched it with raised funds.
9614880	9619880	Uh, this is, you know, all joking aside about the location, that's a pretty cool that there
9619880	9623880	will be like a space like that. You know, we have a pinball museum in the Bay area and
9623880	9626880	they still have yet to go. I really need to know. Yeah, it's an Alameda. I think it's
9626880	9629880	an Alameda. So, uh, yeah, I gotta go check that out. But yeah, there's going to be a
9629880	9634880	video game museum in, in Texas. Um, I doubt this is the same thing, but I know they were
9634880	9638880	talking about doing one in Iowa, like where twin galaxies was born. They were going to
9638880	9642880	do one that remember where all the eighties contests and they all, there was like a time
9642880	9646880	magazine shoot out there years ago and it's like an hour away from the nearest airport.
9646880	9650880	I think my old boss was in that time magazine. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He used to hold the record
9650880	9655880	for pole position. That's like played it with his feet or something. I don't get why people
9655880	9661880	do these things. I just know that. Why not? Uh, so there you go. Uh, yeah, that's going
9661880	9667880	to be in Frisco, Texas. Now. I don't know. Uh, maybe, maybe Texas is a big place. How
9667880	9672880	far is this from Travis Donovan? Is this cause maybe he can go do a report on this. I don't
9672880	9675880	know where Frisco, Texas is, but I know like the number one rule about San Francisco and
9675880	9681880	its nicknames is you don't call it Frisco. I know that from living in the city for a
9681880	9687880	while or San Fran. You can call it San Fran. Anything but Frisco. I think anything but
9687880	9691880	Frisco or maybe this is why they don't want to be confused with the video game museum
9691880	9695880	maybe. All right. Uh, there you go. That is it for our news tonight. We're going to open
9695880	9699880	up the Skype line now. One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge
9699880	9703880	radio. Here's your chance to have a say on anything we've talked about tonight. Uh, you
9703880	9707880	want to reminisce on game show games with us? That's fine. You want to talk about Minecraft
9707880	9711880	or anything we've talked about. Now's a great time to do that. Let me go over to Loki real
9711880	9717880	quick and see if he has any last minute stories while I pull up Twitter. I did actually. Um,
9717880	9722880	I had a story regarding the retron five. Apparently people have been digging into the code of
9722880	9729880	it and they found out, guess what? It's stealing a bunch of code from other emulators. They
9729880	9736880	literally just stole literal code from different emulators out there to build it in there.
9736880	9740880	And unfortunately those, you know, the other emulators that were out there releasing their
9740880	9745880	GPL, um, viral license. But I don't know what to think because it's really not cool that
9745880	9749880	they stole somebody's code, but at the same time, what were emulators kind of built to
9749880	9753880	do? They're not built a steel code. They're built to emulate console. Yeah. All right.
9753880	9759880	I know. I know. But so I'm just saying there is a, I, and that may not be the popular thing
9759880	9763880	for me to say, I'm sorry, but you, I just, I see a little sliver of irony and there's
9763880	9769880	just a little sliver, but is somebody taking that code and selling it for money isn't cool.
9769880	9773880	And then they were also trying to change parts of it to hide the fact that they stole it.
9773880	9779880	But you know, they did some comparisons and like there's, it's pretty much the exact,
9779880	9784880	I'm going to keep it real though. I still kind of want one. I hear they're really shoddy.
9784880	9788880	Are they? Yeah, that's too bad. Maybe I'll wait for somebody to perfect the technology
9788880	9791880	a little bit, but anyway, we got a call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange
9791880	9796880	launch radio. Who's this? The one and only Rama. Hey Rama, how are you doing buddy?
9796880	9801880	I'm doing pretty good. I'm stuffed from all the seafood and ribs and barbecue over the weekend.
9801880	9807880	Hey, did you hear my discussion on a Brazilian meat cuisine? What?
9807880	9813880	I want you to know, not even five to 10 minutes from my job, there are at least two to three
9813880	9819880	blocks full of Tarasco places. Oh, delicioso.
9819880	9824880	Well, you know what makes it even much more delicious? When the company picks up the tab.
9824880	9831880	Oh, indeed, indeed. Well, I'm just going to add that to my list of reasons to come back east.
9831880	9836880	I'm overdue. Well, there you go. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9836880	9840880	Let me tell you about anticipation. This is a game I used to play the living hell out of as a kid.
9840880	9846880	I mean, it got to the point where I could play it on very hard and solve every single one of the puzzles.
9846880	9853880	Can't do it now, but back then I could do it within like two dice roll. I knew exactly what it was.
9853880	9859880	You would be surprised what you'll remember from your youth. Go watch one of these long plays on YouTube,
9859880	9863880	like we were doing in studio. And as the thing starts drawing, like you'll remember, you'll just be like,
9863880	9868880	oh, it's this, like sausage. Rama, how did I know that? How did I know that? Because I remembered it from when I was a kid.
9868880	9874880	Rob, the fact that you know that it was sausage, really? Shut up, shut up. Heart.
9874880	9882880	Anyway, yeah, anticipation was a lot, a lot of fun. But yeah, that's the only thing is, is that, you know,
9882880	9887880	you didn't have things like DLC expansion packs and additional questions and things like that on cartridges.
9887880	9891880	So once you had them all memorized, the game was kind of done, right?
9891880	9896880	Yeah, it's sort of like the old pressure look because it was the same patterns over and over.
9896880	9898880	And once you knew what it was, that was it, you know?
9898880	9903880	But then again, you could say that about a lot of video games. Once you know the pattern, you can beat it, no problem.
9903880	9904880	And the challenge is gone, right?
9904880	9909880	Mm-hmm. See, anticipation is a game I would like to see updated and not for nothing.
9909880	9912880	That would probably be a convincing reason for me to get a Wii U.
9912880	9915880	Oh, look at that. Even so far to say the Wii U.
9915880	9919880	Now, here's the most important question I'm going to ask you about your anticipation addiction, Rama.
9919880	9924880	Is it the trumpet, the heels, the ice cream or the teddy bear?
9924880	9925880	Trumpet.
9925880	9928880	Oh, you're a trumpet fan. I can see that. I can see that.
9928880	9929880	Yes.
9929880	9930880	All right.
9930880	9936880	And what's interesting when you talk about the game shows is that I just remember one thing is,
9936880	9941880	I have a friend who goes on a lot of anime and other conventions, and he runs game shows.
9941880	9946880	And he takes, like, classic concentration, Scrabble, match game.
9946880	9951880	He writes his own code and he makes it themed for whatever the convention is.
9952880	9957880	And this is something that's pretty cool and it's, like, quite popular at most conventions.
9957880	9963880	Yeah, there was a guy at All Games back when, and I don't know if he still does this,
9963880	9966880	but he did that at Pinning Arcade Expo, like a video game-related thing.
9966880	9970880	And Bobby probably knows more on that than I do because I never actually saw it happen.
9970880	9975880	But I know it exists in some form on the video game circuit as well,
9975880	9980880	but I know on the anime where there are more conventions to do that kind of stuff,
9980880	9982880	you see it a little more.
9982880	9983880	Mm-hmm.
9983880	9984880	Yeah.
9984880	9985880	And one more thing before I get out of here.
9985880	9986880	Yeah, of course.
9986880	9989880	Now, one year I actually hosted a game show and I did match game.
9989880	9994880	And what's cool about the conventions is they will always be two versions.
9994880	9999880	You have the one for all audiences, daytime, and then you have the 18-plus stuff,
9999880	10001880	which is pretty much anything goes.
10001880	10002880	Nice.
10002880	10007880	I haven't filmed, I have the footage somewhere, but it got really raunchy.
10007880	10009880	I mean, almost offensive.
10009880	10015880	Let's just say to the point I was banned from hosting any game shows for two years.
10015880	10020880	But what was funny is there were staffers in the room who were, like,
10020880	10022880	loving every single minute of it.
10022880	10026880	You know, it was my dream when I was in the fourth grade to be a game show host
10026880	10028880	when they asked, you know, what do you want to do when you grow up?
10028880	10029880	I said, I want to be a game show host.
10029880	10031880	I want to be like Bob Barker.
10031880	10034880	And, yeah, I have this instead.
10034880	10037880	But, you know, you have me thinking when you're talking about all this stuff
10037880	10041880	on the anime convention circuit, you know, I could propose a panel for GamerX.
10041880	10043880	Well, yeah.
10043880	10044880	I mean, why not?
10044880	10047880	I mean, code up a fun game and go for it.
10047880	10053880	I mean, and you could get away with doing match game because that's just asking
10053880	10055880	for it right there if you do match game.
10055880	10060880	I think that would be a lot of fun to do a match game live like that or something.
10060880	10062880	Match game or a dating game.
10062880	10064880	Those are two are really popular.
10064880	10066880	All right.
10066880	10069880	Well, my friend, do you have anything else on your mind tonight before we let you go?
10069880	10074880	I hate the fact I have to work from 8 to 5 now.
10074880	10076880	Aw.
10076880	10077880	That means I have to get up at 6.
10077880	10079880	You have a normal person's hours job.
10079880	10082880	I've always had a normal person's hours job.
10082880	10087880	My schedule used to be 9 to 6, but now the tech department is down two people,
10087880	10089880	so it has to come in and do the early shift.
10089880	10090880	Oh.
10090880	10091880	Yeah.
10091880	10093880	That means more coffee.
10093880	10094880	All right.
10094880	10095880	Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.
10095880	10096880	Good luck with the new shift.
10096880	10097880	Thanks a lot, bro.
10097880	10098880	All right.
10098880	10099880	See you later.
10099880	10100880	Later.
10100880	10101880	You know, you could be dark soccer.
10101880	10103880	I brought another part of the reason she isn't here tonight.
10103880	10105880	Even if she was here, she's only going to be able to be here for the first half
10105880	10108880	because she's got a lot of stuff going on at work, I guess.
10108880	10112880	And so in the morning, she has to be there early for some type of overtime thing.
10112880	10115880	So she's probably in bed by now even if she was listening.
10115880	10119880	So I'm sure she can feel your pain there, Rama, a little bit.
10119880	10124880	Anyway, if you have a call or some thoughts, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a user name on Skype,
10124880	10125880	Orange Lounge Radio.
10125880	10129880	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, Rob, match game where you do your Charles Nelson Riley voice.
10129880	10130880	I'll think about it.
10130880	10133880	I actually, now you've got my gears turning and I'm like,
10133880	10135880	this might actually be a heck of a lot of fun to do something like that,
10135880	10137880	like a match game type of panel.
10137880	10139880	That would be a lot of fun.
10139880	10141880	All right.
10141880	10142880	Let's see.
10142880	10144880	While we wait for some calls, any other last minute stories, Logan?
10144880	10145880	Yes.
10145880	10150880	There are some details about the new features in Grand Theft Auto 5 and online
10150880	10156880	for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One PC that leaked out actually from Rockstar Games
10156880	10159880	and then they immediately deleted the page that it was on.
10159880	10162880	But of course, you know, the internet takes photos.
10162880	10165880	So some of the features that they're going to be adding to the game,
10165880	10170880	a brand new first person mode for vehicles that show in the interior of vehicles,
10170880	10173880	including working speedometers, talkometers, dash lights and more.
10173880	10176880	Brand new first person mode while on foot.
10176880	10178880	New Easter eggs in story mode.
10178880	10181880	New animals roaming Los Santos.
10181880	10183880	Animals in Grand Theft Auto online.
10183880	10188880	And then of course, a newly overhauled character selection screen.
10188880	10192880	You can transfer your stuff from the current gen to the next gen.
10192880	10196880	Or last gen to current gen, I guess.
10196880	10200880	When do we officially stop saying next gen?
10200880	10202880	It's current gen now.
10202880	10204880	I don't know. When do we stop?
10204880	10207880	Mike got it.
10207880	10209880	You call it current gen.
10209880	10210880	All right.
10210880	10213880	1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, OrangeLaundrio.
10213880	10214880	Just a few tweets tonight.
10214880	10216880	Dark Tetsuya is sending us some tweets saying,
10216880	10220880	I had to plug this Kickstarter for an epic game room bar here in town.
10220880	10222880	Save Point Tavern.
10222880	10225880	Imagine a bar restaurant with almost any game you can imagine,
10225880	10229880	like video games, classic new RPGs, CCC board games, along with food and drinks.
10229880	10231880	And yes, classic arcades too.
10231880	10233880	So I'm looking at this Kickstarter.
10233880	10234880	They made it.
10234880	10236880	So I guess this is something that's going to happen.
10236880	10240880	But yeah, they're going to make a tabletop and gaming bar in Sacramento.
10240880	10243880	I will have to read more about this because I'm curious.
10243880	10246880	I would like to know what is the other...
10246880	10250880	Because I worry, like, this is a great idea,
10250880	10256880	but sometimes making things happen is a little harder to actually do.
10256880	10258880	That didn't seem like a lot of money.
10259880	10261880	That doesn't seem like a lot of money.
10261880	10262880	So I don't know.
10262880	10264880	I wonder what kind of space they're talking about there.
10264880	10266880	Well, now they're talking about stretch goals.
10266880	10269880	Like, for their stretch goal number one, $28,000.
10269880	10272880	A 100-inch projection screen with surround.
10272880	10275880	Aren't those a couple thousand dollars by themselves?
10275880	10276880	I don't know.
10276880	10277880	I don't know.
10277880	10279880	Well, that's up from their, what is it?
10279880	10281880	23 is their starting goal?
10281880	10283880	So I guess, yeah, five grand more.
10283880	10284880	Well, good luck.
10285880	10288880	This is going to be a heck of an undertaking for you guys.
10288880	10292880	Speaking of local stuff, a new game store just opened up in my neck of the woods.
10292880	10293880	Oh, yeah?
10293880	10294880	It's an independent game store.
10294880	10299880	And they have, like, any of their used games you can pop in and play.
10299880	10305880	They have some consoles right there you can play in one of these easy chairs that the speaker's built in.
10305880	10309880	But you have to pay, like, per the time you play.
10309880	10310880	I already figured what the prices were.
10310880	10313880	We got to pay for, like, half-hour, hour, two-hour increments or something like that.
10313880	10316880	They wouldn't want people to loiter there all day playing their games.
10316880	10318880	Yeah, obviously they're going to charge for that.
10318880	10320880	But it seemed like a nice little place.
10320880	10322880	That was like that, um, what was it?
10322880	10326880	That gaming place that we went to the first time at E3 or whatever.
10326880	10328880	Was that the first E3?
10328880	10329880	I think it was the first E3, remember?
10329880	10331880	With all games and stuff.
10331880	10332880	The place I was talking about?
10332880	10333880	The place from the article?
10333880	10335880	Oh, you're talking about the arena lounge or whatever that was.
10335880	10336880	Yeah, the arena lounge.
10336880	10340880	Yeah, it sounds very much like the arena lounge because they have their custom, like, chairs with speakers built in.
10340880	10341880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10341880	10342880	Stuff like that.
10342880	10347880	It's mostly, it's a game store, but then they're like, you know, you can, you know, bring your own games in.
10347880	10348880	You can play them right here if you wanted to.
10348880	10353880	Or, if anything that we have used, you can pay to check it out first before, you know, we sell it.
10353880	10356880	So, I just wouldn't, I had to go in and check it out.
10356880	10357880	Yeah.
10357880	10359880	It's interesting to see something that's not a GameStop, you know, opening up.
10359880	10360880	Like an Instagram.
10360880	10364880	And, like, how do these places stay alive when you hear that GameStop's such a behemoth, you know?
10364880	10365880	Yeah.
10365880	10368880	There's another one down a little bit further away in my neighborhood as well.
10368880	10370880	And it's been open for a while.
10370880	10371880	I forget what it's called.
10371880	10374880	Well, I think there's some people that when they get really turned off, they're like, I'm never going to shop here again.
10374880	10377880	You know, they mean it, and they want to go somewhere else.
10377880	10380880	Yeah, good deal. They run, like, monthly specials.
10380880	10384880	They had Infamous, Second Son for, like, 30 bucks, which is cheaper than you can get it on Amazon.
10384880	10388880	So, I was like, hey, good for them if they're going to do specials like that on new games.
10388880	10389880	All right.
10389880	10391880	I'm going to put out one more call for phone calls.
10391880	10393880	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10393880	10394880	Our username on Skype.
10394880	10395880	Orange Lounge Radio.
10395880	10397880	I don't know what's in the air this week.
10397880	10401880	We didn't get e-mail. Like, some weeks we get flooded with e-mails and calls and can't get them all.
10401880	10404880	And tonight it's like, no, we'll let you.
10404880	10405880	Is there something on TV?
10405880	10407880	Yes, there's something on TV tonight.
10407880	10408880	Football. Football started.
10408880	10411880	Oh, did, uh, fall TV's coming back this next week, right?
10411880	10414880	Yeah. I think some shows have already started.
10414880	10418880	I think some started and some are, like, and then you got, like, what, like, Survivor starts next week.
10418880	10419880	On Wednesday.
10419880	10420880	Big Brothers finishing up.
10420880	10421880	On Wednesday.
10421880	10422880	Thank God Frankie didn't win, right?
10422880	10426880	Yay! I was so happy.
10426880	10428880	See, at least I know you like all those trashy reality shows.
10428880	10429880	I love them.
10429880	10430880	Yeah.
10430880	10431880	I don't watch as many as I used to.
10431880	10433880	I've kind of narrowed it down to the ones I used to watch.
10433880	10434880	I just keep watching them.
10434880	10436880	I just can't grab anything new now.
10436880	10439880	I mean, I did watch, um, Who Done It last year.
10439880	10440880	That was great.
10440880	10441880	Who Done It was great.
10441880	10442880	I love that show.
10442880	10443880	I thought Who Done It was better than The Quest.
10443880	10446880	I knew a lot of people were getting really excited about The Quest on ABC.
10446880	10447880	I didn't watch that either.
10447880	10449880	It was, um, it was silly.
10449880	10453880	But, um, it was neat how they had it set up like a show.
10454880	10458880	Uh, that was like a medieval thing that actually had a storyline, huh?
10458880	10459880	Was it like a LARP?
10459880	10464880	Sort of, but I sort of felt like the story only existed in the very beginning and the
10464880	10468880	very end of the show to tie the silly challenges in each show together.
10468880	10469880	Okay.
10469880	10471880	And so, and they still had that whole like voting thing that would happen at the end
10471880	10475880	of the episode that kind of was, that's the drama right there and didn't really
10475880	10477880	I do watch King of the Nerds as well.
10477880	10478880	So there we go.
10478880	10480880	I guess I do still watch everything.
10481880	10484880	That show got a third season so I'm excited.
10484880	10485880	King of the Nerds.
10485880	10488880	You know, a member of the OL army was on King of the Nerds last season.
10488880	10489880	I know that.
10489880	10492880	Nicole, if you guys don't know, she was great on this season.
10492880	10495880	She was a big threat because she was kind of one of those people that had knowledge
10495880	10497880	of multiple different things.
10497880	10499880	And so they took her out when they had a chance.
10499880	10503880	But one of the spoilers we had her on when she was on the tester.
10503880	10504880	Yeah, I remember that.
10504880	10508880	So I didn't, I never watched the tester, but I remember when she was on and then I'd
10508880	10512880	watched the first season of King of the Nerds and then when, when,
10512880	10515880	when she was on your show, I started following her Twitter and then I got,
10515880	10517880	I saw the announcement that she's going to be on King of the Nerds season two.
10517880	10518880	That's awesome.
10518880	10519880	That had surprised me.
10519880	10521880	She was definitely one of the more entertaining contestants.
10521880	10523880	Well, that surprised me too, because I kind of thought after the tester,
10523880	10528880	like we had her on the show before her episode aired and I got the feeling that
10528880	10531880	she wasn't too happy with the way things turned out on the tester.
10531880	10532880	So I kind of was surprised.
10532880	10534880	And then she showed up on a King of the Nerds.
10534880	10536880	Did you watch like the first episode?
10536880	10539880	Because she was singled out by her team, right?
10539880	10542880	So I was like, Oh no, the curse continues.
10542880	10544880	She's getting kicked off first before everybody.
10544880	10545880	Yeah, yeah.
10545880	10547880	No, they did a twist and a twist.
10547880	10549880	It was stupid, but, but she saved herself.
10549880	10550880	She got, I know.
10550880	10551880	I mean, she's great.
10551880	10552880	And it was a great show.
10552880	10553880	It's funny.
10553880	10554880	Thanks to Twitter and things, you know,
10554880	10557880	you start to kind of like really get to know people and you start to learn like
10557880	10560880	reality TV really is like there's the one like narrow perception of somebody.
10560880	10561880	Oh yeah.
10561880	10564880	Like I never like buy into the fact that that's actually reality.
10564880	10565880	You know, it's like, Oh yeah.
10565880	10569880	Frankie wasn't fed any hints to go along further in the game because it's such a
10569880	10571880	huge fan base watching the show on bigger brother.
10571880	10573880	And you know, I'm friends with somebody that was on one of the shows.
10573880	10577880	It was hated by everybody, but I'm like, he's a cool dude.
10577880	10579880	And it's just like, this is the wave.
10579880	10581880	Hey, he was one of my favorites that season.
10581880	10583880	I don't know why people hated him.
10583880	10584880	I don't know either.
10584880	10585880	All right.
10585880	10586880	Anyway, that's it.
10586880	10589880	I guess Flacco and I are left here to talk about reality television all night
10589880	10590880	because you guys aren't calling in.
10590880	10592880	So I hope you're having fun, whatever you're doing.
10592880	10595880	I guess just too many people standing in front of a cave on destiny,
10595880	10597880	shooting it over and over again to get loot.
10597880	10598880	I think that's what's happening.
10598880	10601880	There's everybody shooting the cave or they all ran off to get fibbage.
10601880	10602880	I'm hoping that's what I hope.
10602880	10603880	That's what it is.
10603880	10605880	They're all like, we can't call in the show tonight because we all started
10605880	10607880	playing fibbage and try to catch the podcast.
10607880	10608880	That's right.
10608880	10609880	We'll just catch the podcast.
10609880	10610880	Awesome.
10610880	10611880	All right.
10611880	10612880	Well, uh, you know, it is a show where every gamer has a voice,
10612880	10616880	so we encourage you to, uh, uh, lend us your voice at, um,
10616880	10619880	participate at orange on twitter.com or of course on Twitter,
10619880	10621880	twitter.com slash O L R.
10621880	10624880	Check in with Loki one more time for any other stories.
10624880	10627880	No, I'm searching on how to kill the trumpet vine.
10627880	10629880	Cause that is what is growing in my backyard.
10629880	10630880	Oh no.
10630880	10631880	And fuck that thing.
10631880	10632880	Seriously.
10632880	10633880	It's bad.
10633880	10636880	Like if I'm lazy and I cut the vine off and just throw it on the ground,
10636880	10639880	it'll fucking root up right there and just grow again.
10639880	10641880	I'm like, it's like a fucking hydra or something.
10641880	10644880	It's seriously terrible.
10644880	10645880	All right.
10645880	10647880	Well, good luck against the garden monster.
10647880	10648880	All right.
10648880	10649880	Uh, awesome.
10649880	10650880	Uh, well fuck.
10650880	10652880	Oh, then I'm going to say thanks a lot for being here tonight.
10652880	10654880	Thanks for filling in for dark soccer at the last minute.
10654880	10658880	I had to use your phone to do the stories, but it's okay.
10658880	10661880	And I know she appreciates it too. Cause she had a, you know,
10661880	10663880	she wasn't expecting to lose her voice and what have you,

10667880	10669880	You're a great support for the network and we appreciate that.
10669880	10671880	And, uh, if you think about it,
10671880	10674880	probably wouldn't have got that interview tonight if I hadn't been
10674880	10678880	thought to looked at fibbage, thanks to you. So maybe not.
10678880	10681880	And then, and it always goes back to Shane, doesn't it? In a way,
10681880	10684880	in a way it always is. And then, um, yeah,
10684880	10688880	Shane is a pusher. Oh, and then, and then my plug everybody,

10697880	10699880	And uh, rank those movies.

10701880	10705880	So I ranked a lot of people listening. Go, go rank the movies.
10705880	10707880	Yeah. Free points. You get a link at three points.

10719880	10720880	I love the half here.
10720880	10724880	That was the best. Did Bobby do that too?
10724880	10727880	There's some funny, like, I know I like a lot of the loot.
10727880	10728880	It's really funny.
10728880	10731880	I know we haven't done a lot of raffles lately cause we haven't had a lot of
10731880	10732880	like prizes in the pool to give away.
10733880	10736880	I'm going to really try to get stuff at fan fest and Blizzcon so we can try to
10736880	10738880	bring back the raffles. I have a bunch of steam codes.
10738880	10740880	I can do it. Well, maybe, okay,
10740880	10742880	maybe we'll set up a raffle for a next month, but anyway,
10742880	10746880	you got to check out some of the loot cause we have a lot of funny in jokes on
10746880	10747880	the loot and like little,
10747880	10751880	like I actually sit there and think of funny shit to put on the loot and I
10751880	10753880	don't like how many people have gotten the hashtag tag.
10753880	10756880	Probably I got any five. So I love it.
10756880	10760880	Check that out over at voggenetwork.com. Anyhow,
10760880	10762880	thanks again Flaco for being here. Besides that plug,
10762880	10764880	any other final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10764880	10768880	Uh, no, not really. Just glad to be here.
10768880	10770880	Glad to be the laugh track of the show.
10770880	10771880	Cause I can't stop laughing. I don't know.
10771880	10773880	Well, last week we had a live studio audience. Somebody,
10773880	10776880	I know that was great. I love commented on that to me.
10776880	10778880	Like when, when, when Jonas and Diego are there,
10778880	10781880	it's like you guys have a live studio audience here cause they have very big
10781880	10783880	laughs. So you just got to bring me in next time. Dan's here.
10783880	10785880	I'll sit in the background and I'll just laugh the whole time.
10785880	10789880	I love when Dan's on. Dan's I crack up. I'm like laughing in my car.
10789880	10795880	It must look like an idiot. There's plenty of reasons why you look like an
10795880	10798880	idiot Flaco. That's not why. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.
10798880	10803880	Uh, Loki, thank you of course for being here as always.
10803880	10805880	Uh, your final thought for our listeners tonight?
10805880	10807880	Uh, my final thought is I,
10807880	10814880	maybe I'll take a break from working on my game to dust off the Minecraft server.
10814880	10816880	You need to play one fucking game this week, Loki. Play one.
10816880	10821880	I, well I, like I said, I downloaded a few games on my steam backlog cause I was
10821880	10824880	like, I was going through and I'm like, what the fuck is half of this shit that
10824880	10828880	I have? Like when did I get sniper V2? Oh, that's right. It was free.
10828880	10831880	Um, it's just like, you know, I keep downloading stuff.
10831880	10834880	Like anytime I see an offer for a free steam come like, Oh,
10834880	10838880	I'm gonna add it to my back. I have like 280 games on there. It's just,
10838880	10841880	it's getting ridiculous. So, um,
10841880	10843880	I'm going to try maybe playing some road redemption.
10843880	10848880	Hopefully that runs okay on my system. And, um, I don't know.
10848880	10852880	I'll see what else. I haven't, uh, console games.
10852880	10855880	I think maybe the next console game I'll play is going to be Borderlands,
10855880	10858880	I think. Borderlands is a pre-sequel. That looks kind of fun. Yep.
10858880	10861880	Uh, and then Call of Duty after that, I,
10861880	10864880	I'm actually looking forward to Call of Duty, so we'll see.
10864880	10866880	I do, I wish I could get PlayStation four or something.
10866880	10869880	I need to get a job and money, so. Well, good luck on that.
10869880	10872880	By the way, if you are local and you have a job for Loki,
10872880	10875880	you have a job for Loki. Uh, he could, he could use it, right? Yep.
10875880	10877880	Do you, do you know your last day at your current place yet?
10877880	10881880	Yeah, the 30th. Uh, so, uh, yeah, I know that already. Um,
10881880	10885880	and actually I have, was it my coworker knows, um,
10885880	10887880	someone that's a head hunter in the game industry.
10887880	10892880	So she's wants me to contact this person. I'm like, okay, well,
10892880	10895880	I don't think there's really only bummer is that if you get in the game
10895880	10899880	industry, I might lose you to a conflict of interest. I hate that.
10899880	10901880	I mean, I understand you gotta do what you gotta do for yourself and your
10901880	10905880	family. But, uh, no, I don't, I honestly don't think it would be anything.
10905880	10908880	I could, you know, I don't think there's anything really out there for that.
10908880	10911880	Not in this area. There's not, you never know. You've been,
10911880	10915880	you've been on the side of, of, uh, the retail sales. There's,
10915880	10918880	there's people at these companies that want people with your skillset
10918880	10921880	working for them to get the get. So you never know. You never know.
10921880	10925880	We'll see. We'll see. All right. Uh, anyhow, my final thought tonight,
10925880	10928880	I just, uh, I want to, um, thank everybody for tuning in and listening.
10928880	10931880	And as I always say on the show, uh, if you like what you heard here at
10931880	10934880	orange on radio, please tell a friend or two or 17 about the show,
10934880	10937880	even though we are the internet's longest running program about video games.
10937880	10940880	It's a very small audience we have here because all we've got is word of mouth.
10940880	10944880	So please tell a friend about the show and would really appreciate that.
10944880	10951880	It does go a long way. A nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher radio
10951880	10954880	or wherever it is that you heard about this show goes a long way as well.
10954880	10959880	Uh, by the way, with iOS eight, uh, podcast is now a mandatory app again on there.
10959880	10963880	So, uh, more everybody, everybody who's using an iPhone or whatever has a
10963880	10966880	podcast app now. So just tell them to put orange launch radio in the search,
10966880	10971880	uh, and they can find it. Um, the other thing I just want to say real quick
10971880	10975880	for my personal final thought is that I'm going to be undertaking a project on
10975880	10978880	my Twitch channel, which I know everybody's live streaming these days,
10978880	10981880	but I'm hoping you'll take a minute to check out what I'm doing. Um,
10981880	10986880	I am going to play final fantasy four. I'm going to challenge my gamer a D D
10986880	10988880	and I don't know if I'll be successful or not,
10988880	10993880	but my goal is to stream the entire thing. Start to finish.
10993880	10997880	Not all in one sitting people, but I'm talking about when I stream games,
10997880	11001880	I'm only going to stream from SC4 for the next couple of weeks until I play
11001880	11004880	start to finish. That's my goal. I don't know if I'll do it.
11004880	11006880	So I'm going to need a lot of encouragement if you guys even like it.
11006880	11008880	But if you guys think it's stupid and you're like, no,
11008880	11011880	go back to hardcore Diablo or whatever, then I'll do that too. So it's,
11011880	11015880	we'll see. So, all right, that's going to do it for another week here at orange
11015880	11018880	launch radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.
11018880	11020880	I really appreciate the support. We'll be back.
11020880	11022880	Dark soccer ought to be back next week.
11022880	11025880	We'll catch up with her and more gaming news.
11025880	11029880	Of course, next week on orange lounge radio. Have a great week, everybody.
11029880	11033880	Uh, thanks to Mike from Jackbox games for being here tonight.
11033880	11036880	Really appreciate it. And thanks to all you who tuned into the show,
