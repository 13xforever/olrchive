14000	27000	Labor Day weekend is over and during the break, Nintendo revealed its brand new 3DS via Nintendo Direct. At least they didn't call it the 3DS You or Me. And that's just one headline from another BusyCon weekend. Stay tuned for more, including your comments, calls, and emails on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 566, September the 7th of 2014. My gosh, we're already in September. The year's gonna be done before we know it.
47000	59000	Here comes the holiday season of gaming with the Destiny release this week and oh my gosh, it's gonna be a busy few months. Thanks for joining us for it to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
59000	69000	My name is Rob Roberts here with you over the next few hours and in studio joining me as always are my incredible co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69000	70000	Hi.
70000	71000	Hi, welcome back.
71000	73000	You too. Welcome back to your house.
73000	77000	Thank you. Yes. Well, I wasn't here last week. I was, I was in it. Where was I?
77000	79000	I wasn't here either.
79000	87000	Where was I? Because I, you know, I had that moment, you know, I don't know if you guys do this. Let me say, let me also just go ahead and introduce Techmaster Loki here tonight as well.
87000	88000	Hi.
88000	102000	So I can ask a question of all of you. I don't know if you do this because whenever I have a week that we don't have a show, I kind of find myself sitting somewhere going and then I notice I look at my clock or look at my watch and it's six o'clock or in the case of being at Dragon Con, it's nine o'clock Eastern.
102000	114000	And I'm looking going, I should be setting up for, I should be on the call with Bobby right now and we should be doing OLR, but I'm not. Do you do that too? Or is that just me who's kind of like, I should be doing this, but I'm not.
114000	116000	I had a moment of wondering what to do with my time.
116000	117000	Yeah.
117000	124000	And then Dan and I decided that it was the day before our anniversary, so we would watch Divergent, which the book was better, of course.
124000	125000	Of course.
125000	131000	The movie wasn't bad. It was just very, you know, teen angsty. It felt teen angsty. You're watching it on the screen as opposed to reading the book.
131000	137000	I could have watched that on the flight, but they wanted six bucks. No, thank you. Was Divergent worth six bucks?
137000	138000	It was worth six bucks.
138000	139000	Oh well.
139000	140000	But.
140000	142000	I watched four hours of Shark Tank instead.
142000	147000	Dan got me a bottle of Hypnotic for our anniversary and I drank a lot of it.
147000	150000	Awesome. Yes, Loki?
150000	153000	I was going to say, yeah, I wouldn't pay six dollars for that either.
153000	154000	Oh, did you see Divergent?
154000	155000	No.
155000	156000	What did you do with the week off?
156000	158000	I think I watched the kids.
158000	162000	You've had two weeks off, actually, because I know you had family obligations a couple of weeks ago.
162000	163000	Yeah, and I watched the kids again.
163000	164000	Yeah.
164000	165000	That's pretty much all we did.
165000	166000	Do you remember how to do a radio show?
166000	167000	What did you watch them do?
167000	168000	Of course I do.
168000	173000	It's like sitting here going, Hannah, I hate this. This is so boring.
173000	175000	What did you watch them do? What do children do in the wild?
175000	185000	Well, I remember Winston's actually scooting around now, so I'm watching him not, or at least trying not to get him to chew on, you know, computer cords and stuff like that.
185000	187000	I told you toddlers are cats.
187000	195000	He wants to put everything in his mouth, so he wants to put, like, if it's something on the floor, he's going to grab it and taste it, because that's what toddlers do.
195000	197000	They taste everything.
197000	199000	Same like with dogs. Dogs taste everything, too.
199000	201000	And cats.
201000	204000	So I remember what I was doing a week ago at nine o'clock Eastern.
204000	210000	So we had just finished presenting at the Parsec Awards, which is, that was a great honor, we got to present.
210000	213000	And someone got to sit by Felicia Day, and I'm jealous.
214000	217000	It wasn't me. Is that that picture of Brad?
217000	220000	That's from a few years ago. Sadly, Brad wasn't there this year.
220000	225000	But I would have only wanted to be there to see Felicia Day.
225000	227000	I don't think she was there this year.
227000	228000	There was no reason for me to be there.
228000	231000	That's not true, because there was a lot of things that Dark Soccer would have fun with.
231000	236000	I don't know, there were other Buffy celebrities there, like Emma Caulfield.
236000	238000	There was a cast of Mythbusters there.
238000	242000	The cast of Mythbusters was there, including some of the guys that are no longer on the cast of Mythbusters.
243000	250000	Anyway, so we just finished presenting at the Parsecs, which was awesome, because I got to literally brush elbows with Lord British.
250000	254000	Who, if you don't know who he is, I didn't really get a chance to meet him.
254000	259000	I had a great admiration for him prior to the stupid Ready Player One contest.
259000	264000	I still, in spite of, everybody has their hit and misses.
264000	267000	Look, we've had bad episodes of OLR, and people forgive us for that.
267000	269000	So we can forgive him for a bad face.
269000	270000	No, I can't.
271000	275000	I need to air my grievances with him, and then we'll be done.
275000	278000	He's the creator of Ultima, for God's sake.
278000	284000	Ultima's won through Ultima Online, which is like an epic, epic MMO.
284000	293000	Something I would have rather played instead of this fucking stupid garage sale collector game thing that I was forced to play.
293000	297000	If it was like, hey, let's play some Ultima Online, I'd be like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.
297000	303000	But no, it was garage sale, the game, I don't know.
303000	304000	Were you going to say it, Arsyra?
304000	306000	I was just reading what Bobby said in chat.
306000	309000	He said, I shook his hand because I made a joke about him and he liked it.
309000	311000	He actually wanted to shake my hand.
311000	314000	That's right, Lord British wanted to meet me.
314000	323000	That comment from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
323000	324000	Although-
324000	325000	Apparently he's a giant effing celeb.
325000	331000	I've got to say, because I saw, I don't remember what it was, some documentary or something, his house is fucking awesome.
331000	346000	Okay, so I went to the Lord British panel at Dragon Con where we got to hear, oh, this was awesome, the confirmation that yes, the evil spheres in Ultima 7 were based off the Electronic Arts logo at the time.
347000	352000	And EA knew that, which they were ECA back in the day.
352000	357000	If you go back and look at your kind of computing history, they actually used to be like a cube and if you see their old logo.
357000	372000	So yes, EA knew that when they bought Origin and Lord British was basically talking about like, you know, I kind of had to sell Origin because we were getting bumped off the shelves for these other bigger distributors.
372000	374000	We had to merge with somebody else to get the shelf space basically.
374000	377000	But then he talked a lot about his house, which sounds amazing.
377000	389000	And I didn't realize he was super into geocaching, but apparently he set up this geocache at his house that you have to actually like go through a forest and answer riddles to open doors.
389000	394000	Like it's just like, what an egomaniac, but I love him for it.
394000	402000	But then you talked about when his house got broken into by some crazy guy and how he protected himself with the secret passageways in the house.
402000	406000	Like it's just like, this is crazy. I love listening to him talk. I wanted to stay longer.
406000	414000	He went longer than the hour that was allotted to him, but unfortunately he was right before the VOG Network presents panel over the podcasting track.
414000	418000	So I had to leave to get to the other panel, but I want to invite him on OLR sometime.
418000	426000	I don't know if he would ever come on a little piddly show like this, but I'll give him three hours to talk and it would be it would be amazing.
426000	430000	I think we all could listen to Lord British for three hours. He's an amazing guy.
430000	435000	So anyway, quickly, let me also just kind of wrap up Dragon Con real quick.
435000	440000	There's not a lot of gaming content at Dragon Con because it is more of a geek convention.
440000	443000	So since it is the voice of geeks network here, we kind of dabble in all that stuff.
443000	445000	You know, Dragon Con is a great fit for us.
445000	449000	But as far as gaming content, like we didn't really get any game announcements or anything like that.
449000	452000	You know, that's all happening at PAX, which we'll get into a little bit on in the show.
452000	460000	But, you know, did see some good gaming fandom and, you know, saw like the Darkmoon Faire party for World of Warcraft.
460000	464000	I saw an EverQuest landmark panel where we really didn't learn anything about the game.
464000	467000	But those that were into the game sure seemed to enjoy it. So, you know, props to them.
467000	473000	And there was a few things here and there. Like, you know, again, the Lord British panel was a personal favorite of mine.
473000	480000	But I did want to say a big, big thank you to those that came out to see some of the things we did on the podcasting track.
480000	486000	Some of you guys actually got up early Monday morning to come see that participating not just listening panel, which was a lot of fun.
486000	491000	And I just want to thank you guys for, you know, coming up and introducing yourselves, saying hello, and being there. It was great.
491000	497000	And I'm trying to work on Dark Soccer and Loki, guys, someday. But we might have to wait for Loki's kids to turn 18.
501000	503000	Someday. Someday we'll get you all to Dragon Con. Had a good time.
503000	510000	The one I'm really working on for next year is Grandpa from Hoard House and who also hosts the Starboard power coupling.
510000	516000	Because I'm like, Grandpa, this year the Trek track hosted a dilithium crystal ball.
516000	522000	You don't want to go to the dilithium crystal ball, Grandpa. So I think I'm working on him for next year. We might be able to make that happen.
522000	527000	So, yeah. So thanks to everybody that showed up at Dragon Con and I'll see you guys in 2015.
528000	533000	And big shout-outs to Travis, obviously, who I spent a big chunk of the weekend with.
533000	536000	And Brian from British Invaders, who I got to meet for the first time.
536000	540000	All the guys from Critical Myth met each other for the first time at Dragon Con.
540000	544000	So it was amazing, in person, meaning. So it was amazing to kind of get to witness that.
544000	550000	And just everybody, all the VOG and non-VOG and people on the podcast track.
550000	554000	Just thank you, thank you. I had an amazing convention and can't wait until next year.
554000	561000	I was promised exclusive loot for registering my participation for listening to that panel.
561000	565000	And I'm checking my account. I just don't have any.
565000	569000	I think he's going to retcon it in. I think he was in a hurry to get that podcast up.
569000	570000	I'm just giving him crap.
570000	575000	I know, I know. It's always fun to give Bobby Black Wolf crap. It's even more fun to give it to him in person.
575000	576000	So there you go.
576000	579000	Let's see, look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
579000	583000	Tigerclaw asks, did Lord British talk about the time he went to space?
583000	589000	Actually, that didn't really come up. That topic did. I mean, he had talked about putting a geocache or what do they call them?
589000	593000	The treasures or whatever. He did put one on the International Space Station.
593000	596000	And it has been checked more times than the one he put at the bottom of the ocean.
596000	601000	Like, I remember that that that whole topic had come up, but he didn't talk really explicitly about his travels.
601000	607000	A lot of it was focused on like the making of Ultima one and two and then kind of talking about the house.
607000	609000	So, you know, there's there was a lot.
609000	618000	That's what I did like during my two weeks that I was on the show is like I was watching a lot of these postmortem things that they have.
618000	624000	Like, like Gamasutra has like links to the GDC stuff, the postmortems where they talk about, you know,
624000	630000	its developers talking about the creations of the games and all the like thought processes and stuff and, you know, trouble and stuff that they did.
630000	637000	You know, putting these things out like Maniac Mansion and what other ones that I watch. I watched a bunch of them.
637000	646000	Great shit. I love watching that stuff. It's very fascinating. That would have been I bet they've got one for Ultima on there somewhere, but good stuff.
646000	655000	Yeah. Speaking of postmortems, something I did get to do at Dragon Con this year that I didn't do last year is I actually got to go to the very last podcasting panel where they have like the wrap up.
655000	663000	Like, you know, in every track at Dragon Con has this, whether you're doing, you know, Tolkien track or, you know, video game track or whatever, they always do like a wrap up panel at the very end.
663000	671000	So I actually went to the one for podcasting and it was, it was really great, informal, got to meet a lot of other people that do podcasts of all shapes and sizes.
671000	680000	And I just got to say, I walked out of that very motivated, which is always a really good feeling. So don't be surprised if you see me taking on more projects.
680000	685000	Just what I need to be doing more projects in podcasting. What? What? What? What?
685000	687000	I think you and I should do a new project.
687000	690000	Now is a great time to pitch me new projects. I'm just saying.
690000	691000	I have ideas.
691000	695000	Yes. All right. Ideas, you has them. All right. We'll talk on air about that.
695000	696000	I have evil ideas.
696000	697000	Or off air about that.
697000	698000	Evil ideas.
698000	701000	Well, I have been playing a lot of Diablo, but we'll get into our gaming weeks in a minute.
701000	710000	One thing I wanted to talk about for a kickoff topic here, not just Dragon Con, but this week, you know, we're coming up on September 9th, which is nine nine, right?
710000	713000	And already going to be a big day. We know Destiny's coming out that day.
714000	723000	Apple's going to announce inevitably a new iPhone, possibly a new watch is the rumors and what have you.
723000	729000	So we'll see. We'll see. So that's all possibly have a nine nine. But you know what?
729000	739000	Screw both those things because nine nine twenty fourteen also marks the fifteenth birthday birthday of the Sega Dreamcast launching in the United States.
739000	742000	That's right. Nine nine ninety nine was the day for the Sega Dreamcast.
742000	747000	I remember sitting on my butt reading a five dollar book I picked up at Barnes and Noble.
747000	750000	Well, perfect. I wanted to reminisce a little bit here.
750000	754000	One thing, my friend Melissa, who is getting married in two months.
754000	757000	Oh, so you guys you guys camped out for the Dreamcast.
757000	758000	We did.
758000	760000	What did you get? What did you pick up at launch for Dreamcast?
760000	761000	Do you remember?
761000	762000	What didn't we get?
762000	770000	Well, we we got, you know, all the crazy taxi and what else didn't come with Sonic Adventure, did it?
770000	772000	I don't remember because I know we had it.
772000	775000	I don't know. Well, did they not? I don't know if it came with games, did it?
775000	779000	Because they have like a base system then because I know the one I got didn't have any games.
779000	784000	And we got like a couple other things. But keep in mind, we already had a Dreamcast and a bunch of games.
784000	789000	So we didn't really feel the need to buy more games, except we wanted to hear the English cast of Sonic Adventure.
789000	792000	Right. So I was going through a little bit of a rough patch in ninety nine.
792000	794000	So I was kind of I kind of wasn't gaming a lot.
794000	800000	Probably the period between like ninety nine and about two thousand two thousand one right before our started and I got into DDR and all that.
800000	804000	I kind of wasn't gaming as much. So I didn't pick up the Dreamcast when it first came out.
804000	807000	I bought the Dreamcast when it was on sale for forty dollars.
807000	811000	Like I think Game Stops really were selling them for like forty dollars used or something.
811000	821000	So I remember picking up a Dreamcast and I played the ever living crap at a fantasy star online, which probably leads into my addiction to various online games and other MMOs today.
821000	824000	I mean, fantasy star online really set the stage for a lot of that.
824000	832000	And so it's kind of ironic that Destiny comes out this week, which I compared to PSO in some ways, in some ways on a previous show.
832000	835000	So it's kind of fun to see that come full circle.
835000	844000	But it should be stated, it is not the 15th birthday of the Dreamcast period because it was out in Japan for darn near a whole year before it was out here.
844000	845000	Right. Like they had it for a while.
845000	855000	I think it came out in, I want to say like January or February because I had one for my, we had one when I got DDR second mix for my birthday.
855000	862000	I was doing, that wasn't the system that they launched. No, that was the Saturn that they did that where it's like, it's out now, you know, that type of thing.
862000	868000	Yeah. I want to say I was doing research earlier when I did the Fugu question, which is about this topic as well tonight.
868000	875000	And it was November of 98, but that probably, you probably just took a couple months for you to get on board and get one.
875000	876000	I won mine.
876000	877000	Huh?
877000	878000	I won mine.
878000	880000	You won yours. How'd you win your Dreamcast?
880000	884000	I went to Accuse Our All-Nighter and won it in a raffle because I didn't even want one.
884000	889000	I didn't want to, you know, that system because I was like, I don't want it.
889000	891000	And then I got him like, sweet.
891000	892000	That's awesome.
892000	895000	I'm like, well, at least I'm not going to pay for it, but I'm going to buy games for this now.
895000	896000	So what did you end up getting for?
896000	901000	I got, I don't remember, see, I don't remember what year I got it because it wasn't 99.
901000	904000	I'm pretty sure. I think it was like 2000, 2001.
904000	909000	And it was, I got Power Stone.
909000	913000	I was going to say, you strike me as the type that would have played a shit ton of Power Stone.
913000	915000	We did because I played a shit ton of Power Stone in the arcade.
915000	923000	So yes, I had to get Power Stone and I got Tony Hawk Pro Skater and I think I had Crazy Taxi.
923000	928000	I know I had Fancy Star Online and what else did I have?
928000	930000	Did you get Quake 3?
930000	931000	No, no.
931000	937000	Dancing was Quake 3 for the longest time and we were so pissed that we couldn't use our, we got the Ethernet adapter.
937000	939000	We couldn't play PSO on it.
939000	941000	Very, very, very irritated me.
941000	946000	I think I only played PSO online once because I only had the modem for it.
946000	949000	So, I don't know, it was okay.
949000	952000	I didn't do a lot of online playing on that until the Xbox.
952000	956000	And then, what other game did I get? I got something else too.
956000	958000	Because I still have all the same games.
958000	961000	Like that initial first batch of games I bought was it.
961000	963000	And then I never bought any more games for it.
963000	968000	I remember getting really excited when we picked up Grandia 2 because I had already been playing my friends Japanese version.
968000	970000	And my save file worked.
970000	972000	From a Japanese game.
972000	974000	And Power Stone was one of the other games that did that.
974000	978000	Power Stone's awesome. I should have gotten Power Stone 2 but I never did.
978000	979000	Aw, it was fun.
979000	981000	I have it on my arcade cabinet.
981000	986000	My other favorite thing to do on the Dreamcast, even though I realize y'all this is of a questionable legality.
986000	990000	But I've supported the crap out of Virtual Console and the like ever since.
990000	993000	But burning CDs full of emulators and ROMs.
993000	995000	Sorry, not sorry. That was a lot of fun.
995000	997000	Remember the Para Para thing?
997000	999000	Oh my god, that thing was horrible.
999000	1001000	The purple biscuits?
1001000	1003000	Green biscuits.
1003000	1006000	It's green because you know how I know it's green?
1006000	1008000	Because I fucking have it.
1008000	1010000	I have it. It's in my closet.
1010000	1013000	No, it was another knockoff that had the purple ones.
1013000	1015000	Or maybe it was just the controller or something.
1015000	1020000	Let me ask this question because I want to get to the new news, not just reminiscing.
1020000	1023000	But let me ask one more question about the Dreamcast and I'll read some comments from chat.
1023000	1026000	I want to know your guys' thoughts on this too over at live.vognetwork.com.
1026000	1032000	Why do we remember the Dreamcast so fondly when it didn't really do so well?
1032000	1037000	I mean, it kind of failed as a system, I hate to say it, but it didn't.
1037000	1040000	But why do we remember something so fondly that didn't really do so well?
1040000	1045000	I think for me it's a lot of it kind of brings it back to how the early consoles were
1045000	1049000	and the early home video game consoles where they were basically
1049000	1052000	hey, we're going to take all these cool arcade games and port them to console.
1052000	1055000	And so with the Dreamcast you had a lot of that.
1055000	1060000	Like with Power Stone and all the different Sega games that they had.
1060000	1062000	A lot of the CPS2 games as well.
1062000	1064000	Yeah, those were all in there.
1064000	1067000	And just a lot like Ikaruga, like all these big shmups and stuff.
1067000	1072000	And plus, I think the other thing, the reason I think so fondly of it is it supported so long.
1072000	1075000	There's still people making games out there for it right now.
1075000	1079000	And it was maybe because it was so easy to pirate for,
1079000	1084000	it allowed you to expose yourself to a lot of things that you might not have been able to play otherwise.
1084000	1088000	I think it's the pirating thing that might have led to the big factor in this downfall,
1088000	1090000	though I don't really think so much as marketing.
1090000	1092000	Because our marketing in the US was really clever.
1092000	1093000	Yeah.
1094000	1100000	I would say I think the PlayStation 2 was able to really kind of kick it in the butt.
1100000	1105000	With the mere fact that the PlayStation 2 played, and I realize it was a couple years later,
1105000	1107000	but the PlayStation 2 played DVDs.
1107000	1109000	And that was a huge thing for people.
1109000	1111000	You know, the fact that it could play DVDs.
1111000	1114000	A lot of people made the decision, oh, I'll get one of these for the living room.
1114000	1118000	So the Dreamcast really got a kick in the butt when that happened, I think.
1118000	1119000	Yeah.
1119000	1121000	So I think that was a huge factor.
1121000	1126000	But it still surprises me that it didn't somehow pull it out.
1126000	1131000	I kind of wish that someday that Sega would go back to manufacturing consoles.
1131000	1132000	Right?
1132000	1137000	Because fuck, man, the games that they're putting out just alone, you know, just the Sonic games,
1137000	1139000	it's just kind of crap.
1139000	1144000	I wish they would just go back and recapture the magic that they used to have.
1144000	1147000	Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vogniteware.com says,
1148000	1150000	It came at a weird time in gaming for me, though.
1150000	1153000	PC gaming was strong and the PlayStation was dominating the charts,
1153000	1156000	but lots of love for the Sega-specific titles that came out for it.
1156000	1157000	Tigerclaw says,
1157000	1159000	Dreamcast also had a built-in modem.
1159000	1162000	When you dial into your ISP and you download some stuff from a game,
1162000	1165000	I remember Sonic Adventure has some cosmetic stuff that you can download from it.
1165000	1168000	Oh, yeah, I remember that because I used to play the hell out of PSO.
1168000	1169000	Blackwool said,
1169000	1174000	I had a friend who loved his Dreamcast and pulled out his spindle of burned games to show me how much he loved it
1174000	1178000	and then sighed and said it's a shame it wasn't a financial success.
1180000	1184000	Blackwolf also points out PlayStation 2 also had EA exclusives.
1185000	1186000	So, yeah.
1186000	1188000	Kaijuto disagrees with me, saying,
1188000	1190000	No, PlayStation 2 didn't kill the Dreamcast.
1190000	1193000	The Sega Saturn and the PlayStation 1 killed it.
1193000	1194000	And, and,
1194000	1196000	Bleemcast.
1196000	1197000	Remember?
1197000	1199000	Bleemcast was kind of awesome.
1199000	1200000	I do remember that.
1200000	1202000	That's like, that's unheard of.
1202000	1206000	Imagine, like, if they had a PlayStation 3 disc or something that let you play Xbox 360 games.
1206000	1207000	Oh my God.
1207000	1208000	It would be fucking ridiculous.
1208000	1209000	Yeah.
1209000	1210000	That's crazy.
1210000	1211000	You don't see that kind of shit anymore.
1211000	1212000	You really don't.
1212000	1213000	It's amazing, though.
1213000	1214000	You really don't.
1214000	1215000	All right, thanks for those comments.
1215000	1216000	Again, over at live.vognetware.com.
1216000	1219000	We will get into a little more Dreamcast reminiscing with the FUGL question of the week.
1219000	1222000	But for now, let's fast-forward to the present.
1222000	1225000	We have a couple weeks off to catch up on, so let's try to quickly get through.
1225000	1226000	How is your...
1226000	1227000	Wait, wait, hold on.
1227000	1228000	Blackwool says,
1228000	1229000	Fuck yeah, Qsar.
1229000	1230000	Top Gun.
1230000	1237000	You guys have Qsar in Atlanta because seriously, that might help me get out there to Atlanta.
1237000	1240000	I mean, just saying.
1240000	1241000	We'll find out.
1241000	1243000	I didn't even know Qsar still existed.
1243000	1245000	Oh, we still got one in Concord.
1245000	1246000	There's still one in Concord.
1246000	1248000	Still one in Vacaville.
1248000	1250000	Vacaville one sucks.
1250000	1252000	But the Concord one apparently is still pretty good.
1252000	1254000	It's just it's all the way in Concord.
1254000	1262000	I want to say our pals Spike and Jon over at Game Buoy did a Qsar thing for Spike's birthday or something.
1262000	1264000	I've played at all of the arenas in this area.
1264000	1267000	I mean, even like Bascom, which is in San Jose.
1267000	1268000	That is crap.
1268000	1271000	But like, man, that's the problem, man.
1271000	1273000	It's like over an hour away to go play Qsar.
1273000	1277000	And it's just you go down there and there's no one playing except for like little kids.
1277000	1281000	That's why I wish they had the arena back in Citrus Heights.
1281000	1282000	It sucks.
1282000	1283000	Move to Citrus Heights.
1283000	1284000	You know, it's like, oh, sweet.
1284000	1286000	It's like like two minutes away.
1286000	1287000	I can even play so much Qsar.
1287000	1288000	And then it closes.
1288000	1292000	It's so funny, too, that I used to play at that same one all the time.
1292000	1294000	Yet we didn't know each other at the time.
1294000	1297000	You probably kicked my ass because I was terrible at Qsar.
1297000	1300000	Black Wolf in chat says we don't have any Qsars anymore, but there might be one in Atlanta.
1300000	1306000	Keep in mind, Black Wolf lives in a suburb and says, nope, the last Qsar in Atlanta closed last year.
1306000	1307000	A lot of them.
1307000	1312000	All right, let's let's fast forward to the present and talk about what types of games we have been playing this week.
1312000	1314000	Or the past two weeks.
1314000	1315000	Dark Sakura, ladies first.
1315000	1316000	What have you been doing?
1316000	1317000	How was your gaming week?
1317000	1318000	I played some Final Fantasy 14.
1318000	1320000	I actually did that today.
1320000	1327000	My 3DS has been kind of just being used for puzzles.
1327000	1330000	What do we do?
1330000	1333000	Oh, yeah, we were playing Kingdom Hearts.
1333000	1338000	I guess not really a whole bunch of stuff.
1338000	1340000	Oh, yeah, I started Another Shepherd on Mass Effect 3.
1340000	1343000	I might have mentioned that before, but I actually played some more of it.
1343000	1347000	And some more Sims 2.
1347000	1349000	That's about it.
1349000	1352000	I'm not going to get Sims 4 until there's an expansion.
1352000	1355000	Which there will be thousands of them.
1355000	1358000	I mean, since all the content's not in the game.
1358000	1361000	I played nothing, sadly.
1361000	1364000	Two weeks off I really played nothing.
1364000	1366000	Dark Sakura?
1366000	1368000	I did remember something else I played.
1368000	1369000	Go ahead.
1369000	1372000	I started Fractal again.
1372000	1374000	Because that game's awesome.
1374000	1376000	Okay, I'm done. Sorry.
1376000	1378000	So nothing for two weeks, Logie?
1378000	1379000	Yeah, I've been programming.
1379000	1381000	Are you qualified to talk about video games?
1381000	1382000	I am.
1382000	1386000	Oh, you've been programming your own game instead of playing others.
1386000	1387000	Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
1387000	1388000	That works.
1388000	1394000	I got done with my editor thing and then I realized it's not going to work.
1394000	1396000	Because, yeah.
1396000	1399000	The way I did it, it was just not going to work at all.
1399000	1402000	So I had to go completely from scratch and redo it again.
1402000	1404000	So actually I'm almost done with it again.
1404000	1405000	Back to where I was.
1405000	1413000	It's just my complex math equation or whatever to rotate these vectors around a point.
1413000	1415000	It just didn't work.
1415000	1417000	I guess the math was wrong or something.
1417000	1422000	That's what you get for when you copy stuff off the internet without actually knowing how it works.
1422000	1426000	So I'm actually going to go back and do it the way I was originally going to do it.
1426000	1429000	And I think that'll work a lot better.
1429000	1431000	So I have to write that up.
1431000	1436000	But it's pretty complex and hopefully this way works.
1436000	1439000	Because if it doesn't work this way, then I have no idea what I'm going to do.
1439000	1442000	But I think this way should be a lot more efficient.
1442000	1447000	And then once I get this done, I can start making the game again.
1447000	1451000	Because it's just like engine, engine, engine, engine, engine stuff.
1451000	1454000	I want something that I can see.
1454000	1457000	It's really interesting hearing you go through these growing pains though.
1457000	1459000	It's going to be fun to go back and listen to old episodes of R.
1459000	1463000	Well, it's like anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to do it the right way anyway.
1463000	1467000	Anytime I try to cut corners, I end up having to go back and redo it.
1467000	1473000	I rewrote my shader this weekend because it was too complex for what I needed it to do.
1473000	1476000	And it's like, ooh, I want to put all the bells and whistles in.
1476000	1477000	I didn't really need it.
1477000	1483000	For what I'm doing with it, I just stripped out everything I didn't need out of it and redid it.
1483000	1486000	And so now I have that again.
1486000	1491000	But, I don't know, it should be...
1491000	1494000	Because now everything is being procedurally created.
1494000	1498000	It's almost like I'm making Minecraft in a way.
1498000	1506000	Because the way you would make a voxel game like Minecraft is pretty much the same way I'm generating the objects that you make in this editor.
1506000	1509000	Did Loki just claim to be making Minecraft? I think he did.
1509000	1512000	I'm not making Minecraft. It's just like...
1512000	1519000	It's because it's similar to the way voxel games work, so it's not exactly the same way.
1519000	1521000	Some folks in chat are going...
1521000	1524000	BlackWolf says, Loki's making vaporware.
1524000	1526000	Act F says, Loki nuke him forever.
1526000	1529000	SSG100Matt says, I hope he doesn't get burned out.
1529000	1532000	Dungeon Buster says, half Loki 3.
1533000	1538000	Okay. It's only been like six months. It hasn't even been that long yet.
1538000	1542000	But give yourself a break once in a while. Play some games. Get some inspiration.
1542000	1545000	I'm burnt out at all though. I think it's interesting.
1545000	1546000	Good. Good.
1546000	1548000	If it's not fun, then why would you do it?
1548000	1553000	Exactly. If I don't want to do it, then I won't do it. I'll take a break for a day or something.
1553000	1555000	Because there's a lot of games I have to play.
1556000	1563000	If they put out a new expansion in Grand Theft Auto 5 or something, maybe that'd give me an excuse to play some games or something.
1563000	1567000	Or when Call of Duty Advanced Warfare comes out, I might have to play that for a bit.
1567000	1570000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, because it's not on our show roll tonight, what's up with the release date for that?
1570000	1572000	Did it get bumped again? I thought I heard it was getting bumped.
1572000	1574000	It hasn't gotten bumped yet.
1574000	1580000	There was a rumor that one of the versions got bumped, but they're still saying it's fourth quarter.
1581000	1584000	They'll say it's fourth quarter until it's not fourth quarter.
1584000	1593000	Right now, they don't have a date nailed down yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if it got bumped.
1593000	1599000	If anything, just because there's so much stuff coming out in November, the day that it comes out now,
1599000	1604000	if it came out any day in November, it's going to be really packed.
1605000	1610000	I don't know. I hope it comes out in November.
1610000	1614000	It'd give me an excuse to buy a next-gen system, I guess.
1614000	1617000	I'd need a job for that, though.
1621000	1625000	Let me talk quickly about my gaming week, because I didn't play a lot a lot.
1625000	1628000	Obviously, I was away at the convention, but I did play a few things.
1628000	1632000	On the flight, I played on the PlayStation Vita quite a bit of Dragon's Crown,
1632000	1635000	which is a game that's on the PlayStation Vita, of course.
1635000	1640000	It's also on PlayStation 3. It was part of the PlayStation Plus package, I think, last month or the month before.
1640000	1642000	I finally got around to playing it.
1642000	1646000	I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed that game, and I want to continue playing more of it.
1646000	1653000	I'll probably get it for my PlayStation 3, because that's a game that I would like to play on a bigger screen,
1653000	1656000	maybe more than the Vita, but for the flight, it worked great.
1656000	1660000	If you don't know what this game is, it's kind of like a mash-up between something like Golden Axe,
1660000	1664000	like an arcade game, like Golden Axe type of thing, mixed with an RPG.
1664000	1670000	You have a town, and you do these quests, and you go out, and you'll go to the field,
1670000	1672000	and you go a particular path through here.
1672000	1677000	Yeah, it's neat. I enjoyed that game. It was a great way to kill a little time on the flight.
1679000	1683000	There was that. I've been playing probably an unhealthy amount of Diablo III.
1684000	1686000	That's really the one game I've been playing more than anything else.
1686000	1690000	I've been playing Diablo III on not only PS4, but PC as well.
1690000	1695000	I'm playing both concurrently, because the PlayStation 4 one obviously just came out last week,
1695000	1699000	so I wanted to get a character to 70 and get my trophies and all that, right?
1699000	1704000	So what else happens last week? Well, not only do they release Diablo III on the PlayStation 4,
1704000	1708000	but they release the 2.1 patch on PC, which is not on consoles.
1708000	1712000	So if I want to play the newest content, like some of the new maps, and most importantly,
1712000	1716000	a seasonal character and the seasons that are going on Diablo, I've got to play on PC.
1716000	1720000	So even though I might have quit World of Warcraft six months ago,
1720000	1727000	Blizzard sure sucked me back into their universe and playing a lot of their games with Diablo III.
1727000	1728000	So job well done.
1728000	1731000	I bet you haven't been playing The Three Vikings.
1731000	1737000	I have not been playing The Three Vikings, unless they have a cameo that I'm not aware of.
1737000	1738000	Only in a while.
1738000	1739000	Only in a while.
1739000	1743000	So nothing about the new expansion or anything that they've revealed so far,
1743000	1746000	making you interested in jumping back into WoW again?
1746000	1753000	I'm going to make this short. I'm actually in the beta for Warlords of Draenor on World of Warcraft,
1753000	1759000	and I am not enthused about what I'm seeing. I hate to say that.
1759000	1762000	I hate to say it about a beta, something that's still in progress,
1762000	1767000	but I'm just not seeing enough to really kind of get me interested in the game again.
1767000	1771000	When are we going to see an expansion for Final Fantasy XIV?
1771000	1773000	They're still patching it pretty rarely.
1773000	1776000	They're talking about the 2.4 patch that's going to actually bring out a new class.
1776000	1779000	The Rogue and the Ninja are going to be in XIV.
1779000	1780000	My next class.
1780000	1783000	That's in a patch, and then the Shiva fight is coming,
1783000	1787000	and they just confirmed this week that Shiva will have a move where she does a snap,
1787000	1788000	and all the ice shatters.
1788000	1790000	And her boobs.
1790000	1791000	Yes, and boobs.
1791000	1794000	I thought that was in XIV.
1794000	1798000	They're trying to put all the primals in XIV. They just did Ramuh in the last patch.
1798000	1803000	They have Ifrit and Garuda, so now the last one is Shiva.
1803000	1809000	I did make another character, by the way, so I could have it be solely a ninja.
1809000	1816000	I'm kind of in a lull on XIV right now. I'm just sucked into Diablo right now more than XIV.
1816000	1821000	I kind of log into XIV, and I'm like, I don't really want to craft.
1821000	1824000	But I know Alan's really enjoying it. Alan plays XIV all the time.
1824000	1826000	That's it, Rob. We make noobs together.
1826000	1829000	We'll see. I'll just make a noob in Diablo.
1829000	1834000	You make a noob in XIV, and I'll make a noob in Diablo on PC.
1834000	1836000	We have to livestream it.
1836000	1837000	Yes.
1837000	1838000	Now I'm down.
1838000	1839000	That's our new project.
1839000	1841000	If we're doing Diablo, we're going to do a hardcore.
1841000	1846000	Because more people will watch if it's hardcore, because they're all waiting for the moment you die.
1846000	1850000	Because you know, in hardcore, once you die, you die. It's done. Game over.
1850000	1852000	Literally game over, start from the beginning.
1852000	1853000	Yeah, right?
1853000	1854000	Doesn't that sound like fun, Jamie?
1854000	1855000	No.
1855000	1856000	That might be fun.
1856000	1857000	That sounds like piss.
1857000	1860000	I don't know if my PC would be able to run Diablo.
1860000	1864000	By the way, I apologize to any of my coworkers who are listening to this for the first time.
1864000	1869000	You told your folks over at the land of cubes and tech.
1869000	1870000	Locat.
1871000	1872000	A couple.
1872000	1873000	Shout out.
1873000	1874000	Trusted people.
1876000	1878000	Where else was I? I was going to say...
1878000	1880000	Oh, one other thing I checked out briefly this week.
1880000	1883000	Minecraft on the PlayStation 4 came out this week.
1883000	1885000	And so I downloaded that and checked it out.
1885000	1890000	I only played about 30 minutes, but it is the same thing I played on 360.
1890000	1895000	Just was slightly crisper graphics, which I know is ironic because it's Minecraft and the graphics aren't exactly at selling point.
1895000	1906000	I wanted to know since, you know, because this is not this week, but it was last week since I'm assuming you got a chance to check out some more stuff on the DK2 on the Oculus.
1906000	1907000	I did. Thank you for bringing it up.
1907000	1910000	Yes, Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus to Dragon Con.
1910000	1917000	And so I did play the DevKit 2 and the game I actually played was Vanguard V, which you've talked about previously on the show.
1917000	1920000	So I didn't know really anything about this game.
1920000	1921000	I don't really own an Oculus.
1921000	1923000	I don't follow it nearly as much as Bobby does.
1923000	1927000	But every time he said, here, put this on and I'm going to press a few buttons and you're going to play a game.
1927000	1930000	Every time he's done that, I've really enjoyed the experience.
1930000	1933000	So I'm eagerly awaiting the consumer level.
1933000	1937000	Because you have to remember, Oculus is not really for consumers right now, but it'll get there.
1937000	1941000	Just like Project Morpheus is going to get there at some point, right?
1941000	1945000	So I played Vanguard V, which is a game you can control completely with your head.
1945000	1947000	And it plays a lot like Rez.
1947000	1949000	Like imagine you're playing Rez.
1949000	1950000	That's what it felt like to me.
1950000	1954000	Imagine you're playing Rez, but it's where you look that fires the little red kill.
1954000	1956000	That fires the bullets and everything.
1956000	1957000	It was actually really fun.
1957000	1960000	And the music is really good because I think it was Vert.
1960000	1963000	One of those big Chiptune guys does it, yeah.
1963000	1965000	So the music was really good too.
1965000	1970000	The stuff that they have for the title theme, I've been playing that in my car for weeks now.
1970000	1974000	But it's just so unlike him.
1975000	1980000	It's like an orchestral space opera track.
1980000	1981000	It's just fucking amazing.
1981000	1983000	But yeah, he does music in the game.
1983000	1990000	And actually they're kind of doing the external crowdfunding now.
1990000	1993000	They have their own Vanguard V website now you can go to.
1993000	1996000	Which I didn't, just to clarify, the full game is not out.
1996000	1999000	I played, I think it's like the first level as a Kickstarter thing.
1999000	2001000	Yeah, the Kickstarter demo.
2002000	2004000	But it was enough of a taste of the game for me.
2004000	2009000	Where I was like, alright, if I could buy one of these devices for $250,
2009000	2011000	although I imagine it's going to be more like $300 probably,
2011000	2013000	I'd be into a game like this.
2015000	2022000	I like that it was third person, but the way that they justified that is the queue or whatever that follows.
2022000	2023000	It's like Rez.
2023000	2025000	It's very similar to that.
2025000	2027000	It didn't take me out of the element at all.
2028000	2031000	I definitely had that moment when I kind of took the thing off and I'm like, whoa.
2033000	2034000	Cool stuff.
2034000	2035000	Yeah, I had a good time with that.
2036000	2039000	Let's see, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetware.com,
2039000	2041000	Rama says, what's Project Morpheus?
2041000	2044000	Did I call it the wrong thing or is he just being silly?
2044000	2046000	Yeah, I think he's just being silly.
2046000	2048000	Oh, Act F says, to be fair, the only demo is 83.
2048000	2052000	Oh, I see, because hardly anybody's been able to touch one of those things because it's only 83.
2052000	2056000	And for the record, that game, Vanguard V, is supposed to be for the Morpheus too.
2056000	2065000	He's got the dev kit stuff, so when they do get it funded, they're going to be developing it for both platforms.
2065000	2073000	I did notice too that with this new kit, they have something similar to what Morpheus has with the whole fact that the camera can track your head motions.
2073000	2079000	And I guess they do something like that now with the new Oculus too that I don't recall being there before.
2079000	2080000	No, I wasn't there before.
2080000	2088000	Yeah, so that was, I don't know how it played into the game I was playing, but yeah, so that was a feature.
2088000	2095000	Alright, so there you go, that was my gaming week. Thank you, Loki, for reminding me of one other game to give a shout out there for Vanguard V.
2095000	2104000	Let's get into housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com.
2105000	2119000	Also, be sure to follow us on YouTube, where the show is also posted, for you to listen to our vast archives quickly and easily on a variety of devices, because they got YouTube on everything, right?
2119000	2123000	So we are YouTube username OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Be sure to subscribe there.
2123000	2129000	And a big shout out to Jason, who runs things over at the YouTube channel and makes sure things get posted in a timely manner.
2129000	2136000	Although they do intentionally lag one week behind. We do want to push people to the podcast first. That's kind of our bread and butter.
2136000	2146000	But for those that are interested in checking out old episodes or an archive or going directly to like 1 hour 17 minutes in a previous episode, you know, YouTube is a great way to be able to do that.
2146000	2159000	Alright, let's get into the news. We're going to start tonight. I'm not going to do last week's news set to Holic, because there's really one big thing that everybody's talking about from last week, and Loki's going to get into that right now.
2159000	2174000	Yeah, so Nintendo, they announced a brand new 3DS hardware SKU called the New 3DS, because apparently they've fired whoever comes up with clever names for their, you know, hardware.
2174000	2193000	And this should, no one should be confused what the New 3DS is versus the old 3DS. I mean, I'm sure consumers, especially in, you know, North America and stuff that confuse the Wii and Wii U will have no trouble discerning 3DS and New 3DS.
2194000	2197000	Yeah. So what is the...
2197000	2201000	Alright, I have to say this though. Didn't Apple kind of do this, and it was fine for them?
2201000	2204000	No, I actually bought a new iPad.
2204000	2212000	I think it's stupid. And I understand that, you know, that they have the new iPad and stuff, but it's just spec-wise it's a little bit different, but...
2212000	2214000	For...
2214000	2229000	Plus, for me, on the iPad, the big thing that finally made me buy an iPad when I did was the retina display. Like, the retina display was such a huge jump from the prior iPad for me, and I realize everybody looks for different features, but for me, I was like, okay, I'm going to invest in one of these new iPads now.
2229000	2235000	So, but the 3DS, this new 3DS, doesn't seem to have that big of a jump.
2235000	2237000	It does, actually.
2237000	2238000	Does it really?
2238000	2251000	Well, here's the thing. It's got quite a few additional features to it. First off, they're going to have both the XL, or LL version that's called in Japan, and the regular 3DS size.
2252000	2270000	It has different buttons. It's got apparently better 3D, so the way 3D's a little bit better is the camera tracks where your face is and adjusts the 3D projection to hit your eyes so that you're not, like, losing it if you're not straight on with it.
2270000	2280000	It's got this weird second, like, C-Stick nub thing that's on the right-hand side, so they're comparing it to the C-Stick that was on, like, the GameCube and stuff.
2280000	2293000	It's got NFC built in. Also, the ZR and ZL buttons that were in that Circle Pad Pro, so I guess with the nub and those extra buttons, it's almost like the Circle Pad Pro's built into it now.
2293000	2303000	They've got, like I said, the buttons now are colored kind of like how they were on the Famicom, or I should say the Super Famicom.
2304000	2314000	Better battery. It's compatible with micro SD cards now instead of the standard SD card. You can back up your data wirelessly.
2314000	2321000	One of the things I think is really cool about it is they've fucking fixed the web browser in it now, so now it supports HTML5, which...
2321000	2328000	Would they be able to stream this show through that? Are we doing HTML5, or is that, you know, Flash still?
2328000	2330000	You've got to ask Bobby, because I don't know.
2330000	2333000	No, we're doing HTML5 so that it can be run on iOS.
2333000	2335000	Oh yeah, it runs on iOS, so it's HTML5.
2335000	2338000	So yes, you would be able to listen to our show through the web browser.
2338000	2340000	Okay, well now I'm a fan.
2340000	2346000	So I think that's pretty cool. I mean, I'm just glad that they improved the web browser, because I mean, that's pretty sweet.
2346000	2354000	And of course, the CPU's improved, and now I think it's also got more RAM or something in it.
2354000	2363000	And you can also clip on different covers for it, so if you want to like, you know, put like a Pokemon cover on it or something, you can do that.
2363000	2369000	And it'll snap on, and then say later on you decide, oh I want, you know, a Smash Brothers cover, you can snap on a Smash Brothers one.
2370000	2378000	Here's the problem though. Like with everything, you know, if it was just this cool hardware upgrade and stuff, that would be cool.
2378000	2390000	But, they're going to make games that only run on the new 3DS, because it's a slightly improved CPU and stuff that these games will not run on the regular 3DS.
2390000	2399000	So can you imagine, say you're buying, you know, a new game or something, a new Zelda game that runs only on the new 3DS for your 3DS.
2399000	2413000	You know, I want Zelda for the 3DS, you know, I think that you're going to get confusion again, because it's just, you know, it's not like the iPad, the new iPad, where if I go on, you know, the iOS store, I know all that shit works with my iPad.
2413000	2419000	You know, whether I have one iPad or the other iPad, it's going to just work.
2419000	2431000	Technically you could run into issues with things that you use, because at some point you aren't able to use the old iOS systems anymore on old devices.
2431000	2435000	Very, very early ones are the only ones excluded.
2435000	2441000	Right. In the iPad world right now, right. But the phones, certainly, I don't think the 3G.
2441000	2451000	I don't know if you've actually read up on the iOS 8 stuff, the stuff that came out of the developers conference. It's supposed to go, I think, as low as the 4S.
2451000	2452000	Okay.
2452000	2456000	And that's, we're looking three years back, four years.
2456000	2459000	I don't have an iPad touch and they stopped supporting it.
2459000	2460000	No.
2460000	2463000	Or iPad touch, I'm sorry.
2463000	2472000	There's a lot I want to say about this 3DS thing. Okay. A, did they announce this for the US yet? Or were they going off the Japanese announcement?
2472000	2474000	We're just going off the Japanese announcements right now.
2474000	2483000	So they could change the name for the US. They could. It could still be a 3DSi or something. They might still change the name here, right?
2483000	2485000	I don't think that they will.
2485000	2487000	But you don't know that they won't either.
2487000	2492000	I would be very surprised if they changed the name. I don't think that they will.
2492000	2495000	They've never changed system names except for Famicon.
2495000	2501000	The only difference you're going to see is it's going to be new. The only difference you're going to see is a new 3DS XL and not LL.
2501000	2504000	The only difference is a descriptive term.
2504000	2511000	Yep. DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS. I mean, they have been naming them differently every time, so I don't see why they wouldn't.
2511000	2513000	But to be fair, they did it in Japan too.
2513000	2515000	But I'm talking about from Japan to the US.
2515000	2516000	Right.
2516000	2522000	Where there have been very minor changes as far as what comes out of there versus what comes out of here.
2522000	2535000	Aside from the Famicon and Super Famicon and the Super Nintendo and Nintendo, the only difference we've had naming-wise would probably be the XL and LL. That's really the only differences we've seen.
2536000	2543000	And now the only game that they've announced so far that will only work on new 3DS that will not work on old 3DS is Xenoblade.
2543000	2551000	But it's simply a port of the Wii game that Nintendo gimped the sales up from the beginning by only selling it through two retailers, one of them being themselves, right?
2551000	2552000	Yeah.
2552000	2555000	And that they waited far too long to release.
2555000	2561000	So essentially they're giving Xenoblade a second go because they realized they fucked up the first time. My opinion.
2561000	2569000	But that's the only game. It's a port of a game that's been out for a while. So I'm not convinced I need one still.
2569000	2578000	This would be great if maybe I didn't have a 3DS yet or I didn't have a 3DS XL or whatever. I would be like, okay, I can get this new one.
2578000	2587000	But since I just bought that Zelda 3DS XL not that long ago, I'm not really interested in this until maybe they announce a few more of these must-have games that will only work on the new.
2587000	2597000	Well, I'm trying to understand this. Why the hardware refresh again? I mean, I don't think 3DS sales are tanking. I mean, they're doing really well.
2597000	2600000	I don't understand why they need to refresh the hardware again.
2600000	2606000	A lot of handheld companies do it. Apple does it every year. Samsung does it every year. They all do it every year.
2606000	2615000	I mean, they're definitely not feeling the pressure to compete against Vita. If they were feeling the pressure to compete against Vita, they would probably support Unity or something.
2615000	2619000	I think they're competing against the iPhone way before they're competing against the Vita.
2619000	2625000	In my opinion. I don't know. It's just kind of...
2625000	2631000	Okay, and then here's my tinfoil hat thing. Loki, feel free to shoot a hole through this theory, but it's something I've been stewing on a little bit.
2631000	2638000	Because I know in prior weeks on this program we had the whole speculation about the trademarks that were filed about the...
2639000	2644000	And I don't remember what they called it, but it was basically the Nintendo Synergy or something where...
2644000	2651000	And I don't remember what the hell it was called, but it was basically that they were trying to bring the Wii U and the 3DS more in parity.
2651000	2655000	Or it was Nintendo's next console maybe, not even just the Wii U, but whatever Nintendo's planning next.
2655000	2662000	And the 3DS a little bit more in line with each other. That they're trying to maybe develop one game for both things and that whole thing.
2662000	2671000	Could it be that this new 3DS is being launched with the souped up things and the new buttons because...
2671000	2675000	Okay, here's Crazy Rob talking. It will function as a Wii U gamepad.
2675000	2677000	I don't think so.
2677000	2678000	Why not?
2678000	2690000	Why not? Because first off, the controls on it aren't going to be close enough to the way they have on the Wii U.
2690000	2692000	I mean, I guess they could do that.
2692000	2702000	But I've always been thinking that it's not going to necessarily function as a Wii U gamepad, but that the Wii U would support 3DS titles instead.
2702000	2709000	That you would see 3DS titles on the Wii U since the gamepad could function as the bottom screen and the TV would function as the top screen.
2709000	2711000	So I don't know if they're going to do that.
2711000	2718000	Honestly though, if it can support Wii looking Xenoblade or something like that.
2718000	2722000	If it can support that, that's kind of a Wii level game.
2722000	2723000	That's kind of cool if they could...
2723000	2724000	It is a Wii level game.
2724000	2728000	Yeah, it is a Wii level game, but I don't know.
2728000	2732000	It would make more sense if this was along the lines of the Wii or something.
2732000	2736000	Whether, oh, okay, we're developing a game or making games for both systems.
2736000	2738000	The handheld doesn't have to process all the data.
2738000	2743000	It only has to read the feed coming in from the near broadcast field thing that comes in from the Wii U.
2743000	2745000	It doesn't have to actually process the data.
2745000	2750000	Well, the NFC stuff is for the fucking Amiibo figures. That's all that's for.
2750000	2754000	That's not for anything else. That's just that shit.
2754000	2763000	Okay, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, Kazuto says they have a new 3DS because everyone cried for two thumbsticks and more console-like. That's why.
2763000	2765000	But what games really support that?
2765000	2766000	Yeah, exactly.
2766000	2767000	It's not like we have this barrage of...
2767000	2771000	I don't even know where to get one of those 3DS control pad pros anymore.
2771000	2772000	Those control pad...
2772000	2774000	There's Kid Icarus and some Resident Evil games.
2774000	2779000	Yeah, it was Resident Evil Revelations, Kid Icarus, and Monster Hunter were the only games.
2779000	2781000	Is Smash Brothers going to use it?
2781000	2784000	Smash Brothers will use the C-Stick, yes.
2787000	2788000	Maybe that's why.
2788000	2790000	Or it can as an option.
2790000	2791000	Alright.
2791000	2796000	actdeft agrees with you, Loki. He doesn't think so either as far as what I was suggesting.
2796000	2798000	But Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob, actually.
2798000	2802000	So, some folks thinking there might be something there.
2802000	2806000	Dark Tetsuya says, we won't get the new 3DS until 2015, I heard.
2806000	2809000	Of course. You're not going to get it this year.
2809000	2813000	I imagine this is a holiday 2015 thing, maybe?
2813000	2815000	I don't know if it would be holiday.
2815000	2816000	That does seem far out, doesn't it?
2816000	2817000	It could be like March.
2817000	2820000	It could be March. Maybe just before the end of the financials or something.
2820000	2821000	I just...
2821000	2825000	Well, maybe that's why they're doing it, to try and pad the financials a little bit.
2825000	2829000	I would think that they would need a game that really shows the system off.
2829000	2831000	Once again, though, I still don't understand.
2831000	2833000	They're literally throwing out SKUs left and right.
2833000	2837000	It's like they're just throwing everything out there to see what sticks.
2837000	2839000	Like, oh, seriously.
2839000	2843000	They're like, oh, people don't want 3D graphics, so we got the 2DS.
2843000	2848000	Unless that 2DS was just because, oh, people think they're going to go blind with 3D.
2848000	2851000	These 3D displays are going to make you go blind or something.
2851000	2856000	Yes, because the 3D outside of those displays make me go blind, too.
2856000	2858000	The 2DS was a Pokemon system, plain and simple.
2858000	2863000	I mean, I still don't understand what the point is, but it's like, okay, we don't want 3D.
2863000	2864000	We do want 3D.
2864000	2869000	It's like they have so many SKUs out there now, but at the same time, it's like this isn't the system that needs help.
2869000	2871000	The Wii U needs help.
2871000	2872000	Help the Wii U.
2872000	2873000	3DS is fine.
2873000	2875000	You're doing great with the 3DS already.
2875000	2876000	Are they?
2876000	2878000	I think they are, yes.
2878000	2881000	I don't think that they're having a problem selling these systems.
2881000	2883000	There's plenty of games coming out for it.
2883000	2887000	Most of the publishers out there support the system because it's rocking.
2887000	2894000	It's just, I don't know, like are they trying to go more hardcore with this?
2894000	2896000	I mean, they're trying to like get the hardcore crowd.
2896000	2900000	Are they thinking that's what's happening is that the hardcore crowd's buying Vita's?
2900000	2902000	Because I can tell you what's happening with the Vita's.
2902000	2903000	Nobody's buying the Vita's.
2903000	2904000	You know what's happening with the hardcore crowd?
2904000	2908000	They have too much time playing hardcore games on consoles and PCs.
2908000	2911000	That's why they're not buying a 3DS.
2911000	2917000	That's why I wouldn't buy a 3DS, because I don't have enough time to play a 3DS and console and PC.
2917000	2923000	I agree to a point that I would rather see a Xenoblade reimagining or reconfiguring on the Wii U,
2923000	2929000	but then again, there is a game coming from the same developers in 2015, so we know that.
2929000	2932000	I'm going to our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com.
2932000	2938000	Kaijuto says Monster Hunter is a huge game, which I believe was in response to what the other circle pad used for.
2938000	2940000	It's a huge game in Japan.
2940000	2945000	Well, but the Japanese market is important, and where has this 3DS only been announced so far? In Japan.
2945000	2950000	So he could be onto something there, because this is upgrading for a Monster Hunter.
2950000	2953000	Because the last Monster Hunter game didn't sell systems.
2953000	2954000	Not here.
2954000	2956000	No, not here. It did not sell systems.
2956000	2960000	And any Monster Hunter game that's come out here hasn't really sold systems.
2960000	2962000	So I just...
2962000	2964000	I don't think that's really...
2964000	2968000	I mean, yeah, it's a good game, but it's just not as big over in North America.
2968000	2970000	It's just, in Japan it does really well.
2970000	2973000	And it's too bad, because it looks like a fun game.
2973000	2979000	It's just, you know, it's not something that's super mainstream, I guess.
2979000	2982000	All right. Well, we could go on and on with this topic.
2982000	2984000	I'll just quickly say this.
2984000	2987000	AkumaJP in chat says, not true, Loki.
2987000	2990000	Vita is not selling well there, because no good game there.
2990000	2993000	There's a ton of games coming out in Japan.
2993000	2995000	You know, the Vita, the interesting thing about the Vita...
2995000	2997000	Didn't he say good games?
2997000	3001000	Well, I just talked about one that I thought was pretty good at the top of the show, Dragon's Crown.
3001000	3003000	I thought that was a good game, and it's available on the Vita.
3003000	3006000	However, it's also available on the PlayStation 3.
3006000	3011000	And a lot of the Vita stuff is ports of PS3 and 4 stuff.
3011000	3015000	It's really to have Sony-branded crap with you wherever you go.
3015000	3018000	It's kind of where the Vita's at right now.
3018000	3024000	But, to their credit, at least that stuff, the cross saves work just fine, which is fantastic.
3024000	3035000	And Nintendo, come on, that would be fantastic if you put out Mario Kart 8 on the 3DS and Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U and had the saves go back and forth.
3035000	3037000	That would be fantastic.
3037000	3045000	I would love to see something like that, but honestly, I think they're just going to need a new console to come out.
3045000	3052000	And unfortunately, I don't think that whatever new console does come out is still going to be up to the specs of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3052000	3058000	I just wish that they would put something out that was equal to that.
3058000	3062000	Then we can start talking about, you know, it wouldn't be so hard developing games for them.
3062000	3065000	It would be pretty easy to port shit over.
3065000	3075000	And if they're going to do that, they need to do it soon, because the problem with the Wii U is that, great, you launch something that has Xbox 360 specs a year before you're already dwarfed.
3075000	3076000	You know what I mean?
3076000	3081000	So if they're going to bring something out in parity with Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it has to happen sooner rather than later.
3081000	3084000	Because they wanted to keep the price down because they thought they were going to win on price.
3084000	3092000	And unfortunately, yeah, you could win on price, but you also have specs of the system from last generation.
3092000	3102000	And so now, you know, people are just going to buy that system that has a ton of games for it versus your new system that clearly doesn't have a ton of games for it.
3102000	3104000	All right. Well, good discussion, you guys.
3104000	3113000	But just in the interest of time and the fact that it's already 7 o'clock, I want to just table the other new 3DS discussion to our mailbag or possibly phone calls later in the show.
3113000	3115000	Again, you can always email us with your thoughts.
3115000	3117000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
3117000	3120000	Meanwhile, I want to move into other news, though, from this week.
3120000	3126000	Sony did a little press conference over in Japan where they announced some upcoming features for the PlayStation 4.
3126000	3132000	A PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.0, one of the big things they're going to unveil with that is themes.
3132000	3136000	So you know how the PlayStation 3 had a theme in the operating system?
3136000	3143000	Well, now if you are sick of the Sony Blue that is on the PlayStation 4, you can change that to a variety of different themes that will be available.
3143000	3149000	And I'm sure they'll sell some and some will be free with PlayStation Plus and, you know, so on and so on.
3149000	3158000	Toro and Kuro were featured, these Japanese characters, a little more famous for PlayStation Japan, were featured in one particular theme that was demoed during the presentation.
3158000	3161000	So that's pretty cool that that's going to be happening.
3161000	3167000	I would like to see more of being able to rearrange some of the shit on the crossbar.
3167000	3179000	Like, I need to be able to arrange my games differently because I have so much crap on PlayStation 4 now thanks to all the PlayStation Plus and the fact that anything you put a disc in for becomes an icon on your bar.
3179000	3182000	Like, I could scroll to the right forever for things.
3182000	3184000	Weren't they doing folders or something like that?
3184000	3188000	If that was announced that I missed it, I would love that, though.
3188000	3195000	I don't remember if that was a hopeful feature or if that was, I thought, I'm going to check this out.
3195000	3200000	I thought they had folders coming, like, in an update or something like that.
3200000	3201000	That would be fantastic.
3201000	3203000	Oh, that's what it was.
3203000	3209000	It was a new, it was a PlayStation 4 user interface design. They apparently leaked.
3209000	3212000	It says users will get folders to organize games and apps.
3213000	3219000	But I don't remember if that was faked or not. I can't remember if that was the case or if it was real.
3219000	3223000	But that'd be cool if you had folders.
3225000	3231000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, floor.
3231000	3236000	Some other big game announcements coming out of this news announcement that Sony did over in Japan.
3236000	3241000	Disgaea 5 will be hitting the PlayStation 4 in 2015 in Japan.
3241000	3249000	Again, this isn't confirmed for the US. I would imagine it's likely here, but who knows if that means holiday 2015 or later or who knows what.
3249000	3254000	So that is pretty cool that that's happening. A lot of people will be throwing printies.
3254000	3258000	Persona 5 also going to be coming to the PlayStation 4.
3258000	3265000	Now, Persona 5, I believe, had already been announced for PS3, but they will be bringing a version out on PlayStation 4 as well.
3265000	3271000	Because PlayStation 4 has been selling pretty well. A lot of people have upgraded. It makes sense for them to release on PlayStation 4.
3271000	3274000	So Persona fans, I'm sure, are very happy about that.
3274000	3280000	And Dark Sakura, I know you're a fan of this series. Not everybody has necessarily played these games.
3280000	3286000	But over in Japan, there will be a new game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in the Ys series.
3286000	3287000	Ys.
3287000	3289000	Not to be confused with wise.
3289000	3290000	Ys.
3290000	3292000	But a lot of people say wise.
3292000	3294000	And they're wrong. It's Ys.
3294000	3300000	So that will be happening. This all, again, coming out of the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2014 press event.
3300000	3306000	It will be coming out in the 2015 window for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Again, that's Japan.
3306000	3308000	Tokyo Game Shows this week, right?
3308000	3312000	This week or next week. I don't remember. I thought it was one more week.
3312000	3313000	I think it's this week.
3313000	3316000	It could be. Akuma's in chat. He should know.
3316000	3320000	I'm just curious to see if The Last Guardian's gonna be there.
3320000	3322000	Ah, don't hold your breath.
3322000	3327000	It might be this week because I know Square Enix unveiled their lineup for Tokyo Game Show and Final Fantasy XV is not there.
3327000	3330000	There's supposed to be a Konami panel where they're showing off...
3330000	3335000	Well, it said more PT stuff, but I don't think they would show that same demo that's been out forever.
3335000	3340000	I mean, hopefully that means we're gonna see more Silent Hill stuff.
3340000	3343000	AkumaJP says next week for Tokyo Game Show.
3343000	3344000	Okay.
3344000	3345000	So there you go.
3345000	3347000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3347000	3353000	Well, we've been focusing on the other two. How about a little bit of attention for Microsoft?
3353000	3355000	Why not?
3355000	3360000	Well, they are tweaking the Xbox Live reward program to add some different features.
3360000	3366000	And one of this right now is ways to earn credits for what you buy or what you've done.
3366000	3369000	This is for Xbox One and Xbox 360.
3369000	3373000	They have a star system that will give you rebates on your purchases.
3373000	3375000	You have to spend a lot of money there to get it to work.
3375000	3379000	To get one star, you have to spend $150 annually.
3379000	3382000	And then that gives you a 1% rebate.
3382000	3385000	And you can get up to 5% through earning stars.
3385000	3388000	You do this through your Live Gold.
3388000	3390000	You do this, you know, like I said, through buying stuff.
3390000	3393000	But Live Gold members will have that doubled.
3393000	3397000	The typical way, like I said, is making purchases.
3397000	3401000	There will be different promotions open that, like, you buy certain things.
3401000	3403000	You get a certain amount of credit.
3403000	3409000	And then there will also be surveys monthly and referring friends to the program.
3409000	3415000	Gold members will earn 1,000 credits by just downloading and playing one of the free games with Gold.
3415000	3418000	Releases for 10 hours. That's an example.
3418000	3420000	There's a lot of information on it.
3420000	3427000	Actually, through the Xbox Live rewards website at rewards.xbox.com.
3427000	3430000	$150 sure seems like a lot to spend in a year.
3430000	3431000	But at the same time...
3431000	3433000	In a year? That's three games?
3433000	3437000	Yeah, that's where I'm having trouble.
3437000	3439000	I'm sure there's people sitting there going, Rob, you're an idiot.
3439000	3445000	But it's because I don't buy a lot of my disc-based games, for lack of a better term, digitally.
3445000	3448000	But I can see where they're trying to give incentive now for people to do that.
3448000	3453000	Like, the Wii U had done this too with the whole Premium Bundle that they had.
3453000	3456000	Unless you get a registration code for buying physical copies.
3456000	3459000	That would be cool, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
3459000	3463000	And the reason why, and we've talked about this on the show before,
3463000	3468000	is that you've got to give value to the digital games for the equity you lose in the physical games.
3468000	3470000	Of being able to sell the game back.
3470000	3476000	And Steam does this very well by bargain basementing the digital price.
3476000	3480000	And so they say, hey, it's ten bucks over here.
3480000	3481000	Exactly, that's my thing.
3481000	3486000	A lot of these new release games that come out digitally are the same damn price as...
3486000	3488000	And there's nothing extra with it.
3488000	3491000	Here's what's... Well, and I know we'll get into it a little later in the show,
3491000	3495000	but I think Destiny in some ways, and I know we're going to get into it later,
3495000	3499000	but one thing they're doing with the collector's edition, they're trying to sell that digitally too.
3499000	3502000	You know, they're really pushing the digital angle.
3502000	3504000	And I think this is why, is because they're trying...
3504000	3509000	This is the creative way to get out the resale market.
3509000	3514000	My problem with digital distribution in general is that, I mean, you think about it this way.
3514000	3519000	You have very little in the cost of advertising, packaging, shipping.
3519000	3524000	The companies are saving a lot of money, but they're not cutting the prices on the content.
3524000	3525000	Exactly.
3525000	3531000	And I don't even think that adding incentive like this for buying the content at full price is going to be enough.
3531000	3535000	There has to be another incentive, and that's where Steam is succeeding with that.
3535000	3542000	Because they are making just enough overhead, I think, that they're turning an okay profit for their end of things.
3542000	3547000	But they're also, I think, being, they get their revenue in other ways as well.
3547000	3550000	Packaging though, packaging for games is so damn cheap.
3550000	3554000	It's not, it's just really cheap.
3554000	3555000	But it's still money.
3555000	3560000	It's a couple bucks, but seriously though, like marketing funds, yeah, that's expensive.
3560000	3562000	They spend several million dollars.
3562000	3567000	I think it's a hundred million dollars they're spending on just marketing Destiny.
3567000	3568000	Yeah.
3568000	3572000	What we heard about that was, it's a half billion dollar game, isn't it?
3572000	3576000	Probably with marketing, yeah, throwing in there, it's probably, yeah, that's about right.
3576000	3580000	Yeah, I mean, again with the whole digital.
3580000	3583000	You know where they're doing well with digital, it seems though.
3583000	3589000	You know what they're doing smartly, and what Sony and Microsoft have both done, and I believe Nintendo has done this as well,
3589000	3597000	very smart to push the games digitally, is the whole pre-download and be able to play the game at 12.01 AM.
3597000	3600000	Pre-load or whatever they call it, you know what I mean?
3600000	3606000	I'm just trying to make my, so basically you get to download it and it activates right at release.
3606000	3610000	Right, and this is a big thing Destiny's doing, is that if you download the game,
3610000	3616000	they are really buying into the instant gratification needs of the gaming community, which be real,
3616000	3619000	there's a lot of people in the gaming community that need that instant gratification.
3619000	3621000	I want to play it now.
3621000	3622000	They want it.
3622000	3623000	Right.
3623000	3625000	And they're too used to getting their way.
3625000	3631000	And you know what would help doing that is pre-order DLC.
3631000	3638000	Stop doing this fucking retailer exclusive pre-order DLC and make that digital pre-order DLC.
3638000	3640000	No, don't encourage them.
3640000	3644000	I would like to tell the entire gaming community right now,
3644000	3650000	game makers are not, you're not entitled to your game now. End of story.
3650000	3655000	But at the same time, well, I, but I know people who really love the digital thing.
3655000	3660000	Good for them. Let them take advantage of it and let them read through whatever benefits there are from it.
3660000	3666000	You know, but if you want to push that, you need to make it more attractive.
3666000	3673000	And I don't think having the game O release, like when I'm going to be awake for an hour to play it,
3673000	3678000	or the average person is going to be awake for an hour to play it before they have to go to work the next day.
3678000	3684000	You know, that's nothing that that's, that's bread, you know, little, here's a few crumbs.
3684000	3687000	Thank you, sir. May I have another, whatever.
3687000	3690000	All I know is I've got money I got to spend on my Xbox account.
3690000	3695000	So I'm probably gonna end up buying destiny just because I've got to spend that money.
3695000	3697000	So it doesn't expire.
3697000	3702000	You can run the VoG network crew on the Microsoft platforms because Bobby me.
3702000	3704000	No, no. Travis is on Microsoft as well.
3704000	3706000	So you and Travis will be on the Microsoft site.
3706000	3708000	I do want the PlayStation version.
3708000	3712000	No, I mean, that's what it's like me and Diablo.
3712000	3718000	If only I had a way to transfer my Xbox money onto my PlayStation account, it would just be fantastic.
3718000	3721000	Let's talk about my sick problem with Mass Effect.
3721000	3727000	So should we remind everybody that I own the trilogy for Mass Effect on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.
3727000	3731000	The only thing I don't have is Mass Effect three on the Wii U and the minute that sick puppy.
3731000	3734000	Well, I'll probably when it's $20 in a bargain bin, I'll probably have that too.
3734000	3735000	Let's be real.
3735000	3738000	I had zero need for it on another system.
3738000	3744000	We'll also have it on PlayStation four whenever they do an HD or remix.
3744000	3746000	Bring it the fuck on.
3746000	3749000	I want multiplayer Mass Effect on PlayStation four so fucking bad.
3749000	3753000	Did you hear about the Dragon Age Inquisition multiplayer supposed to be similar to Mass Effect?
3753000	3754000	Yes.
3754000	3755000	And I am excited.
3755000	3760000	I was not really like foaming at the mouth over Dragon Age like Alan and Shane were.
3760000	3765000	But now that like I'm hearing about all this other stuff, I'm like, now I'm going to fucking play Dragon Age two.
3765000	3768000	Rob, I put in my order for it already for the deluxe edition.
3768000	3769000	Of course you did.
3769000	3771000	Was there any ever any doubt?
3771000	3779000	It's except Shane and I were having a chat because we're both at low cat about like romance options.
3779000	3782000	And everybody that I wanted to romance is not an option.
3782000	3784000	Namely, very Vivian and Morgan.
3784000	3786000	Yeah, but you'll be on the PC hackers going to hack.
3786000	3789000	You'll be able to romance whoever you want within months.
3789000	3791000	OK, then tell me why you can't.
3791000	3794000	You'll be able to romance Paris.
3794000	3798000	I'm going to put Garris in my team and then I'll reinvent my hawk on Dragon Age.
3798000	3800000	That would be awesome.
3800000	3802000	They can put Thomas the Train in Skyrim.
3802000	3804000	They can put Garris in Dragon Age.
3804000	3808000	Go romance yourself.
3808000	3809000	All right.
3809000	3811000	Let's move on.
3811000	3812000	Loki, what do you got?
3812000	3813000	This is kind of cool.
3813000	3818000	This is a brand new kind of VR headset powered by Oculus.
3818000	3821000	It's the Samsung Gear VR headset.
3821000	3828000	And what's kind of cool about this is that it actually uses the Galaxy Note 4.
3828000	3833000	And it's this thing that it plugs into basically that makes it into almost like an Oculus Rift.
3833000	3839000	More like the dev kit one, though, because it doesn't have the actual spatial tracking.
3839000	3842000	But still pretty cool.
3842000	3850000	And they've got a lot of people already making games for it, including they even showed off like a VR version of Temple Run.
3850000	3856000	So I'm kind of on it.
3856000	3862000	But yeah, I can't afford a new phone right now, but looks cool.
3862000	3868000	And of course, it would be separate on top of the phone, which I'm guessing would be kind of expensive on top.
3868000	3870000	But it's supposed to be out later this year.
3870000	3872000	So we'll see.
3872000	3875000	They haven't announced pricing or when exactly we're going to see it yet.
3875000	3878000	But I don't know.
3878000	3880000	It's kind of exciting that we're seeing a lot of stuff out now.
3880000	3882000	And it's actually a consumer piece.
3882000	3885000	So looking forward to it.
3885000	3887000	Bobby talked about this a lot on his show tonight.
3887000	3890000	The Bobby Blackwell show, which is on before us at vognetwork.com.
3890000	3897000	And he had been talking about, and I kind of agree with this, that it's going to be good that this is going to establish like a baseline kind of product.
3898000	3901000	Where things can be optimized for this.
3901000	3903000	Does that make sense?
3903000	3905000	So that's kind of exciting.
3905000	3908000	It's kind of interesting to see VR on cell phones, I guess.
3908000	3910000	If that makes sense.
3910000	3913000	Because this is going to be running on like a cell phone platform.
3913000	3918000	So the thing that I like that's kind of cool about it is it is wireless.
3918000	3925000	And one of the things I always worry with with the Oculus Rift is I have a laptop.
3926000	3930000	It's a gaming laptop, I guess, if you will.
3930000	3934000	But gaming laptops aren't exactly the same as a gaming PC.
3934000	3938000	It's not spec-wise the most powerful thing on earth.
3938000	3941000	And a lot of the games I can't run in high.
3941000	3946000	It's kind of a medium settings based PC, if you will.
3946000	3951000	So I don't know how well the Oculus Rift would run on my laptop.
3951000	3958000	But something like this that uses the phone to power it might be kind of cool.
3958000	3962000	Or something like Project Morpheus, which is supposed to have something externally,
3962000	3965000	doing a lot of the computation for it would be fantastic.
3965000	3970000	I hope that when the Oculus Rift does come out that we have something like that.
3970000	3974000	Like Project Morpheus where it has something doing some extra computation
3974000	3979000	so that people like me that don't have the most powerful system ever
3979000	3982000	can still run it rather well.
3983000	3987000	All right. Can we go back to a previous topic real quick here before we get into the next story?
3987000	3988000	Because you bought it.
3988000	3994000	Let's get into I need to play something here before we do the next segment here.
3994000	3995000	I know this is a little early.
3998000	4001000	I need to give an F.U. of the week to act deft in chat.
4001000	4004000	Don't let him act deft for your weakness.
4005000	4010000	Act deft during Loki reading that last article there linked me on Amazon.com
4010000	4016000	to Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U for 13 bucks. 13 bucks.
4017000	4018000	It'll be here on Wednesday.
4020000	4023000	Rob. Rob. Stand up.
4024000	4025000	I'm standing.
4025000	4026000	Come here.
4026000	4027000	I'm coming over.
4028000	4029000	Hand.
4029000	4030000	Here's my hand.
4031000	4032000	Why did you slap my hand?
4033000	4034000	Bad Rob.
4034000	4035000	No. No.
4035000	4036000	Bad.
4036000	4037000	Says the lady who bought a video.
4037000	4038000	Bad consumer whore.
4038000	4041000	No. Says the lady who bought a video game with a fucking dish.
4041000	4043000	No. I will not have this fuckery.
4043000	4045000	Technically Dan bought it. For me.
4046000	4048000	I will not have this fuckery because guess what?
4048000	4049000	It also had a clock.
4049000	4050000	Guess what?
4050000	4056000	Come Wednesday I own every release of Mass Effect there has been.
4057000	4058000	You're still naughty.
4058000	4060000	BioWare just put your cock in my mouth.
4060000	4061000	Seriously.
4062000	4065000	Rob. Rob is a bottom for Mass Effect.
4066000	4069000	That's not true. Whatever you read on the bathroom stall is not true.
4071000	4074000	Oh my god. I cannot believe I just fucking bought it.
4074000	4075000	I can.
4075000	4076000	Or.
4076000	4079000	Alex in chat going are you fucking serious right now?
4079000	4080000	Rob is a consumer whore.
4080000	4084000	You know you probably could have gotten that used somewhere like for a lot less than 13 dollars.
4084000	4085000	Yeah.
4085000	4088000	On top of that it's actually supposed to be not like very great.
4088000	4092000	Because it like cuts out so many of the different options.
4093000	4096000	That like you have no option to save the council.
4097000	4098000	You like.
4098000	4100000	It's just all kinds of missing stuff.
4100000	4103000	It was really strange when they gave you the option to romance Mario.
4103000	4106000	I just didn't understand why they had to throw that into that version of the game.
4106000	4107000	But there it was.
4109000	4110000	And.
4110000	4112000	No. Rob doesn't do the Garris romance right?
4112000	4113000	You always romance Caden.
4113000	4114000	I always romance Caden.
4115000	4116000	So.
4116000	4118000	Okay. Then you have to make me a promise in this one.
4118000	4119000	Oh god. What?
4119000	4121000	You're going to romance Steve.
4124000	4126000	I don't want to be some dude's rebound.
4126000	4129000	You're. It won't be the rebound.
4129000	4131000	But you have to do this for me.
4131000	4132000	Alright. Fine. Fine. I'll do it.
4132000	4134000	Your first play through you romance Steve.
4134000	4136000	For Dark Sakura I will romance Cortez.
4136000	4137000	Cortez.
4137000	4140000	Corteshep. I don't know. I don't know how you.
4140000	4141000	Sheptez.
4141000	4142000	Alright.
4142000	4143000	I will call it Sheptez.
4144000	4148000	Now. Now Alan is. Alan is giving me a mini lecture in chat right now.
4148000	4151000	And the story simulator to set up your career is missing hella shit.
4151000	4153000	Like Dark Sakura said.
4153000	4156000	Don't sit there and tell me you are not morbidly curious.
4156000	4159000	That you don't have an ounce of morbid curiosity.
4159000	4160000	I've seen it.
4160000	4163000	The one cool thing is that whole map thing on the thing.
4163000	4164000	Yeah.
4164000	4165000	That's fun.
4165000	4166000	You know what?
4166000	4167000	What?
4167000	4169000	I did that with my PC by calling it the internet.
4169000	4171000	And I want to play multiplayer.
4171000	4174000	Is anybody playing Mass Effect 3 on Wii U multiplayer?
4174000	4175000	Echo. Echo.
4175000	4177000	Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
4178000	4180000	Mass Effect. Mass Effect. Mass Effect.
4180000	4182000	Wii. Wii. Wii.
4183000	4184000	You.
4185000	4186000	Rob.
4187000	4188000	Rob.
4188000	4189000	I can't believe. It was 13 bucks.
4189000	4190000	Rob.
4190000	4191000	Give me a break. What?
4191000	4193000	You know what else you can get for 13 bucks?
4193000	4194000	Uh. Lunch.
4194000	4195000	Really bad heroin.
4197000	4200000	But you don't see people going out and getting really bad heroin.
4200000	4202000	This is really bad heroin for him.
4204000	4206000	I can't. Is there anybody out there?
4206000	4210000	Is there anybody out there who says, you know what, Rob?
4210000	4211000	Good job.
4211000	4213000	Is there anybody out there who says, Rob?
4213000	4217000	Rob, the entire internet at this moment is judging you.
4217000	4221000	And just think of how much more judgment will go during the podcast.
4221000	4222000	But you brought the Wii version.
4222000	4223000	I'm gonna say something.
4223000	4224000	It's a special edition.
4224000	4226000	Like as in special bus.
4226000	4228000	Dark Sakura could be a lot worse.
4229000	4230000	Cause I'm not a woman.
4231000	4232000	Right now in gaming.
4235000	4236000	Alright. You know what?
4236000	4238000	Seriously. Enough with you.
4239000	4242000	I am so tired of hearing about like, you know.
4243000	4244000	Yes. Guess what?
4244000	4246000	There's dicks on the internet.
4246000	4250000	Both physically, you know, literally and metaphorically.
4250000	4251000	Okay.
4252000	4255000	Did we just start playing games on the internet?
4255000	4260000	Do we not know that there's people out there that will do crazy, stupid shit when they're anonymous?
4260000	4261000	Really?
4261000	4264000	Are you at all surprised that this is happening?
4264000	4267000	Because I'm not at all surprised at all that this is happening.
4267000	4273000	There actually is a study out about mental illness and anonymous bashing of other people.
4273000	4276000	That they are technically sociopaths.
4276000	4278000	For the record, it's all straight up fuckery.
4278000	4281000	But that's why I had to have a laugh at its expense.
4282000	4283000	So.
4283000	4284000	By the way.
4284000	4285000	What?
4285000	4286000	Bitch.
4287000	4288000	Let's see.
4288000	4291000	Fifth Dream in chat says, good job Rob. Thank you.
4291000	4295000	And no one can call me a whore for it because I do not have the Garris moe pillow.
4297000	4298000	There you go.
4298000	4299000	Alright. There we go.
4299000	4300000	Thank god.
4301000	4302000	Alright.
4302000	4304000	I want to know where Shane is during all of this.
4304000	4305000	Sleeping.
4305000	4306000	Alright.
4306000	4307000	I need some judgement in here.
4308000	4309000	Alright.
4309000	4310000	Alright.
4310000	4314000	Well, here's a console I will not be able to buy Mass Effect on because it doesn't exist.
4314000	4315000	On the Ouya.
4315000	4319000	Yes, the Ouya is still out there selling systems.
4319000	4322000	Actually, you know when the Ouya came to GamerX, they were showing off some pretty interesting
4322000	4323000	looking things on the Ouya.
4323000	4324000	The rabbit game.
4324000	4325000	Yeah.
4325000	4327000	A lot of that stuff looked really cool.
4327000	4332000	I know the guys over at GamerX and gals and everybody over at GamerX are really pushing
4332000	4336000	the read only memories thing and that's an Ouya thing.
4336000	4341000	But maybe the Ouya is going to become something a little different because the Ouya, apparently,
4341000	4343000	looking to be acquired.
4343000	4348000	Currently in talks with Google, Amazon, and some Chinese companies including Tencent,
4348000	4350000	who owns Riot Games, by the way.
4350000	4352000	This comes from some sources.
4352000	4355000	The ever present sources with ReCode.
4355000	4361000	No formal offers on the table yet, but we know YouTube's got a billion dollars to spend.
4361000	4362000	So, who knows?
4362000	4364000	Anything's possible.
4364000	4367000	That'll be interesting if the Ouya does get acquired by somebody else.
4367000	4370000	That'd be very interesting if somebody like Google or Amazon got it.
4370000	4374000	I mean, I know Amazon just spent a lot of money with Twitch, so maybe they're a little
4374000	4377000	bit, and they're trying to do their whole thing with Amazon Fire and all that too, so
4377000	4379000	maybe they're a little bit less of a contender.
4379000	4383000	But Google, it'd be very interesting if Google walked out of this whole thing with the Ouya.
4383000	4384000	Could be interesting.
4384000	4386000	Really?
4386000	4389000	Why would they do that?
4390000	4393000	Because of the brand recognition that Ouya brings?
4396000	4400000	I mean, because I'm just thinking like, you know, a company like Google that seems to
4400000	4405000	be pretty innovative, that they could probably whip out their own fucking console in like
4405000	4407000	two seconds without needing the purchase.
4407000	4410000	Funny you say that, because didn't they put out the Google TV thing?
4410000	4414000	That little USB stick or that thingy that you just plug in the TV and it's supposed
4414000	4415000	to do all the streaming and all that?
4415000	4416000	Yeah, the Chromecast.
4416000	4417000	Okay, thank you, the Chromecast.
4417000	4418000	That's what I'm trying to think of.
4418000	4419000	What sold more?
4419000	4420000	Ouya's or Chromecast?
4420000	4421000	I have a Chromecast.
4421000	4422000	Do you really?
4422000	4423000	Yes, I do.
4423000	4424000	I don't even have one.
4424000	4425000	What sold more?
4425000	4426000	Actually, it's super awesome.
4426000	4429000	Well, considering that the Chromecast came out way after the Ouya.
4429000	4431000	It was 30 bucks.
4431000	4433000	I probably think the Chromecast sold more.
4433000	4437000	I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there as a question, because maybe you're asking
4437000	4441000	like, what could Google do with Ouya, and maybe something similar to a more robust type of
4441000	4442000	Chromecast.
4442000	4443000	They've got those, though.
4443000	4446000	They've got like, the GameStick was supposed to be very similar to that, and they've got
4446000	4452000	so many of these, you know, device, Android device on HDMI stick things.
4452000	4456000	I just don't see them wanting to buy this.
4456000	4461000	I mean, you want to hear something funny?
4461000	4466000	I could imagine, you know, what if GameStop bought this?
4466000	4470000	Because, you know, they're looking, they want a gaming platform.
4470000	4471000	Can you imagine?
4471000	4473000	I could see them doing that.
4473000	4474000	Don't say that, don't say that.
4474000	4478000	Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a code man jumping into
4478000	4482000	the Mass Effect 3 debate a little late, but says, had to come into chat real quick to
4482000	4484000	tell Rob I bought it this morning.
4484000	4486000	High five, bro.
4486000	4488000	High five.
4488000	4494000	And as you're, you know, you're high fives echo the vast nothingness that is the people
4494000	4500000	playing on Mass Effect 3 online on the Nintendo network.
4500000	4505000	It's like, dude, I'm getting my party cool because you're the only one playing.
4505000	4510000	Hey, I will play, Cody and I will be the two people playing on Wii U.
4510000	4511000	It's fine.
4511000	4514000	I don't know, maybe you could, you know, beg George to play too.
4514000	4515000	There you go.
4515000	4518000	We'll have it, the old stuff's going to be cool again.
4518000	4523000	Let's see, folks in chat seem to think the Chromecast probably sold better.
4523000	4526000	Mega Man X 400, our buddy from Video Game Realness.
4526000	4527000	Yeah, thank you, that's right.
4527000	4528000	Chromecast sold more hands down.
4528000	4531000	I completely forgot about Android TV, yes, so there.
4531000	4534000	Don't need fucking, you know, Ouya.
4534000	4537000	This whole, this is all speculation and tinfoil happening.
4537000	4539000	If Google buys it, could they call it the Ouya?
4542000	4544000	I'm making a great marketing campaign.
4544000	4545000	Ouya!
4547000	4548000	What's it going to do?
4548000	4550000	It's going to Ouya.
4551000	4553000	And this is why Rob is not a marketing...
4553000	4555000	Download porn, it's a Ouya.
4556000	4559000	You know what we use our Chromecast for, by the way?
4559000	4560000	Porn?
4560000	4564000	Watching, no, watching endless, endless streams of video game playthroughs.
4564000	4571000	Oh, oh, I almost forgot, going way back to the new 3DS.
4571000	4576000	The new 3DS, parental locked, unless you pay money to unlock it.
4576000	4578000	Shut the fuck up, where did you hear that?
4578000	4583000	It's parental locked, it's not a lot of money, it requires about 60 cents to unlock it.
4583000	4587000	But it's parental locked when you get it, you have to pay money in order to unlock it.
4587000	4589000	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
4589000	4591000	Is that like just a credit card check or something?
4591000	4595000	Well, they charge you 60 cents and then they don't give you that money back.
4595000	4599000	So I would, I guess if you want to call that a credit card check, I'd call that as a micro transaction.
4599000	4603000	But that was something that they did, yeah.
4603000	4610000	Because, you know, those HTML5 web browsers, those are all compatible with all those porn sites out there.
4610000	4615000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Soccer, one more story before release dates.
4615000	4623000	Well, okay, you know how we have been going on and on about the Nut Neutrality thing going on,
4623000	4630000	and how it's a load of bullshit, and how different companies are going to be able to throttle our connection.
4630000	4635000	Well, on September 10th, there's actually a big protest going on by a group called Fight for the Future.
4635000	4642000	And a lot of other major sites and companies will be included on this one.
4642000	4647000	What they're going to do is they're going to show people what the internet might look like
4647000	4652000	if the FCC makes the changes that it wants to make.
4652000	4659000	Basically, Tom Wheeler, who's the chairman of the FCC, proposed changes that would make it okay
4659000	4665000	for the service providers to charge content for, you know, charge for faster and better access.
4665000	4673000	The fast lanes. So basically, there is, there's going to be, now it's not going to change the speed or anything,
4673000	4675000	they're not going to try to throttle their own websites.
4675000	4681000	But what they're going to do is start popping up things that look like rainbow wheels, or loading symbols,
4681000	4688000	or, you know, make, just basically give you an idea of what the web's going to look like,
4688000	4691000	how inconvenient and messy things are going to be.
4691000	4698000	It's also including Etsy, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Wordpress, Vimeo, Reddit, Mozilla, Imgur,
4698000	4700000	is it Imgur or Imgur? Anyway.
4700000	4707000	Meetup, Cheeseburger, Namecheap, BitTorrent, Gandhi.net, Startpage, Boing Boing, and Dowola.
4707000	4709000	Some of them I haven't heard of.
4709000	4716000	We'll be also with 35 advocacy organizations and other activists to show what this is going to be looking at.
4716000	4722000	They're going to basically put messages on there with an infinitely spinning site loading icon,
4722000	4730000	or the wheel of death, to symbolize what the web would look like without net neutrality.
4730000	4735000	Just alert, basically, it's basically like the equivalent of standing out on the street holding signs.
4735000	4739000	It's going to be on the sites that you look at.
4739000	4742000	This is a good way to kind of bring awareness to this.
4742000	4746000	I think a lot of plugged in people I like to think already know about this,
4746000	4751000	but hopefully some of the sites participating are things that maybe are sites that people check
4751000	4757000	that aren't necessarily going to be advocacy sort of things like, I don't know, like news websites,
4757000	4761000	things that people, like CNN and things like that, but I don't know.
4761000	4766000	But it being on Etsy and Kickstarter, right there, though, those are pretty good.
4766000	4770000	Yeah, those are pretty good. How about Pinterest? Can we get on Pinterest?
4770000	4775000	You know what would be funny is that if Pinterest actually changed their little pinnet icon temporarily
4775000	4780000	to just a spinning wheel or an X, you know.
4780000	4786000	Well, just a reminder, guys, if you do not like the idea of net neutrality, write some letters,
4786000	4790000	call Congress people, vote, vote, vote, vote.
4790000	4795000	Actually, if you do like the idea of net neutrality, then you would probably do.
4795000	4796000	Did I say it backwards?
4796000	4797000	Yeah.
4797000	4799000	I did say it backwards, so thank you, Loki.
4799000	4802000	If you support me buying a dictionary, vote, vote, vote.
4802000	4809000	If you support a free and equal internet for all people who are basically all on the same type of connection
4809000	4813000	unless you're one of those poor people in the mountains who has dial-up, they exist.
4813000	4817000	Yeah, sure. Alaska is a state.
4817000	4821000	Write Congress, write your local representatives,
4821000	4827000	and make sure that you continue adding to the millions of others who have written into the FCC protesting this.
4827000	4832000	Make your voice heard, and I'd say hit them where it hurts.
4832000	4837000	If, you know, I'd say, hey, especially if you're a campaign contributor,
4837000	4842000	say I'm going to withdraw all of my campaign support until you turn this around.
4842000	4848000	Because the reason why FCC is letting this through is because they're being paid.
4848000	4850000	They're plain and simple.
4850000	4856000	Campaign donations coming from Comcast, Time Warner, any of these companies,
4856000	4862000	so that they will get the reaction out of the government that they need to lend their pockets.
4862000	4863000	All right.
4863000	4864000	End of story.
4864000	4869000	Before we get to the release dates, I just want to point this out because I just got a picture from Brad.
4869000	4872000	It's a picture of Ouya. This is our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad.
4872000	4876000	It's a picture of his Ouya sitting on the desk, and he replied to me and he said,
4876000	4880000	hey, don't knock the Ouya. This is my desk right now.
4880000	4885000	So I replied, hot Ouya shot.
4885000	4890000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out in a store near you.
4890000	4897000	This week we have Destiny coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
4897000	4906000	And if you're not into, you know, massive space, you know, epic shooter games, then there's hockey for you.
4906000	4911000	NHL 15 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4911000	4917000	Also an ultimate edition of those as well if you want the extra credits for building your ultimate team.
4917000	4919000	That's it.
4919000	4923000	All right. I guess not a lot of people want to go up against Destiny, eh?
4923000	4924000	Nope.
4924000	4925000	Nope.
4925000	4928000	All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
4928000	4929000	Hey, guess what?
4929000	4931000	Destiny is a thing in Japan as well.
4931000	4935000	September 11th is the release out over there because they get games on different days.
4935000	4940000	Also the DualShock 4 in white is also coming out in Japan to kind of celebrate that.
4940000	4942000	So check that out on the PlayStation 4.
4942000	4944000	The Xbox One is now out in Japan.
4944000	4946000	That happened while we were out.
4946000	4954000	But no releases to note right now for the Xbox One in Japan for this week because they just obviously released it out there.
4954000	4956000	So they kind of did all the launch games already.
4956000	4961000	PlayStation 3 will get Destiny this week as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo with Power Up Kit.
4961000	4962000	That is a price reduction actually.
4962000	4966000	That's going into the best series along with Sangokushi 12.
4966000	4971000	New games on the PlayStation 3 include Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Midstorm Revolution.
4971000	4973000	Because, you know, you got to have a Naruto game.
4973000	4976000	It is a day of the week ending in Y.
4976000	4983000	Eiyu Densetsu Sen no Kiseke 2 comes out in regular and limited drama CD bundle set.
4983000	4984000	Oops.
4984000	4985000	That's the 25th.
4985000	4986000	Sorry, I got ahead of myself.
4986000	4987000	Well, there you go.
4987000	4989000	A little preview of what's to come in two weeks.
4989000	4993000	On the Xbox 360, Naruto Shippuden is out this week as well.
4993000	4998000	On the Wii U, nothing until the 20th, but the 20th is Bayonetta 2.
4998000	5000000	So that's a really big release for the Wii U.
5000000	5010000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, on the 11th, Chain Chronicle 5, Criminal Girls Invitation and Sangokushi 12 gets a price reduction there.
5010000	5013000	Those last two games, price reduction games on the Vita.
5013000	5017000	Lastly but not leastly, the Nintendo 3DS.
5017000	5022000	Dairanto Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, September 13th.
5022000	5025000	Oh my God, I did not realize it was that soon.
5025000	5031000	No wonder, my people that, my friends that own Japanese 3DSes, because you know the whole stupid thing is region locked, right?
5031000	5032000	No wonder they're so excited.
5032000	5036000	That is coming out, like, this week.
5036000	5037000	Holy crap.
5037000	5040000	We're going to know a lot more about this game this week.
5040000	5044000	We'll find out if it's true that the Duck Hunt dogs in the game are not.
5044000	5046000	It's pretty cool.
5046000	5049000	I'm looking forward to that being released over here.
5049000	5052000	Alright, last but not leastly, the UK, Dar Sakura.
5052000	5054000	On the 9th, Destiny.
5054000	5057000	And on the 11th, Train Fever for Mac.
5057000	5058000	That's it.
5058000	5060000	They're essentially the same game.
5060000	5064000	Destiny and Train Fever.
5064000	5069000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before the classic game of the week.
5069000	5072000	Alright, speaking of Destiny.
5072000	5077000	If you are inclined, you can purchase that digitally and guess what?
5077000	5080000	You'll get a free upgrade to the next gen version.
5080000	5085000	That is of course if you buy a Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 version digitally.
5085000	5091000	You will get a free upgrade when, you know, for people like me that don't have a Playstation 4 or Xbox One yet.
5091000	5097000	You'll get a free upgrade to the Xbox One or Playstation 4 version depending on which platform you purchase that on.
5097000	5099000	So, absolutely free.
5099000	5104000	For a limited time though. They haven't said how long that's going to last but it is for a limited time.
5104000	5109000	On top of that you also get of course the Guardian, was it?
5109000	5114000	It also includes I guess the standard or guardian editions of the game as well as expansion passes.
5114000	5117000	So if you buy those on one platform you get them on the other one.
5117000	5119000	Cool.
5119000	5126000	And we kind of got into this a little bit earlier about the whole fact that, you know, they're really giving incentives for people to buy digitally.
5126000	5130000	This is a huge one for people that are still on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
5130000	5134000	In fact, it almost sounds like, Loki, this might have swayed your decision big time.
5134000	5136000	Well, I just, I don't know what the hell it's been, Mike.
5136000	5139000	I have like $70 in like fucking Xbox money, so.
5139000	5140000	Wow.
5140000	5141000	Yeah, it.
5141000	5143000	Must be nice just to have that money lying around.
5143000	5144000	Long story there, but yeah.
5144000	5148000	I've got that stuck in my account and I'm like, what the fuck am I going to buy this?
5148000	5151000	So, got to pick something soon before it expires.
5151000	5153000	And then that'll be an Xbox One game if you ever get an Xbox One.
5153000	5154000	Exactly.
5154000	5155000	Alright.
5155000	5160000	Alright, lastly before we get to the classic game of the week, some updates on Mighty No. 9.
5160000	5169000	Mighty No. 9, if you were a Kickstarter backer of a certain level, you got a Mighty No. 9 beta that was available for those backers.
5169000	5176000	A lot of this came out of PAX, so it might be just over a week old, but with a big game like Mighty No. 9, I wanted to bring this up anyway.
5176000	5178000	I've heard good things about it from people who are playing it.
5178000	5182000	Yeah, I actually watched a Twitch stream of somebody who was kind of playing it and it looked like it was.
5182000	5184000	Our intern Drew has it.
5184000	5185000	Oh really?
5185000	5186000	Yes.
5186000	5187000	So fun.
5187000	5193000	Yeah, it looks like it's pretty challenging, like one of the old Mega Man games that you are going to have to kind of have that muscle memory of jump now, shoot now.
5193000	5196000	You know, just having to get all those little patterns down, so.
5196000	5205000	You had to donate more than $80 to this in order to get this beta, but it is available and out there, so if you haven't seen this, it's all over YouTube now.
5205000	5207000	Some folks doing that.
5207000	5217000	By the way, also coming to Mighty No. 9 multiplayer, that's pretty cool, online race battle through, and a little video posted of that earlier this week.
5217000	5221000	So this Mighty No. 9 sounds like it's going to be a pretty hot release. I'm excited about it.
5221000	5222000	Alright.
5222000	5224000	Let's go back to a simpler time.
5224000	5230000	Let's go back to a time when this game could have just been like Mega Man 11 or something.
5230000	5240000	It's the classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking out this game this week.
5240000	5241000	Yeah.
5241000	5247000	Not your freaking Destinies and your Diablos and whatever other crapola you're all playing this week.
5247000	5248000	Yeah.
5248000	5252000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5252000	5256000	Well, I'm sticking with my CPS2 theme that I'd like to do for a couple months.
5256000	5262000	So I picked Mars Matrix Hyper Solid Shooting, which, yes, it was a CPS2 era game.
5262000	5275000	This was a scrolling shooter game that came out, it was actually a vertical scrolling shooting game that was developed by Takumi in 2000 and published by Capcom for their CPS2 arcade board.
5275000	5289000	It came on the Dreamcast later on in 2001, and the arcade version actually used a horizontally aligned monitor like Giga Wink did, which is pretty rare for a shooter game.
5289000	5292000	So basically, yeah, it is a shooter game.
5292000	5293000	It's got an amazing soundtrack.
5293000	5295000	Rob, can we play a little bit of this?
5300000	5302000	That's just the splash screen.
5305000	5309000	But I liked it when you get to the pickle ship, so it's going to pop up in a second.
5309000	5311000	All right, tell us a little- oh, here we go.
5314000	5315000	That's really good.
5315000	5317000	Oh yeah, this is a club song right here.
5317000	5322000	Well, the whole soundtrack was just like really just on top of it.
5322000	5330000	It was pretty clubby, you know, but it fit the game because the game was like a kind of a rendered look to it.
5330000	5332000	It was actually really well done.
5332000	5340000	So anyway, the game only uses one button, but you have to use a different action along with the timing of how you do it.
5340000	5342000	So a normal shot is just pressing the A button.
5342000	5347000	Your shot power increases with each level up to level 8, depending on your experience points.
5347000	5354000	You have a piercing cannon, so by not pressing the A button for at least one second, you press A.
5354000	5359000	And the attack is basically close range that hits multiple targets.
5360000	5368000	It's stronger than the normal shot, and the strength also increases in proximity to the target.
5368000	5371000	It also, though, does not change based on level.
5371000	5381000	There's also the mosquito, where if you have like a bar up at the top that if it's full, you can hold the A button for a quarter to half a second.
5381000	5387000	The barrier gets activated, which damages any enemy that touches it until the GHB gauge is drained.
5387000	5391000	Enemy bullets are attracted towards the fighter as well.
5391000	5400000	When you release the A button while the GHB is not empty, it causes those bullets to fire in any direction away from your fighter when the A button is released.
5400000	5405000	And repelled bullets can hit the enemy when it hits the enemy and is converted to a cube.
5405000	5412000	You have the gravity hull bomb, that's the GHB by the way, where you hold the A button until the GHB gauge is emptied.
5412000	5418000	When activated, an explosion damages all on-screen enemies and destroys all the bullets.
5418000	5425000	Each of your fighters is a little different. The Mosquito 1 is the normal speed with a wide blaster and lower shot damage.
5425000	5429000	Mosquito 2 is higher speed with a laser shot and higher shot damage.
5429000	5437000	So you also get, of course, your 1-up and you get cubes, as I mentioned earlier, which increase your experience and recharge your combo meter.
5437000	5440000	Bigger cubes give you larger recharge time.
5440000	5442000	Rob, did you ever play this?
5442000	5446000	Actually, no I didn't. I didn't even realize this was one of the CPS2 era games.
5446000	5448000	This one just wasn't on my radar.
5448000	5451000	Did they release this in any of the repackagings they did?
5451000	5456000	When they did the, what, the Playstation 2?
5456000	5457000	Well, we'll be getting to that.
5457000	5458000	Excuse me.
5458000	5460000	There's a little bit about the experience system though.
5460000	5463000	I was curious if you had ever played it since the big Dreamcast of Fran.
5463000	5464000	I haven't.
5464000	5465000	What about you, Loki?
5465000	5467000	No, I've never played this.
5468000	5476000	Anyway, with the experience system, you basically capture a cube, you get EXP, and your combo meter fills up.
5476000	5478000	I do like those bullet patterns though. Those are pretty sweet.
5478000	5480000	Yeah, it's a really gorgeous game.
5482000	5489000	So basically you can deplete your combo meter if you fail to capture a cube for a prolonged period of time or if you're destroyed.
5489000	5498000	The cubes can be found by destroying enemies or parts of enemies or hitting an enemy with a repelled bullet like the charge meter we shared before.
5498000	5505000	When your experience is high, your level is increased and then you can have more powerful shots.
5505000	5512000	So as far as, yeah, the other versions that were released, there was the Dreamcast version which had arcade mode.
5512000	5518000	It says that it was a perfect conversion, but the scores for the enemies are different.
5518000	5527000	There's elite mode, which is also called a range mode, where you can adjust certain options like your combo time, ship speed, and the GHB charge speed.
5527000	5534000	In elite mode A, enemy ships and formations are changed. In elite B, the stages are the same as arcade mode.
5535000	5548000	You have score challenge mode or score attack mode where basically you kill an enemy with a piercing cannon that causes a bunch of cubes to appear and each of the cubes will increase the capacity value by one.
5548000	5553000	You have a shop system, strategy mode, a movie, and a gallery.
5553000	5564000	And then there's a bug where your score cannot go beyond 999,999,999,990.
5564000	5572000	And they basically, that was the bug in the arcade version and they fixed it by adding two extra digits in the score table.
5572000	5579000	This has only been released on the Dreamcast and arcade.
5579000	5581000	So basically, nope.
5581000	5587000	Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version of this a 31 out of 40, which is a decent score.
5587000	5594000	The game also from IGN got a rating of 8.5, which was great.
5594000	5603000	And there's also in the demo sequence for the arcade version, there's a voice clip that says, I'm not programmed to give you that information.
5603000	5608000	It was taken from Season 1 Episode 16 of Star Trek The Next Generation.
5608000	5609000	Oh really?
5609000	5610000	Yes.
5610000	5612000	So it's Roddenberry's wife?
5612000	5615000	Who did, because she did all those, the computer voices and stuff.
5615000	5617000	I don't think it was the computer.
5617000	5618000	Oh.
5618000	5619000	And anyway.
5619000	5620000	Nevermind.
5620000	5625000	But also you can get the soundtrack as I have went out on a limb looking for it.
5625000	5631000	Because yeah, anyone who has it on, like for example, it was on Amazon for 85 bucks.
5631000	5635000	But it's the Mars Matrix and GigaWing 2 soundtrack box.
5635000	5636000	And that's it.
5636000	5639000	Pretty, pretty rad game.
5639000	5646000	That's a clever way to, I don't know if it was intentional, but it was a clever way to tie the Dreamcast birthday and the CPS2 theme together.
5646000	5647000	So there you go.
5647000	5648000	It was intentional.
5648000	5649000	Alright.
5649000	5651000	Mars Matrix, classic game of the week.
5651000	5655000	If you like your shmups, like I know Dark Sakura does, I am terrible at them.
5655000	5659000	If you would like to try this game, I would be happy to lend you my copy.
5659000	5661000	Hooray, I gotta dust off my Dreamcast though.
5661000	5663000	I don't even know where the damn thing is.
5663000	5665000	I just love the music in it, it's so good.
5665000	5667000	Yeah, it sounds like the soundtrack is pretty good. I like that.
5667000	5675000	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break guys, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including rapid fire news, our Fugu question of the week about more Dreamcast.
5675000	5682000	We also have some news with games like Elder Scrolls Online, Dragon Quest 7, yes, news on 7, and League of Legends.
5682000	5684000	We got plenty of that news.
5684000	5692000	Your e-mails are FUs of the Week, your phone calls are 1-877-GAMO-LR and plenty more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5698000	5709000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on September the 7th, 2014 with the 566th episode of our show.
5709000	5717000	Which means we're only 100 away from 666th since apparently a Thufferin' Thuckattach. I can't say that number.
5717000	5719000	So there it is.
5719000	5722000	We are going to have the year of evil.
5723000	5731000	Did you think like years ago, I think we joked about episode 666, probably back during episode 66 we probably joked about it.
5731000	5736000	And to think we might actually hit that number is kind of mind blowing.
5736000	5745000	I want to say that I am spiteful enough that we should just be spiteful against reality and make it. Make it so.
5745000	5750000	Make it so. Well what is the old saying, everything I do is motivated by spite and porn?
5750000	5751000	And porn.
5751000	5754000	Is that true Loki? Is everything you do motivated by spite and porn?
5754000	5758000	I don't know about everything. Most of the things I guess.
5758000	5762000	I would have to add to that. Spite, porn and pumpkin flavored everything in the fall.
5762000	5763000	By the way.
5763000	5764000	Because it is that time of year everybody.
5764000	5767000	I had my one and only pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.
5767000	5768000	Did you? Your one and only?
5768000	5770000	It tasted like cancer, it was fantastic.
5770000	5772000	What? How did some?
5772000	5779000	The whole allegation about the stuff that's in the pumpkin spice latte frappuccino.
5779000	5781000	Yeah, no I read the Snopes article.
5781000	5788000	Well at any rate, at any rate, because I am really back on my fitness kick.
5788000	5792000	I had my one and only and that's it.
5792000	5794000	It's delicious.
5794000	5795000	You know what would make it better actually?
5795000	5796000	What?
5796000	5797000	Chocolate.
5797000	5799000	I want a pumpkin mocha frappuccino.
5799000	5802000	You could probably ask for that and get that.
5802000	5803000	Don't give me ideas.
5803000	5804000	Now she's thinking.
5805000	5807000	But pumpkin flavored everything comes in this time of year.
5807000	5810000	Because I have the pumpkin spice Keurig coffee maker cups.
5810000	5813000	Which you know the straight up coffee is not quite as bad for you as the frappuccinos.
5813000	5815000	So that's something.
5815000	5818000	And then you know I just got the email from Noah's bagels.
5818000	5822000	Pumpkin bagel with pumpkin cream cheese spread.
5822000	5823000	Good.
5823000	5825000	Pumpkin coffee.
5825000	5827000	I love it. I love it.
5827000	5833000	And then I think Rama posted on my wall earlier a joke that was a pumpkin direct condom.
5833000	5834000	I'm thinking.
5834000	5835000	Yeah I've seen that on Tumblr.
5835000	5837000	That's a little much people.
5837000	5838000	Put down the Photoshop.
5838000	5841000	Maybe if I can make it through my first week without killing people.
5841000	5844000	I will reward myself with a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.
5844000	5845000	With a pumpkin condom?
5845000	5846000	Oh a pumpkin bagel from Noah's.
5846000	5847000	Yes yes.
5847000	5848000	There you go.
5848000	5849000	Ew.
5849000	5850000	Rob.
5850000	5854000	Okay so you know the thing we don't have here in California.
5854000	5857000	Actually we just finally got like two weeks ago an hour and a half away.
5857000	5860000	That they have in Atlanta that I had to have was Dunkin Donuts.
5860000	5865000	And yes if you are somewhere outside of California we do not have Dunkin Donuts here.
5865000	5869000	Although well we just got our first one in Modesto of all fucking places.
5869000	5870000	I know right.
5870000	5871000	Like which is a two hour drive away.
5871000	5872000	I think there's some Modesto.
5872000	5873000	I don't know.
5873000	5874000	People that.
5874000	5875000	I usually know people that.
5875000	5876000	Are getting out of there quickly.
5876000	5877000	Modesto.
5877000	5880000	Actually you want to hear a funny story.
5880000	5882000	My parents met at Modesto Junior College.
5882000	5883000	Aww.
5883000	5887000	So actually every time I make fun of Modesto I really shouldn't.
5888000	5891000	You know that movie American Graffiti is about Modesto California.
5891000	5892000	Yes.
5892000	5893000	It was an early George Lucas movie.
5893000	5896000	My mother went to high school with George Lucas.
5896000	5897000	Crazy right?
5897000	5898000	Huh?
5898000	5904000	My aunt went to school with Jimmy Buffett.
5904000	5907000	One of my friends went to school with Britney Spears.
5907000	5908000	Oh my gosh.
5908000	5912000	How privileged to be in her light.
5912000	5913000	Whatever.
5913000	5915000	I'm sure she was probably pretty awful actually.
5915000	5918000	Alright so the reason why I brought up Dunkin Donuts while I was out in Atlanta.
5918000	5923000	I had to go to Dunkin Donuts which thankfully in the SunTrust Plaza which is right next
5923000	5925000	to the hotel where Dragon Con is at.
5925000	5926000	They had a Dunkin Donuts.
5926000	5927000	It's only open during the week though.
5927000	5932000	I couldn't go Saturday to Sunday but on Friday I went and bless their hearts.
5932000	5934000	They had pumpkin donuts.
5934000	5936000	And it was so good.
5936000	5937000	Rama.
5937000	5940000	I want you to go to a Dunkin Donuts.
5940000	5942000	Vacuum wrap me a couple of those.
5942000	5943000	You know where I live.
5943000	5944000	Ship me some.
5944000	5945000	Jamie.
5945000	5946000	Jamie.
5946000	5947000	Let's.
5947000	5948000	And I can't believe I'm actually going to suggest this.
5948000	5949000	Are we going to Modesto?
5949000	5950000	Let's go to Modesto.
5950000	5951000	Oh my god.
5951000	5952000	Okay.
5952000	5953000	Okay.
5953000	5954000	Okay.
5954000	5955000	I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.
5955000	5956000	Yes.
5956000	5957000	I don't.
5957000	5958000	Call in.
5958000	5959000	I'm not going to call in.
5959000	5960000	Yes you are.
5960000	5961000	Co-workers enlisted at the show that will tattle on me.
5961000	5963000	Co-workers do rob a solid.
5963000	5966000	We will buy you donuts and bring them to you.
5966000	5967000	Guys.
5967000	5970000	I seriously have a problem.
5970000	5972000	What about next Sunday before OLR?
5972000	5973000	We'll go in the morning.
5973000	5976000	Go get donuts with the church crowd and then bring them to OLR.
5976000	5980000	And Loki, who's sitting here criticizing us, can benefit from the rewards.
5980000	5981000	Look at Rama.
5981000	5982000	Look at Rama.
5982000	5983000	Look at Rama.
5983000	5984000	Rama, I love you.
5984000	5987000	I do not want anything pumpkin spice.
5987000	5989000	I fucking hate everything.
5989000	5991000	More for us.
5991000	5993000	Everything pumpkin spice.
5993000	5994000	Fine.
5994000	5995000	You can have a fucking plain glazed.
5995000	5996000	No, no, no.
5996000	5997000	I don't even want plain glazed.
5997000	6000000	You keep your own fucking donuts.
6001000	6002000	Plain glazed.
6002000	6004000	Don't look like a savage.
6004000	6005000	Rob.
6005000	6006000	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
6006000	6007000	What?
6007000	6008000	You don't want sprinkles or something?
6008000	6009000	No.
6009000	6010000	Fuck that.
6010000	6011000	I don't want anything from Dunkin' Donuts.
6011000	6012000	Fine.
6012000	6013000	We'll eat it in front of you.
6013000	6014000	Oh, and I won't care.
6014000	6015000	We need to like have donuts.
6015000	6016000	Nothing but donuts all day.
6016000	6020320	And there's people on the East Coast that are sitting there going, those stupid Californians
6020320	6023000	freaking the fuck out over Dunkin' Donuts is not even a big ass deal.
6023000	6024640	You know what I would freak out more over though?
6024640	6028800	To which I say, now you know how I feel every time you people talk about In-N-Out Burger.
6028800	6030000	It is not that big of a fucking deal.
6030000	6031520	You know what I would freak out more over though?
6031520	6032520	What?
6032520	6033520	If we got a Tim Hortons.
6033520	6035520	I'd be like, oh my God, Tim Hortons.
6035520	6039660	I've had a Tim Hortons donut twice.
6039660	6042120	Burger Hortons or Tim King might become a reality.
6042120	6043120	Whatever.
6043120	6044120	Burger King, you suck.
6044120	6045120	All right.
6045120	6047480	Look, it is a, it is a video game podcast.
6047480	6050200	You cannot have video games without donuts.
6050200	6052640	Damn it.
6052640	6053640	I have no idea.
6053640	6057640	Keep in mind, I was raised with Krispy Kreme, so when I had donuts that weren't Krispy Kreme,
6057680	6059560	I was like, why are they cakey?
6059560	6060760	Loki may beg to differ.
6060760	6063480	Can you have video games without donuts?
6063480	6065760	Yeah.
6065760	6068960	What can't you have video games without pizza, right?
6068960	6073160	You can't play video games without anything, but I like pizza.
6073160	6074400	Tim Hortons is yummy.
6074400	6075400	What happened to Loki?
6075400	6076400	You know what is good though?
6076400	6077400	You guys have seen Loki.
6077400	6078640	I'm putting his, I'm putting his, uh, picture on a book card.
6078640	6082800	You know what's good though that I finally had going to SoCal was Winchell's.
6082800	6083800	Yeah.
6083800	6084800	We used to have Winchell's here.
6084800	6087400	There was one in Roseville when I was growing up and they closed it.
6087400	6088400	Anyway.
6088400	6089400	All right.
6089400	6094800	Look, by the way, our friend, uh, Mega Man X 400 from a video game realness from Canada
6094800	6097640	says Tim Hortons is not that big of a deal coming from Toronto.
6097640	6098640	See if you live there.
6098640	6100040	It's a big deal when it's different.
6100040	6101040	Exactly.
6101040	6102040	It's a big deal when it's different.
6102040	6103040	Well, remember, okay.
6103040	6106360	Remember when we had the big boom of Krispy Kremes here, Rob?
6106360	6107360	Yes.
6107360	6109360	What was my reaction?
6109360	6111360	Really?
6111360	6112360	It's fucking Krispy Kreme.
6112360	6116480	My reaction was buy a dozen of those and eat them during work.
6116480	6117480	I'm not sharing.
6117480	6119520	I'm eating them all myself.
6119520	6121520	And then second reaction going inside.
6121520	6125840	This doesn't look like a fucking Krispy Kreme.
6125840	6131020	What I do want over here is I want all the fucking cool shit that's on those like Chinese
6131020	6134880	and Japanese menus at their fast food places, you know, where they build like, they build
6134880	6138600	the ridiculous burgers and stuff that would kill ordinary people.
6138600	6139600	No, not the shrimp burgers.
6139600	6140600	I'm talking like this.
6140600	6145760	Like, you know, the burger pizzas and you know, just the ridiculous stuff they have.
6145760	6149340	I want the Kuro burger that was at Burger King in Japan.
6149340	6153360	I want the Pizza Hut commercials from Japan where all the workers are cats.
6153360	6154360	That's what I want.
6154360	6156080	Did you ever see the Kuro burger though?
6156080	6157720	No, but quickly.
6157720	6165200	It was a black bun, like, flung with the squid ink and like black cheese and I want the goth
6165200	6166200	burger.
6166200	6169200	All right, rapid fire news time, guys.
6169200	6172160	Let's talk quickly about some video game topics.
6172160	6173600	We just, it's a busy week.
6173600	6174800	We have to get these out quickly.
6175480	6181560	So Mortal Kombat X is finally nailed down the release date, tentatively, as April 14th,
6181560	6182560	2015.
6182560	6189600	It'll be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, and Windows PC.
6189600	6194560	So yeah, hopefully they will be actually coming out that day.
6194560	6199560	They do have, I guess, a pre-order incentive to, you know, unlock Goro as a playable character.
6199560	6206040	So that's kind of lame that they lock a really cool character behind a pre-order wall.
6206040	6210080	But what else is new?
6210080	6214040	If you're not in the mood for Madden but you want to play some football, guess what?
6214040	6222160	There is a ROM hack for Tecmo Bowl 2 updated to Tecmo Bowl 2000, or Tecmo Super Bowl 2015.
6222160	6230440	It's basically a roster update to give everybody the, I guess, modern rosters, offensive schemes,
6230440	6234160	and all 32 current NFL teams.
6234160	6241720	And so if you have an NES emulator, you can go download that, TecmoBowl.org.
6241720	6246880	And they've got, I think it's in their forums, you can check that out.
6246880	6253040	And last but not least, this is kind of surprising, but maybe after, you know, their presentation
6253040	6258160	at either Gamescom or E3, I can't remember where they're talking about VibRib in a lot,
6258160	6261760	but Sony has filed a trademark for VibRib in Europe.
6261760	6262760	What?
6262760	6263760	What?
6263760	6264760	Yes.
6264760	6271040	So they're going to be possibly either re-releasing the old game or putting out a new one.
6271040	6273180	I hope it's a new one.
6273180	6275220	Let's all join hands and pray.
6275220	6281700	Oh Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, wait, bless this thy donut that with it we might
6281700	6285820	be blessed with VibRib in.
6285820	6290220	Whatever it is you believe in, God, Buddha, Flying Speedy Monster, whatever it is you
6290220	6295940	believe in, join hands with me in prayer that VibRib in is making some type of comeback.
6295940	6301060	I mean, I don't care if it's like just a freaking like PS1 now game or something.
6301060	6306900	What if we get the ribbon box with VibRib in emoji ribbon and like ribbon all the things.
6306900	6308660	Don't fuck with my emotions.
6308660	6312100	That's what confused me so much is was that they have the guy that created VibRib in talking
6312100	6317540	about VibRib in for like a very long time during like GDC, it was E3, they fucking whipped
6317540	6318540	out VibRib in E3.
6318540	6319540	Oh my God.
6319540	6320540	Agdef said it.
6320540	6321540	What?
6321540	6322540	VibRib in with MP3 support.
6322540	6325660	For the love of Vibri, please.
6325660	6330940	Knowing Sony, if it were to happen, it would be VibRib in with Sony Entertainment Network
6330940	6331940	support.
6331940	6332940	I just thought of something.
6332940	6333940	What?
6333940	6335500	How to cosplay Vibri.
6335500	6339700	All right, anyway, quickly, it's a three hour show, not seven.
6339700	6345820	So, yes, that's all we know so far aside from the filing that, yeah, VibRib in is possibly
6345820	6348780	going to come back.
6348780	6352980	Fifth Dream in chat says, fuck yes, please, VibRib in, I will suck some people off for
6352980	6354460	VibRib in to exist.
6354460	6358140	I'm right there with you, Fifth Dream.
6358140	6362620	Rob says, Fifth Dream, TMI, dude.
6362620	6367100	I already said something about BioWare earlier this evening, so tonight, all the cocks.
6367100	6373980	I remember that day, we went to network video RIP, and I got VibRib in, and you got Kitty
6373980	6375460	the Cool.
6375460	6378860	The Hello Kitty game.
6378860	6381860	Yeah, you kind of made out better, didn't you?
6381860	6383540	All right, let's see.
6383540	6386580	And Rama says in chat, I pray to Joe Pesci.
6386580	6389220	Well, I said whatever you believe in, whatever you believe in.
6389220	6398540	All right, MegamanX400, uh oh, uh oh, asks, what is VibRib in?
6398540	6399540	Get out.
6399540	6400540	No, I'm just kidding.
6400540	6401540	VibRib in.
6401540	6402540	We shall educate you now.
6402540	6406060	I've already done it as a classic game, but maybe I need to just do it again.
6406060	6408140	Just quickly, give a 60 second speech.
6408140	6414260	VibRib is an all kind of victory 3D game, where you're a rabbit, whose name is Vibri,
6414260	6417980	and you walk along the line, and you get different obstacles in your way, and you have to do
6417980	6420780	certain button mashes to pass said obstacles.
6420780	6423940	It's got its own little soundtrack, but the great thing is that you can put in your own
6423940	6428560	CDs, and use different music, and the tracks will change based on the music that you play.
6428560	6433980	And he turns into different things as he goes into this halo creature, and it's absolutely
6433980	6434980	awesome.
6434980	6437860	And he sings the demo, how to play the game.
6437860	6440020	He sings how you play the game.
6440020	6441220	And it's adorable.
6441220	6444260	And he's got this little cute little voice, kind of digitally sounding, and oh my god,
6444260	6448060	Vibri is adorable!
6448060	6454260	It's like, it's like a endless runner, but, you know, it's not, yeah, kind of.
6454260	6458700	And if you want, actually if you want a good idea of what the game looks like, it's got,
6458700	6463820	it's you know, it's a, what's the group that does it, a Weebles game.
6463820	6468940	But Weebles did something kind of based off of, it plays exactly like Vibribin for iOS,
6468940	6472140	called Dancing Russian Men, and that will give you an idea of how the game looks.
6472140	6475700	I mean, not how it looks, but how it plays, so.
6475700	6483980	And Mega Man X400 in true Canadian fashion apologizing, lol, sorry, sorry, I don't know.
6483980	6484980	That's okay.
6484980	6485980	You know what?
6485980	6488980	We're here, but now you do know, and knowing is half the battle.
6488980	6493140	Just go look up the intro to Vibribin.
6493140	6494140	It's cute game.
6494140	6495140	It's adorbs.
6495140	6496140	Cute game.
6496140	6497140	Alright, let's move on.
6497140	6499580	We've got more news we've got to talk about, including with Sony.
6499580	6504380	Maybe if Vibribin does come out on PlayStation 4 in one form or another, people will be streaming
6504380	6509340	it on the PlayStation Vita, because there's going to be an app that will allow the PlayStation
6509340	6515380	Vita access to the PlayStation Live network that's all over the PlayStation 4.
6515380	6519420	So yes, you too can watch the Ustreams and Twitch channels of people sitting in their
6519420	6525920	living room saying racist, sexist, horrible things to each other, because that's a lot
6525920	6527020	of what's broadcast on there.
6527020	6528020	But you know what?
6528020	6529620	Amongst all that, there is a lot of good streams, too.
6529620	6533460	A lot of Diablo 3 streams lately, and of course, of course, I knew this would happen the day
6533460	6534780	the game came out.
6534780	6537940	Guess what game is dominating PlayStation Live right now?
6537940	6539220	Minecraft.
6539220	6540980	Dominating PlayStation Live right now.
6540980	6545440	So you can watch more Minecraft feeds on the PlayStation Vita very soon, which makes sense
6545440	6549380	because they brought it to mobile phones as well, although I think it's just a link.
6549380	6551580	News on Bravely Second.
6551580	6555740	I know that a lot of you guys were fans of Bravely Default, Dark Soccer and myself included.
6555740	6556740	De-fart.
6556740	6557740	Bravely De-fart.
6557740	6564340	Well, in Bravely Second, which I guess Dark Soccer would call Bravely Second fart, I don't
6564340	6565340	know.
6565340	6566620	There's some information that's come out about Bravely Second.
6566620	6568900	Bravely Suck It.
6568900	6570420	Bravely Suck It.
6570420	6572140	I don't know.
6572140	6577580	The Wind Vestal Agnus will be back in Bravely Suck It.
6578580	6585940	There will also be some new characters, including Magnolia Arch in the roles of Valkyrie, Performer,
6585940	6586980	Red Mage and Time Major.
6586980	6588420	Some of the screenshots we see.
6588420	6594300	Magnolia Arch in the screenshots.
6594300	6598340	Also another new character revealed this week, Yu.
6598340	6600100	That's YU.
6600100	6606220	YU is another new character that is the Falcon of the Gale who will be joining Magnolia as
6606220	6608620	a party member during the game.
6608620	6609620	Some other characters.
6609620	6614500	Jean, the Wolf of the Inferno and Nikolai, the Bison of Solidity.
6614500	6616700	So more information on Bravely Suck It.
6616700	6618820	Okay, Dungeon Buster wins.
6618820	6623980	Bravely Second win.
6623980	6625180	We're like seven years old.
6625180	6626180	All right.
6626180	6627180	I love you guys.
6627180	6628180	I love you guys.
6628180	6630860	Lastly, some news on the Retron 5.
6630860	6632100	Remember this console?
6632100	6633100	That thing.
6633100	6634100	The aluminum box.
6634100	6638340	I'd seen this at E3 and I got to play Zombies Ate My Neighbors and High Def, which was kind
6638340	6639340	of awesome.
6639340	6642380	Which reminds me, I need to get a Retron 5.
6642380	6647300	I did not know that they were doing firmware updates to the Retron consoles, but they are.
6647300	6651940	A new firmware update, firmware 2.0 Beta 1 came out for the Retron.
6651940	6658740	It includes IPS patch support, meaning you take an imported game cartridge.
6658740	6662980	You take a little, I guess, USB stick with the IPS file.
6663020	6666460	You can patch the cartridge to play fan translations.
6666460	6667460	That is fucking amazing.
6667460	6668460	Right?
6668460	6669460	That's awesome.
6669460	6672420	And the Seiken fan translation is like the best.
6672420	6673420	Seiken Densetsu.
6673420	6674420	Right?
6674420	6675420	So that's really cool.
6675420	6677260	Some other firmware support.
6677260	6681300	Support for S&S SPC 7110 cartridges.
6681300	6684140	I don't know what games that included.
6684140	6686020	Screen shaking and some GBA games fixed.
6686020	6691860	Yeah, there was actually a test video out that was showing that it wasn't working with
6691860	6694300	some of the add-on games.
6694300	6697940	So I'd like to, yeah, hopefully they've addressed that.
6697940	6699060	That's really cool.
6699060	6704540	Some game compatibility fixes, meaning Sky Kid, Yokai Club, and Dark Soccer, you can
6704540	6705540	rest easy.
6705540	6707260	Fantasy Zone will now work.
6707260	6713700	Can you imagine if Dark Soccer had bought one of these things and Fantasy Zone didn't
6713700	6714700	work?
6714700	6715700	Oh my god, the thing would be in pieces.
6715700	6719540	Do you know that I have almost every home version of Fantasy Zone?
6719540	6722820	Oh really, says the woman who made fun of me over Mass Effect 3 earlier.
6722820	6723820	Yeah, guess what?
6723820	6724820	They're all different games.
6724820	6726540	Yeah, guess what?
6726540	6727540	Suck it.
6727540	6731620	Technically, they are different games for, you know, different consoles.
6731620	6732620	Yeah.
6732620	6736020	It's just, you know, the Wii U window in place.
6736020	6737620	But it does support the tablet.
6737620	6743540	Rolling my eyes so hard that it just, I think I might have strained my ocular joints.
6743540	6746820	Roll them back so you can do the next story.
6746820	6748700	Girl.
6748700	6752280	So well, the next three stories then, to be accurate.
6752280	6758220	So there are instructions out there on how to upgrade the next gen Minecraft, you know,
6758220	6762500	with the new versions on Xbone and Playstation 4.
6762500	6767860	There actually is a blog post out there about how to do the upgrade, of which I will give
6767860	6770140	you the URL as soon as it loads.
6770140	6773820	But there's also videos out there, so you can also check it out on various tubes of
6773820	6776880	you that you might be able to find.
6776880	6783040	So by the way, I almost got it to load, never mind.
6783040	6791440	It's actually on a post by Brian Silva on the Playstation 4 blog, blog.US.PlayStation.com.
6791440	6797520	And I will link that into the chat room, because it's a really long URL for the regular URL.
6797520	6802680	So that being said, I'm sure you are all going to be super happy with having instructions.
6802680	6810000	So also, there are details out now, at least for the European release of Bayonetta 2.
6810000	6813640	Which will of course be a Wii U exclusive, and probably one of the few reasons to own
6813640	6814640	one.
6814640	6815640	What?
6815640	6816640	So?
6816640	6817640	So?
6817640	6818640	So?
6818640	6819640	So?
6819640	6826440	Nintendo said that the first print edition, which is exclusive to Europe, will have the
6826440	6833480	discs of Bayonetta 2, Wii U Bayonetta remake, the Art of Bayonetta 2 art book, and a 3D
6833480	6838420	embossed leather effect packaging that recreates the Hierarchy of Laguna.
6838420	6844240	The book of angels that were all the enemies that you have to kill with your gun shoes
6844240	6845240	from.
6845240	6848200	So yeah, pretty cool.
6848200	6851640	Lots of details on Bayonetta 2 this week, by the way, because of the Nintendo Direct.
6851640	6856520	So if you didn't see it, go watch it, because Dark Sakura is just touching the tip of the
6856520	6857800	iceberg with this.
6857800	6859640	Well, it is rapid fire, is it not?
6859640	6861640	I know, I understand.
6861640	6869200	And then, last but not least, there is a release list that came out from the Direct, actually,
6869200	6873560	that has a list of games coming out in 2015.
6873560	6878160	One of those games listed is Star Fox.
6878160	6884720	There is also another Zelda game listed in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X, I guess it is,
6884720	6889960	or X, I guess X, since there wasn't two through nine.
6889960	6893800	Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, Act Deft, just letting you know.
6893800	6900880	Mario Maker, Yoshi's Woolly World, Splatoon, Captain Toad, bunch of stuff.
6900880	6906000	So Star Fox, something else called Project Guard.
6906640	6912480	Yeah, so a good thing that a lot of those E3 titles we saw, because Star Fox and Zelda,
6912480	6916720	we got little tastes of at E3 this year, but nice to see that they are still targeting
6916720	6921400	2015 for that, because I don't know, the way Nintendo rolls sometimes, I would not have
6921400	6924480	been shocked if you told me that Zelda game wasn't happening until 2016.
6924480	6927920	Act Deft, I said Star Fox, not Star Fucks.
6927920	6928920	There's a difference.
6928920	6933880	And maybe my little bit of a southern accent plays into that, but no.
6933880	6936720	I usually emphasize when I say the word fuck.
6936720	6942120	Alright, well let's go to the fucking FUGL question of the week right now.
6942120	6945120	It's Radio Koopaloo.
6949120	6954240	You take Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together, you get FUGL, and it's the
6954240	6958440	FUGL question of the week, where we ask a question of our fan communities at Facebook
6958440	6959440	and Google Plus.
6959440	6966000	That's Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google.com slash Plus, Orange Lounge Radio.
6966000	6969000	This is all about the Dreamcast we talked about earlier in the show.
6969000	6970360	Were you a Dreamcast owner?
6970360	6971360	Why or why not?
6971360	6973160	Looking back, do you have a favorite Dreamcast title?
6973160	6975080	We'll start with the Googlers tonight.
6975080	6981520	Act Deft saying, I got my Dreamcast on a Black Friday for $50 US, like 12 years ago or so.
6981520	6985160	I played with it a lot, and it was my go-to console for fighting games, though I think
6985160	6990360	my favorite game for the Dreamcast was either Jet Grind or Jet Set Radio or Sonic Adventure
6990360	6991360	2.
6991360	6992680	Crazy Taxi in a close second.
6992680	6995000	God, I miss crazy taxi.
6995000	7001320	Renee, Renee Y replies and says, we had a Dreamcast because we were a hardcore Sega
7001320	7007160	family, as a good strong family should be, right?
7007160	7011240	My favorite game to play was Phantasy Star Online, one of my first MMOs.
7011240	7015040	It was a truly unique experience being able to play a game with my cousin who lived all
7015040	7016320	the way across the country.
7016320	7019400	Eventually, we ended up giving the console away to a friend who didn't have enough money
7019400	7020400	to buy a console.
7020400	7021400	This was in 2005.
7021400	7025600	I can't believe it's been almost 10 years since I've given away my Dreamcast, let alone
7025600	7027560	15 years from when I owned one.
7027560	7032680	That's really sweet that Renee gave the console away to somebody who, you know, over here
7032680	7035160	you had no console, so that's really cool.
7035160	7036600	Good job.
7036600	7039680	Reddertainment replied and said, no.
7039680	7041560	That's it, no.
7041560	7043640	Not a Dreamcast fan, I imagine.
7043640	7046840	Flaco Jones replied and said, never had a Dreamcast, but a friend of mine did.
7046840	7049000	He also had every game pirated to discs.
7049000	7052360	I think I only played Tony Hawk on it, but it was good.
7052360	7054960	And Collin M says, bought one shortly after it came out.
7054960	7059480	Phantasy Star Online and Space Channel 5 were my favorite games on the system.
7059480	7060920	Choo, choo.
7060920	7066320	A few comments over here on Facebook, Fabrice A says, I'm a hardcore Sega fan and of course
7066320	7067320	I own a Dreamcast.
7067320	7070720	I think it's still the best console ever because of the numerous, excellent arcade games they
7070720	7071720	had on it.
7071720	7075320	Crazy Taxi is an all-time favorite game for me and I still play it from time to time.
7075320	7079600	Occasionally I go out and look for sailors too, but not before I have a hot dog at Tom's.
7079600	7082560	Dreamcast, it's still thinking.
7082560	7085760	Tonic Vision replied and said, I actually bought a Dreamcast in college after it had
7085760	7086920	been out for a little over a year.
7086920	7090960	I got it for $99 on Amazon and what amazed, Amazon was a thing back then?
7090960	7091960	I guess it was.
7091960	7093900	I guess it was kind of in its early days.
7093900	7096960	What amazed me the most is how easily it ran pirated CDs.
7096960	7101640	A couple of floors up for me, a guy knew how to do it and made me about 10 discs packed
7101640	7102640	with games.
7102640	7106280	I fell in love with Code Veronica and stayed up many weekends playing Marvel versus Capcom
7106280	7107600	2 with friends.
7107600	7111320	Having never owned a Genesis, I thought it was a solid system overall, but I must admit
7111320	7114600	that when PlayStation 2 came out, it started collecting dust immediately.
7114600	7117400	The surprising amount of people admitting to open piracy here.
7117400	7119360	I think you were onto something earlier when you said that.
7119360	7120360	Part of the problem.
7120360	7121760	Yeah, part of the problem.
7121760	7126520	KingSnee replied and said, one of my favorite memories with the Dreamcast was when I first
7126520	7129960	came in contact with it and Sonic running from a killer whale.
7129960	7132920	I thought that was the coolest thing I'd seen in a game at that point and that's one
7132920	7134840	of the many reasons why I got a Dreamcast.
7134840	7139160	I still think about playing my first RPG, Grandia 2.
7139160	7143720	Guillermo R. replies and says I was in college and skipped classes on 9999 to go pick up
7143720	7146720	my Dreamcast, Sonic Adventure, and Soul Calibur.
7146720	7148440	What an amazing system at the time.
7148440	7151840	I still have it plugged on my TV and fire it up every now and then.
7151840	7154760	While the games haven't aged as well as I like to remember them, Crazy Taxi with the
7154760	7159200	original soundtrack, Soul Calibur, Power Stone, and Soul Reaver are still a fun ride down
7159200	7160800	memory lane.
7160800	7166000	Awesome Unicorn says I never owned a Dreamcast but I did have Space Channel 5 lunchbox and
7166000	7168040	that's what really matters.
7168040	7169040	That's a fair answer.
7169040	7170040	That's a fair answer.
7170040	7172080	Dr. Sunya says I still have mine.
7172080	7176240	Maybe if there's one thing I've loved about the Dreamcast, it was the arcade ports.
7176240	7181660	Marvel vs. Capcom, Crazy Taxi, and Soul Calibur all had ports from the arcade that were not
7181660	7185080	only near perfect but had tons of extras to boot.
7185080	7186780	Several people calling that out.
7186780	7189460	Ragenator says I never got a Dreamcast even though it did appeal to me.
7189460	7193740	At the time I already had some systems in use like Super Nintendo, N64, and PS1 with
7193740	7198820	plenty of games for each so trying to afford a four system plus games was a no go.
7198820	7203780	Haseo Sumeruagawa says I never owned a Dreamcast mostly because I was seven and not the richest
7203780	7207780	family but I always wanted one to play Sonic Adventure 2 because Shadow was awesome hands
7207780	7208780	down.
7208780	7209780	Well, go to a flea market.
7209780	7212400	You might be able to get one still.
7212400	7216820	And lastly, Curlykirk replied and says I didn't get a Dreamcast when it first came out but
7216820	7221000	I eventually got one probably soon before it stopped being made but I still have one
7221000	7225760	now and love the sports games like the 2K series and Virtua Tennis.
7225760	7228320	Great answers and I heard some new names in there as well so thank you guys so much for
7228320	7231000	applying and participating with our question this week.
7231000	7234840	I'm going to go ahead and get back into news since the hosts here in studio kind of already
7234840	7239320	took on this question earlier in the show but yeah, now's a good reminder to friend
7239320	7242960	us on Facebook and on Google Plus so you can answer for next week.
7242960	7243960	Let's go back into some news.
7243960	7244960	Loki.
7244960	7252160	Alright, so I'm not surprised by this news considering how all the reviews and kind of
7252160	7257880	impressions seem to be of this game but apparently the Elder Scrolls Online, not doing so hot
7257880	7263680	and ZeniMax Online apparently has been hit with some layoffs but they're still seeing
7263680	7267760	they're continuing to invest heavily in the game and says now that we're nearly six months
7267760	7275360	post launch, we have a thriving online community in a game that runs smoothly and says that
7275360	7280120	we remain strongly committed to the Elder Scrolls Online and continue to invest heavily
7280120	7284920	to develop new content for PC players, prepare the game for its console launch and handle
7284920	7288680	our planned expansion into important international territories.
7288680	7293000	As for customer service, we continue to operate large support centers in Hunt Valley, Maryland
7293000	7301400	and Galway, Ireland but basically saying the reason why they're having layoffs as normal
7301400	7306280	for games of this type, we had ramped up a large workforce to develop a game of vast
7306280	7312760	scale and the ramped up customer service to handle expected questions and community needs
7312760	7318520	for Elder Scrolls Online launch and of course now that they don't need that so I don't know.
7318520	7323560	Maybe it is still doing okay, I'm still, I don't know, it doesn't seem like a lot of
7323560	7330120	people I know are interested in it so I have to wonder how well it's doing.
7330120	7333320	We talked about this a little bit on Hoard House this week which is, you know, a cheap
7333320	7339520	plug Wednesday nights at seven here at VOG or has its own podcast feed as well and one
7339520	7343020	thing I mentioned on Hoard House I want to mention here is that this news is really surprising
7343020	7346640	considering this is supposed to be a big console release.
7346640	7350200	This game is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and I believe the Xbox One as
7350200	7351200	well.
7351200	7354400	I remember this whole thing and so it's weird that people are being laid off in advance
7354400	7355400	of that happening.
7355400	7359240	Now, I do realize that in the cycle and development of games sometimes, you know, development
7359240	7363340	is finished before the game comes out so that people, you know, are laid off as the project
7363340	7364680	closes or whatever.
7364680	7367700	But you would think that they would, yeah, they were saying that they ramped up their
7367700	7372400	customer service and stuff for the launch of that game.
7372400	7376280	When they need that same type of thing for the launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One or their
7376320	7378240	expectations that much lower now.
7378240	7379240	Exactly.
7379240	7383640	That's the same thing that concerns me about this is that it doesn't kind of add up and,
7383640	7388120	you know, you don't hear about companies like, you know, Blizzard and Square Enix laying
7388120	7391400	people off, you know, when the development's done because they continue to develop the
7391400	7394120	game with enhanced, you know, patches and other things.
7394120	7398560	Now, granted, those two companies I just mentioned are really big and probably have other projects
7398560	7403400	that people can be assigned to whereas ZeniMax was kind of made to make Elder Scrolls so
7403400	7405520	maybe the situation is a little different.
7405520	7409440	But it doesn't get my hopes up about the game's longevity.
7409440	7413240	They could also be just like, ah, fuck it, we'll just do it with what we got and, you
7413240	7417480	know, if it's a little bit rough, well, people are kind of expecting that.
7417480	7418480	I don't know.
7418480	7421160	Maybe that's their thought.
7421160	7425560	Maybe they just, they figure at this point that they're not making enough money back
7425560	7429600	from it that they have to kind of cut their losses.
7429600	7433640	They can't afford to ramp up employees for that launch.
7433640	7435240	And who knows when that launch is coming, you know?
7435240	7441380	Why keep all those employees around for, you know, it's supposed to be this year.
7441380	7442380	Supposed to be.
7442380	7445680	I mean, it's, I thought it was, I thought the beta was supposed to be first quarter
7445680	7446680	this year.
7446680	7449320	Like, I mean, like that thing got really delayed.
7449320	7450320	I could be wrong.
7450320	7454120	I could be mixing it up with another MMO, but I could have sworn that the Elder Scrolls
7454120	7456400	online was supposed to happen a lot faster than it has been.
7456400	7461480	EKMA JP was just adding in that Square Enix has almost all contracts and no layoffs.
7461480	7462480	Oh, interesting.
7462480	7466200	That's a clever way to do it so you don't have to, you know, announce all these layoffs
7466200	7467200	or whatever.
7467200	7468200	Interesting.
7468200	7469200	Um, let's see.
7469200	7475720	Kane shadow is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying ESO hype is done and over with thankfully.
7475720	7480640	And um, you know, I, I don't know, but I also know people that still kind of really like
7480640	7481640	this.
7481640	7483200	Like I have some friends that actually do a podcast about ESOs.
7483200	7486600	I almost feel bad sitting here like poo pooing on it, especially when I haven't played an
7486600	7492160	awful lot of it, but you can't help but look at a lot of this going, I, I, I would have
7492160	7496240	bought it if it even used like the Guild Wars model where you buy the game and then
7496240	7497240	the online craze.
7497240	7501000	If they did it like they're doing destiny where you buy the game and you play it online,
7501000	7502640	that'd be fucking amazing.
7502640	7505160	But no, it's not like that.
7505160	7512160	And so yeah, unfortunately I, I just can't dedicate myself to paying for a game that
7512160	7513160	I'm not going to play.
7513160	7517440	You know, especially if it's a monthly fee, I'm, I can't see myself paying for something
7517440	7518440	that I'm not gonna play.
7518440	7522160	Do for the Minecraft server for now.
7522160	7523560	But yeah, I don't know.
7523560	7528840	I can't do that for an MMO because I just, it's just throwing money away.
7528840	7529840	Yeah.
7529840	7535080	Um, I, I, I don't know, I, I, I would hope that maybe they go to that model cause I still
7535080	7539040	would like to see this come out on consoles just because I love the idea of MMOs on, on
7539040	7540040	console.
7540040	7541040	Yeah, they did it well.
7541040	7542040	They did what?
7542040	7543040	They went free to play with DC universe.
7543040	7546920	I mean, I think that helped that, but I don't know if they're going to do that with Elder
7546920	7548800	Scrolls online.
7548800	7549800	It's a big property.
7549800	7550800	I don't know.
7550800	7551800	We'll see.
7551800	7552800	We'll see.
7552800	7555360	Well, moving on for now, cause we're just hypothesizing here, uh, moving on to something
7555360	7556840	else that Square Enix related.
7556840	7558440	This has to do a dragon quest seven.
7558440	7559440	Yes, I seven.
7559440	7560440	I know.
7560440	7564000	I know that, you know, we should be talking about 10 or even potentially 11, but uh, here's
7564000	7567920	the thing about dragon quest seven is that Square Enix has talked about this week.
7567920	7573040	Uh, Noriyoshi Fujimoto, who's the dragon quest mobile producer for Square Enix, talked to
7573040	7577880	Silicon era, uh, about the company doing more dragon quest games and that they would
7577880	7581920	like to bring the remastered version of dragon quest seven for the Nintendo three D S to
7581920	7586040	the west, but they don't think sales of the game will be high enough.
7586040	7590280	The quote here in terms of dragon quest seven, it has a lot of texts to go through and translate,
7590280	7594040	and we've received so many requests and so much positive feedback about the game, but
7594040	7597360	unfortunately we have to consider the cost and the manpower needed to handle the sheer
7597360	7599960	load of text in terms of scenario and script.
7599960	7603040	The game is probably one of the largest in the DQ franchise.
7603040	7607720	If a lot of people can buy it and support it, well, we can't promise anything, uh, from
7607720	7611560	dragon quest seven and B, excuse me, from dragon quest eight and beyond, we've revamped
7611560	7612560	the translation.
7612560	7616160	For example, we've added regional twangs like those from Baltic region sounding Russian
7616160	7617340	and things like that.
7617340	7619140	We've also updated the spells and monster names.
7619140	7622240	So any classic titles we revisit, we want to stay consistent.
7622240	7626260	That being said, when we go back and update the classic titles, we make these changes.
7626260	7627260	That's another step in the process.
7627260	7632180	Well, as you can imagine, after this quote happened, now you have Twitter lighting up
7632180	7636880	with a lot of people sending messages to Square Enix, like I'll buy it, make it happen, do
7636880	7637980	it, do it.
7637980	7639700	So maybe you want to lend your own voice.
7639700	7643460	I'm surprised there's not a change.org petition already, although there probably is one out
7643460	7646860	there, but, um, I'm sure some of you out there may be listening to this.
7646860	7649380	Maybe you want to go lend your support for this game as well.
7649380	7652020	If you think this is something that would interest you, I would check it out on, on
7652020	7653020	3DS.
7653020	7654020	Heck yeah.
7654020	7655020	That'd be great.
7655020	7661420	Uh, I'd almost like to see it more like on PlayStation now or something where I can play
7661420	7665420	it on the TV, but I'll take the 3DS, it's better than nothing.
7665420	7667140	All right.
7667140	7669540	So let's move on Dark Sakura.
7669540	7674380	Well, uh, for, I know that we've got a lot of listeners who are League of Legends fans,
7674380	7678180	so there is actually something going on with League of Legends.
7678180	7681060	Riot is re-imagining the lore.
7681060	7687460	Um, yeah, basically they've had so many different releases and different contents added on that
7687460	7692420	the lore has just been all kinds of fubar, so they're just wiping it and redoing it.
7692420	7699020	Um, there is a quote out there actually from Tommy Knox, um, who said that we look back
7699020	7702380	at the original decision, at the decisions that made perfect sense when we originally
7702380	7707160	made them, but are now at odds with our design values and ultimately limit our ability to
7707160	7709720	continually improve League of Legends.
7709720	7710720	That's unacceptable.
7710760	7715560	In such situations, we seek to aggressively re-imagine content in a way that realizes
7715560	7716960	its full potential.
7716960	7718920	So basically we done fucked up the lore.
7718920	7720120	We're going to redo it.
7720120	7721280	We're pulling the Star Wars.
7721280	7722280	Lucas sold it.
7722280	7723840	I was just going to say the same thing.
7723840	7729640	Is this, is this akin to Disney saying, well, now that we own Star Wars, books invalid.
7729640	7732880	We're actually doing this, doing this right.
7732880	7733880	Yeah.
7733880	7734880	Yeah.
7734880	7739360	Although many would argue the books were plenty fine, but I understand the need to be like,
7739360	7744360	because if they do episode seven and they hadn't invalidated all the extended universe,
7744360	7748720	there was going to be so much stuff where people would be like, that can't happen because
7748720	7754080	in such and such book on page 140, uh, this character has printing.
7754080	7755080	Yeah, exactly.
7755080	7756080	Right.
7756080	7757080	Yeah.
7757080	7760400	So no disrespect to those that are fans of the extended Star Wars universe, but I kind
7760400	7763780	of understand why they had to do it for that reason that if it's like, okay, if we really
7763780	7769000	are going to kind of take control of this and you may not agree with me, but I fully
7769040	7775360	believe that control needed to be taken away from Lucas because the prequels were awful.
7775360	7779600	And the way that they're handling this is more like how the Tomb Raider reboot went
7779600	7784520	or, you know, re-imagining how Battlestar Galactica went as mentioned here in the article.
7784520	7788120	Um, so they're just trying to make it, I guess, a more cohesive story.
7788120	7789120	That makes sense.
7789120	7790120	That's fair.
7790120	7791120	All right.
7791120	7795160	Uh, I do like what fifth dream said.
7795160	7796160	Yeah.
7796160	7797160	Retcons for everyone.
7797160	7798160	You get a retcon and you get a retcon.
7798320	7799320	All right.
7799320	7803320	Uh, let's move on with some more stories then we're going to get to the mailbag.
7803320	7804320	Loki.
7804320	7805320	All right.
7805320	7808400	So I don't know.
7808400	7815480	It's Google is I guess jumping on board with, I think, um, Apple to do something very similar,
7815480	7821600	but they've refunded $19 million worth of in-app purchases or if you would call it a
7821600	7829400	guess accidental in-app purchases made by our children because you know, I gave them
7829400	7835400	my tablet and they didn't have any sort of parental controls or way, you know, gave them
7835400	7840080	my parental controls and they bought a bunch of Smurf money or whatever the fuck it is
7840080	7841080	that they're buying.
7841080	7847120	Um, but apparently, yeah, because of the, um, complaint, I guess filed with the FTC,
7847120	7854000	they've agreed to pay $19 million in refunds made, um, I guess for purchases made without
7854000	7857280	the account holders explicit consent.
7857280	7861840	So that sucks, but Google has a ton of money.
7861840	7862840	So you know what?
7862840	7864640	Uh, I don't know.
7864640	7866600	And that's why they, they couldn't afford Twitch anymore.
7866600	7870040	It's just like, it's, that's, that's pennies, you know, I got 19 million in my wallet right
7870040	7871040	now.
7871040	7878120	But I don't know, at the same time, I think that it is a responsibility of parents to
7878120	7881200	be monitoring what their children are allowed to buy.
7881200	7887040	But at the same time, I could see that maybe some people that develop apps make that stuff
7887040	7891160	a little bit too easy to purchase or confusing that kind of sense.
7891160	7892220	So I don't know.
7892220	7897120	It's interesting to see how both the, you know, Google play and the, you know, iTunes
7897120	7903440	store are kind of starting to insert the language to make the not truly free games
7903440	7904720	sound like what they are.
7904720	7905720	Not truly free.
7905720	7908440	It's interesting to see that evolution, you know, especially since, you know, gaming is
7908440	7910680	getting bigger and bigger on these platforms.
7910680	7915280	And sometimes us, us gamers that tend to tilt a little more hardcore kind of forget that.
7915280	7919100	But um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting to see that evolution.
7919100	7924200	I guess it's just something they have to do right now and you know, but at the same time,
7924200	7928280	yeah, they really need to have something in place where it's just like, yeah, come
7928280	7929280	on.
7929280	7932040	Your parents take responsibility or we're going to get stuck in the situation.
7932040	7933040	You know what?
7933040	7936480	They should just enable parental controls from the start and then you have to pay 60
7936480	7937480	cents to unlock it.
7937480	7938480	How's that sound?
7938480	7944120	Lucky fucking tend to seriously that it's absolutely lame.
7944120	7945120	All right.
7945120	7949160	Well speaking of Nintendo, let's not forget that back in the day they made some arcade
7949160	7950160	classics.
7950160	7958000	One of those all time classics is donkey Kong and donkey Kong, danky, danky Kang for his
7958000	7959000	oldest.
7959000	7962960	This game is, it still ends up in, in our video game news all the time.
7962960	7965720	And a lot of this is the war over the high score, right?
7965720	7968540	We had a whole movie about this King of Kong, right?
7968540	7973680	And then this new guy, Hank Chen showed up and was like, Hey, I'm the new kid in school
7973680	7975480	and I'm going to smash all these records.
7975480	7976480	And he did.
7976480	7980600	But guess what happened this past week, Robbie Lakeman.
7980600	7981600	That's right.
7981600	7986100	A new guy has now taken the throne in donkey Kong competition.
7986100	7992040	His high score is the new world record, 1,141,800 points.
7992040	7999440	That is pretty small victory over a Hank Chen score, which was only about 3000 less.
7999440	8005360	This is kind of neat too, is that Robbie Lakeman would actually stream his attempts.
8005360	8009920	And for whatever reason, the one where he actually broke the record was not streamed,
8009920	8011920	but he did upload it after the fact.
8011920	8016640	So you can actually watch an entire four hour stream or not, sorry, not stream, but four
8016640	8017640	hour video.
8017640	8021460	Cause that's the era we live in of this dude breaking the record and you could learn a
8021460	8025180	tip or two on this 30 year old game if you would like.
8025180	8026920	So there you go.
8026920	8030520	But that's kind of neat though, that we live in that era now of like, you know, we can
8030520	8033440	watch people shatter high scores live.
8033440	8036800	Like it used to be, you know, you had to have a copy of the tape.
8036800	8040720	Somebody would have a VHS tape that they were recording to send to Twin Galaxies or you
8040720	8044320	know, whatever magazine or whatever was to keep track of the high scores.
8044320	8046320	Twin Galaxies isn't around anymore.
8046320	8048600	They relaunched as like a new thing.
8048600	8051280	It's like a 24 hour streaming channel now or something.
8051280	8054960	So do you still do all that bullshit where you got to like tape everything?
8054960	8057440	I have no idea to be honest.
8057440	8063080	I sort of think live streaming kind of negates that, but I know because they still, they
8063120	8069360	had to like, for a member back when like I was going to do, make the attempt that, you
8069360	8075960	know, trying to break the arcade world record thing for that stupid Ready Player One contest,
8075960	8082080	Twin Galaxies, like you had to record like video of the board that you're using and stuff
8082080	8083280	like that.
8083280	8086400	And it has to be like, there's no breaks in it whatsoever.
8086400	8088840	And the way you have to film it is very specific.
8088840	8089840	So I don't know.
8089840	8091560	It'd be interesting to see.
8091560	8094160	I don't know if like that would count.
8094160	8098480	Tiger Claw links the website so you can find out twingalaxies.com so you can check that
8098480	8099480	out.
8099480	8100920	Yeah, I'm too lazy to look at that.
8100920	8105440	William Murderface suggests that we need the King of Kong 2 electric boogaloo.
8105440	8106440	I agree.
8106440	8108880	Or the Donkey Kong Jr. race.
8108880	8109880	Donkey Kong 3?
8109880	8110880	Anybody?
8110880	8112320	Anybody play Donkey Kong 3?
8112320	8113320	Which was...
8113320	8114320	I did.
8114320	8115320	I tried to forget that.
8115320	8117880	When they, when they tried to turn a platformer into a shooter.
8117880	8118880	Anybody?
8118880	8124880	Alright, anyway, um, let's see, uh, we are going to, yes, Sjoan Undermat says Twin Galaxies
8124880	8126840	is under totally new management, I believe.
8126840	8127840	That is, that is true.
8127840	8131080	Alright, um, let's, let's go into the mailbag.
8131080	8136720	Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com and Dark Soccer dives
8136720	8141600	in the mailbag and pulls out some emails that she thinks are worth reading on the program.
8141600	8142600	Yep.
8142600	8144200	We've got two weeks to build up some emails.
8144200	8145200	All four of them.
8145200	8146480	Alright, well, they better be good.
8147080	8149920	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
8149920	8153860	I hear you all talking about Porter Robinson on the last podcast and how his music on his
8153860	8157040	latest album was inspired by various video games.
8157040	8160080	I thought it'd be interesting for you guys to know that Porter actually got his start
8160080	8164120	in electronic music because he was turned on to the genre while playing DDR and other
8164120	8167840	Bimani games with his brothers when they were kids in North Carolina.
8167840	8172200	They are huge rhythm game nerds and Porter frequently answers interviewers asking why
8172200	8175300	he got into making music by saying he played DDR.
8175300	8179900	In fact, I actually met his brother Nick, who now produces video content for Revision3
8179900	8184260	at California Extreme a few years ago while playing DDR Extreme reminiscing about the
8184260	8186020	good old days of DDR.
8186020	8189940	Just thought you guys would find that fact interesting considering the roots of the show.
8189940	8190940	Yours truly, AZHP.
8190940	8192900	Pretty fun to have on the show then.
8192900	8193900	Yeah, right?
8193900	8194900	P.S.
8194900	8195900	Open invite.
8195900	8200260	P.S. Porter says his favorite city in the country he's visited during his tours is San
8200260	8203300	Francisco and he wants to settle down there at some point so we must be doing something
8203300	8204300	right.
8205300	8208420	But 573 is coming up, hello.
8208420	8214540	But in all seriousness, it is really fascinating that we're at this point where this, you know,
8214540	8218740	DDR is kind of an old, DDR qualifies as a classic game of the week.
8218740	8221780	You know, it's that old and this show has been around for 12 years.
8221780	8223140	I did play something.
8223140	8224580	Now I remember why I was out.
8224580	8225580	I'm sorry.
8225580	8227420	I do remember something now.
8227420	8228420	Oh, alright.
8228420	8229660	Here's why I was out.
8229660	8230660	Now I remember.
8230660	8236740	Because I went to, I went to my brother-in-law's, well soon to be brother-in-law's bachelor
8236740	8237740	party.
8237740	8238740	Wasn't anything great.
8238740	8239740	We went to Dave & Buster's.
8239740	8247600	But I played DDR X2, I don't know, so I played a little bit of that.
8247600	8248940	But that's why I was out.
8248940	8250780	You realized you were old and out of shape.
8250780	8252300	Oh, I already knew that.
8252300	8253300	We weren't going into it.
8253300	8257860	Like I played, I didn't play, I played one game with doubles and I was just all singles,
8257860	8259100	you know, from there on out.
8259100	8263100	I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but a friend of mine wanted to play some music
8263100	8266740	games on Xbox with Kinect yesterday, so we played Just Dance.
8266740	8272180	And I also had that whole like, wow, I'm old and out of shape moment after like three songs.
8272180	8278380	That's why, because she had to watch the kids, so I had to take the night off because it
8278380	8282620	wouldn't be fair that she had to watch the kids for two nights.
8282620	8283620	That's what it was.
8283620	8284620	Now I remember.
8284620	8289740	Well, anyway, but the fact that DDR is so old that like it's an influential game like
8289740	8290740	that.
8290740	8294820	I mean, it influenced this show, but it's interesting that, you know, you have this
8294820	8299020	generation that DDR influenced from a musical perspective.
8299020	8301580	That's so fascinating to me.
8301580	8303140	Anyway, very cool email.
8303140	8304140	Thank you.
8304140	8305140	We didn't have DDR.
8305140	8308140	We wouldn't have Just Dance or Dance Central or any of that.
8308140	8309140	Yeah.
8309140	8310140	None of it.
8310140	8312460	Hello, escorts in the realm of Podtopia.
8312460	8313700	Hi.
8313780	8317660	With all the recent talk of PT Silent Hills and the upcoming yearly Rocktober holiday
8317660	8323220	of Halloween, I'm curious what you would say is the most scary game you've ever played.
8323220	8327820	Not the best game that is scary, but the game that scared the ever living fuck out of you.
8327820	8328820	Mine is Nintendogs.
8328820	8331100	Curse you, Sinophobia.
8331100	8332340	Stay black, redertainment.
8332340	8336540	This message has been brought to you by PT on Xbox One and other things that may never
8336540	8337540	happen.
8337540	8339180	Trainer.
8339180	8343940	I remember playing Resident Evil when the dogs burst through or yeah, when the dogs
8343940	8346060	was it Resident Evil or Resident Evil 2?
8346060	8347060	Yeah.
8347060	8350460	When the dogs burst through the window, I'm like, holy crap.
8350460	8351460	And then that was it.
8351460	8356660	Because, but you saw, you've, I squealed during the PT that actually kind of, it wasn't like
8356660	8362540	a scare as much as the things that actually frightened me are like games that features
8362540	8366540	clowns and that's why I will not play Five Nights at Freddy's because whenever, if I
8366540	8371900	see an animatronic that isn't working, it freaks the ever living fuck out of me.
8371900	8373940	That is definitely a game on my list to stream.
8373940	8377420	I have a little growing list of things I want to do YouTubes and streams out of.
8377420	8384860	I will not be able to play that just because it hits like an old phobia of mine.
8384860	8388580	I mean, I might, and then I might go barf for an hour.
8388580	8391140	Don't watch commercials for the next American Horror Story either.
8391140	8393340	Do I watch TV?
8393340	8395820	They show up on Facebook, so careful.
8395820	8396820	I have adblock.
8396820	8399500	Loki, is there a game that super scared you?
8399500	8403100	No, I don't really play any of these like super scary games.
8403100	8404660	I just not interested in them.
8404660	8405980	I do have Among the Sleep.
8405980	8406980	I should play that.
8406980	8410700	That's supposed to be pretty creepy, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that on my
8410700	8412220	Steam backlog right now.
8412220	8416940	Loki and I were roommates when Silent Hill 4 The Room came out and I was playing through
8416940	8421700	that and I was like screaming and Loki was like, shut up.
8421700	8422700	I don't remember that.
8422700	8427100	I was so scared in that game that just made me nauseous and that's when you find the giant
8427100	8428100	head.
8428100	8429100	Yes.
8429100	8430100	Oh my God.
8430100	8431100	That scared the hell out of me.
8431100	8433380	But it was more, it's more when you, there's this one place where you like kind of fall
8433380	8436900	down and you land on the bottom and then all of a sudden these two headed little baby monster
8436900	8439500	start going and they like start running at you.
8439500	8444180	And I started like screaming and Loki's like, what the hell's going on over there?
8444180	8445420	Like a concerned dad.
8445420	8446420	I wasn't.
8446420	8450300	That was a polite way of saying shut up.
8450300	8454820	I would say though, honestly, the scariest game I've probably played, like scariest experience,
8454820	8456460	turn all the lights off.
8456460	8462940	Well now it's a tie because Quake, uh, with all the lights off and the headphones and
8462940	8466700	just staring at the monitor and playing Quake, that's actually super scary because the first
8466700	8470060	person and everything, especially when that game was out, you know, the graphics are a
8470060	8471260	little bit ahead of its time.
8471260	8473820	That was really scary to me because you turn a corner and then monster.
8473820	8478940	I guess the, the, well, the recently, I'll kind of, it had like a moment in there would
8478940	8481700	have been, uh, the original Bioshock.
8481700	8486060	Like there's the one, especially that one scene where you're, you know, going around
8486060	8489460	through like the, um, I think it was a lab or something like that.
8489460	8496180	And like the, this gas or, um, some sort of like line burst and like it's steamy and you
8496180	8500060	turn around and there's a guy like Santa right in front of you and you're just like, ah,
8500060	8501060	die, die, die.
8501060	8503380	Uh, but then the other one I'm thinking of.
8503380	8507100	Actually, even though this wasn't, you know, the best of the silent Hill games, I was playing
8507100	8509740	silent Hill homecoming home alone.
8509740	8514660	I actually want to play that one during a rainstorm and it was dark and there was a
8514660	8518840	scene where like the ceiling falls and all this stuff like falls down and it scared the
8518840	8519840	shit out of me.
8519840	8524580	And then I got up and I saw the front door had blown open and that was the moment I said,
8524580	8526180	Nope, Nope, Nope.
8526180	8529780	Turned off the three 60 shut the door, went in my room and crawled into the covers.
8529780	8530780	Nope.
8530780	8531780	DS night.
8531780	8537060	Didn't they, didn't they do though, um, a game based off of the ring that came out in
8537060	8538060	Japan.
8538060	8540700	Yeah, they'd had it on the Wii.
8540700	8543040	I actually, I actually want that game.
8543040	8549060	I wanted to play it, but I wanted to play like, I want like a game like that where you
8549060	8551500	die in the end, you know, cause there's no happy endings.
8551500	8552500	They had one.
8552500	8555860	Well, I don't remember if it was a rain, but they had the one, it was, God, I don't remember
8555860	8556860	these movies anymore.
8556860	8558540	It's the one that was the grudge.
8558540	8559540	Yeah.
8559540	8564380	Cause there were also a bunch of TV movies and cause the ring series just got stupid
8564380	8566140	in Japan with the Sadako 3d.
8566140	8567200	It was awful.
8567200	8568540	That was a bad movie.
8568540	8569540	Um, let's see.
8569540	8572120	Fifth dream says I couldn't play PT.
8572120	8575020	Even watching sky play freaked me out for a couple days.
8575020	8576020	Oh, live.vognetwork.com.
8576020	8579540	Oh, let's move on to the next email.
8579540	8580540	Sorry.
8580540	8581780	Next email.
8581780	8586540	Hey, orange lounge, I've been playing through divinity original sin and it's kicking my
8586540	8587540	ass.
8587540	8588540	I'm struggling.
8588540	8592060	Completing objectives is almost like getting that good grade after hours of studying for
8592060	8593060	a test.
8593060	8596020	What was the, what were the most difficult games that you've ever played that made you
8596020	8598460	rage and smile all at the same time?
8598460	8599460	Much love.
8599460	8603100	EA skeezy from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
8603100	8605820	Rage and smile at the same time.
8605820	8613420	I guess that sense of accomplishment for making it through something super meat boy.
8613420	8617380	I got that with fractal, any mega man game.
8617380	8618380	Fractal.
8618380	8619380	Mega man two.
8619380	8620380	Mega man two.
8620380	8621380	Mega man nine recently.
8621380	8622380	Oh my God.
8622380	8625400	I haven't even played, I bought that and I never played it.
8625400	8626900	Now's the best time.
8626900	8630340	But you remember when I was on my really big fractal kick?
8630340	8631340	Hmm.
8631340	8635060	Just getting into level 30 on fractal cause each level was like a struggle.
8635060	8637860	I would try for days to pass one level.
8637860	8642500	And then I was like, because me, I love my puzzle games and just being good at fractal.
8642500	8647620	And then, um, there was a one day that while I was intensely intoxicated playing on Wendell's
8647620	8656660	uh, uh, PSP that I got to like, what was it, 25 on, um, uh, great, now I can't think of
8656660	8662260	the name, that puzzle game that has Luminesce while I was drunk and I could never do it
8662260	8663260	again.
8663260	8667140	And then I was like, I have a level 25, oh, that was great.
8667140	8672420	Um, ask me this question again about level 85 and wow.
8672420	8676300	Ask me this question again about rage inducing games that you love when I lose my hardcore
8676300	8680260	character in Diablo three, especially if I end up live streaming that big moment that
8680260	8684780	I lose my hardcore character because that's going to be a table flipping moment.
8684780	8687100	How high is your hardcore character right now?
8687100	8688220	Right now I just beat act two.
8688220	8690140	I think I'm only 28 so it's not that far.
8690140	8694140	I have, I have to get to 70 but I'm, I'm playing conservative right now.
8694140	8695420	I'm not trying to push it too much.
8695420	8699100	I'm making sure I'm a little out geared, but we'll see.
8699100	8701580	I'll give you updates cause I'm really sucked into this right now.
8701580	8702580	Like that's my goal.
8702580	8703700	That's my current goal of the moment.
8703700	8708180	Destiny will veer me off track for a little bit, but I'll, I'll, I can only sit in front
8708180	8712260	of the PlayStation for so long before I'll end up back at the PC.
8712260	8713260	Next email.
8713260	8714260	Last email.
8714260	8715260	Last email.
8715260	8718500	Hi, I've been a long time listener since the live three 65 days.
8718620	8721860	I don't have too much to add, but I do want to thank you for all the hard work you guys
8721860	8722860	put into your show.
8722860	8727020	I really do enjoy listening to the different perspectives of the events of the gaming industry
8727020	8730260	and I was looking forward to hearing from you three or sometimes four or five.
8730260	8731260	You get the idea.
8731260	8733380	I hope all is well and take care.
8733380	8734620	And that's from needle crash.
8734620	8736580	Oh, is that no question?
8736580	8737580	Nope.
8737580	8738580	Just a nice wow.
8738580	8739580	Happy email.
8739580	8740580	Well, that's awesome.
8740580	8741580	Thank you.
8741580	8742580	I love the happy emails.
8742580	8743580	Thank you.
8743580	8746820	And while you have been listening to us for a long time, you know what's funny and you're
8746820	8747820	still here.
8748500	8754300	I've been randomly meeting people at Dragon Con even this happened and just through some
8754300	8758500	other events where people are like, yeah, you know, I've never really emailed or called
8758500	8763260	or said anything, but I've been listening since the live 365 days and I'm like, well,
8763260	8764260	nice to meet you.
8764260	8765260	Thank you for showing up.
8765260	8767820	I'm always just blown away by how long people have been around.
8767820	8774020	I wouldn't know what we're doing because it doesn't feel like we're really doing much,
8774020	8775220	but I guess we are.
8775220	8778580	I think in some ways, not to get too sappy on you.
8778580	8780020	It's not what we're doing.
8780020	8783020	It's what we're not doing.
8783020	8784700	That could be part of it.
8784700	8788860	I think in some ways, it's like that bar cheers, right?
8788860	8789860	Right.
8789860	8791580	It's the old 80s sitcom cheers.
8791580	8793900	Does that mean I get to sit in the corner and drink beer?
8793900	8797780	You are definitely Rhea Perlman.
8797780	8800060	I would be Ted Danson.
8800060	8801060	Loki's Kirstie Alley.
8801060	8802060	No, no, no.
8802060	8805620	No, no, no, no.
8805620	8806620	You are Norm.
8806620	8807620	He'd be our Norm.
8807620	8808620	He'd be Norm.
8808620	8813380	I would say Rama's more the norm because every time, every week when he calls, Norm, Rama,
8813380	8814380	right?
8814380	8819340	But anyway, all that joking aside, I think it's this place and we've tried really hard
8819340	8822580	to build a welcoming place, like no jerks allowed, right?
8822580	8826740	A welcoming place where we can just sit around and talk about video games.
8826740	8830660	And even when I don't agree with you guys, and there's some of you guys in chat that
8830660	8835420	I disagree with an awful lot, you know who you are, but I respect you and I respect your
8835420	8836420	opinion.
8836420	8840300	And I think the fact that we all respect each other in that way and have helped create that
8840300	8844900	environment has helped the longevity of this show in a way you guys can't even imagine
8844900	8847260	because we don't tolerate that disrespect.
8847260	8850780	We're not going to allow that type of environment because that's what's going to make people
8850780	8852100	not want to be here.
8852100	8856420	So and if you'd rather participate quietly, then that's cool too.
8856420	8860020	Just know that if you ever want to speak up, we're here to listen.
8860020	8862060	Every gamer has a voice.
8862060	8863900	And it might be mine.
8863900	8868740	It is yours an awful lot, but we love you.
8868740	8874460	I'm the one reading the emails unless I have, you know, laryngitis or something.
8874460	8877180	And those are the days when I sound like this.
8877180	8881140	Hi, this is Jamie, you're listening to Orange Lost Radio.
8881140	8885700	Now you sound like one of those anti-smoking commercials or something.
8885700	8887860	I sound like the tracheotomy cow.
8887860	8888860	You do.
8888860	8889860	You do.
8890700	8895220	Actually, I sound like one of the Simpson sisters, Marja sisters.
8895220	8896220	Patty and Selma.
8896220	8897220	Patty and Selma.
8897220	8898220	I love Patty and Selma.
8898220	8899220	All right.
8899220	8900220	Yeah, that's it.
8900220	8903980	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send us an email.
8903980	8908580	And if you want to send a very kind email like that one was, then you know what?
8908580	8910340	Those emails really make my fricking day.
8910340	8913140	So I appreciate that you even take 30 seconds to type that out.
8913140	8917220	If you want to send an email that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck, then I'll read that
8917220	8918220	too and then hit delete.
8918220	8919220	And then we'll laugh.
8919220	8926020	No, but again, I, I don't always agree with some of the opinions, but I respect them.
8926020	8930700	As long as you're, I like things that as long as you treat respectful discussion, yes.
8930700	8932160	As long as you treat people respectfully.
8932160	8933160	That's all I care about.
8933160	8935940	Sometimes we're going to get heated here in the, here in the room.
8935940	8939620	We've all had, we've had the dark soccer and I have gotten into it.
8939620	8940620	Dark soccer, Loki gotten into it.
8940620	8944700	I've gotten into it, Loki, but we all respect each other a ton and more and more every week
8944700	8945700	that we still are.
8945700	8948780	And then Rob buys Mass Effect 3 on Wii U.
8948780	8951100	You only, you only said that cause Shane walked in.
8951100	8955140	I know, but it's funny, Shane, did you hear what happened earlier in the show?
8955140	8964140	I bought, I bought Mass Effect 3 on Wii U because it was $13 on Amazon, but, but, but
8964140	8965140	I own it.
8965140	8967900	Shane, Shane, no one can hear anything that he's saying.
8967900	8971900	Shane said you could have borrowed mine for free and figured out that it's garbage.
8971900	8973980	But now Shane, now you don't understand.
8973980	8976860	Now Shane, I own Mass Effect 3, every single version or Mass Effect.
8976900	8978900	You don't sound like Harvey Fierstein.
8980900	8982900	Shane, come here and get on a mic if you're going to keep talking.
8985900	8986900	We're doing a show.
8986900	8987900	You're talking to everybody else.
8987900	8991420	I was just saying, why did you buy that when we need to buy cables for iPhones and we could
8991420	8992420	have combined the order.
8992420	8993420	Why?
8993420	8994420	Porque no los dos?
8994420	8999100	I don't understand Mexican.
8999100	9000100	Get out.
9000100	9001100	Okay.
9001340	9009980	You know what, apparently I sound like Aunt Slappy and Aunt Slappy sounds like an old
9009980	9010980	Jewish woman.
9010980	9011980	All right.
9011980	9017900	I'm, I am falling more and more into the stereotype of my adopted culture.
9017900	9018900	All right.
9018900	9019900	I'm no good at saving money.
9019900	9021540	Let's go to the FUs of the week.
9021540	9023020	You ready for the FUs of the week?
9023020	9024020	Here we go.
9031100	9045980	I am surprisingly good with my lot in life right now.
9045980	9054820	The only things I have to say about FU is people who don't know how to support their
9054820	9058940	ideology without using fallacious arguments.
9058940	9062860	Therefore I have decided that henceforth, anytime I disagree with somebody, I'm just
9062860	9066660	going to point out how the argument sucks and how they've actually spouted a logical
9066660	9069700	fallacy and tell them to talk to me when they can actually debate.
9069700	9071740	Like we learned how to do in school.
9071740	9075620	Is that similar to how on Twitter I have a policy where if people try to troll me with
9075620	9079540	that messages, I just respond with a RuPaul's drag race gift?
9079540	9085100	Kind of, but like for example, it's like, Oh, well marijuana is a slippery slope to
9085100	9086100	this and that.
9086100	9090220	Slippery slope arguments are considered fallacious.
9090220	9094740	I need something with numbers and proof behind it.
9094740	9098460	Maybe they just need to smoke some weed and chill out.
9098460	9101620	This is like, um, you know, I don't, I don't do marijuana for the record, but I don't care
9101620	9105660	if you just used, uh, an emotion, emotional reasoning instead of logical reasoning.
9105660	9108420	I want you to rephrase that using proof.
9108420	9109420	All right.
9109420	9110420	Loki, your review of the week.
9110420	9111420	You know what I say?
9111420	9114860	It's snow covered mountains are slippery slope.
9114860	9115860	It's factual.
9115860	9120580	Especially when you go sledding and they're extra slippery.
9120580	9122060	Is that your FU of the week?
9122060	9126900	No, I guess my FU of the week would be, I have nothing to do at work.
9126900	9131300	I guess I could be looking for work, but it feels a little wrong to be looking for work
9131300	9132300	at work.
9132300	9136940	But since they're like, well, they're training people like on the new system, but I'm not
9136940	9139300	one of those new people that they're trained on the system.
9139300	9145380	And then, then apparently they're keeping a couple reps from our Dallas office for some
9145380	9146380	reason.
9146380	9151180	I don't know, but they wanted to keep some outside reps instead of paying for one rep
9151180	9153860	to be in our Folsom house, but whatever.
9153860	9159020	So I've got to get them up to speed on my accounts, but they don't give a shit.
9159020	9160860	So fuck it.
9160860	9163060	I don't give a shit too then.
9163060	9168820	So I guess I have you to my boss and his boss for not fucking writing my rec letters or
9168820	9169820	recommendation.
9169820	9172420	Like I asked you, I fucking asked you like weeks ago.
9172420	9174860	And then I reminded you again and you still haven't fucking done it.
9174860	9176940	I'm only asking you one fucking thing.
9176940	9180580	You can't give me a job, but the least you can do is fucking write me my goddamn letter
9180580	9182040	of recommendations.
9182040	9185180	So I can apply for other jobs.
9185180	9186180	What a mess.
9186180	9187460	I hope you get through that quick.
9187460	9188460	Logie.
9188460	9190540	Oh, well, like a couple more weeks or a few more weeks.
9190540	9194580	So 30th, a few comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9194580	9197860	Rama says marijuana is a slippery slope to me having an empty fridge.
9197860	9199860	You know what I said?
9199860	9200860	What?
9200860	9204700	It's a slippery slip to Benadryl for me since I'm allergic and then that's a slippery slip
9204700	9205700	to naps.
9205700	9206700	Lots of naps.
9206700	9211980	Uh, SSG100 Matt says what Jamie needs is for people to show her the receipts for their
9211980	9212980	arguments.
9212980	9216140	So people are actually buying their arguments or something.
9216140	9217900	I think it's a reference to the Whitney Houston.
9217900	9219900	I want to see the receipts.
9220900	9222620	According to the market on an argument.
9222620	9223620	So sales.
9223620	9224620	Hello.
9224620	9227620	I'm here to have an argument.
9227620	9231620	Oh, this is abuse.
9231620	9232620	All right.
9232620	9233620	Do I get to do my FUs of the week?
9233620	9234620	Here's my FUs of the week.
9234620	9235620	All right.
9235620	9236620	Yes.
9236620	9237620	Remember that whole thing about respect and all that.
9237620	9238620	We all love and respect each other.
9238620	9239620	Put that on hold for a minute.
9239620	9241060	Put that on hold for a minute.
9241060	9242700	Shut up lady.
9242700	9247900	My FU of the week goes to everybody with the exception of code man and fifth dream.
9247900	9248900	My hype.
9248900	9249900	My high five.
9249900	9255540	F you to everybody who made fun of me for buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U.
9255540	9262660	I'll do what I want rod buying Mass Effect three on the Wii U is like me having cheesecake
9262660	9263660	for breakfast.
9263660	9265220	Well, I'm a grown up.
9265220	9266500	What's the fucking problem?
9266500	9268500	I'm a grown up.
9268500	9269500	Exactly.
9269500	9270500	I'm a grown up.
9270500	9277500	It's like as Gordon Modesto for Duncan.
9277500	9278500	All right.
9279100	9280100	Team adult.
9280100	9284460	We know how to adult.
9284460	9288980	Just a few more stories for you guys and then your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR
9288980	9293440	and then, and then the week after that we go to San Francisco, just go to hot cookie.
9293440	9295420	And then after that we go to LA.
9295420	9296420	Just go to Disneyland.
9296420	9297420	All right.
9297420	9298420	Calm down.
9298420	9299420	Calm down.
9299420	9300420	Put the car in park.
9300420	9303380	Uh, one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
9303380	9307460	All one word, but first a couple more stories for you guys, uh, Loki.
9307460	9314680	So Sega is locked in a courtroom battle with gearbox, um, regarding aliens, colonial Marines
9314680	9315680	and some more.
9315680	9323080	Um, I guess testimony came out, um, on September 2nd and regarding, you know, how gearbox handled
9323080	9327940	the majority of the marketing of the game and, um, basically said the significant level
9327940	9335060	of public relations, the anatomy and was demanded by the studio and to, you know, the TLDL of
9335060	9338220	it is, um, or I messed that up.
9338220	9346060	The TLDR of that is, um, basically gearbox president Randy Pitchford just did whatever
9346060	9347060	the fuck he wanted.
9347060	9354340	Uh, according to, uh, say guy just, just did what he wanted and, you know, uh, advertise
9354340	9355720	the game however he wanted.
9355720	9360700	And so they're blaming him for the fact that the game didn't quite meet what they were
9360700	9362180	showing off at E3.
9362180	9368980	And I don't know, it's a drama, a whole bunch of drama.
9368980	9372180	No shortage of that in the gaming industry these past couple of weeks.
9372180	9377460	I mean, I think right now they're trying to distance the fact that yes, it was gearbox
9377460	9383200	that, you know, cause this game to suck and not Sega because Sega does have another aliens
9383200	9386840	game coming out in like a month from now.
9386840	9391460	So they probably want to establish that, yeah, it wasn't us, it was them.
9391460	9393460	So that people buy that game.
9393460	9395500	I think they've distanced enough from it.
9395500	9398700	A lot of the, a lot of the people I think are pretty good about knowing that it's a
9398700	9401460	different thing.
9401460	9404580	That's the impression I get anyway, especially, especially when you've got Sigourney Weaver
9404580	9408700	and some of the DLC, that's a pretty, pretty big land, you know?
9408700	9409700	Yeah.
9409700	9415260	So, all right, well, uh, I got one more thing for you guys here and it has to do with a
9415260	9418160	possible competitor to Steam and Origin.
9418160	9423640	Another challenger enters the ring, and that could be Warner Brothers, now keep in mind
9423640	9428880	this is all rumor, however, Warner Brothers filed a series of trademark applications this
9428880	9434720	past week for something called WB Play, covering things like, quote, online retail store services,
9434720	9439040	quote, audio and video broadcasting services, and quote, entertainment service.
9439040	9442600	And also, quote, downloadable virtual goods.
9442600	9445040	So hmm, very interesting.
9445040	9449280	Warner Brothers has used Steam and Origin in the past, but possibly they're going to
9449280	9450720	come up with their own thing.
9450720	9454880	Uh, again, you have to really tinfoil hat this an awful lot, but it's not like we haven't
9454880	9460440	seen companies kind of try to do their own thing and try to have that central, you know,
9460440	9462120	hub for their stuff.
9462120	9467280	You know, Ubisoft has one, EA's got that whole pass online, well, and they have Origin, right?
9467280	9469600	So well, yeah, and it can go one of two ways.
9469600	9474960	I mean, it could be like Uplay where their games are offered on Uplay and they're offered
9474960	9480040	on the Steam store, or it could be like Origin where their games aren't usually offered on
9480040	9482400	the Steam store, it's just on Origin.
9482400	9490440	So hopefully it's more like, you know, Uplay, but I don't know.
9490440	9495040	Warner does some weird, having worked in the industry with Warner Brothers on the movie
9495040	9500080	side, they do some really strange shit, and then they turn around and do some other strange
9500080	9504960	shit and it just keeps going on and on like that, and even if it doesn't make any fucking
9504960	9509840	sense they will keep sticking with it like, oh, they're going to sell direct to everybody,
9509840	9513600	oh, they're not going to sell direct to everybody, oh, they're going to do that again, oh, they're
9513600	9518360	not going to sell to, you know, distribution, they're going to just, you know, limit rental
9518360	9520040	windows, oh, they're not going to do that.
9520040	9524080	It's just like, ugh, I can't follow what they're doing anymore.
9524080	9528160	Um, so, I could see them doing this, whether it's successful or not, but they're going
9528160	9532640	to stick with it, and if anything, they may do this just for, you know, not only games
9532640	9537080	but movies as well, you know, have a platform where they can digitally distribute their
9537080	9538080	products.
9538080	9543240	Well, now, WBPlay is going to be something because the domain name, wbplay.com, it was
9543240	9548240	registered back in 2013, but they're not doing anything with it right now, so clearly something
9548240	9552040	is going to happen with this, and, gee, the launch of Batman Arkham Origins would be a
9552040	9557000	great time to kick the wall down with launching something, especially with the Mortal Kombat
9557040	9561760	10, or Mortal Kombat X, excuse me, just around the corner as well, so, you know, 2015 would
9561760	9564680	be a great year for Warner Brothers to make a move in that department.
9564680	9569760	I'm all for competition, but at the same time, Origin was, I don't like the whole, like,
9569760	9575000	required thing, and yes, I realize Steam started this way, but Steam's been around so long
9575000	9580440	now that time and an epic amount of Steam sales have really healed a lot of things.
9580440	9583160	So I just hope if Warner Brothers is going to do their own thing, I just don't want it
9583160	9584600	to be mandatory.
9584600	9586400	Make me want to install it.
9586400	9590200	Do something that's going to make me want to get on there and use the service.
9590200	9591200	That's all.
9591200	9593120	That's all I want.
9593120	9594640	Is that a fair request, Loki?
9594640	9595640	Yeah.
9595640	9596640	All right.
9596640	9600920	Speaking of Steam, just a real quick update, they did do a client beta update that does
9600920	9608840	some in-home streaming, I guess, optimizations and some updates for AMD, so some more video
9608840	9613520	cards supported there for the in-home streaming support, so stay on top of your Steam beta
9613520	9616080	updates if that's something that's of interest to you.
9616080	9617360	All right.
9617360	9618360	Now we're done.
9618360	9619680	We're to the calls.
9619680	9620680	So let's open it up.
9620680	9625740	Skypline is open right now, 1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9625740	9628800	And in the meantime, I'm going to get to the Twitters, because I know we had a few Twitter
9628800	9630280	topics tonight.
9630280	9634160	While I bring up Twitter, does Loki have any last minute stories he wants to cover?
9634160	9635960	Uh, no.
9635960	9636960	Really?
9636960	9640320	It's like Borderlands 2's coming to Linux.
9640320	9641320	That's kind of cool.
9641320	9642320	Oh, that's cool.
9642640	9647480	I don't know why this was even news anywhere, but apparently, yeah, the new 3DS models,
9647480	9650680	they're region-locked as well.
9650680	9651760	Really is that a shock?
9651760	9656880	Because the original 3DS and 3DS XL were region-locked as well.
9656880	9659640	What made you think they were going to all of a sudden change their mind on that?
9659640	9665400	Although honestly, if it wasn't region-locked, they might sell a few more systems, but yeah.
9665400	9666400	I have the reasons.
9666400	9669800	If the new 3DS was not region-locked, I'd buy one in a heartbeat.
9669960	9672520	Anyway, let's go ahead and go to the phones, because the phones are lighting up.
9672520	9673520	Let's get to it.
9673520	9674520	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9674520	9675520	Who's this?
9675520	9676520	Hey, what's up, guys?
9676520	9677520	This is Kaijuto.
9677520	9678520	Hey, Kaijuto.
9678520	9679520	What's up, buddy?
9679520	9684960	I got to put my two cents into the new 3DS, and also I want to let you guys know about
9684960	9687880	a news story that I think that you should cover maybe later that I haven't really seen
9687880	9688880	in the news.
9688880	9689880	Okay.
9689880	9692520	So I'm going to try to make it all quick so you can get to another phone call.
9692520	9699760	The 3DS, I'm pretty much convinced that everything about the new 3DS is to fix whatever
9699760	9701960	everybody felt was wrong about the current 3DS.
9701960	9706840	If you think about it, the faster web browser, like Loki mentioned, a lot of people complained
9706840	9708880	about that when the 3DS came out.
9708880	9712560	Also, a lot of people hated the fact that I never had this problem, but people were
9712560	9717720	saying, if you look too far off to the side, you lose the 3D, and what do you see now in
9717720	9718720	the new 3DS?
9718720	9722060	It's like you can tilt it a little further, so that means that more people can stand around
9722060	9725440	you at the bus stop and watch you play your 3D game.
9725440	9729920	The thumbsticks, which I mentioned before, the extra shoulder buttons, which makes it
9729920	9733840	sound like they're making it for hardcore gamers, so-called hardcore gamers.
9733840	9738640	The SD card slot, that's another thing that people wanted, and hopefully with all this,
9738640	9742400	they'll bring back picture chat, or whatever the hell that thing was called.
9742400	9743640	Oh, the swap note.
9743640	9745120	Yeah, swap note, yeah.
9745120	9746120	That would be great.
9746120	9747640	They're willing to bring that back.
9747640	9751720	Is that why there's going to be a 60 cent lock on this maybe with the parental controls?
9751720	9752720	That actually-
9752720	9753720	I wouldn't doubt it.
9753720	9754720	Huh, interesting thought.
9755200	9759160	That's a good thought, and here's where I stand with the new 3DS.
9759160	9762320	As much crap as we've kind of been giving you here, especially over the name and things
9762320	9766680	like that, ultimately, golden rule, we've said this before, our system is only as good
9766680	9768080	as the games that are on it.
9768080	9771380	All I'm hearing right now is that, oh, we're going to get Xenoblade, which was already
9771380	9775060	done on the Wii and have already played, so that alone is not enough to convince me to
9775060	9778780	replace my XL, which works for the 3DS library just fine.
9778780	9781960	Some of these other features, they all sound good and cool and things like that, and yay
9781960	9786240	for the people that don't already have a 3DS, but eh, I can play my 3DS games just
9786240	9787240	fine right now.
9787240	9788240	I'm not going to-
9788240	9792780	A lot of fans, a lot of fans of the current 3DS, I mean, it's almost like they pretty
9792780	9797200	much heard people's cries and they fixed them.
9797200	9799200	Obviously, that's not their main reason.
9799200	9806120	Their ultimate goal, of course, is to make money, but yeah, to me, I applaud them for
9806120	9809800	doing it because I think that they're actually listening to their fans and trying to correct
9809800	9810800	the mistakes.
9810800	9814880	Y'all know that the, what the hell is it, the 3D XL, whatever the hell it's called,
9814880	9817280	I mean, people were complaining about the screen being too small.
9817280	9818280	They fixed that.
9818280	9821760	It seems like they just seem to make the 3DS for everyone.
9821760	9825880	People hated the 3D, you got the 2DS, you know, it's like, you know, I think it's a
9825880	9826880	good thing.
9826880	9829880	I don't know if I'm going to buy it anytime soon, but it's a good thing.
9829880	9834480	See, see, wait a minute.
9834480	9839360	At the end of the day, I'll try to put cynical Rob aside and say, you know what, if Nintendo
9839360	9843640	is really listening to people, and I really hope you're right, that this is what they're
9843640	9849720	trying to do, is they're really trying to listen to people, that would be fantastic.
9849720	9851160	I do hope you're right in that regard.
9851160	9855480	I'm a little skeptical if that's really the case, but I would love it if it is the case.
9855480	9856480	I'm almost sure of it.
9856480	9859480	All right, let me get to this real quick and I'll let you get to a call.
9859480	9863000	You guys got to find out about what's going on with CraftBucket and Minecraft.
9863000	9866600	I know that, Loki, you used CraftBucket for your server, right?
9866600	9869000	Yeah, I did.
9869040	9871560	They kind of already explained what went on with that.
9871560	9876880	It's just that I guess the original dev or whatever doesn't want to work on it anymore,
9876880	9880640	and apparently it was purchased by Mojang at one point, and so they're going to continue
9880640	9885720	development on it, at least for 1.8, internally within Mojang, and they're going to release
9885720	9886720	that at some point.
9886720	9893400	And I don't know where Minecraft's officially supported mod singing works into it.
9893400	9898920	I can only hope that, I mean, fuck, I'll switch over to whatever they have if it, you know,
9898920	9901840	supports what I want to run on it.
9901840	9902840	So we'll see.
9902840	9908320	You know, it would be nice to have one unified thing that I don't have to wait for, oh, CraftBucket
9908320	9913640	to update to support 1.8, you know, because right now I'm on 1.79.
9913640	9914640	I don't know.
9914640	9917440	I hope it's better.
9917440	9918440	I don't know, man.
9918440	9922240	With Mojang, I mean, it took them a year just to come out with 1.8.
9922240	9925600	I mean, I know it's a big update, but it took them a year.
9925600	9927960	Those guys have proven to be super slow.
9927960	9931960	I don't know what the hell they're doing over there drinking goat milk or whatever the hell,
9931960	9939160	but they don't seem to do things on time, and they changed their mind, because I remember
9939160	9943800	back in 2011, we were supposed to get the mod API, and all of a sudden, I didn't know
9943800	9946480	where we got runs, which doesn't make any sense to me.
9946480	9948880	They're doing a lot of tweaks, though, to the game.
9948880	9954400	I saw kind of a development article about how they're redoing their calling engine for
9954400	9959480	it and stuff to make it a lot faster, because remember, you know, if your chunks aren't
9959480	9963120	loading or whatever, you can see kind of in the distance and see all these different caves
9963120	9969520	and stuff that are down there, where now that's all going to be culled out so that your CPU
9969520	9972960	isn't trying to render shit that you're nowhere near.
9972960	9977240	So I think that's great, and they were doing that for the Pocket Edition, I think, mainly,
9977240	9982240	but I'm sure they can apply that to the regular edition as well, and that only means better
9982240	9983760	performance.
9983760	9989200	I kind of wish they would move out of, you know, using Java for everything, but I mean,
9989200	9992140	that's just the way the game's built, I guess.
9992140	9997420	It would be nice to see some sort of, you know, boost for, you know, having a nice graphics
9997420	9998420	card and stuff like that.
9998420	10002960	I don't know, I just don't really see that with their client.
10002960	10007200	But I'm hopeful once they do get the mod API support out there, and once, you know, maybe
10007200	10012160	even if, you know, CraftBucket gets updated to 1.8, it doesn't matter that they're, you
10012160	10017200	know, not getting every single little update, it's just, you know, you can fill the gaps
10017200	10020600	in with a lot of stuff that, a lot of the mods that they have on there.
10020600	10025440	I kind of wish that they would have, you know, like, Forge support where you can make your
10025440	10031360	own, you know, characters and, you know, stuff in there, like, that's really what I wanted
10031360	10035400	to have, is like, was it CraftForge or whatever, I forget how they, I don't remember what it's
10035400	10036400	called, but basically...
10036400	10039400	Yeah, SpoutBucket, Craft, all types of Craft.
10039440	10044600	Yeah, it's like so many different, like, offshoots of, you know, Bucket, you know, of like, SpoutCraft
10044600	10050160	or something like that, where you can, you know, combine, you know, Bucket plug-ins with,
10050160	10055440	you know, just the, all this user-generated stuff, you know, new blocks, new enemies,
10055440	10058680	new all sorts of things, that would be pretty awesome.
10058680	10065040	But honestly, if they make it easier to put stuff in there mod-wise, at least on a server
10065040	10069000	than they have with Bucket, because Bucket is kind of a pain in the ass sometimes, I'm
10069000	10070000	all for that.
10070000	10071000	Yeah.
10071000	10072000	It's glitchy, it's buggy as hell.
10072000	10077520	I mean, I have a server on it, and, I mean, I'm always, like, you know, having to remove
10077520	10082880	something and putting something back in, downgrading, upgrading, it's a mess, so I'm what you're
10082880	10083880	saying.
10083880	10086320	All right, well, Kaijuto, buddy, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but have
10086320	10087840	a good one, and thanks for the call.
10087840	10088840	Good perspectives.
10088840	10089840	All right.
10089840	10090840	Later, buddy.
10090840	10095680	All right, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to
10095680	10096680	give us a call.
10096680	10100000	Meanwhile, I'm reading some Twitter topics, so I wait for another call to come in.
10100000	10106120	Alan Alchemy tweeted us earlier today, saying, another OLR challenge for me, all three hosts
10106120	10110240	play Hatoful Boyfriend for How Is Your Gaming Week.
10110240	10112840	Loki will say no, in parentheses.
10112840	10115680	I want to do it, I want to check out this game for sure.
10115680	10118240	I will say no, because I don't have money to buy that game, and honestly, I don't need
10118240	10120520	yet another game in my backlog.
10120520	10123840	What if Alan gifted it to you?
10123840	10125400	It looks silly, but I don't want it.
10125400	10126480	I don't really want it.
10127200	10131720	It's not my type of game, yeah, it's funny, it's pigeons and birds and stuff, it's a dating
10131720	10135880	sim, it's hilarious, but I think it's just going to get old so fast, like once you get
10135880	10137680	past that joke, it's just whatever.
10137680	10138840	Will Jamie play it?
10138840	10141000	Hatoful Boyfriend, Dating Pigeons?
10141000	10142000	I've already played it.
10142000	10143000	Oh, well then-
10143000	10145600	Not the new one, but I've played the old releases.
10145600	10147520	You should play the new one, and tell us which they are.
10147520	10148520	Well, maybe I will.
10148520	10149520	All right, we'll see.
10149520	10150520	Anyway, we're going to go to the phones again.
10150520	10151520	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10151520	10153520	Hey everyone, this is Norm Peterson.
10153520	10154520	Hey, Norm!
10154520	10155520	Hey, everybody.
10155560	10157920	What up, my friend?
10157920	10158920	Not much, not much.
10158920	10159920	Did you appreciate that comparison?
10159920	10165080	Oh yeah, and the funny thing is, I was about to shout in the chat room, that's me, before
10165080	10167320	you said it.
10167320	10172880	You know what though, to be fair, there's a lot of regular callers to OLR that I feel
10172880	10176680	rightfully share the title of, Norm.
10176680	10179680	You're very good at getting through first or second, though.
10179680	10183840	I actually gave you a shout out on one of the panels, and I don't even remember, it
10183840	10189520	was because we were talking about just creating that kind of environment, and I actually asked
10189520	10193560	the room, I asked the room, I said, how many of you guys here listen to OLR?
10193560	10196480	And a good chance, I was surprised, I was like, wow, a lot of the hands actually went
10196480	10197480	up.
10197480	10200960	And I said, could you guys imagine an episode of OrangeLoungeRadio where Rama doesn't call
10200960	10201960	in?
10201960	10202960	And I got a resounding, no!
10202960	10208960	So I'm a ratings bringer!
10208960	10210920	Something like that, something like that.
10210920	10212880	I thought you would appreciate that story.
10212920	10213920	What's on your mind, my friend?
10213920	10219280	Well, I just wanted to make sure I got everybody's orders correct, so Rob, you want three bags
10219280	10226440	of pumpkin spice latte, Jamie wants a dozen donuts, shrink-wrapped, freeze-dried sent
10226440	10231320	to her, and Loki wants a large black coffee, right?
10231320	10232320	Loki doesn't drink coffee.
10232320	10235600	No, this is vacuum-sealed, that way they stay fresh.
10235600	10240120	Okay, that's why I was calling the order back over to make sure I had it correct.
10240120	10242120	I want pumpkin as well.
10243120	10249520	Loki wants you to knock this shit off, that's what he wants.
10249520	10252520	I don't know, no, I think it's fantastic.
10252520	10256440	I will be fighting Dark Sakura for those donuts, but she'll be fighting for the coffee, so
10256440	10257440	it'll work out.
10257440	10259600	Rob, you are such a consumer whore.
10259600	10262280	And how?
10262280	10266720	I just bought Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U, that's my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3, take
10266720	10269800	all the shots you want tonight, I don't give a fuck.
10269800	10275440	I know you don't give a fuck.
10275440	10279600	There's shame in your game, Mr. Rob Roberts, and for that, I salute you.
10279600	10280600	You know what?
10280600	10282080	Support the games you love, right?
10282080	10283080	I don't know.
10283080	10284080	Oh yeah.
10284080	10285080	I got nothing.
10285080	10286080	I got nothing.
10286080	10287080	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
10287080	10290520	Was it just to check the order, or what's your game been like the past couple weeks?
10290520	10292240	We didn't have a show last week.
10292240	10295600	I actually picked up the Lego Movie video game, and it's been pretty fun.
10295600	10296600	Oh yeah?
10296600	10297600	Yep.
10297600	10298600	Everything is awesome?
10298840	10303640	Everything is awesome, everything is cool, and you're part of it.
10303640	10304640	Let me stop.
10304640	10305640	Let me stop.
10305640	10311280	If I start seeing that, I'm gonna hang up, turn on the PS3, start playing this game and
10311280	10312960	realize it's time for me to go to bed.
10312960	10314440	Shit, it's six o'clock in the morning.
10314440	10316440	I got 45 minutes.
10316440	10318520	That ain't happening.
10318520	10321800	Rama, what's coming up on Anime Jam Session this week?
10321800	10326920	Oh, actually, we don't know yet, because Marco hasn't gotten the outline to me yet.
10326920	10329480	I usually don't know until Monday, so...
10329480	10332360	Well, shoot, here I was trying to let you have a plug, but...
10332360	10337560	I know, and I appreciate it, but you know how the saying is, good help is so hard to
10337560	10338920	find these days, you know what I'm saying?
10338920	10339920	Yeah, no, I understand.
10339920	10343400	Well, look, I have OLR show rule done about two hours before we're live, so you know,
10343400	10344400	I know how it goes.
10344400	10345400	Exactly, yeah.
10345400	10347400	Tacking Melly Rob that morning.
10347400	10352320	Loki, the other week, Loki had his stories in at four o'clock, and I was like, Loki,
10352320	10353320	God damn it.
10353320	10355560	All right, but anyway, we make it work.
10355560	10356560	All right, Rama.
10356560	10359600	No, no, no, no, hold on, my stories were not in at four o'clock.
10359600	10360880	Not this week, but a prior week.
10360880	10361880	No, that's true.
10361880	10362880	It was like three weeks ago.
10362880	10363880	But usually I get it before that.
10363880	10364880	Yeah, you're okay.
10364880	10365880	All right.
10365880	10366880	No, they work hard.
10366880	10371600	I was like, I took a nap before four o'clock today, I know for a fact that those stories
10371600	10373480	weren't in.
10373480	10375080	The joys of producing a podcast.
10375080	10378000	All right, Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try and get some more calls.
10378000	10381480	If you really do do this donut thing, you're so awesome, I can't even...
10381480	10386160	I'm not gonna do the donut thing, but remember, I did do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.
10386720	10389440	I called all of you out, but you don't have to worry.
10389440	10393400	Act Def is taking one for the team, because remember, he does work for the site.
10393400	10396200	I don't have ice or a bucket, so that's not gonna work.
10396200	10398640	I ship you a bucket, sir.
10398640	10399640	Mr. Bucket?
10399640	10400640	Mr. Bucket?
10400640	10405520	No, I would like to continue to do things to support the MS Foundation.
10405520	10409200	It's kind of my charity of choice right now, so I'm gonna try and put some things together
10409200	10410720	with the Hoard House guys for that.
10410720	10412520	But I think what you guys are doing is fantastic.
10412520	10413520	Yeah.
10413520	10415280	All right, I'm gonna let you go, buddy.
10415280	10416280	Take care.
10416280	10417280	You too, man.
10417280	10418280	Stay black.
10418280	10419280	You too.
10419280	10420280	Bye.
10420280	10421280	Bye.
10421280	10423000	The bucket of advice right now sounds pretty good.
10423000	10424400	It's kind of warm in here.
10424400	10428360	I'm gonna make sure the AC's on or something.
10428360	10433280	You guys fill time while we wait for another call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
10433280	10438600	Um, words.
10438600	10444280	I really have no idea what to say, because I have a 10-hour day tomorrow.
10444280	10445480	Sounds like fun.
10445480	10448720	I did sign up for it, but I have an extra day off.
10448720	10453480	So my goal is to have something playable in my game by episode 573.
10453480	10454480	That's my goal.
10454480	10455480	Really?
10455480	10456480	Yes.
10456480	10457480	I am back, by the way.
10457480	10458820	I turned the AC down one degree.
10458820	10463760	For you guys, I can spare the electric bill for one degree.
10463760	10464760	Let's see.
10464760	10465760	Looking at some other comments.
10465760	10470480	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,
10470480	10473240	all one word.
10473240	10474840	Flaco Jones sent us a tweet.
10474840	10477120	Since you took the week off, I hope you can still touch on this story.
10477120	10479920	I'm looking forward to Loki's reaction.
10479920	10485320	And the story that he posted was about, and this is from the official Xbox news wire,
10485320	10490000	talking about the Xbox One standalone Kinect sensor will be available in October.
10490000	10495120	It will be bundled with Dance Central Spotlight, which came out while we were out as well,
10495120	10498200	and it will be available at retailers for $149.99.
10498200	10500840	Did you hear about that?
10500840	10501840	Yeah, I did.
10501840	10504120	A little higher than what I was expecting for retail price.
10504120	10506120	I don't think anyone's going to buy it.
10506120	10507120	No, seriously.
10507120	10511000	I mean, look at who you're targeting this towards.
10511000	10515320	You're targeting it towards somebody that wanted to buy an Xbox One system because they
10515320	10520240	thought having Kinect in there was too expensive, and so they wanted to spend $100 less.
10520240	10524600	And now you're telling them, oh, spend $150 on a Kinect that you probably don't want in
10524600	10531200	the first place to play, what, a game that you didn't really know about from the beginning
10531200	10532760	that you wanted to have Kinect for?
10532760	10538680	I can't think of any game that's coming out for Kinect that would justify spending an
10538680	10539680	extra $150.
10539680	10542520	I can't think of anything.
10542520	10547880	I'm sorry, Fantasia, while it's probably a cool game, is not fucking worth another $150.
10547880	10551280	Nor is Just Dance, nor is that Dance Central game that they're putting out on it.
10551280	10556920	Yeah, it's like, I want to play Dance Central Spotlight, but not $150 bad, you know?
10556920	10558320	It's really too expensive.
10558320	10562680	The only thing I see that this is a positive is if this works on PC as well, because the
10562680	10566200	PC one that they had, which I don't know if it was a dev kit or something like that, was
10566200	10567200	$200.
10567200	10568200	Jeez.
10568200	10569880	So it's just ridiculous.
10569880	10577000	It's a good way not to, I guess, if anything, this being out there makes maybe the Xbox
10577000	10582880	One with Kinect a slightly better value if you really want Kinect, but honestly, you're
10582880	10586680	probably not really going to want Kinect, because look at their track record.
10586680	10589120	What have they done for games with Kinect?
10589120	10591360	Has there really been anything that innovative for it?
10591360	10592360	No.
10592360	10595160	I feel so bad for Harmonix, who's so invested in that.
10595160	10596800	Harmonix is the Kinect right now.
10596800	10602600	You know, with the Disney Fantasia and the Dance Central Spotlight, I feel so bad for
10602600	10603600	them in a way.
10603600	10608160	Well, props to them that they have some really good software on there, and to be fair, the
10608160	10613600	stuff that they do have for Kinect, like Just Dance, I'm guessing, is pretty good, and Dance
10613600	10619120	Central was fun, but it's almost like buying a Wii U at that point, you know?
10619120	10622480	Why am I going to spend this kind of money for two games?
10622480	10624000	Well, there's more than two.
10624000	10627720	I understand that, but I'm saying it's the equivalent of like, you know, why am I going
10627720	10633280	to spend this kind of money for a couple games, and potentially in the future, I don't really
10633280	10638680	know what, other than another Just Dance game, I mean, really, what else is going to be coming
10638680	10639680	out?
10639680	10640680	Another Kinect sports game?
10640680	10641680	Does anyone give a shit about that?
10641680	10642680	No.
10642760	10645360	What about another Star Wars game where I can do the Han Solo?
10645360	10648360	All right, look, I've got to get back to Twitter topics.
10648360	10654560	All right, Jason says, on the subject of rebuying the same game, I have three copies of Titanfall,
10654560	10659760	360 physical, Xbox One digital, Xbox One physical with limited edition.
10659760	10664720	Thank you, Jason, you get me, you get me, even though I don't know if I'd buy three
10664720	10665720	copies of that game.
10665720	10668640	I do have at least one, so, but at least you get me.
10668800	10673800	All right, SGA100Matt says, could the scum bar from Monkey Island become an official
10673800	10674800	Lego set?
10674800	10675800	It's possible.
10675800	10678480	And he links us to an article from RetroCollect.com.
10678480	10681360	Loki, you're the big Lego fan around here.
10681360	10684960	I don't, well, I don't know if you still really do those with the kids, but I would think
10684960	10686640	that's a fun activity you could all do together.
10686640	10689520	Would you be interested in a scum bar from Monkey Island?
10689520	10692680	I wouldn't pay for it, but I am sure it's one of those cousteau things.
10692680	10696080	They have, like, was it the Back to the Future one looks pretty cool, and every time I pass
10696200	10702760	by those Minecraft ones, I'm like, eh, maybe, but no, Legos are too damn expensive nowadays.
10702760	10706080	I'm sure they were just as expensive when I was growing up, but it seems like it's like
10706080	10712320	what you get for your money is just ridiculous, and I have so many Legos as it was.
10712320	10714960	I do have the Hogwarts Express, though.
10714960	10715960	I have a few of them.
10715960	10716960	I should bring one of those.
10716960	10721920	They're little tiny Hogwarts Express Lego things.
10721920	10725360	So I've got some of those, and Star Trek Enterprises, which I gave you one of those already.
10725360	10727640	But yeah, I don't know.
10727640	10728960	Last call for phone calls.
10728960	10729960	1-877-GAMO-LR.
10729960	10732920	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
10732920	10737880	I will be closing it here after one more tweet from Dar Tetsuya, who says, thoughts on the
10737880	10742000	new Mario Kart 8 DLC coming out between now and next year.
10742000	10743960	This happened during the week we were off.
10743960	10746440	I'm glad you brought this up, because this was some big news.
10746440	10748640	Hopefully we can have more game nights with the new tracks.
10748640	10751880	So if you guys haven't heard, Dar Saket, this might be of particular interest to you.
10751880	10755080	I don't know if you saw this, but they announced for Mario Kart 8.
10755080	10760760	There are going to be two DLC packs, and they're already pushing this shit in the game.
10760760	10764800	In the game, they show up on the freaking character select screen.
10764800	10770600	I gotta say, as much as Nintendo does DLC very well, the way they sell it is kind of
10770600	10771840	shameless.
10771840	10775840	The fact that it's right there in front of you in the game, and you just have to push
10775840	10778480	A to buy it or whatever.
10778480	10782480	But anyway, the stuff that's in it, one pack will be a Zelda themed pack.
10782480	10787840	There's going to be four Hyrule tracks, and four, I guess, retro tracks, I think.
10787840	10794400	And the characters will be Link, and I think it's Cat Peach, and then Tanooki Mario, I
10794400	10795840	believe are the racers.
10795840	10802800	But then get this, the second DLC that comes out in early 2015 is an Animal Crossing pack.
10802800	10809400	And you get the villager, and Isabelle.
10809400	10813920	And there's another Mario related character, I can't think of right now.
10813920	10817480	But then four Animal Crossing themed tracks.
10817480	10818480	I know, it's weird.
10818480	10820840	But didn't they have something that looked like F-Zero in there?
10820840	10825920	They did, I think somehow the blue racer, Captain Falcon's little racer from F-Zero
10825920	10827120	was going to be...
10827120	10831120	Or actually, I don't think the four tracks are all Zelda themed or all Animal Crossing
10831120	10834680	themed, because I swear to God in one of the screenshots, it looked like it was Mute City
10834680	10837000	or something was going to be one of the tracks.
10837000	10844120	Which, fuck you, cocks, for fucking teasing me like that.
10844120	10846840	I don't know, I don't know whether to love them or hate them.
10846840	10847840	Hate them.
10847840	10848840	Alright, I'll hate them.
10848840	10849840	Hey, I turned my back.
10849840	10853520	I think it's cool that they're having DLC for it, I think it's reasonably priced.
10853520	10857520	I wish it was coming out sooner, because it's just like taking a look.
10857520	10860320	I turned my back and the phone was lighting up, I want to get to it, but I want to read
10860320	10862200	this comment from MacDeft as well.
10862200	10865560	Isabelle is going to be my new favorite Carter, I agree, mine too.
10865560	10867800	Although right now it's all about Wendy Okupa, it's a close call.
10867800	10869800	Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio, who's this?
10869800	10870800	Hey guys, it's Jason.
10870800	10871800	Jason, how you doing buddy?
10871800	10872800	Pretty good.
10872800	10877920	I just wish that my train that was supposed to be here ten minutes after the show started
10877920	10878920	was here.
10878920	10879920	Oh my gosh.
10879920	10880920	Yeah.
10880920	10881920	Oh no.
10881920	10882920	Yeah.
10882920	10883920	It's been quite a night.
10883920	10884920	It's fine.
10884920	10889960	I was going to get in in the mid-afternoon, get into Chicago in the mid-afternoon tomorrow,
10889960	10893200	and this delay means I'll get there right around the time I have to be anyways, so you
10893200	10894600	know, no big deal.
10894640	10896640	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
10896640	10897640	We miss you here in California, buddy.
10897640	10900800	I wanted to expand a little bit on the tweet, and there was something that Loki was talking
10900800	10902400	about earlier that's actually relevant.
10902400	10908360	Not only do I own Titanfall three times, but I also own the, holy hell, what's it called,
10908360	10914200	season pass for both the 360 and the Xbox One as well, and I was so, so, so close to
10914200	10919560	buying it on the PC as well, but I figured that'd be mildly excessive, and I'd play it
10919560	10921760	not at all, so I didn't.
10922760	10928080	Well, did somebody just break a dish there in the background?
10928080	10932080	No, I'm walking around on the platform, it's the garbage being chucked out behind me.
10932080	10933080	Okay.
10933080	10936320	So wait, so wait, why all the copies of Titanfall?
10936320	10942800	I bought it on the 360, so as I've mentioned on the show before, work has Xbox Ones, which
10942800	10947280	exposed me to Titanfall in the first place, and I got super addicted to it.
10947280	10949880	I got home and I bought it, naturally.
10949920	10954280	And then after I went back out to San Francisco and continued playing even more there, I finally
10954280	10959320	decided to take the leap to get an Xbox One, so I did, and that answers the second question
10959320	10961240	of why the second copy.
10961240	10967640	The limited edition was just because the two-scale, like, what, three-foot high Titan figure is
10967640	10971920	kind of gorgeous, actually, so much so that I don't even want to take it out of its box
10971920	10972920	and haven't.
10972920	10973920	So, you know.
10973920	10976640	Well, I guess that's fair, I guess you got a little something extra with that collector's
10976640	10977640	edition.
10977680	10981440	Yeah, that was very explicitly sought out because I'm very much looking forward to this
10981440	10986840	game and what they continue to do with it, and I'm just having a lot of fun with it,
10986840	10990080	so much so that I haven't paid any attention to Destiny, and I'm pretty sure all of the
10990080	10993840	multiplayer matches on Titanfall are just going to kind of, like, disappear on Tuesday.
10993840	10996800	Nah, they won't disappear, because there's going to be some people that aren't going
10996800	11001600	to be able to drop the 60 bucks right away on, you know, Destiny or whatever.
11001600	11005600	And so the thing I was going to, I was saying that was mentioned earlier in the show, was
11005600	11011160	that it would not have been a big deal, this sounds so foolish for me to hear myself say
11011160	11015680	it, and it always has whenever I have this conversation, the thing that's ridiculous,
11015680	11019800	the reason why I bought the Xbox One for Titanfall, despite already having another 360, is because
11019800	11026600	my Xbox One pilot was leveled three times higher than my pilot on the 360.
11026600	11029960	And those, even just those, like, I wouldn't be torn up if I couldn't play against Xbox
11029960	11033600	One players and multiplayer, but the fact that the pilot stats don't transfer between
11033600	11036000	both systems is completely absurd to me.
11036000	11040920	That sucks, and you know what, all that stuff doesn't really transfer in Mass Effect either.
11040920	11044880	Your Galaxy rating does, but that's about it, but yeah, I hear you, I like it way better
11044880	11047440	when there's, like, a cloud save or something like that.
11047440	11051760	Real quick, I wanted to say about Titanfall and the multiplayer matches, PC you shouldn't
11051760	11054360	see affected too much, because Destiny's not coming out on PC.
11054360	11059960	A lot of people forget that that's, for some reason, Bungie, Activision not deciding to
11059960	11064120	release there, which I thought might have been, like, maybe a piracy thing, like, they
11064120	11068200	were just afraid the game would get pirated to hell, but because it's so online-enabled,
11068200	11072440	that would be a hard thing to do, so I'm kind of curious why they are omitting PC.
11072440	11077000	I guess it's got to be a keyboard and mouse versus controller thing, I don't know, maybe
11077000	11078640	it'll be later, I don't know.
11078640	11082080	Yeah, I mean, Grand Theft Auto, has Grand Theft Auto V actually hit PC yet?
11082080	11083480	I know that was super delayed.
11083480	11086680	No, and we actually talked about that way at the top of the show, a little bit, a little
11086680	11090720	bit, just because, like, you know, we know that the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions
11090720	11093760	are supposed to come out some, at some point, so.
11093760	11097320	Yeah, it's, it's very interesting, all of these shifts that are happening, and the fact
11097320	11098320	that...
11098320	11101560	You still there, buddy?
11101560	11103160	Jason, you just dropped.
11103160	11107640	You know, the, the, we had such staying power when the, yes, yeah, that happens.
11107640	11111920	Okay, yeah, sorry, your audio, your audio's cutting out, buddy, I'm gonna let you go.
11111920	11113840	I think you just hung up.
11113840	11115840	All right, bye buddy, if you can hear me.
11115880	11119360	All right, always appreciate having Jason calling to the show.
11119360	11121280	DarkStalker, you're, you're heading out of here, right?
11121280	11122280	Yeah, I got work.
11122280	11124720	Okay, so, final thought.
11124720	11125720	I got work.
11125720	11126720	All right, bye.
11126720	11127720	Bye.
11127720	11131480	All right, actually, we are gonna start to wrap things up here in studio, because when
11131480	11136320	you have a call with tech problems, that usually says, end the damn show already, and we are
11136320	11139880	running a little late tonight, it's almost 930 here on the West Coast, but hey, that's
11139880	11141880	what happens after a week off at OLR.
11141880	11145160	I wanna thank all you guys for listening to the show tonight, downloading the show, checking
11145160	11148360	it out, or listening live, however you're participating, thank you for being a part
11148360	11149360	of our family here.
11149360	11153160	Again, I wanna encourage you, if you liked what you heard here at OLR, please help us
11153160	11156040	spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.
11156040	11163040	I met some folks at DragonCon, actually, and one came up and introduced himself, and the
11163040	11166400	other said that my friend got me into listening to the show, and I said, oh, well, then a
11166400	11170680	gold star for your friend, because he did what we asked, so I really appreciate that.
11170680	11173980	Tell a friend or two or five about our show, help spread the word about Orange on its Radio,
11173980	11179620	we really, really appreciate it, and yeah, we'll keep doing what we do.
11179620	11186200	Next week, we will be back here, live in studio, Jonas and Diego will be back next week.
11186200	11191640	They were here about a month ago, talking about the teabaggers, which, yes, is a thing,
11191640	11193640	the big anime game room.
11193640	11197340	They had SAC Anime happen, since Dark Soccer didn't make it to SAC Anime, we're gonna hear
11197340	11201460	about that whole thing from them and how that went, and what's next on their agenda, I don't
11201460	11204740	know what con they're doing next, but it'll be fun to have them back, and we'll talk to
11204740	11206140	them about what they're playing.
11206140	11210300	Destiny's out next week, whole lot of talk gonna happen about that, at least for me,
11210300	11212980	I don't know about my co-hosts, but I know I'm gonna be playing an awful lot of that
11212980	11213980	next week.
11213980	11214980	We'll see if I buy it or not.
11214980	11215980	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
11215980	11218820	Well, meanwhile, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11218820	11220540	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11220540	11225940	Working more on my game this week, and so, hopefully, I wish I get some progress, it
11225940	11229820	seems like every time I get somewhere, it's like, ah, crap, gotta redo that again.
11229820	11236420	So I'm hoping, now that I kind of, while sitting during the show, I was kind of outlining
11236420	11242380	what I need to do for rotating stuff, and it looks easy enough, so I'll write that up
11242380	11248980	tonight and test it, and hopefully it works, and if it all works, then the next thing I
11248980	11255340	need to do is add into my editor stuff to do level creation, because right now it's
11255340	11260580	kind of catered towards building, like, parts, and not, if I were to build a level with it,
11260580	11264380	it'd take fucking forever, so I gotta fix that.
11264380	11269620	Alright, and my final thought is, building on something I said earlier, respect.
11269620	11275500	If we all had a little bit more of it, I think, things would not be so fucking dramatic sometimes,
11275500	11278220	so think about that for a little bit.
11278220	11281820	But I know most of you guys that listen to this show all have a pretty good mindset and
11281820	11285260	are all very respectful, and for that, I appreciate you guys for keeping our family
11285260	11287940	strong here at Orange Lounge Radio and The Voice of Geeks Network.
11287940	11293340	Thank you guys again for another great week here of OLR, we will see you in seven days,
11293340	11297820	until then, happy gaming, and I have my fingers in my toes crossed that Destiny will actually
11297820	11301700	work on Tuesday for all you guys, but if it doesn't, that's okay, I'll just level more
11301700	11302700	in Diablo 3.
11302700	11303700	Good night.
