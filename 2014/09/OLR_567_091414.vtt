Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, rumors swirl of a possible acquisition of Minecraft developer Mojang as controversy unfolds involving the author of the mod Craftbucket.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
License and ownership accusations lie, as do fraudulent police reports.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
The story goes much deeper than this, and we'll explain more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 14th, 2014 with episode number 567 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
You numerology fans will be very happy with that tonight. 567 of our show.

00:49.000 --> 01:00.000
This is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all you guys listening live and via the podcast, as well as my co-hosts here in studio.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
First off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Sup bitches?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hey Jamie, how you doing?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm okay.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Today on VOGnetwork.com, you posted a review of Hatoful Boyfriend.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I posted a very basic preliminary review.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I see.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
Because as I told you offline, the game is more fucked up than you get just through the first story line.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Gotcha. How was it? I mean obviously-

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Pudding!

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We want people to go read the review, but overall-

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Pudding.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
So it sounds like you're going to play more of it.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh yeah, I'm actually going to be livestreaming it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I was livestreaming my first playthrough.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I actually got the death ending first.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And then, well most of the endings are-

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm sorry, no spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh my god, you killed the damn bird? That's upsetting.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
No! I got killed by the damn birds.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
The birds kill you? Is this a Hitchcock film? What a fucked up game is this?

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
If you don't pay the birds enough attention, then the secret bird society come and kills you.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
My god, is my cat going to kill me? Is that why my cat's been trying to wake me up more and more at 4.30 in the morning?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
No, that's because cats are assholes.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Also joining us in studio, say hello to tech master Loki.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I second that.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Are you Loki?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Cats are assholes.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Hey, by the way, Loki, happy birthday from all of us here at OLR.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Happy birthdays.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Thank you.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You haven't told us what you want.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Loki had a birthday this week. He wants world peace and a new pair of glasses.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, fuck world peace.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
What, two billion dollars?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Okay, what would you reasonably like?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
A new pair of glasses, apparently.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I don't know. I don't know what I want.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Loki, what's up with- so you joined the glasses society this week?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm just wearing them to get used to them. I really don't need them.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Really?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't. I actively, literally take them off right now and be just fine.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You're probably like me. Like, I have glasses, but I-

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I just think I look cooler with glasses on.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, me too.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
So I wear them.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Me too. I look smarter.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I wear glasses all the time because I need them.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I look older though, so that's the only problem.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
You guys look like blurs.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
My big thing is night driving. Like, driving at night, it's better if I have glasses on.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Like, I'm not being unsafe by doing it without, but, you know, instead of-

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Instead of, I see a red blob that looks like a stop sign, I can actually see clear-

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Hey kids! Look forward to this when you're over 35!

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, here's the thing, it's like, I don't really notice a difference wearing them.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
It's not like, oh hey, that's a lot more clear. It's actually the same, except now, like, if I look far away, it's like, really annoying.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't know. It's like, I can't- like, I can't read any of that text. Let's see.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, my eyes, see, they're blurry because I'm going-

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Can't hear you, Lucky. Mic.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Sorry. They're going back and forth between-

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Why is my mic not working?

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
Anyways, between, like, focusing with and without glasses, so I can't really tell, but, I mean, it looks about the same.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
If there's any improvements, like, super small-

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Alright, well good to know you spent hundreds of dollars on those glasses.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I didn't spend any money on it. My insurance spent money on it.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Okay, that's good. That's good. Show them that.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright, so, how did you spend the birthday? Did you have a good birthday?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Um, I just stayed home and did nothing.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Gotcha. Well, you know, that's what I've been doing in my 30s.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
It's pretty much just, like, any night. We took care of the kids, that was about it.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
How, let's see, you would be 32 this year?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Four.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
34? My god, why did I think you were way younger?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
34.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You're officially mid-30s. Welcome.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
I can't wait till you guys get 37, so I can say it in a row. Like everyone did to me all last year.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yesterday, my sister had her wedding, so I went to that.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
That's right.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Did all that fun stuff.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
There you go.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yep.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Alright, and your sister actually married, like, one of your best friends, right?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, she married my best man at my wedding.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Wow.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
That's neat.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
So, yeah, it worked out. And then, um, what else did I do this week? Yeah, that's pretty much it.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Had he caught the garter at your wedding?

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
No, no, the people that caught the garter in the bouquet at my wedding were actually my two cousins that were brother and sister.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
So they had to dance with each other, which is kind of funny.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
No, but, um, it was kind of cool, though, because I got to see one of my cousins who I haven't seen in, like,

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
God, when I saw him, he was like eight last time, so now he's all grown up and stuff.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
You know, I haven't seen most of my cousins since they were little, so I got to see them.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And, um, yeah.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
I think my cousin actually did catch the bouquet again, but she's getting married, so it's, you know.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
You know what garter I caught, whose wedding I caught the garter at, was Mel B.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
For those of you DDR people back in the day, when Mel and Mel got married, I caught the garter.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
So, hasn't worked yet, but, you know.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
No, it was good times, good times.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
Anyway, we're going to be talking about games with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Again, that's the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And folks in our chat talking about age.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Kaijuto in chat starting us off tonight saying,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Thirty-four, that's like the Atari 2600 demo.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Maybe I should have did a different song for the cookie today.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I am, well, I think we have people of all ages really listen to our show.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I know people in their 40s that listen to OLR and have a good time with it.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I know people, we'll get emails.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Well, actually, I met a listener not that long ago.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It was like, yeah, I used to listen to you guys in high school.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And now I'm in my mid-20s.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Two of my coworkers listen to us in high school.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Is that awkward at all?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
One of them's true.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, okay. Well, that's, yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Drew and Jay.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Oh, okay.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
No, thankfully, nobody at my work, I don't think, listens to OLR.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I think one person did once and then probably-

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
They won't make that mistake again.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
They won't make that mistake again, that's for sure.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I may actually have some of my coworkers from Locat listening tonight, so.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, howdy and hello to all of you that might be listening.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Hey, I'm famous.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Or something.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm famous on the internet. What does that get me?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Can I get a raise?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I am not pushing my luck.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Let's see.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So, yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Kossin in our chat room says, I'm not the oldest one in the room.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I went to the movies today and didn't get carded.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
That happens to me a lot. I don't get carded for booze or bars anymore.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
They stopped carding me at the bars.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, Rob.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I know. That's done.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
You know what's funny? I'm older than you.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I know.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And I got carded for my bottle of Beaujolais last week.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, but, you know, you don't have a beard and thinning hair.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
No, I just have an alley on my chin.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Aww.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I fell.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Isn't that a big lie that you think you're supposed to be done with acne after your teens?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
It wasn't acne this time.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
No.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
This was me falling and scraping my chin on the wall.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Ouch.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
On the wall texture.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I've fallen and I can't get up.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Was it cat related? Because that's a cat move right there, you know?

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
It's like, seriously, you're just walking through the hallway, minding your own business, and they dart out of the corner.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Excuse me while I run to the next room for no reason because I'm batshit insane and an asshole.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, just like this morning.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
No, that wasn't cat related. It was holding laundry related.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
Hey, 5.30, everybody's asleep. This never happens at 5.30. I won't wake everybody up because I'm an asshole.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
That's what Sanrio's resorted to doing lately is it's like, hey, it's 4.30 in the morning. Let's jump up on daddy's bed.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
We've actually started locking Midna out of the bedroom at night.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Because apparently she's like, starts pawing at Dan's face and getting cat hair in his eyes.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
She's like, daddy, mama's making that noise again. Get up and feed me, daddy.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Alright, look, we could talk about cats all night long. In fact, as somebody said earlier, Fifth Dream in our chatroom said,

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
cat-iful, boyfriend. Maybe that'll be the sequel.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But we want to talk about games. And for our kickoff topic tonight, by the way, later in the show,

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
joining us later around the 7 o'clock hour, Jonas and Diego are going to be back tonight from T-Banger,

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
which if you were listening a couple weeks ago, the big anime game room, T-B-A-G-R, the big anime game room.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
They're going to be back tonight. I want to talk to them about SacAnime, Dreamcast Birthday,

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
and whatever else they might have on their mind. They might have some upcoming appearances to plug as well.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Is YowieCon coming up? They're probably doing that.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Probably.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's happening. And GamerX3.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
YowieCon's always been in October, I think.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
GamerX3 is going to happen next year, and I'm sure they're going to come back for that.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm assuming the Kickstarter is going to be a success. If you don't know about the GamerX3 Kickstarter,

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
they're very, very close to their goal, so if you want to get your tickets for cheap, you should go.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
And actually, I can say this on the show, myself, on behalf of VOG Network, kicked out the money,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
so VOG is actually going to be a sponsor of GamerX3.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So we will be there with the table, and very cool.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And just announced Jennifer Hale is going to be one of their guests.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
The voice of FemShep, and what? She's what?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Leah in Diablo. She's in lots and lots of games.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And she's Ms. Marvel.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
And she's Ms. Marvel.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
So anyway, that's very exciting stuff to look forward to.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So we'll talk to them about conventions later on the show.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
We will get into our gaming weeks here, but I always like to do a little bit of a kickoff.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Unfortunately, my co-hosts haven't played this yet this week, so I don't know how much of this we can talk about,

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
but I want to talk about the big anticipation for Super Smash Bros.,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
which, I got to admit, the worst titles in the franchise ever,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
because it looks like they are really going with Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and for Wii U.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Did they lay off the person that comes up with titles for anything, like for Nintendo a while back?

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Because seriously, it's like, yeah, we're going to call that the new 3DS.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah, we're just going to call that Smash Bros. for Wii U, because, you know...

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
I guess it's one of those things where, I mean, it is what it is.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Nintendo is delivering what they want.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
They want Smash Bros. on Wii U.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So here it is. Smash Bros. for Wii U.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Like, at least it is what it is.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
It's not some crazy name like Wii U as a system, I don't know.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But anyway, I digress.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
So, I'm sure you guys have all heard, if you're listening to this show,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
it's all over Twitter and all over Facebook and all that,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
but for whatever reason you missed the boat on this,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Smash Bros. has a demo for the 3DS version coming out this Friday.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
There's going to be a demo playable for everybody to check out this Friday,

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
but Nintendo sent out emails to folks that were Platinum members

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
between certain dates of Club Nintendo for a period of time in about the past year

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
who get their email things,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and Nintendo just basically said,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
hey, we thought you'd want a sneak peek at the Smash demo, so here it is.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And here are three...

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
So it was four codes all together because Smash Bros. is a four-player game, right?

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
So here's four codes for you and some friends to enjoy Smash Bros. on 3DS,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
the demo, one week early.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
It's the Google effect where it's an invite-only thing

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and now everybody's got to have it.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
It was something that the fans are crazy over, like Smash Bros.,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
because we all know Nintendo's got some hardcore fans, right?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Hardcore fans.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And then when you talk about Smash Bros. on Nintendo,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
they love their Smash Bros., right?

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
So people are foaming at the mouths insane for copies of this demo one week early.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Especially since the Japanese version's already out

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and all the rosters have already been leaked.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Right. Well, and there's another certain level of insanity

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
where you already own the Japanese 3DS and you just imported it from Japan.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm looking at you, my pal Captain Spike from GamePooey.org,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
but that's why we love you.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
There's that level of foaming at the mouth crazy.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I did that for Brawl, so whatever.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
All right, fair enough. We've all been there,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
and I did it for BeatMania 2DX back in the day.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
So some of us that have been able to do that in the past, we've all been there.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
But then there's that next level where it's like, I've got to have this now.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
And people are selling codes on eBay for 20, 30 bucks on eBay.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
People are scouting Twitter up and down.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And if you even say Smash Code on Twitter, people are like,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
got any extra, bro? Hey, bro, got any extra? Hey, got some extra Smash?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I mean, it's insane how people will jump on that.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
They just need to hit, man. They just need a little bit.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, and here's the thing. I was fully prepared to wait a week to play the demo

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
because I'm like, sure, I want to check it out.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
But I'm like, I'm not going to pay 20 bucks to download the code.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
And to be fair, I'm not a platinum, foaming Nintendo member.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
If I have to wait, okay.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
But then I saw one of our listeners, ActDeft, wrote a tweet,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and he was like, yay, I got my email.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And I just thought, I'll just try asking.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
So I want to get in before the other guys, the Twitter brigade,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
hits him up and tries to get all his codes.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
So I just said, hi, I don't have a code. Do you have any extras?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And he said, sure. So thank you, ActDeft.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
He gave me a code, and I was able to check out the demo.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
So that was very nice of him to do that.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I felt bad, though, for Shane because another listener contacted me

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
the next day and was like, hey, Rob, did you get into the Smash demo

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
because I have an extra code?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
And I said, you know, I didn't get in, but I know Shane is dying to get in

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
because Shane was playing my 3DS, and I knew he wanted to get his own

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
so we could play against each other.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
So this guy just tweeted Shane a code.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
He didn't use direct message, though,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
because probably Shane wasn't following him at the time or whatever,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
so he couldn't send a direct message, so he just tweeted Shane the code.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, you can guess what happened in the hour that it took Shane

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to get home from work and see that he had a code.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Somebody stole it, which, you know, I...

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
It's not selling if you put it on your front porch and say, get it.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, no, and to be fair, you know, but it sucks that the listener

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
had every good intention and probably had no idea that everybody

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
would see the code or whatever.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
It just kind of sucks that people take advantage of that situation.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I mean, I understand it's like, well, you should have waited in DM,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
but at the same time, you know, somebody's trying to do a good thing,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
and somebody took advantage of that, and that's really poopy, so...

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
But thank you to everybody.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You can't trust humans.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I know, it sucks, and it sucks, but anyway,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
big thanks to everybody that's offered to help out with the Smash demo.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I really appreciate that.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Maybe if you're in chat right now at live.vognetwork.com

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
and you happen to have an extra code or two,

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm sure some listeners would be very, very thankful.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
The one thing that this early demo does have versus the Friday demo

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
is apparently the one that came out early has unlimited uses,

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
and the one that's going to come out Friday has only 30 uses,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
like a lot of the Nintendo demos do,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
which I never really understood the point of that,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
but at the same time, I don't think I've ever played a demo past like maybe 25.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I think Bravely Default I got down to 25.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I think I had to play it five times before I beat it, you know, or...

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Oh, Saints Row I must have played until the game came out.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Right, right.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
So what do you guys think about what Nintendo's doing with that

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
to kind of drive the anticipation?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I'll talk about my thoughts on the demo real quick.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Oh, by the way, if you didn't already know, the demo has five playable characters,

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Mario, Link, Mega Man, the Villager from Animal Crossing, and Pikachu,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
and only one stage, so that's essentially the demo.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
None of the other side modes are in there or anything like that,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
but it's enough to give you a taste,

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
and for me, it was very much about seeing how Smash Bros. runs on a 3DS,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
because I have to admit, I'm kind of like,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't know if I'm going to get Smash Bros. on the 3DS,

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
because that's a game you play on the TV with all the zoom-ins and outs and all that stuff.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know if I'm going to really get it on the 3DS,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
but at least the demo was able to help me see if I would get it,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
and I'm using my quotey fingers, get it or not.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
But quickly, before I get to my thoughts on the demo,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
you guys and your thoughts about how Nintendo is doing this.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Is this a good thing for them to build buzz?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Is it a little ridiculous? What do you think?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I mean, it's a good thing, I guess.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
There was already a lot of buzz as it was just because of all the leaked rosters and everything.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It just gets people excited about it.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
But at the same time, though, demos aren't necessarily a good thing,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
and so there are a lot of people that may have picked it up at one time just to pick it up,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
and then they play it, and they're like,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
you know what, it doesn't really look that good on the 3DS.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm just going to buy it on the Wii U or something like that.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So they may lose a little bit of sales from that,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
but they'll gain a lot of buzz from it also.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah. Let's see, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Kaijuto in chat says, if you buy a code, you deserve to be ripped off.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, I wonder if that was a thing where people were selling fake codes.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yikes.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Dark Tetsuya said, you should see the Mario Kart 8 community I'm on on Facebook.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
This whole week you'd think it was a mislabeled Smash Brothers community.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
So yeah, and let's see, Bochikawa says, I'll just wait for the other demo,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
or wait for Wii U, probably the later.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
And S2100Matt says, I'm skeptical too, but I will end up getting it anyways.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm almost done with my 3DS games that I play on my commute.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
Again, those comments from live.vognetwork.com.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Jamie, any quick thoughts on how Nintendo's doing this?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Is this a good thing to build buzz,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
or is this kind of annoying when they build this super special secret club

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
type of thing for a week?

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
I think that it's a good way to encourage people to make Platinum level.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Other than that, honestly, it's been building the buzz.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
People are talking about it.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I think that's what their goal was.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
What the rest of the populace does isn't their concern at that point.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Right.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
It's interesting you talk about how it gives the value to the Platinum level

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
because I seem to remember that this year Nintendo got a lot of flak

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
because all of their rewards this year were digital only.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Remember that?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Their Platinum and Gold rewards were just virtual console games

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
like Wario, Game and Warrior, or whatever.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
A few other little games were available for Platinum and Gold.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Nintendo got razzed for that a little bit,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
but now we're finding that if you're a Platinum Nintendo person,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
maybe you're going to get access to shit like this.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Can you imagine what's going to happen next year

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
if the Platinum people get the Zelda demo early?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Maybe this is the start of something for Nintendo. Who knows?

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Even then, all of the people selling codes and this, that, and the other,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
at that point that stops being Nintendo's concern.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
The buzz is there. That's what they want.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Right. Exactly.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
All right, so let me talk about the demo itself real quick.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Again, I don't like to base my impressions of the game off the demo,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
but it is very ironic that just the day before this all happened,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I was kind of talking on Twitter, and I was getting into,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I don't know if you want to say it was a debate,

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
but just a discussion on why I wasn't really jazzed about Smash on 3DS,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
but why for other people it was a great thing.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
And in general, I have a hard time getting really thrilled about handhelds.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And it could have been worse than that Smash Bros thing.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
They could have totally went the route of, oh, yeah, you can go get the demo.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
You have to beam it to your 3DS. You got to go visit the GameStop to do that.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Bite your tongue. Bite your tongue. Anyway, let me finish.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
No, that's fine.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
So I was kind of talking about how, you know, I'm not really big on handhelds,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
and I find that I only seem to play them ever if I'm on a plane for a few hours,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and I don't like having that tiny little screen.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I feel like you have more real estate on a big screen.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I don't really get the allure, quote, unquote, of handheld games.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But there were some other people that were talking back to me,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
and one of the comments that really resonated with me was from AkumaJP,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
and I don't, sorry, buddy, I forget exactly what you said,

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
but it got me thinking about how, like in Japan, handhelds are a way bigger thing.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Why? Because there's that total commute culture, so to speak.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Not that we don't have that here, but like in Japan,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
you also have like that big subway and public transit are really big,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
and a lot of people play games on that, so like 3DS makes a lot of sense.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
I thought you weren't allowed to use electronics on the trains.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, maybe not. I don't know, but it got me thinking about like all that.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
It's probably the culture is probably more like, you know, friendly to the handhelds and so forth,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
and then like Captain Spike was talking about how he has this,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and I know he takes the Bay Area train into work all the time,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
and he probably has like an hour every day where he's able to play 3DS.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
That's not part of my lifestyle, so I see the 3DS as, you know,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
it's like the mini screen to play things on, because when I get home from work,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I plop on the couch and I want to play something on the TV,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
so that's why I don't get as excited about handheld games.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
But anyway, so there's no right or wrong.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
I think it's just your perception based on your lifestyle, what kind of speaks to you.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
So anyway, I was a little concerned about Smash on 3DS because, you know,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
the game has a tendency to zoom in and out. It's fast paced.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Was it going to be too blurry? Was it going to be too hard to see?

21:27.000 --> 21:35.000
And the answer is a little bit for me, but not game ruining bad, if that makes sense.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Keep in mind, I'm playing on an XL.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
If I had a regular 3DS, and I know Bobby talked about this on his show tonight,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
he had some frustrations playing on a regular 3DS,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
I could see where that's going to be pretty hard to do,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
especially when you get into those four player matches and the screen zooms all the way out.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That's going to be really rough.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Did you mess with the outline options or whatever in there?

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
Not really. I didn't really tinker with the... I don't even know if that was an option, so to speak, to play with.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I didn't even really get in there and play with that.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, you can adjust them.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Can you? Well, you know, and that's probably help.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
But, you know, I didn't dislike it at all.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
In fact, you know, it was Smash Brothers. It was enjoyable enough.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
It's kind of, you know, what I remember.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I'm way more into the series than I do.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I can probably speak more as to, you know, the subtle differences and everything,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
but I just know I had a lot of fun playing as Mega Man,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
because I've gotten to play a Mega Man game that wasn't like a virtual console

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
or revisit of an old game in a very long time.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
So getting to play as Mega Man in the demo was an awful lot of fun.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
So that was pretty cool to me.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
And, you know, I was able to win a couple matches and get a feel for the game

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
that it will probably be worth buying on 3DS.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
It really depends on how long the wait is between 3DS and Wii U,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
because they still haven't announced the date for Wii U, right?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Even though...

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
21st November.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Is that official or is that still the rumor based on the Fred Meyer leak?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It's been...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It's going to be the 21st of November, I'm sure.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I don't doubt that. That's literally the last Friday before Black Friday, right?

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
Well, that's when they have, was it, the new 3DS Pokemon games,

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I guess, coming out as well.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
So it's going to probably be around that time.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Just like even, like, grant the thought of the rumor was it was going to be coming out on the 18th

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and it finally came out on the 18th, so...

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
So whether I get the game or not I think is really going to depend on

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
do all my friends get it too?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Do I have people to play with?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Is that hype thing going to be there?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Is there going to be functionality with the 3DS and the Wii U

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
that makes me want to buy the 3DS version?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Yes, I've heard about the controller, right?

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Which, by the way, on an earlier show didn't I tinfoil hat and say

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
the 3DS could be a Wii U controller someday.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
So...

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
But anyway.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
You know why the 3DS is a Wii U controller actually makes a lot of sense?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Because what other controllers are there?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
There's the Pro Controller, right?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But how many people have actually run out and bought those?

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Or you get those little Wiimotes from the old Nintendo Wii

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
that don't really have very many buttons.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
So the 3DS makes a very obvious, easy, portable controller.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Not everybody may like the way it feels, but it gives you the buttons

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and the D-pad and everything that you need.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So it makes a lot of sense to me.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
But anyway.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
So that's ultimately going to be what I base it on.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't feel like I have to have Smash on the 3DS

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
knowing that the Wii U version is imminent.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
But I'll probably get it.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
It'll just kind of depend on a few other factors.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
All right.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
ActDef says, whether on 3DS or Wii U, Smash is going to be the game of these holidays.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Let's see.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Kaijuto says they should have given me a demo.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm an ambassador, dammit.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Let's see.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
AkumaJP says you can do what you want on trains.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
So apparently it's fine to play 3DS and all that stuff on the trains there.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Maybe I was just thinking more of the tucking on cell phones.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Perhaps.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And 5th Dream says you can't talk out loud on a phone on trains.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
That's how I understood it anyway.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Maybe that's that.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And SH200Matt says I can see that.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I mean, I commute three hours a day to and from work.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I need to pass the time by playing a game or watching something on the trains

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
when I'm not sleeping, of course.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And my commute to work is 20 minutes in my car.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
So I can't exactly.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I like to listen to the radio.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I can't play games or anything like that.

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
So, yeah, I guess it's very dependent, I guess, on how you do your day and your culture.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, I'm sure everybody else is going to be looking forward to that Smash demo on Friday,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
those that aren't in yet.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
And lots of people are going to be giving their impressions.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
So I'm curious what you guys think throughout the week.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You can always send us an e-mail with your thoughts if you want.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Participate at orangelandradio.com.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
and what other video games we have been playing this week

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
besides some of the things we've brought up in the show already.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
I dated birds.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
We already talked about that.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Yeah, I've played Hot to Fool Boyfriend.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I've played a little bit of Mass Effect 3.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I've played some Final Fantasy XIV today.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
This week has really been a lot of adjusting to my new work schedule

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
because now I work four days, ten hours.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
So most of this morning was spent sleeping.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
But, yeah, I'm actually going to be making it a point

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
to play more stuff that's on my list.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So Hot to Fool Boyfriend is every Tuesday.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm livestreaming it at twitch.tv forward slash dark sakura underscore olr.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
And I'll probably be throwing in some other games too,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
but I'm working now on my dailies for Final Fantasy XIV

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
and going to be getting back into Bravely Defart.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Good times.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I played nothing.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Again? Because you've been programming.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
You've been playing your own game of secrets.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I haven't really been playing my own game,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
but yeah, I've been programming my own game.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I had to rewrite my whole...

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
It's pretty much the whole way that everything's drawn in the game.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So I finished that this week.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And I just now...

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
The only thing I've left to do is rebuild my user interface for my editor.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
So I'm not using the crappy old Unity user interface.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I'm actually going to use the nice ones.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
So I've got to have to look into doing that.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
There was a recommendation, because I watched this week

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
because my work's been really slow.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
In fact, it's going to become pretty much non-existent at the end of this week

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
because they're going to shut off our current system.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
And so at that point, I will have literally nothing to do.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Look for a new job, I guess.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Well, yeah. So I've been at work.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Hey, if anyone's hiring.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, exactly. Anyone's hiring, yeah.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So I've been just...

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I watched some tutorial series.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
They had Microsoft's Virtual Academy crap.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
So they had some stuff talking about Unity

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
and talking about incorporating stuff into Microsoft Azure and that stuff.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
So I was watching that, but they were showing the new user interface.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
They did it in a certain way where the canvas was really large

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
so that the units on there equaled one pixel and stuff.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
So I kind of want to set mine up like that, because that looked pretty cool

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
and made a lot of sense.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So I just have to figure that out.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Hopefully I'm getting close, because now that I've rewritten everything,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I think it's going to be efficient enough.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I mean, because, God, if this isn't efficient enough,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
then I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I don't know. I'll figure something out.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
I think I've gotten it to the point now where it's as efficient as it's going to be.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And so we'll just have to play with that.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
And yeah, so still shooting to have something playable soon, hopefully.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Nice.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
But that's about it.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah, I thought about getting Destiny, but I was just like,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
yeah, you know, I can spend the money now.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
But it would be on an Xbox version,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and I don't really want to get an Xbox One version,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
because God knows when I'm getting an Xbox One.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm probably going to get PlayStation 4 at some point.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
But I don't know.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I just didn't want to spend the money on it right now,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
because I don't have the time to play it.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Or at least I just don't want to spend the time playing it right now.

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
Although Grand Theft Auto coming out again right around the corner is like, uh-oh.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
That might get you, huh?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
All right.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Well, then let me start off my gaming week talking about one thing

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
that I played briefly this week between everything else.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I got my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U this week.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Thank you very much.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Thank you very much.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Stop rolling your eyes over there, young lady.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I did get my copy of Mass Effect 3 for the Wii U,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
so I played it just a little bit,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and I went right into multiplayer because I wanted to check out

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
how the multiplayer runs.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
My only complaint is that loading times are a real pain in the butt,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
but I seem to remember they were pretty bad on 360 as well,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
so I can't really haze it for that.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And in multiplayer, you don't get the maps on the game pad.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
You get the score, so you don't have to pause the game.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
But I did not realize that that whole voice chat thing

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
that's in, like, Mario Kart 8 is in Mass Effect.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I thought you had to have a separate headset in order to use voice chat.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
You don't. You can do talking through the Wii U game pad.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
So that was unexpected and kind of cool.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So, yeah.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Otherwise, yeah, I didn't play a whole lot of that.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I just put it in and played it for a little bit.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Is it in-game or just in lobbies?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
In-game.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Do they have that in-game in Mario Kart 8?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
No, only in the lobby.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
So, yeah, right?

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
There's this feature that doesn't seem to be in any other freaking game.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
It's so stupid.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
No, protect the kids! Protect them!

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Oh, come on!

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
They are on the internet, okay?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
They've already been exposed to everything already.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
It's just...

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
No, there's a big mic button on the thing so that you can push it and then talk.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
And it's like your push to talk is on the game pad.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
You know what?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I hate encouraging this kind of behavior,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
but I would totally be fine with them

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
enabling parental settings from the get-go

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
and paying 60 cents to unlock it

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
if all this bullshit would go away.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Like, if they just made the friend codes thing a lot easier,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
if they just allowed voice chat throughout the entire thing the entire time,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I think it's worth it for that sacrifice.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
Otherwise, with my week, I've been continuing on Diablo 3 in all different forms.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
PC, I have my hardcore character I'm playing on PC.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
I have a Crusader I'm playing on PC with a friend of mine.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Those are both seasonal characters, so I'm working through the 2.1 stuff with that.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And then I'm still playing on PS4.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I have my Barbarian.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
I was playing a little bit with Extifer one night this week.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
I think I'm up to, like, Paragon 30, I think, on my Barbarian.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And then I also have a hardcore Witch Doctor

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
because I'm trying to get the rest of those trophies.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
I really think I am going to take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
which might not happen this holiday with all the other games coming out,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
but I think eventually I will take Diablo 3 all the way to a Platinum Trophy.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
I don't think, maybe on a PSN game somewhere,

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
but I don't think I have a single Platinum Trophy on any PSN game,

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
but it's totally achievable for me with Diablo 3, so I think I'm going to do it.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Alright, but then the other big thing this week that's been eating up an awful lot of my time,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
as I'm sure many of you have had your time eaten up by this game,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
except, of course, Loki didn't play it,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
and I know Dar Sakura's not really interested in this title,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
but I know a lot of you guys out there have been checking out Destiny.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Destiny, of course, the hugely anticipated Bungie title that released on 9ix9ine,

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
the makers of Halo, which, you know, I'm not huge on first-person shooters,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
but I've always had a bit of a special place in my heart for Halo,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and I've told this story on the show before.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
I got introduced to Halo 1 at a wedding at the reception.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
The bride and groom decided they wanted to have a Halo land party for their wedding reception

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
because, you know, it was an awesome wedding like that.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So that's where I got introduced to Halo for the first time,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
and I loved playing the multiplayer. It was a lot of fun,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
and that rolled into playing Halo 2 with my buddies from college.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
So I've always had a good respect for the Halo series,

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
and I really enjoyed Halo 4 as well, which I talked about on the show when that came out,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
and that's probably what's going to finally make me get a freaking Xbox One,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
is this Halo collection or Halo 5 will probably finally do it

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
because I know 343 has got the series now and they're doing a good job with it,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
but I digress.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So Bungie's put out Destiny this week,

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
and it was not totally what I think we were expecting from the makers of Halo,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
but, you know, you could say that based on the beta,

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
and I talked before when I played the beta about how Destiny felt more influenced

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
by a game like Phantasy Star Online than it necessarily did a game like Halo,

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
and I still believe that to be true with the full release of the game.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
Let's talk about some of the good things about Destiny.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
I love the way that Destiny fosters a cooperative environment.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
You've heard the term mingle player out there apply to this game,

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
and I think that that is actually a really neat thing.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't think there's a whole lot of use out of random people on the planet while you're there.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Once in a great while, you might find that you're fighting the same pack of mobs,

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
so you inadvertently help each other, and that's, I guess, kind of cool,

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
but I like way more how, oh, everybody's playing Destiny this week,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
and let's say Bobby sees that I'm online, which happened this week.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Bobby sees that I'm online playing, doing missions on the moon,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
so he just presses a couple buttons, joins my fire team,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
warps to where I am on the moon, and now we're doing missions together,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
and that's kind of fun because we didn't have to set that up,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
and I know there's a lot of co-op games out there,

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
but you have to kind of set that up and, oh, we're going to play co-op in such and such time.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
The environment of Destiny is very drop-in, drop-out, and that's really cool,

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
and I like what they've done for adventuring in that way.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
I love that as somebody who's not very good at first-person shooters,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I can out-level things.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
I can take things at my own pace by doing these open-world missions on Earth

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
or on the moon or on Venus or whatever

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
and level myself to a point where then I can go back and play the story content,

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
and it's not as difficult because some of the story content does get pretty difficult,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
and I don't know if I would be able to beat it

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
if I was necessarily at the same level that you're supposed to be.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
So there is no difficulty scale in Destiny,

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
but it's okay because you can sort of create your own destiny

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
with the difficulty in regards to how much are you willing to go back and grind and some of that.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
The music in Destiny is phenomenal,

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
which always makes that more surprising that the guy was let go from Bungie,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
which we had that story a few months ago,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
but neither here nor there.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
The music in Destiny is fantastic,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
very good at setting the ambiance and building the tension

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
when you get into these moments when the enemies just show up,

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
and it's not like a metal gear alarm goes off.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
The music really builds naturally and builds this anticipation.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
It's so well done, and even though I have caught similar bits being reused in places in the game,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
the music doesn't get repetitive at all,

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
which in most MMOs, I'm using my quotey fingers because I don't really consider Destiny an MMO,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
but in most MMOs, the music gets very repetitive.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
That doesn't feel the case in Destiny, so that's very good.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
And last but not least in the good column, graphics are fantastic,

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
and I'm playing on PS4, and I just got to the Venus level,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
and it's gorgeous, my god.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I could just sit there and walk around.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I was doing that on the moon. I was just walking around.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Where's another pretty cave I can go in and look at pretty purple things?

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
Because that was a lot of fun.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Let's talk about some of the not so good about Destiny,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
because I haven't read reviews out there.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
I don't usually read a lot of reviews on games unless my friends write them.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
But my understanding is the Metacritic for Destiny is not above 90,

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
which for a game of this magnitude of anticipation means it's an absolute colossal failure.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
I don't really mean that. It's just the impression I'm getting from Twitter.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
So I don't remember what the Metacritic is for this game right now.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
It's high 70s, low 80s, something like that, which is still good.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
And isn't 70 considered average? I don't know.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Is 50 considered average? I don't even know what the hell is considered average on Metacritic.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
But it sounds like it's still at least above average, and that's probably where I'd place Destiny 2.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I would not give this game an A+.

37:31.000 --> 37:38.000
In fact, I may review the game on VoG later once I've been able to complete my playthrough.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
But some of the things I can tell you that detract from the game a little bit.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
For a game this caliber with this much anticipation, with this much of a budget that's gone into it,

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
the story sucks. There's no easy way to say it.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
There's no nice sugar-coat-y way to say it.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
The story's really uninteresting.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
I don't really fucking care why I'm blowing up all these aliens.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
These cutscenes I'm forced to watch that I can't skip over that are really annoying.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
It just seems so generic. Ugh.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
It's really not until I got to Venus and this first cutscene on Venus where I finally met a character

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
where I was like, okay, now this character is at least borderline interesting.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
But it's so badly voice-acted, too.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
We've talked about this during the beta.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
The Peter Dinklage ghost character. Not a good character.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
And your own avatar, whatever you tend to play as, either a female or a male,

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
like human or Awoken or robot, dude or dudette, I don't remember what they're called.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
Sometimes your character talks like they're there.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
Sometimes your character is that MMO character that doesn't do the talk and everybody else talks around.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
It's so weird how your character is sometimes there and sometimes not, it seems like, in the way the story is told.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
So, yeah, not a good story.

38:59.000 --> 39:06.000
And for a game of this magnitude, especially coming from Bungie, I was really surprised and kind of disappointed.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
It's flat. I'm not interested.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Now, granted, I haven't beat it yet, so maybe it picks up a lot of steam,

39:12.000 --> 39:19.000
but it would still be a detractor that has taken this long to get interesting, if that's the case.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
One of the detractors of Phantasy Star Online plays into this game as well,

39:24.000 --> 39:31.000
is that you're killing the same things over and over and over again with the hope that some new loot will drop.

39:31.000 --> 39:38.000
And right in Phantasy Star Online, it was always the dudes with the claws and sometimes Arapi would come out in forest, right?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
You have to kill more, kill more, kill more.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Or the other of the lizard-y things.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yes, and the lizard-y things.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
And there's probably two or three different monster types on Earth and on the Moon.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
That variety is a little bit eh.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
They try to spice it up with this thing that reminds me of the fates in Final Fantasy XIV,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
where this big world event will suddenly happen.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
It doesn't happen very often, but for instance, one time I was on Earth doing patrol missions

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
and a giant spider boss showed up for everybody to kill.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And you would get stuff if you participated in that.

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
So that made it at least a little more interesting, but it is kind of a slog of the same stuff over and over.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
I get really excited when I see something new in the game. That helps out a lot.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
And the other big problem I have with the game, which again, coming from the makers of Halo,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
really surprises me that this is kind of a weak point of the game.

40:30.000 --> 40:41.000
PvP. It's gated, which means that you have to, if you want to play the PvP free-for-all deathmatch,

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
which was always my favorite thing to play in Halo, you have to play a 3v3 control map one time.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Win or lose, you must play that map.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
Then you must play a team deathmatch map.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Then you will unlock the free-for-all deathmatch.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
And by the way, you can't even get to the Crucible until you're like level 5 or 6 or something in the story.

41:01.000 --> 41:07.000
So if I want to buy Destiny and just hop in a brawl with my friends,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
where we're all going to just blow the fuck out of each other with rocket launchers,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
you can't do that in Destiny.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You have to wait until you get to a certain point.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
You're going to have to play to unlock it.

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
And then when you get there, I tried playing some of the PvP,

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
and it didn't really thrill me the way that playing Halo did for the first time or playing any of that did.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
It really feels like the sideshow.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
So if you're looking at Destiny for PvP, I kind of worry that you're going to be a little bit disappointed.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
Now I know that Bungie plans to do these events where they're going to roll out special maps for a weekend.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
But again, that seems really weird to me too.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
Why are you going to have that stuff only playable for like 3 days and then shut it off?

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
I mean, it's one thing to roll it out slowly or whatever, but why have something that's not going to be there again?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I don't know if I get the logic behind that.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
So PvP, not as fun as I was hoping.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
Alright, going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
It's literally the same fucking story as so many other things.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
We discovered alien technology and everything was awesome and we were in outer space being hella rad,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
but then aliens came and killed everybody and we're just trying to survive now.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Yep.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
BlackWolf in chat says,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
I don't blame Peter Dinklage, I blame his director.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
Me too. Unfortunately, the blame is going to ultimately fall on Peter Dinklage, whether it's his fault or not.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
That sucks, but I agree that the direction of the story in general, it's a problem.

42:39.000 --> 42:46.000
And it's so frustrating because on one hand, the audio is so good.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
The music is so good that the story components and the narration, the talking doesn't match.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
And it's a glaring issue.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I don't know how else to put it.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
I notice when these characters open their mouths, I'm just like, shut up, I want to hear the music.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
What you're saying is literally not important.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Let's see.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Tigerclaw says,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I heard how this game is much like Halo.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
The ghost character is basically the guilty spark from Halo.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Again, I think it's more Phantasy Star Online than Halo.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I stand by that.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Let's see.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
SSG100Matt says,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Sounds like a ton of hoops to jump through just to play PvP.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Yep.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
But there's a lot of people that don't give two shits about PvP,

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
so I can understand where that's like an asset to them, maybe.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
But for me, I was hoping to just play a little bit of it.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
But I'm glad that also one thing I noticed in PvP, I can't hear anybody.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And I don't know if that's just a PlayStation 4 thing,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
or if they just flat out turn the voice chat off in PvP.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
And I kind of hope that's the case, honestly,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
is that they just turn the damn voice chat off on PvP.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Dungeonbuster says,

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
I technically beat it, and then I'll just leave it at that.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Destiny will sometimes mix encounters up with specials, too.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Enemies with yellow names that are a bit tougher.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
And Dungeonbuster continues,

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
More stuff only opens up post level 20.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Economy is also gated limited.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
You can only earn so many Vanguard Crucible Marks currency per week,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and that's what's needed to buy legendary equipment

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
coupled with an appropriate faction rank.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
Yeah, that's where MMO is very much.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Blackwool says,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
Marty O'Donnell must have hated the voice acting, so he was fired.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Well, who knows? Who knows?

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
So anyway, that's my thoughts on Destiny.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
And yeah, there you have it.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
So we are going to get into some housekeeping,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
and then we're going to get into tonight's news.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And then I'm going to say hi to our guests tonight

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
who are just arriving here in studio.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm going to get them miked up here while we have Loki start off the news.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
First off, follow us on YouTube.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Our shows are posted to YouTube,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
where you can hear them on your 3DS or wherever you like.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
YouTube username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
You can also follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
Curious to see what you guys think about Destiny.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I'm going to try to beat the game,

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
so I feel armed enough to do a review for vognetwork.com later in the week.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And of course, should that happen,

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
you guys will be able to leave your response reviews there at vognetwork.com.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
Tigerclaw says, sounds like Destiny was destined to fail.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I'm going to leave it at this and then get into the news here.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I don't think Destiny is a failure by any means.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
In fact, I don't think it's a bad game.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
I think it's an above average game.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
There's a lot of great things to really like about Destiny.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
But is the game perfect?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Nope, and I just told you why.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
So, all right, let's get into some news.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Loki, start us off tonight.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
All right, so the big news this week was that,

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
well first off, it started off as a rumor that

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
Mojang was going to be purchased by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Now, apparently, it is going to be official.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
It's expected to be announced on Monday.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
And, yeah, so they're going to be merged with Microsoft.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
And so what exactly does this mean?

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
No idea yet, but the thought is that

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
Microsoft is using this acquisition as sort of a way to help

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
boost its presence in the PC and console market.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Which is kind of weird because PC-wise, I think they have

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
pretty much the lion's share of operating systems,

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
but maybe it'll convince people to buy stuff on the Windows Store?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
I don't know.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
But they're saying that they're going to try to use this to boost

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
the sales of Windows Phone and Surface tablets.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
I think even if Microsoft made Minecraft exclusively for Windows Phone,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
no one would still buy a Windows Phone.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
So I'm not really sure what they're thinking there.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Well, what the hell is Microsoft hoping to gain from something like this?

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Like, is Microsoft trying to just get the Minecraft IP?

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Is this what it boils down to?

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Because my understanding is Notch isn't coming with the deal.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
So, I mean, are they getting access to Scrolls,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
the new thing that Mojang's supposed to be working on?

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
Or is it just we want to have Minecraft 2 exclusive to our shit?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Is that what this all boils down to?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Maybe that's what it's all going to boil down to.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
But, I mean, it's like, shit, there's like so many Minecraft clones out there.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
It's like a dime a dozen.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
I'm sure, you know, where the platforms that this is not on,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
a new, you know, clone will rise up and take its place.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
I mean, hell, there's all these people that are behind like Spoutcraft

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and shit like that that have made all these mods.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
It's going to be very easy for them to come around and do like almost like

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
an in the groove, if you will, of Minecraft, you know,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
where it's going to be something that's sort of Minecraft,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
but not quite Minecraft.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
It's really weird to me, too, that didn't Notch take issue with the fact

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
that Facebook bought, I mean, this has to be said,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
that Facebook bought the Oculus Rift for $2 billion.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah, $2 billion changes your mind quite quickly.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
How did that song go?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Sell out with me tonight.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Sell out.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Everything's going to be all right.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Doo, doo, doo.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
90s? Anybody? 90s?

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
All right. Anyway.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
All right, look, I know there's some guys here that want to comment

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
on the Minecraft situation and talk about a lot of different things going on.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Joining us now in studio, welcome back to the show, Diego.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Hello.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
And Jonas.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Hello.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
From the TeaBaggers, or the Big Anime Game Room.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
You know I can't stop calling it the TeaBaggers, sorry.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The Big Anime Game Room.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
How's it going, you guys?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Great. How are you doing?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Good. How did SAC Anime go?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You guys took your rig over to SAC Anime, right?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, this is probably the busiest show we've ever done.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Is it really?

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yes, for SAC Anime.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
What were some of the hits that you guys had out on the floor

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that people were just like, oh, my God, we got to play this

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and keep playing this, can't get enough of it?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Well, I'd say like the biggest hit is when we did the Mario Kart 8 tournament

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
on the re-structured pre-registration when we made it into our main events hall,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
which turned out really spectacular.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
We filled up that entire room.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
It was amazing.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
There were so many people there.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
We got a big hype up with a lot of the people.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
People were having fun, a lot of cheers, a lot of good emotions and everything.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Nice, nice.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Well, this is probably the first chance a lot of people have

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
to kind of show off their skills in Mario Kart 8, too,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
since the game hasn't been out that long.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
So, awesome.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Well, look, I saw you guys, I suppose I saw Jonas was trying to put his hand up

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
while Loki was talking about Minecraft.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
So, what's your guys' take on this Minecraft possibly being sold to Microsoft tomorrow?

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
With the whole trend of people buying, kind of like what Facebook did with Oculus Rift,

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
I think a lot of these companies, just by the way, it's my opinion,

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
a lot of these companies are just trying to buy the IP so no one else will take it.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
It's kind of like what everyone was fighting with Twitch.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Interesting.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
So, it's more about, even though they're not going to pull Minecraft from PlayStation 4, necessarily,

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
if Microsoft were to buy it, Sony's not going to get anything else from Minecraft.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I don't know that's the case, but if you think about it,

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
I can see where if you buy the Oculus Rift, you're kind of investing in the Oculus,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and you know that that's going to bring revenue down the line

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
because this could be the future of entertainment, of gaming, of the internet, whatever.

49:55.000 --> 50:02.000
Same with Twitch. Obviously, a service like that is going to evolve into something.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
It could be very much like the next YouTube, whereas Minecraft, shit, that's a game.

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
I mean, look at even the big games like Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds and stuff on mobile.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
It blows me away how much those companies get bolstered up by that one breakaway title too.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Look at Zynga.

50:22.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, it's all this stuff. I mean, they have their height, and then eventually the interest kind of fades away.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
And I think, first off, discontinuing support for Bucket.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
I mean, yeah, they're going to continue developing internally, but it's not where it was before.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
That's got to hurt.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
And the fact that I'm sure it's going to continue on PC, but say the next Minecraft comes out and stuff,

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
I don't think people are going to... Minecraft is a good game, but I don't know if it's a system seller.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
I mean, people are excited about it, but it's just... I'm not going to buy the...

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
Isn't Minecraft on the 360 still continuously top 10 every month since the game was released?

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
That's true, yeah. It is a top title because it's cheap, and it's good for kids.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
It's a family-friendly title. It's cheap.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
There's not really anything that will dissuade you from playing it, I guess. I don't know.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I don't want my kids being around no creatures.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
I'm all for them, though, coming out with a new Minecraft tier that has enhanced visuals, but still has the voxel stuff on there.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
They can already do enhanced visuals in Minecraft.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
I know on PC they can do it with mods, but I would love to see that as the standard.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
They have to sell the mods they sell you, too. I bought the PlayStation 4 version,

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
and it's even in there where you can play with these skins, but you can't save your world.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
They have the new block skins and stuff like that.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
I think it also... I think iOS also has Minecraft if I crawl in Android, I think.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Pocket edition, yeah.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
Yeah, because I see my nephews and nieces play it a lot on the mobile devices,

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
so I think that's probably what Microsoft's trying to prevent people from doing.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
Take it away from iOS and Android users and put it straight to Windows Phone.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
That's my assumption.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Why would you take it out completely, though, of the iOS?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Well, they'll just come out with something.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
If Microsoft was going to be very territorial with it and just block sales of it,

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't think it's going to sell a lot of Windows Phones.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
People don't buy a phone, especially a terrible phone like Windows Phone.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I'm sorry, my wife has one. It's fucking terrible.

52:35.000 --> 52:42.000
They're not going to buy a phone that's terrible like that just to play Minecraft Pocket Edition.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I mean, you're fucking insane if you buy a phone for an app.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
That's like saying, oh, Angry Birds is exclusive to this phone.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Not Angry Birds, Flappy Birds is exclusive to this phone.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Are you really going to fucking buy a phone for that?

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
Bull's Advocate, you could say that there's probably some people that bought an iPhone for Siri.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
That's stupid.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
No, seriously, it's stupid.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I tried. All right.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Live.vognetwork.com says,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
And we all know how that relationship turned out in the end.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Now Bungie is giving all the secret stuff to Sony.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Here's hoping they learn from that and just leave Mojang alone.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Well, they could just purchase Mojang and it could just be Mojang,

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
and they'll make money from anything that they produce.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Two billion.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Go ahead, Jonas.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
That is true. Just buy the whole Mojang if they're going to do something like that.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Two billion just seems like so much money.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
I doubt that Scrolls is going to be as big as Minecraft was,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
and I don't even know what else they have in the pipeline,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
because obviously a lot of that stuff Notch is working on.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
I don't know. I just can't see this being a very smart purchase,

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
especially for that kind of money, but whatever.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
I guess they can license the shit out of it.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Maybe Windows 9 will have it as a default game.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
It'll just come prepackaged with like...

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
It's like the new Solitaire or Minesweeper.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
Dude, that would be... You want to talk about firing a torpedo into productivity, man.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
There you go.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Okay, over to our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The seg says,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Siri has a lot more day-to-day functions than any game.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I don't know, dude.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I've got to say this very tongue-in-cheek,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
but Minecraft is a way of life for some people.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
People have made millions off of Minecraft.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I'm talking all those freaking YouTube channels,

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
and people have careers out of Minecraft.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
It's crazy.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
But I don't know.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It's just... Wow, it's so huge.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Which, again, I go, but $2 billion for Minecraft,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
but then I remember, but yes,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
people are making all this money off Minecraft.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
Maybe Microsoft just wants to issue YouTube takedown claims

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and get the money off all those videos.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
That's what this is.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
That's what this is.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Microsoft wants all this because they don't have a network anymore,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
so Minecraft TV, 24-7 on the Xbox One.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I don't think they can do that because they've already had it

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
in their end-user license agreement that they're allowing them to do that.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I don't know if you can go back on that.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Maybe you can.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I don't know. $2 billion, you can do a lot.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Alright, moving on.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
That $2 billion will buy a lot.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
It could buy more, well, except now Microsoft's spending it,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
so I guess they'll not be able to use that money to get more patches.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Yeah, why couldn't they have spent $2 billion on,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I don't know, making Windows 8 not suck?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
You know what I mean?

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Why couldn't they have spent money on that?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Or, I don't know, making Windows phone not suck.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Can you imagine what $2.5 billion could do for research

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
in a non-shitty operating system for their phones?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I mean, that would be fantastic.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Alright, well, one thing Microsoft...

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Or Kinect. Holy fuck.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
One thing Microsoft...

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Yeah, I know.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
Think of all the Kinect games that could have been made for $2 billion.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Oh my god, what a good point.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
Like, $2 billion could have bought, like, a lot.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Like, you could have bought Harmonix to pump more Kinect exclusives.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
You could have bought, like, oh my god, anyway.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Moving on.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Some more system updates with some of that money.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
A new Xbox One system update coming out in October.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
It will be a firmware update that will make some changes to the Snap feature on Xbox One.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Easier access to the Snap without having to back all the way out to the Home menu.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
You will be able to use Snap after October to show friendless messages

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
and achievement progress in real time.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Get ready, Trophy Whores.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Achievement... Excuse me, Achievement Whores.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Trophies is the other system.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
Also, there will be a button command that will record the last 30 seconds of gameplay.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
So, a share button?

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
So, it replaces you yelling at the Kinect to record that,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
because, as we know, not everybody has a Kinect anymore.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
And they're not selling systems with Kinect, really.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
I mean, one out of the four, five excuses they have.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
More codecs will be built into the console's media player,

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
and there will be support for a digital TV tuner that is coming out in Europe at the end of October.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
So, that is all coming to the Xbox One this next month ahead of the holidays.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Dark Soccer.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Well, you know, we've been talking about Bucket, right? The Craft Bucket?

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
You mean Mr. Bucket?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Uh, Mr. Bucket?

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
Hello? The... spits out the thing?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Ugh.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Yes!

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
I hear he's a bucket of fun.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Yes, he's a bucket of fun.

57:30.000 --> 57:38.000
Anyway, the guy who did Craft Bucket, basically Wesley Wolf, has been swatted.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
For anyone who doesn't know what swatting is,

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
it's basically when someone calls in some sort of fake police report

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
that would be enough to cause a swat team to come to the scene.

57:50.000 --> 57:56.000
In this case, someone called and said that he had shot and killed his parents

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and were going to kill more people.

57:58.000 --> 58:08.000
In response to, basically, Wolf having done the DMCA takedown for Craft Bucket.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Yeah, the whole thing we talked about last week, right?

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Exactly.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
So, somebody is trying to prove a point by sending the police over to this guy's house,

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
by committing a criminal act, because in California, this is happening to celebrities all the time.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
This happened in Texas.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
No, but still.

58:25.000 --> 58:33.000
But I'm saying it actually, in Texas it's probably even just as big, if not a bigger deal.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
But on top of that, the police said that they set up a perimeter around this house

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
and used a PA system to get the attention of the family.

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
And then they talked to Wolf and his parents and confirmed everyone was safe and sound.

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
Basically, the call came through Skype on an untraceable line.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
I don't understand, in the year 2014, when we've placed a robot on Mars.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.000
We have a robot on Mars, yet we have untraceable lines on Skype. I don't understand.

59:11.000 --> 59:18.000
And the NSA can spy on everybody, but yet that one call that was made on Skype is fucking impossible.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
Well, what they know right now is that, okay, they said that they're working a little bit deeper on it.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
That they know that the call was based in California.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
So they are tracing it, but they said that the call itself, and my apologies, was unidentified.

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, I hope they find this fucker, because this is not the way to prove your point.

59:38.000 --> 59:45.000
I don't understand extremists when it comes to certain opinions in the gaming community.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
People go to these huge extremes, from swatting people to sending tweets that, you know,

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
I'm gonna kick your ass and rip off your head and shove my dick down your throat and all this stuff.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
They learned it from Duke Nukem!

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
All these hideous things people say on Twitter to try and prove a point.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:10.000
What kind of point are you making with that? You are an asshole! That's the point you're making.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Anyway, sorry Diego, I just got on a rant.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
When she was talking about the whole swat thing, I think I was reading an article that popped up on Facebook,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
because someone had shared that about one person that was caught doing that,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and in the process of that they were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And I was reading up on that, that this one child was pretty much crying his eyes out,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
and my friend who had posted up the feed was like, well, that's what you get, you so-and-so, so-and-so.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And I'm like, wow, and I read the article, I was shocked, and the kid pretty much on the pictures itself,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
he was just crying his eyes out, and I said, exactly, you shouldn't be doing that stuff.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Like, they actually caught someone in the act in that.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Well, and then I'm thinking, as you're saying that, I'm also thinking of when,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
this just happened a couple weeks ago, was there was that guy, and he was the executive of some company,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
somebody in chat's got to fill in, but he was on that flight that was going from Texas or whatever,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and somebody tweeted a bomb threat at the airline, and they put his, they grounded his plane,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
and it was, I think this all had to do with that Gamergate fuckery, where they, I think, they grounded his-

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I thought it was a Sony exec.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I think it was, but, you know, I think he made a comment that somebody didn't like,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000
so they tweeted a bomb threat to the airline, and his plane got grounded, all the bags were searched,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and it's like, dude, in trying to prove your point, you have committed a federal offense.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
There are some things you don't do in a post-9-11 world.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Tweeting a bomb threat to an airline is one of them, you idiot. What point are you making with that?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
The point is, you're an asshole. That's the only point that's coming out of that. Come on.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Debate is one thing. Discussion is another thing. Bomb threats, you're an asshole.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Exactly, like, I'm still kind of laughing at that right now, but exactly, it's as idiotic as that sounds as well.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You say it like this when you go towards the circumstances of talking about certain things, such as things like,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
you lied to the government, that's a felony, but if the government lies to you, that's politics.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That's a whole nother Oprah, as we say.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Do you want to hear Matt say that article that might have been fake?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000
But the thing is that they're going to give a kid, even just using this example, 25 to life,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
but yet they let rapists go after five years. I don't know.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Well, that is true. The judicial law is just corrupted as it is. Like we said, even though justice is blind, they just let people walk every day.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Justice is fueled by economy.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Not everybody's going to agree with me on this, and that's fine, we'll just have to have a political debate,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
but whoever called in this swatting thing, you know what they need to do?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
This is how MSNBC is going to get their ratings, because what they're going to do is they're going to turn MSNBC into a channel

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
where they're going to take this kid who called in the threat, and they're going to walk him out,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
and they're going to pull his pants down on TV, and they're going to spank him.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
They're going to spank him in front of the entire nation.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It was a hoax, by the way, a fake.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
What, the whole swatting thing on this guy?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The one that they caught.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Okay, well, whoever swatted this guy, you know who needs to do it? Supernanny.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They should send him to Singapore.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000
No, Supernanny's going to pull down his pants and say, you've been a very naughty boy.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You need to sit on the naughty step and think about what you've done. And that's it.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But you have to understand that she only puts them in timeouts. Spanking is not really something that they approve.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Well, then get somebody else.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
That's why I said send him to Singapore.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Get Jamie. Jamie will spank him.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That's why he has to sit on the noise.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
As long as Jamie has some hand sanitizer, she'll do it.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000
No, that's okay, because not using hand sanitizer and anti-bacterials makes your immune system stronger.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Alright, anyway.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You don't need to use that shit unless you're a doctor.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Bochi Kawa says, fuck yeah, more spanking for children. Some of these kids need to learn.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:22.000
This person's probably 23. I'm not talking about spanking children. If you act like a child, though, then you should be spanked.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
This 23-year-old or whoever did this.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And now I'm just making up who called this in.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I cannot believe that when we, again, can travel to space, when we have all this technology in the palm of our hand, we can't trace a fucking phone call.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Well, it is Microsoft. They could have used that $2.5 billion to invest in their Skype system to be able to trace that fucking call.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I just had a brilliant thought. You know what should be done for people who break certain laws?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
They need to have it tattooed on their face.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
No, no, no. Have it permanently marked on their bodies for the rest of their lives.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Didn't they write a book like that hundreds of years ago called The Scarlet Letter?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
No, that was sewn onto her shirt.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And that was because she was practicing the free rights that men had at the time.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Look, we started here. Now we're over here. Let's get back to the other video game news.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
All right. Loki, bring us back here with something else.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000
All right. So, unfortunately, on Twitch, it's become a kind of a new haven for phishing scams.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It kind of goes to show you, don't click on links that you don't know what they fucking are.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Don't just click random links that appear in chat.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Apparently, they're saying that there's some sort of Counter Strike Go prize type links that are appearing.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And it pops up that, oh, you've won the weapon or something in the game.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And you have to log in to your Steam account to redeem it or something.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And so, when you log in, of course, it steals all your account information then goes through your stuff.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
If you happen to be a Counter Strike Go player and sells all your weapons and shit that you got for money.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
They steal that somehow.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
That's actually pretty fucking clever, which kind of sucks.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Don't hear me wrong here. These guys are assholes for stealing all this stuff that isn't theirs.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
But it just goes to show you, they'll go to pretty great lengths to do it.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And with Twitch becoming more and more mainstream as it is, they're going to come for you on there.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Oh my gosh. So be careful. Don't put your username and password in places where...

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Always check the URL to make sure you're actually on Steam's website and all that.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Very important.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Or better off, just research all this stuff that goes on.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I'll tell everything later about fixing so many computers because people accidentally clicked one thing and now they get all this crap happening on their computer.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Pornography? On my computer?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
It's more real than you think.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Anyhow, let's move on to something happy.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You know what, Jamie? I know you were a fan of this series, at least until the third game.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
But I know you liked at least the second one.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But I'm talking about Fable. Remember that series? Fable? You guys like that?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
It started on the original Xbox, made its way to 360.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Fable 2 was the one you really got into, right?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
For about five minutes. Dan was really into the Fable series.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Well maybe this is something that might bring you back to it.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
The PC version of Fable Anniversary will be coming out shortly.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And it's going to have modding support, according to Lionhead.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Producer Craig Oman, in speaking to Eurogamer, mentioned that Fable Anniversary on PC will have a version of the Unreal Engine 3 editor, which will let you edit all of the existing art and animation in the game.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So, two weeks Telenude patch? Three weeks? Two weeks?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That means that, if I am right, they're going to be able to use some of the same modding tools that Mass Effect 2 and 3 use.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Perhaps. Perhaps. In fact, you know what's funny is they're actually talking about one of the statements that Craig Oman said.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Quote, personally, I just hope someone creates a sci-fi version of Fable.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
So, you could get, like, your Garrus Cross Fable. I don't know.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I need that now.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
See? I knew you'd be interested in this eventually.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Only if somebody does that. And then I can have my Taurean dating sim.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
This is the internet, Jamie. Anything can happen.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
That'd be wonderful, though, just to have the whole sci-fi twist on it.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It already had a feel of having a Star Wars feel to it, of shooting lightning and thunder from your hands and doing other things and pushing people away. It felt like force powers as well.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It would be way more interesting than that Kinect Fable game, that's for sure.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It'd be way more interesting than any of the Fable games since 2, so I'm all down for that.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Fable Effect?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Possibly. That'd be great.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Let's see.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Going into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Kaijuto says, Fable 2 is the only Fable game you need.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It definitely was the peak of the series, that's for sure.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So, the game actually just came out in Europe, at least, on September 12th.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I don't know if that matches over here, because, again, I'm seeing this on Eurogamer, but I'm sure it's out very, very soon if it's not out already.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Also, in the game, there's a new heroic mode, if you are so inclined to play this super advanced mode, where there will be an increased line of sight for enemies and reduced damage on ranged weapons and reduced player armor levels.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So, you know, everything gets hard.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Very cool. So, for those of you that want to revisit the Fable and get all these patches, that'll be really neat.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Darsakura, one more story here before we get to the release dates.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Well, this is yet another reason to love Sega.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Sega is finally putting the crack down on assholes.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:15.000
They have a new policy for the Sega blogs, Sega forums, and any of their social media accounts that basically they're going to be knocking down anyone who posts derogatory and hateful comments, personal attacks on any real person.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So Sega's going to be having the message deleted, and their right to post future comments permanently pooped on, as in not exist.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
That's right. If you're going to make any hateful messages, it's better to read it to Sonic.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And his fucking weird ass long legs.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So you can still make all the fun you want of Sonic's friends. You just can't make fun of real people.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But if I want to say, you know, Tails sucks, I can do that.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Dude, seriously.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
What?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
They made Sonic have more fucking friends in the next game.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
It's like, hey, what does everyone hate? They hate his friends. Let's give them more friends.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's like, you fucking stupid.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And Sega just banned you.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And at any rate, what they've actually said is, therefore we're putting a new policy in place across all of Sega's community and social channels.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
If you make a personal attack or otherwise inappropriate comment, we will delete your comment and we will ban or block you from our page slash channel.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And they said that while their fans may not always agree with the company or each other, that's not an excuse to not show mutual respect on a human level.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Which also takes me, though, to something that we were seeing.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:37.000
A mini discussion that I was having with SSJ100 man in the chat room about removing anonymity from people to basically make them own up to how they treat other people.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:46.000
That goes back and forth there. Removing anonymity can also damage people who need to use that anonymity to protect aspects of their personal life.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Exactly. See, then I think about when Battle.net was going to do the real ID thing.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And I was super against that because I was so not okay with my real name being out there.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And, you know, without getting too tangenty, we have this whole thing going on right now where Facebook is forcing all these people who are not using their real names.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And the most vocal right now of which is the drag queens of the world, that's where I'm seeing it happen a lot, is that they're all being forced to use their real names.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Which could put them in physical danger.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Right. Roller derby girls who use fake names. And I use a fake name and I've never made a secret about that.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
That's because I like to keep my professional life and what I do with everything online and all that separate.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And I realize some people are probably going to figure out my real name and whatever, whatever, and vice versa.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
But it's still that whole thing where it's like, respect the fact that I want to have these two separate personas.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Well, I put my real name out there because, you know, for a while I was really focusing on my design work.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But the stuff that I put there about my personal life, everything in my personal life pretty much except for Orange Lounge has a pseudonym or something that I've made up about it.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So no one knows where I work unless they happen to work with me or I've told them.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Or, you know, people don't really know where I live unless they know me and have been to my house or have sent me something.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And I'm fine. I'm fine now that battle net requires me to have a battle tag and everything can be traced back to that battle tag no matter what game I'm in.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And, you know, my account would be at risk if I was a total, you know, douche nozzle to somebody.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Then that, you know, and that's OK. I'd be accountable in that regard.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:35.000
But, you know, again, when you go all the way to your full name, I don't think I'll say I think that there does need to be a different way to have accountability.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Like, it's really hard to have a happy medium between something that's either real or it's fake.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:52.000
In that case, I think I do rather like what they have on Tumblr where you can block an anonymous commenter completely.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You won't see who that anonymous person is, so it will, quote, protect them.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But you can still block them. And sometimes trial and error, you can find out who they are.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I do think one idea Sega should have experimented with, though, is instead of like silencing these bullies completely,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000
they could have taken the Disney approach where, you know, the bullies would have to select and communicate only with a preselected list of phrases.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000
In this case, I think they should only be able to post quotes from Shenmue.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
That would be all these people would be able to use in the future.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
So it's like, you know, you want to comment on something? Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
That's all they could do. All they could do.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:36.000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some games that are gonna, no doubt, cause some people to say some very naughty things on the internet somewhere. Loki.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Well, I hope not, because Cookie Mama 5, bon appetit, is coming out on 3DS.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Yeah, Cookie Mama, she's a bitch.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Thetrithym, Final Fantasy Curtain Call, coming out on 3DS as well.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Psh, Final Fantasy sucks.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Fairy Fencer F for PlayStation 3.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Fairy Fencer.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution for PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Naruto's not a real ninja.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And finally, Air Conflicts Vietnam, they're doing a port of it for PlayStation 4. And that's it.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.000
All right, let's go back, let's go over to Japan at some point and get the releases. I guess I'm flying over there right now, it's very slow.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Checking out the releases in Japan this week. Nothing really on the newer consoles, the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000
On the PlayStation 3, there's nothing this week either. It's a pretty slow week over there in Japan. Nothing on the Xbox 360 either.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000
How about the handhelds? This is because Smash Brothers just came out, I bet. Cause Smash Brothers just came out this week on the 3DS.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Where's my Smash Code?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
We already talked about that earlier in the show.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Did you guys get your Smash Codes and all that stuff?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
No, I didn't get it, but everyone's been talking about it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
If you reach behind you, there's a gold 3DS if you want to check out the demo. If you want.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
All right, and let's see...

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I think I'll wait, cause I already played it in E3, so...

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Yeah, I can understand that too.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
On the Wii U, oh here's one release this week I'm finding. This is a pretty big one. This is a very Nintendo week.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Bayonetta 2 on September 20th in Japan. I know a lot of people looking forward to that, so there's something.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Boing boing.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And on the Vita, there's a couple games on the Vita this week.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Gundam Breaker and Fate Stay Night are both getting price reductions.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
So they're not new games, but you can get them at an all new low price in the best collection.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So there you go, Bayonetta or nuttin'.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
All right, let's move on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I would move on to the UK if the UK list would load. I think we're all in the middle of our transportation.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So on the 16th we have Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. I'm getting super tired of all things Naruto.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:59.000
On the 17th we have Anomaly 2, the 18th Endless Legend for PC and Train Simulator 2015.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
On the 19th, Damn Near Everything Else comes out.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Flockers for PC, PS4, Xbox One, Hyrule Warriors for Wii U.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Natural Doctrine on PlayStation 3, Vita, and PS4.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Theater of the Final Fantasy, Curtain Call and 3DS.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And Wasteland 2 for Mac and PC.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Dance Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BABY.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So apparently there is a brand new patent for some device from the Pokemon company.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And honestly it looks just like they're having some sort of near field communication thing with Pokemon figures.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I was really worried for a minute there it was going to be a Fleshlight add-on for Pokemon figurines.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So I was getting a little nervous there, but woo!

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
There's still time.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
That won't stop some people from trying.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Apparently the device would be an information processing apparatus. Well that's very vague of you.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Basically able to read NFC and RFID chips like those front end Amiibo figures.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So yes, you can imagine that I'm guessing this is going to lead to some sort of thing where they sell every single Pokemon character as a figurine for Amiibo.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And you know what? You gotta catch them all.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Because that's the only way.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Like some people in venereal diseases.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000
It's the only way you're gonna get like super shinies or some shit they're gonna come up with where, you know.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And then they're gonna start selling like real life burn heals for your wallet is the next logical step for this thing.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
It burns.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
That joke burns too.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Alright, moving on.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Talking about Pikmin, another Nintendo product.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Pikmin is gonna get a movie of sorts. Of sorts.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah, this is a report from Variety.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Pikmin Short Movies.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's animated shorts that are produced by Shigeru Miyamoto.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
They're gonna be debuting at the Tokyo International Film Festival.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And this is gonna be at the end of October.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And so Miyamoto will be having a presentation where there's gonna be these Pikmin Short Movies and there'll be three animated shorts.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
One is called The Night Juicer.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Where Captain Olimar wants to blend up Pikmin.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
What is this? A fucking horror movie?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
The name of that again? Can you say the name of that one?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Keep in mind this is October 25th to the 31st.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
The Night Juicer.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
You know what? I'm sorry.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Isn't that the attachment for the Pokemon?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The Night Juicer.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
The Night Juicer, all that reminds me of is the fruit fucker from the Penny Arcade comic.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I see that now.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
The fruit fucker movie. The Night Juicer.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That sounds pretty splashing.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Night juicer. Night juicer.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Night juicer.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Let's see, also Pikmin Short Movies.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Olimar blending up Pikmin? That's gross.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Whoa.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
That's the concept. Night juicer. He's gonna blend up the Pikmin.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Listen, you guys are really fucking annoying me now.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
So I'm gonna juice you.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I can see where this is all leading to. The juicing to the blending.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It's all making sense now.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
They're onto something.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Will it blend?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I can't wait for the third episode where he rolls them up into a joint and smokes them.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Is that why there's no green Pikmin?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Alright, anyway.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Treasures in a Bottle, which will involve an odd treasure. That's all they say.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It's treasure in a bottle.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Surprise, it's fucking nothing.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And Occupational Hazards is the third one, which plays out at a construction site.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Sounds like a fucking...

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It's like Happy Tree Friends.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Doesn't it?

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It's Happy Tree Friends.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Or like Wile E. Coyote in Roadrunner.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
No, it's Happy Tree Friends.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It looks like the future of Pikmin will now be blended together into one.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I guess.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Or it's becoming a horror franchise.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The one drink to rule them all.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You would say that at the exact moment Loki knocks a soda on the floor.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
It's empty.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Speaking of a horror film, apparently Diego has the powers of persuasion.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Let's go back to a time when things were a little simpler.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
You know, we didn't try to stick our video game characters in a blender.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That was something reserved for like goldfish.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
PETA, don't harass me.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
What kind of sick person are you, Rob?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
That you would think of that.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I never wanted to do that.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I knew some fucked up kids growing up.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Didn't we all know some fucked up kids growing up?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I would just chant at my brother's fish until they died.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Because I hated them.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Oh, so I'm weird trying to get out blenders.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yet you would perform a satanic ritual on your boy.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
No, no, no. You would murder them.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I would just wish them to die.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You would curse them in eternal damnation.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But I didn't murder them.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You fish murderer.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But then, you know, the quick murdering or the, you know,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
very methodical ritual that you had.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It wasn't a ritual. I'd just be like, God, I hate you fish.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Why are we talking about murder? The happy music is playing.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm going to feed you to the cat.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Time for the classic game of the week,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
and find, you know, next to her, you know, guns

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and various tools of mass destruction.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Just for that, I'm going to put up puzzle and dragons

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
and then a week.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Oh, you're such a...

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So mean to me. All right.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Here it is, your classic game of the week.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I gave you candy corn.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
That's true. You did give me.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And it was apple pie and I ate them.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Just my fat.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
All right.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
The classic game of the week is, again, sticking with the CPS-2 theme.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I went for Armored Warriors, which in Japan it was called

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Powered Gear Strategic Variant Armor Equipment.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It came out in 1994.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It was a beat-em-up.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Like I said, it was CPS CP System 2.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And there's no home version of this ever.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
However, the mecha in the game were later used

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
for Cyberbots Fill Metal Madness.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Which, don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
according to Devilot and Puzzle Fighter.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Anyway, Armored Warriors was basically

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
as a multiplayer beat-em-up.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
You go around in robots and you basically beat up other robots.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Robots!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And then you can use different type of input commands

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
with the joystick and you get team-up change,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
which lets you do tandem attacks with whoever you're playing with.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So basically, it's just a big robot war

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and you are trying to get to the end

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and beat the perfect warrior cyborg robot.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And Blodia's in it.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
That just makes me happy because Blodia was awesome.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Oh, Janna?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yep.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
So the characters that you play as,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
you have First Lieutenant Jeff Perkins, who pilots Blodia.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You have Captain Ray Turner, who is the pilot of Reptos.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You have Glenn Reed, who pilots Golden.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And Sarah White, who has Forty.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So basically, I mean, really, there's not a lot of special to it,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
but the notable thing about this game is that this is what led to us having Cyberbots.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Which, Cyberbots is fucking awesome.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So, thank you, Capcom for Armored Warriors, which gave us Cyberbots.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
That's it.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
It has no home release.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
No home release.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So, really, the only way you're going to play this is...

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Get yourself a super gun.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
That's right.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You're going to have to go to an arcade that might still have this game somewhere.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Armored Warriors.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Or, you know, they do make a CPS2 emulator.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I would never endorse using emulators and downloading the ROM illegally, but...

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
For an outdated system that has no...

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Yeah, get a super gun.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
All right.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Armored Warriors.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
In part B, we're going to talk to our friends from the big anime game room a little more

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and talk about what's coming up next for them

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and what their plans for the future might be.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And then we're going to get into some rapid-fire news.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
The Fugu Question of the Week, your emails, and plenty more

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this September the 14th, 2014

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
with the 567th episode of our show already in progress.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And you know what's very important and very special about this day

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
as was brought to my attention via Facebook.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000
September 14th, 1985, was the debut of the Golden Girls on television.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So, a very important day in television history.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
My God, that was all...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Thank you for being a friend.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That was 29 years ago. 29 years ago.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
No wonder they are all almost dead.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I mean, what's...

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And woe to the poor children who were not alive when there were Golden Girls.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yes, I know, I know.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Praise be to Betty White and she can't die ever, ever, ever, ever.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
All right, let's see.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Moving on, before we get into some rapid-fire news,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
let's talk to our friends Jonas and Diego a little more from the big anime game room.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
What's next on you guys' agenda?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What big cons are coming up in the future?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
What's your next big show?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Well, the bigger one that's coming up next is our one that's coming up in...

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Oh, it's semi-big, but it's big enough.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
It's the one coming up in Reno, Nevada.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It's known as a snafu that's abbreviated as Sierra Nevada Anime Fans United.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I've never heard of that one, but Reno's a fun town.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Where do they have that up there?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
They have it at the Grand Sierra Hotel.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Oh, okay. So they do use some of the hotel space up there.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
That's the one that used to be the Hilton years ago, right?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I believe so.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I think it was.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I believe so, yeah.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It's a beautiful place.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I think it's been going on for about four years now.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Nice.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Three to four years now.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
What weekend is that?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I might have to go up there and check it out.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
That's the second to last weekend of October.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I think that's 25th, 26th, and 27th.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Actually 24, 25, 26.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's Friday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Maybe tied down with rehearsals for a performance I got going on.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
But that still sounds like it'll be a lot of fun.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Well, I won't say most of our group, but some of our group will be there since some can't really attend.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But we'll pretty much bring our armory with us of games.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And united with our Nevada friends and people who also staff our other cons.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Because some of them put their effort into staffing and are part-chair to this as well.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Because some of them helped start this convention at Reno.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Nice.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
That's always kind of neat.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Have you guys kind of been at the ground level of a convention like that and really kind of seen it grow over the years?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Well, I guess GamerX, we talked about last time you guys were here.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It might be an example.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Are there a lot of cons you guys are kind of following since the first year that have really grown?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Yeah, Snapagon we saw grow from the ground up.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah, Snapagon?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
There's one called KrakenCon, which I got invited to, but I'm not sure if I'm able to go.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
But I'll keep in tabs for it.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I think KrakenCon is in Oakland.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I believe it's the first or second week of October.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Wow, all these cons I've never even heard of. That's awesome though.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I know YaweCon is this weekend, but we aren't able to make it.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Oh, you guys aren't doing YaweCon?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We're not doing YaweCon because one, it's under new ownership.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
YaweCon in 2011 got purchased by a manga company.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I didn't know that.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And then whatever direction they have, if they want game room, that's fine.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
If not, then unfortunately they haven't made the decision to put a game room in there at the moment.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You know, I've never been to YaweCon, but I have heard that what happens at YaweCon stays at YaweCon.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I have heard that much.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It is quite an experience.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.000
When it was under the original ownership back in the day, when it was in San Mateo and around the Bay Area, around San Francisco-ish?

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
San Mateo and San Francisco is the only one.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
San Mateo and San Francisco. And when we first got in there, yeah, it was quite an experience, definitely.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And I was like, they have a game room?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I said, oh, game room. I get it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But it was actually quite amazing. Really nice people there. Nothing practically went wrong.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It was good vibes over there, definitely.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Good. Awesome.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Last week we spent a little bit of time celebrating the 15th anniversary of the US launch of the Dreamcast.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And since you guys do a lot with classic games, I know you got something to say about the Dreamcast.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
What are some Dreamcast memories that you see living on today in the game room?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
What are some Dreamcast things that still live on today in the game room?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
A favorite would be definitely Power Stone. Power Stone 2, to be exact.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Oh my gosh, you have the Dreamcast boot-up noise on your phone.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Yeah, it's what I do for my email.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
That's awesome.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Towards that, what else did we have?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Choo-Choo Rocket.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Choo-Choo Rocket. Very underrated Sonic Team game, oh my lord.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
When I first played that, that thing is on steroids, but it's fun steroids.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Not in that sense, but in the sense of gaming, that is.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It's so ridiculously fun that all you have to do is just fill up your rockets full of mice,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and there's so many things that change the game around and flip you around.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It's so chaotic, but it's chaotic fun.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Choo-Choo Rocket, I want to say they released that for iPad and all that stuff, too.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
So at least there's a way to experience it if you don't have a Dreamcast to hook up.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Other things such as, I remember, Cannon Spike.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Cannon Spike was pretty popular for a while, definitely.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
When I first found out about that game, I was like, wow, there's Kami in here and Mega Man,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and it's pretty much a bird's eye view shooter game that goes around,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and then just constantly shooting and going through the entire level.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It's actually quite amazing.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Any other ones?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Let's see.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Good ones.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
The original Soul Calibur for the Dreamcast.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
That was a big one at the time.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Sonic Adventure 2, because the newer generation like Sonic Adventure,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
for those who did not grow up on the 2D Sonics.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2, because people still prefer that as the console to play Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I bet.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Because I believe people are saying that if you play it on any other console, there's lag.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Not to mention, of course, the Dreamcast is based off the NAOMI board,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
which Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the arcade was based off of.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Right.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Also, the game Jet Set Radio.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah, that was another favorite right there.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:51.000
You know what? Okay, if you guys have a Planet Harriers, I would be at every event ever.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Well, they'll have to find one.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Planet Harriers never had a home release.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
It's almost impossible to emulate.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Wow.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So, I mean, you can emulate it, people have.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I couldn't get it working.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Planet Harriers.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Planet Harriers.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It sounds like Diego is not the only one who has made the Dreamcast boot-up noise a way of life.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
ActDef says, I used to have the Dreamcast starting sound on my phone, too.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And let's see. Fifth Dream says, I made my Windows PC boot-up sound.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
The Dreamcast boot-up sound.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Definitely. I mean, it was thinking and it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Well, I want to say it's still thinking now because people still use the.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
We bring that back in our game room at least.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Yeah.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Yeah, we still have those things.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And Dreamcast, I want to say it was a great system.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Obviously, I wasn't there to pay for the full price and I kind of feel sorry for those who stood in line.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I had a roommate who stood in line at Florin Mall here in Sacramento to actually do that.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Which is now a Walmart.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Which is now a Walmart, yes.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
They still have the Sears, though. The original Sears.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Oh, I didn't realize.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It still stands. Every brick.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Oh, wow.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
That was. I think the Florin Mall was the first place I ever played Pump It Up.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And that was probably the last time you ever caught me at Florin Mall.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Right at the Tilt, right?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yeah.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Oh, my goodness, the Tilt.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
All right, the Tilt.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Local drama here in Sacramento, California, where our lovely show is based.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Skies of Arcadia. I almost forgot about that.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, good memories. Good memories.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's great to see that through these game rooms that you guys do, you can still celebrate all those classic games.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And I'm sure until the end of time, there will always be a Dreamcast so somebody can play MVC, too.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Actually, we still do it because our most common game in a game with a Dreamcast is actually Typing of the Dead.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Of course. Oh, my God.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Yeah, that game is amazing.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah, I was excited when they brought back. They put a version of it on PC not that long ago where they have a newer version of Typing of the Dead.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I don't know what's more amazing, watching the actual footage.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Just watching people have their faces change as they type the words out almost fiercely or something.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
They really get into the game as they type those words out.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Well, then sometimes the words get really awkward.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And so then your face is kind of like, what?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Right. And as their hands are moving as well, they're like, oh, my goodness, I can't believe this is happening.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I can't believe I'm typing these naughty things.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
What is this game forcing me to do?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:19.000
All right. Well, look, we could reminisce about the Dreamcast all night long, but we're going to get into some rapid-fire news and talk about quickly what else is going on in the gaming world.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And you guys, please feel free to pipe up if there's anything you want to comment on as we move on throughout the rest of the show.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So let's start off with some rapid-fire news. Loki.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:36.000
So this is kind of strange. They're kind of going the route of, what is it, the Disney Infinity with Little Big Planet.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.000
They're re-releasing the Vita version of Little Big Planet, but they're dubbing it the Little Big Planet PlayStation Vita Marvel Superhero Edition.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Because the version of Little Big Planet that they're releasing is going to also include all the content of the original release as well as a host of Marvel Comics characters and skins and that kind of stuff.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000
So yeah. So that's kind of cool. And that's going to be coming out on, looks like around November 18th, November 19th.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Is that the same time that Little Big Planet 3 comes out in PlayStation 4?

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Little Big Planet 3 is actually coming out in two weeks.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Oh, wow.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I'm sorry. No, not Little Big Planet 3. I'm sorry. Little Big Planet 3, yeah, actually that is around the exact same time.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:28.000
So that'll be right, probably the same date actually. That'll be coming out. No, I'm sorry. I was thinking Disney Infinity for some reason. Disney Infinity is in two weeks.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Gotcha.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:38.000
But yeah. This is kind of cool. The next Final Fantasy spinoff they're saying is going to be a text input battle RPG.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So, typing of the Final Fantasy, I guess. It's Final Fantasy Worldwide Words.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter. H-E-A-L space P-L-Z, enter.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
No, no, no, no. That was Ragnarok Online or Port Pront.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Oh, sorry. C-U-R-E space P-L-Z, enter.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Port G-H. Port G-H.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Yeah, so apparently in order to defeat enemies in the game, you know, you can cast spells and stuff like that, but it requires you to type in words.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Could two things I love be blended together any better? Like Final Fantasy and typing of the dead? That sounds amazing.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
It will be out on the Japanese Android, I guess.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Android? I don't want to type on a phone.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
September 16th. An iOS version is supposed to be released soon.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
What if the bonus rounds, though, force people to type with proper grammar?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I think I would need new underwear.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
For the final boss, you must properly use your, your, and your.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Or their, their, and their.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:47.000
And last but not least, the date has finally been confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 4 on, uh, or 4 or 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
November 18th in North America, and then the PC version is coming out on the 27th of January.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Um, they were talking about some of the new additions to the game.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Of course, new weapons, vehicles, activities, more wildlife. They even have like an orca whale in there.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And cats. Cats are in there.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Which, by the way, when Loki and I were tweeting each other this week, I think the cat thing might have sold me on this.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Just, just, just to be clear.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So, um, yeah, uh, new foliage system and enhanced damage and weather effects.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And then, of course, 100 new songs added to the radio and 30 players in online.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Jeez. At a time instead of 16.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So, that's pretty awesome. And you'll be able to transfer your safety.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Loki might finally, he might buy himself like a PlayStation 4 as a, I just got laid off present.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And I don't think I, I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I would like to do that, but I don't think the White's gonna let me do that.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Bummer.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Yeah.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Alright, get that game done. Sell it. 50 bucks a pop.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Alright.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Uh, let's see. Checking out some other quick news here.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Uh, I'm surprised, uh, Loki doesn't have a lot to say about this, so maybe he does. I don't know.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But apparently there's an Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara crossover.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
What?

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
What?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The fuck?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Okay, hold on, hold on. Before y'all get too excited, this is a Japanese retailer specific pre-order bonus for a pale wing costume in Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That went from interest high to interest...

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Jonas, she sounded like a big fan over there. Earth Defense Force cross Oni Chambara. Are you here for that?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I don't know if I can comment on this.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
No comment. No comment. No comment for the tea baggers. Alright.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Ultimate NES Remix, you know, because NES Remix on the Wii U is not enough, they're gonna bring it to the 3DS as well.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So Ultimate NES Remix not only will offer, you know, the same similar types of things that you saw on the Wii U versions,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:01.000
but obviously they have to give something new to make you want to buy it all over again, and that will be a full version of Speed Mario Bros.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
It's a very fast version of the original Super Mario Bros.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So yeah, there you go. Mario's fast, the music is fast, you're gonna speed run this shit whether you want to or not.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's what's gonna happen in Ultimate NES Remix with that.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:26.000
And lastly, speaking of Nintendo products, if you are a Wii U Deluxe owner, don't forget you are getting 10% back from any e-purchase shop you make.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Meaning if you buy virtual console games, which I might be a sucker for those and I bought a lot of those,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000
but also if you got your free game with Mario Kart 8, that was an eShop game, so if you have a Wii U Deluxe,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
you probably have like a $5 card sitting in your account right now.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Don't forget, this promotion ends December 2014, and you will have until March 2015 to spend those points.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So this is just a friendly reminder circulating the blogs.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Check that balance, because you would probably kick yourself if you missed out on some free games.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Interesting, I didn't get my free $5.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Make sure you log in, you connect everything on the Nintendo site.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I've done it before, I've gotten like $10 or $15 worth of cards, which says a lot about how much fucking shit I bought on the Nintendo Wii U.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Not because I recently went to the eShop just to buy the new DLCs from Mario Kart 8.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I didn't see any new transactions.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I got the free game, I got the free Pikmin 3.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000
You're not gonna see it in the store, you have to go to a website where you then redeem for the codes that you put in the store.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Okay, I have to check that out.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Yeah, check that out. What the hell's the website?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
We're just taking a message.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Let me see if I can remember where the website is. I think it's like nintendo.net slash deluxe, or it's like deluxe.nintendo or something like that.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Nintendo.com slash deluxe.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Somebody in chat will help us out here over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
While we wait for that though, let's go to the next story from DarkSakura.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Next story or stories?

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Stories!

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Stuff!

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Oh wait, first, actdeft. ddp.nintendo.com, thank you.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Dang it, actdeft, stop interrupting my shit.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Well hey, it was for free shit. I'm sorry DarkSakura, are you gonna give us free shit tonight?

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Uh, I haven't been to gym boys.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
As opposed to, just think, it's not TTP that we talk about on the show sometimes, it's DDP.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So, Ubisoft confirmed that Watch Dogs Wii U will be out November 18th.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Good for all of those people who are getting it.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Also, it will be out in Europe on November 21st.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Sorry guys, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait, you've gotta wait.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Are they doing anything extra in this version, or is it like just a straight up port?

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I think it's a port?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Boy, it's another game that's been out forever coming out on the Wii U, this is sure to not fail at all.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Why should anyone have, oh I'm sorry mister, I just bought Mass Effect 3 for Wii U.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Yeah, and then you all called me crazy, so clearly I'm the exception to the rule.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I'm not gonna buy Watch Dogs on five different systems, I didn't like it that much, jeez.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Rob.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
What?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Hearts.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
So how about some Octodad?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It's also gonna be on the Wii U, well at least they're thinking about it.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:27.000
The developers Young Horses are saying that they're in the deciding process, meaning, deciding process, why call it deciding process?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
You're just deciding.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
When you have-

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
With these big companies it can be a process.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
When you're done, you have decided, you have a decision.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Process my ass, it's like boarding process.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Boarding process.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
You're not boarding process, you're just boarding.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Now they're just deciding.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm sorry George Carlin said it best.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Anyway.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
It said, this is the quote, we're not working on whether or not we want to bring the game to Wii U.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It's not a no, but it's also not a yes.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Trust us, we'll be quite loud about it if we do decide to happen to do the port.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Sorry for the non-answer, but that's all we've got right now, so sorry not sorry.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And he put a smiley face after it too.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So this is pretty good.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:29.000
The TIGA basically has a proposal calling on the British government to create a new creative content fund for video games to the tune of 3 million pounds annually, which is about 4.9 million dollars.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:39.000
They finalized the tax breaks for video game production so that companies can basically have their games pass a cultural test.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000
So looks like we've got a lot of big stuff going on with that too.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:52.000
They're saying basically that the CCF could recoup investments from game sales once a developer has generated a certain amount of revenue.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So it has to pass a cultural test?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Yes.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:03.000
So if somebody decides to make some of the OLR dream games such as Puzzle Sluts, that's probably not going to pass the cultural sensitivity test.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I think it's like the cultural thing like along the signs they say, is this porn?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Does it have cultural significance?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I see.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
They could be sluts and not naked.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
That's right, it's true.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
All of those guys are sluts.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Which guys? Just everybody in general? Everybody's a slut?

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
For every woman that sleeps around, every man that sleeps around is a slut as well.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Yeah, that's fair.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Not a player. A slut.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
What's that have to do with puzzles?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Moving on. Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Yes. The seg in our chat room says, I should think about making puzzle sluts.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Yes.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
We have a wiki that has all the OLR dream games on it.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
We need, we need though, if there are going to be puzzle sluts, there must also be man sluts in it.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
No, we talked about that a long time ago when we first proposed the game. It would be equal opportunity slutting.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
And, and, and, and.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I want like, I want alien sluts.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Gay sluts, straight sluts, every kind of sluts, just not like weird shit like dead people's sluts.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
The slut machine?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Pigeon sluts.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And most importantly, consensual sluts.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Pigeon sluts.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Yes, pigeon sluts are fine. That's unlocked.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
All right. Anyhow.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
That's DLC. Pigeon sluts.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I do want to point out though, remember an OLR dream game did become a reality.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Give this a cheap plug.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
We have bungee ferret tossing.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
That's right. Bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360. That is a, it's a fucking real thing.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Yes.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Show to game bungee ferret tossing. You should consider taking that to the next game room.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Just say it'll be a big hit.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Bungee, bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yeah, we already did something with like Food Ninja and people actually got a hype on that at the conventions.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Right?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
They, they just went hysterical on that thing. They just loved it.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And they were screaming at the top of their lungs just because someone sliced like five watermelons and a banana at the same time.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I could do that in real life.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Act-a-dusted puzzle sluts two super slut edition.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
All right.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I want super, super, I want super puzzle sluts DX for matching service.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
All right. Look, we've got our Fugu question.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
The Fugu music is still playing and here we are talking about sluts.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
All right.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:35.000
We take our Facebook and our Google plus communities and we ask a question of the communities and we read some of our favorite answers.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
By the way, I just want to, well, hold on, stop the happy music for a minute.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Fucking Facebook.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Okay.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So Facebook today, after staring for months and months and months of this thing on our page at facebook.com slash orange launch radio that says you should finally put a fucking cover image on your page.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So I finally clicked the button and I'm like, gee, I have this old promo shot from like 2007.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So I put it on our, our, our Facebook page, right?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Because we haven't taken promo shots since like 2007 because look how much hair I have here.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But anyway, uh, so, so still in my hair was hot pink.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You guys, you guys look the same.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
But anyway, uh, I don't like the same.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:28.000
The thing is though, I put up that picture as the cover photo on Facebook and you can see how many times something has been viewed and the cover picture.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Facebook has shown to more people than the Fugu question of the week got seen this week.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
So that'll teach me to listen to Facebook when it says to update things.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I thought it was going to say, Hey, you know, you should update your Facebook cover image or something like that.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Like right after you put it up there.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Hey, it's been up there for a little bit.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Leave it to me.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'll make one like it new.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Like, isn't this your Justin TV image from back in the day?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And it's like, don't worry.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Mama will fix it.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Yes.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Yes.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
This, this, this, this image on our Facebook was for the Justin TV channel.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Just to give you how old that is.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Anyway, back to the happy music.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Fugu question of the week.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
It's about the Sega story.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
The dark soccer talked about earlier.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
It is, uh, uh, you know, Sega dealing with rudities on their site.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000
So we asked our readers and listeners, how much do you believe a gaming site should regulate the comments of their readers?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Should everyone get to have a say, even when that is what said is nasty or should everything be approved by a moderator before it's visible for all to see

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
or something in between.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So let's start with some of our Facebook answers here.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Uh, fifth dream says even negative comments can be made without calling names, cursing like crazy or being snotty and rude.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I think most sites should have a three strikes policy, be a jerk a few times and you get banned.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Uh, Guillermo R replied and said, I think every site should be moderated against trolling and harassment.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Not go as far as having to approve every comment, but definitely have a big ban hammer for people that don't know how to play nice.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I applaud Sega for their stance.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Andy R says, I'm fine with moderation in places like that, especially seeing as these communities often contain younger children.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Gaming needs to be more welcoming these days, not less.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Uh, Duchok, I hope I said that right, says, I feel like whichever approach you take, it needs to be consistent.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
There will always be trolls, but you need to set and reinforce expectations.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
That is the exact same thing that Supernanny says, set and reinforce expectations.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I didn't mean to make her a theme tonight, but I'm just saying.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I watched a lot of Supernanny when that was on.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Alright, uh, Jenner Johnny says, I'm all for free speech on company websites, but only if it's used in a constructive and or mature manner.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:47.000
People who use their anonymity to post unintelligent and destructive comments should be subject to moderators and or removal of said comment.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Uh, Keoki replies and says, in a world where so many people enjoy being rude and troll everyone,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
simply because they are hidden behind the anonymity of the internet, sites should moderate and approve comments,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
even if it's just to stop people from getting their enjoyment that way.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And lastly, Morning Wolf says, some moderation is in order, but as someone who moderates a set of fora.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Is that the plural for forums? A fora? I've never heard that before.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I don't know, but anyway.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I thought the plural of forum was...

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Forums, yeah, right? A set of forums.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
A set of forums, well, whatever.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I just researched this.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
As who moderates a set of fora.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
What if it's multiple forums, though? Anyway, forget it.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Alright, a set of fora. I'm interested to know how...

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
That could just be autocorrect, for all I know.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
I'm interested to know how they'll define inappropriate and personal attack.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Too many people see criticism of any kind as personal.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
A very interesting comment from someone who has a little more experience with this,

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.000
and that is, you know, this might all sound fine and good, but where exactly are they drawing the line?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Okay. The plural of forum is forums.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000
The plural fora, as in the original Latin, is chiefly used when talking about a public square in an ancient Roman city.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000
So therefore, for the internet sense, forums is correct.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Fora only refers to the physical location of a public forum.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Interesting. Well, I still think that was a teaching moment here on OLR, so there you go.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
The more you know.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Solved by the resident grammar nerd.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Alright. Anyway, going over to Google Plus in our foogle, which is a completely made-up word.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Is that in the dictionary? Alright.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Redertainment saying, not long ago, Jezebel, as well as other sites across the Gawker network,

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000
changed the way they handle comments in order to address what they perceived as a growing and pervasive problem against their commenters.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000
If such a problem exists, the people who run any website should be able to take steps to address the problem,

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
and if that includes requiring moderator approval for comments, so be it.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Sure, we'd like to be free to say what we want in response to an article with nothing to act as a hindrance,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000
but, as we all know, the anonymity of the internet has led to a high population of unrepentant jackasses online.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
That's going to be my next rock band. Unrepentant jackasses.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
The problems those jackasses cause cannot be ignored and must be addressed,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.000
even if it causes problems among those who do not engage in such jackassery.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Is that a fair use of the word, jackassery?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Yes, jackassery.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:18.000
ActDeaf says, I think that encouraging discussion should be allowed, but when things get out of hand,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
a moderator should definitely step in.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Not sure if I totally approve of screened messages, but it's their site, so they can handle it how they please.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I'm not sure if this is Brozime or Brozime, and I've probably asked this like a million times before.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I'm going to think it's Brozime.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Alright, well it's one of the two.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Repisant says, it unfortunately needs to stay the way it is.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Human moderators can be paid to take down unwanted opinions and can't possibly work fast enough to keep up on popular pages.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Inhuman moderation has the problem of misfiring like copyright claims on YouTube, so that could potentially be worse as well.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
That's a very good point. Don't let a fucking robot moderate your forum.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Ronnie B. last but not least on Google says, I think it's okay to censor personal attacks at least.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
In general, people should treat others how they would want to be treated.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Companies should also be expected to allow respectable criticisms as feedback from their consumers, perhaps to better their product.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I like ending on that comment because it reinforces the golden rule which nobody follows on the internet these days.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Treat people like you would want to be treated. Dang it.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I'll just open it up to comment in the room. What do you guys think is appropriate?

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I'd say treat people better than you would like to be treated.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Honestly, freedom of speech, at least in the United States, only applies to speaking about the government in approved forums.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Therefore, a private organization can limit the speech of whoever is using their services.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:58.000
If it is a public forum, like for example, Sega can't go on Twitter. Twitter could regulate that speech, but Sega could not.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And Twitter also, since you brought that up, they kind of need to do a better job of it too, because there's a lot of real nasty shit on Twitter.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And I know Twitter does have a report abuse feature, but it's not working.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
It's also being abused too, by the way.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Yeah, so Twitter kind of needs to fix their shit. And I love Twitter. I've embraced that since the beginning.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I think it's very smart where you basically make people speak in text messages, which I know doesn't sound smart, but it's been a great concept.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.000
But Twitter really, really needs some type of overhaul in regards to some of their policies.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
You know what Twitter needs?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
A mother.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
No, a button simply called expose.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Hmm. I could see some people using that for naughty purposes. What does the expose button do?

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Reveals their identity for a solid hour.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
But then we go back to the whole, not everybody should necessarily have to have their identities online.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Did you hear though about the, it was a paper printed, I want to say, in one of the big psychological publications.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:19.000
It was between a couple psychologists and a few sociologists who actually revealed that by classic definition, people who go behind anonymous names and tell people to kill themselves or do hate like that are criminally insane.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
They're labeled as true sociopaths.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:30.000
That given the chance for them to go around and cause harm to people physically in real life and remain anonymous, they would most likely do it.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And that's the kind of shit that Twitter needs to like, we need to be able to respond faster to that.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
But anyway.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Those are the kind of people I wish wouldn't breed.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
All right.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.000
All right. Well, if there's no other comments on that, let's move in back to our-

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I do have one comment.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Sure, please Jonas.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
With the way Sega's moderation thing, will it be similar to the way that like me versus moderating things or just-

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.000
No, it just sounds like the Sega is going to be pretty swiftly acting against people that attack people.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
You can go on there and say, all of Sonic's friends are shitty.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
You can say that because it's not real people.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:14.000
But when they say things like, let's say they post one of the developers at Sega, you know, hard at work and somebody's going to go, wow, he looks like a fugly slut.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Then that's not okay because that's a real person.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:26.000
So Sega is going to take a stance against, you know, moderate errors, taking a stance where they're going to moderate that shit and, you know, we ban you for a very long time.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:33.000
All right. Let's get back into some news and we'll get to the mailbag and your calls very soon.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:45.000
So there's a rumor now that Microsoft is testing the ability to stream Xbox games to a browser.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:56.000
According to, I guess, a tech blog, Neowin, they're saying that they're currently testing the ability to play Xbox games via the web browser.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I guess that would be for use on, like, I don't know, their tablets and stuff or whatever.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Or hey, maybe even, you know, the Xbox One since, you know, it does have Internet Explorer built into it.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Apparently it's saying, you know, Xbox 360 titles, the 360 dashboard both run in browser and with the games outputting at about 60 frames per second.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I'll believe that when I see it.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:33.000
But, I mean, I guess if it's possible to do something similar with, you know, similar technologies that they have right now at Sony.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Cool. I hope that's the case because I'd love to play my Xbox 360 games from work.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000
So this could be a very different kind of streaming thing than what maybe Sony's doing.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
You know, obviously there's PlayStation Now. They're trying to build into everything.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But that would be very interesting because Microsoft would have the capability to kind of build that into Windows in a way.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Yeah.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And through their browser.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
That would be cool even with just, like, laptops.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Like, that would get me to use Internet Explorer specifically for that.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
But that's, you know, it's a small win, I guess.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yeah. Interesting.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:15.000
But think about how much better that would be if they spent 2.5 billion dollars investing in that technology and not buying Minecraft.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
The seg in our chatroom says, and all on Silverlight.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Oh, you better believe it. You'll have to have that installed in order to do it.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Whatever.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I already have it installed for God knows what other websites I have to visit with their stupid Silverlight in there.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Could they, maybe they could just bring one versus a hundred back as a browser game.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Just do HTML5 or something.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I mean, I thought that was the whole thing with, or was all that, like, crap with Internet Explorer.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Was it beyond 10 now or something?

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Was, like, oh, because remember they had it where you can run games directly from the browser and stuff.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Like, specific IE pages or something.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Is that all running on Silverlight or was that, you know, HTML5?

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I can't remember which that was.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I think it's, like, I don't, if you're using Internet Explorer on the Xbox and stuff, like, I don't think it has Silverlight.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000
But I think it will do HTML5. I think.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Don't quote me on that, though. It's not like I browse the Internet from my Xbox very often.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
All right. Well, let's move on.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
If it does support HTML5, let's say just hypothetically that I was using that.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Could I stream an Xbox 360 game to my 3DS or, sorry, new 3DS?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
That'd be pretty cool.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:33.000
All right. Moving on. Speaking of Xbox One, the console was released in Japan.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I don't know if you guys heard, but the console did release in Japan.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
And I'm not sure a lot of people in Japan actually heard the Xbox One was launching there either.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Or they didn't care because the sales figures are in.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:52.000
And in four days in Japan of the console launch, 23,562 units were sold.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
That's kind of low, just so you guys know.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
That is way less than what the Xbox 360 sold in the region when it first went on sale there.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Which was 60,000 units in two days.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:10.000
The original Xbox was 123,000 units in three days back in 2002.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
So the Xbox One sold like a sixth of that.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
The best-selling game on the system in Japan, Titanfall, which was bundled with the console apparently.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I didn't know that they sold like a Titanfall bundle over there, but there you go.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Connect Sports Rivals sold just over 14K copies.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Dead Rising 3, 7,330 units.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Just to compare this, Act Def says kind of low. Those are almost rock bottom.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Yeah, to put this in perspective, Xbox One sold 23,500 units in Japan, right?

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000
The Wii U sold 308,000 units in two days.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
The PlayStation 4, 322,000 units in two days.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So, Xbox One kind of went over like a poop in Japan.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But this surprises nobody, I think.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
It was a very weak fart.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
They didn't do much to try.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Microsoft's not exactly trying to get Japan at this point.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000
If they want the games for Japan, just release the sequel to Galgun for the Xbox One.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
No, but seriously, they didn't honestly do anything.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
We were kind of waiting to see what they were going to announce.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
It was going to be kind of like, ooh, this is the must-have thing for the Xbox One in Japan.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
There's that one thing from Platinum Games they alluded to at E3.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
The one trailer they had.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Yeah, but that's it.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And there was really nothing besides the concept thing.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
They announced the new Monster Hunter game on Xbox One. Maybe then.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
There you go. That might get people a little more excited.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
SSG100Matt says,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Those are the type of numbers you cross your legs in pain to.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Those are the type of numbers that a good independent app on...

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Just a random app out there might sell.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
A good one.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Well, there you go.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
So apparently Microsoft is not really going to try to push the Xbox One in Japan any further.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
At least not that we're seeing.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Anything's possible, but not really expecting anything huge.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.000
But hey, to be pleasantly surprised would be great.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
If they come out and say, Lost Odyssey sequel.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I'm going to be like, God damn it, because now I'm going to have to buy an Xbox One.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Speaking of that, whatever happened to Miss Walker?

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
That is a good question. This came up on a previous show.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
They were making 3DS games.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.000
The last thing I remember them doing was Last Remnant on the Wii, which was a very late Wii.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
You mean Last Story or Last Remnant?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Sorry, Last Story. Thank you, Last Story, not Last Remnant. Thank you.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I was going to say Last Remnant, that was on PS2 or PS3.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Shit, I have that in my Steam library and I haven't even played it yet.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
That was Square's first Unreal game, I think.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Yes, it was.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Let's see, other games by Miss Walker.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Terra Battle is Android and iOS.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
That's a terrible name for it. Terra Battle.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I mean, it's Terra Battle. I mean, it sounds like terrible.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
But that's an Android and iOS game.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
The last console game they made was The Last Story on the Nintendo Wii,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
and before that was Blue Dragon on the Nintendo DS, the Awakened Shadow.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
So things have been kind of quiet on the Miss Walker front.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I think they're still going.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I don't think they have folded, but they must be focusing.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Yeah, their website's still up and going.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
They've got a little thing for Terra Battle, and party with Terra Battle's artists.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
So I guess that's their big thing right now.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
A lot of stuff I see on here is about Terra Battle.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Is it Terra Bad-al?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
I don't know. I have not played it.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Are you checking it out on your phone right now?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
No, I'm sending Grandpa an email.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Hi, Grandpa.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Well, Dark Soccer, you might have to put a break in your email here and do the next story.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Well, this is actually really, really awesome stuff.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
The 2014 Women in Games Hall of Fame inductees have been announced.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
We have King.com's...

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I'm going to mispronounce her name.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Katharina Lavers-Mallet and Marie-Claire Aissaman from the Norwich University of Arts

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
are the latest inductees that were included.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.000
This basically was put into effect in 2011, sponsored by EA,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000
and it's part of the European Women in Games Conference that took place yesterday.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000
So they're definitely giving some more recognition to some very deserving ladies.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I don't know if you know this, but is there actually a physical hall of fame,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
or is this more a spiritual thing as part of this convention?

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I don't know if it's a spiritual thing or not. I would think that it is.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
But you can get more information at womeningamesjobs.com.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:00.000
It made me think about at the Sony Metreon back when it was the big place to be for PlayStation,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
they started a gaming walk of fame there, and they were trying to make it like...

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
It was supposed to be the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it would be in San Francisco,

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and then two years later is when the PlayStation Store closed and all that stuff.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I don't even know if it's still there, the Walk of Fame. I doubt it.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
The Gaming Walk of Fame. I don't know.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But anyway, sorry. You talking about not to hijack your story, Darcyro.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
It just kind of made me think, like, oh, I wonder if it's maybe a physical place I can go and learn more.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
But a lot of times these things are kind of more spiritual.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I don't think so much. Yeah, but go check out the site.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Okay.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Learn more.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Sounds good.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
We need more, I would say, women not just in the development arena,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000
but definitely in the reporting and the coverage analysis, the business behind it,

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
without having someone wiggle their finger at them and accuse them of doing things.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Mm-hmm.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
A little bit more respect, guys.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
All right. Loki.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
All right.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Oh, sorry. Sorry. The SAG has a report. Sorry, Loki. The SAG has a report.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Oh, man. The Walk of Game.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
No, it's now a Target. All of Target.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Oh, there it is.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
So the Walk of Game is now Women's Lingerie Department.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I thought that I read that they were going to bring that to, like, a convention or something like that.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Maybe.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
They were doing something with that or something.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Because that confused me. I'm like, how do you move that?

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Well, you move the slabs somewhere. You don't have to have the whole sidewalk move.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Anyway.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Anyways, moving on.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
So, Oculus Rift.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Apparently, the Oculus Rift consumer version will be out by summer of 2015.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Cool.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
And priced somewhere between $200 and $400.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000
They're saying it's also going to have a high resolution and a 90 hertz or a higher refresh rate.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:58.000
So, yeah. I'm excited to see what comes of that and what they're going to do with it once it actually launches.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Next year's going to be a big VR year because I bet Morpheus will be what we're going to talk about for PlayStation 4 holiday as well.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So this is going to be very curious to see what the pricing looks like on those and, you know, what the games are looking like.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
And very, very interesting.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And I fully anticipate a Virtual Boy 2 coming out of Nintendo.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And with the same type of graphics, too, because you know how Nintendo just doesn't quite get it right away.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
So it's going to be, you know...

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Well, to be fair, the 3DS was kind of ahead of the time a little bit.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.000
I mean, 3DS gaming kind of came and went, but now it's kind of a thing again with all this Oculus stuff.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I mean, it's different, but...

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Diego, comment?

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I remember when Game Gear was ahead of its time.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
That thing lit up the entire room, that light.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Yeah, and it also single-handedly kept Energizer, EnduraCell, and business for all the batteries that thing ate through.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yes, it did.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I think it was like a power generator. It could probably light up the entire house.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I think the person that invented rechargeable batteries owned a Game Gear.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I think that's the only plausible explanation.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
There's got to be a better way.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
There's got to be a better way.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Too much power.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Well, now it's just that Nintendo, was it their Wii Remotes, I think, do that.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Unless they improve that in the Wii Remote Plus.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I don't own one of those, but the original Wii Remotes, man, they'll just nom on those batteries even while you're not using it.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
That's Nintendo for you.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Well, speaking of all these VR things, you know, we talked a little bit last week about the Samsung Gear VR that has the Oculus built into it, right?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
And it's going to be, you know, one type of, like, you know, kind of baseline Oculus, if you will.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Well, Harmonix is actually going to be creating a VR experience for the device.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And I think this makes most of us in the room kind of perk up, because I know a lot of us are music game fans, and Harmonix does a very good job with their music games.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So, Harmonix Music VR, it's a music listening, dream-like experience that uses the company's music analysis engine to generate VR world elements.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It's a visualizer that you can basically be in with VR. That's kind of neat.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
A comment here from Steve Janiak, the CEO of Harmonix.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Harmonix has always been interested in creating fundamentally new ways for people to interact with music.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:22.000
There's an incredible amount of potential for this with virtual reality, and Harmonix Music VR is just one way we can deliver on these types of innovative experiences.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000
We can't wait to hear what people think about this new way to experience the music they love.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000
That's totally, like, one-ups the beats thing. That totally one-ups that. We'll see.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I think it would be cool if they brought their first person shooter over. I think that would be good.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Chroma?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Yeah, Chroma would be a good thing.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Did they kill it off?

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000
It was Alpha, so they're still working on it.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
It's on hold for a little while.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Maybe they'll put frequency on this. Who knows? No, I guess they can't, because the whole Sony tie-in.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Yeah, Morpheus.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Or Amplitude. No, it's not Amplitude. They're bringing it back.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Same thing. Same thing. Yeah, maybe they can put that on Morpheus. Who knows?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Mailbag at Orange, excuse me, participate at Orangelaunchradio.com. This place is in his emails.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place where our mailbag is located, and Dark Soccer is going to dive in to the mailbag.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It's all sticky.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Well, I thought it was really empty when I looked. It was very dusty in there.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
It was, and it's making me log in again, so hold on.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
So Dark Soccer is going to get her can of compressed air.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I'm going to get some bleach.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Dusty out the mailbag there, and read some of your emails. Or email, as the case may be.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Two.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Oh, two emails. There was only one when I looked earlier.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Well, that's what you get for only looking once.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Hi, OLR. It's the Nasty Canasta.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I just wanted to inform everyone about the Binding of Isaac Rebirth finally getting a release date.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
November 4th for Steam, PS4, and Vita.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
The date was announced through a trailer so surreal it was too hot for Steam.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Seriously, it's about as weird as P.T.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
If you can spare 90 seconds to watch and creep out your listeners at the same time, here's the link.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Which we're probably not going to do.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Yeah, I'm going to skip over that just because I don't know if it's an audio-visual thing. I'll have to check that out later.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Here's what I will do though.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Google it, people.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
I am copying the link, and I will paste it in the chatroom in a moment.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
There you go.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Nicholas is being quite generous with the release of Rebirth.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
The game will be given away to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:35.000
And if you own the original Isaac on Steam, you can take advantage of a 33% loyalty discount toward Rebirth before it's out.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Have a great night, the Nasty Canasta.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
And I'm going to go post that link in the chatroom real quick.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Sounds good.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I don't have a whole lot else to say on this except, you know, Binding of Isaac, it's a really weird game.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Like, it's kind of scary, odd, disturbing.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
And Smash TV-like.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:01.000
But, yeah, you make the mistake of thinking it's Zelda when you first see the interface, but yeah, it's way more like a Smash TV or a twin-stick shooter type of thing.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yeah.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
But it's fun.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Makes me wish I had a way to hook up my twin sticks to it. I have Dreamcast 2 and 6.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.000
But I'll check out the expansion because it probably won't be very much because, you know, Isaac was very reasonably priced game.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.000
And showed up in all these Humble bundles and things like that.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Is the Binding of Isaac Rebirth?

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:30.000
But, you know, now that I think about it, though, if I have a way to hook up my Dreamcast keyboard to my computer, chances are I might be able to hook up my twin sticks to my computer.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Somebody's written a driver for it, I'm sure.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I have to play this with my twin sticks for Virtual On. Oh my god, it must happen.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Hey, OLR, it's Brozime.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Which I'm going to stick with Brozime.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:52.000
As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Please use punctuation.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Have you... I'm going to restart this and imagine proper capitalization.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Imagine a world where people don't write emails on their mobile phones.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Because I'm trying to phrase it properly and I can't... I'm phrasing it the way that it's written.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So I have to stop.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Breathe in, breathe in.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Okay.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:24.000
As someone who recently got into the Persona game series and with the release of two new titles coming up, what do you guys think about the series?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Have you played any of the games and do you like them?

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I haven't played a single one. I have a lot of friends that are into them. I might play one. That's it.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Oh, I thought that was the email saying that.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Actually, yeah, I must admit Persona's a series I kind of have missed out on. I haven't really played a lot of the games.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I think Shane's super into it and I know other people out there too that are really into it. I haven't played an awful lot of it.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
My understanding is the last one was on the Vita and I didn't really get into that.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I keep seeing Persona 4 really cheap.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I know it was on PS2 and it was on PS3. I just, for whatever reason, never got around to the series.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.000
I never really got into it, but I have a lot of friends that are into it who have been trying to get me hooked and no.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
How about our anime game room guys? Are you guys big on Persona at all?

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
No? Blank Stayers? Not really?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Exactly, no.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Mike Jonas, please.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Not really, though. We have shown Persona 4 arena the fighting game for one of the tournaments.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Ah, okay.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
There you go.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Alright, yeah, sadly, you know what? We've kind of missed out on it too, but I'm keeping tabs on it. Something I'll catch up on eventually.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
And by the way, correcting your grammar is how I show love.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Also, Rob, last week you said you've been playing Dragon's Crown on Vita. Period.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Are you looking for anyone to play with?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Probably not on the Vita. I'm going to see if I can still grab it for free on the PlayStation 3.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I don't know if there's cross-play or whatever, but yeah, sure, I'd play that. I thought the game was pretty rad.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I've got the game on both PS3 and Vita, and wouldn't mind an excuse to play more.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Well, there you go.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I'm going to play some more for Dragon's Crown.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Yes, I own the game.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
You do? Yeah, that's nice. Good artwork.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Yeah, artwork.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Remember, grammar correction is love. I correct your grammar because I care.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I know.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
That and bad punctuation really makes emails hard to read.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Alright. Well, there it is. Is that it for the emails tonight?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
All two of them.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Only if you're going to write from your mobile phone, please take your time.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Alright.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.000
It really is not that hard to switch over to using the period. Just saying.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, appropriately enough.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
This is fucked up.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I don't know.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
FU to adjusting to my new schedule.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It's not all that great working on Saturday, but I also don't mind having my weekdays off.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And FU to situations on behalf of my friend who just lost her children.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Oh, no.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I have them taken home.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Oh.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
That's... Sorry, my mind went to, like, lost, lost.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
No.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
But still, I mean, that's still very unfortunate.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I'm not going to name names or anything. It's a private thing.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Sure, sure, sure. Of course.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:53.000
But I'm sending out my love to my friend because I think that it was a misguided and incorrect accusation I led to it.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Oh, boy.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
So I am thinking very positive thoughts for her and her family.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Okay. Complicated.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Alright. Well, you know what, Jonas? I know you love the FU segments. Why don't you go next, buddy?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:14.000
FU to those who keep posting misinformation and hashtagging important information and stuff.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Or, like, important news that posted on Facebook or whatever.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Again, people, if you want to educate people about your opinion, please get your sources right.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I don't want to hear another Ferguson where people are posting videos that are, like, one year old or videos that actually have...

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:37.000
that took place outside the state of the... where the locations are.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
That just... It doesn't educate people. It just adds more ignorance.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000
People love to be ignorant on Facebook.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Or just in general, though, because then...

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Yeah, but I see more of it on Facebook. Like, the proportion of ignorance, like, outside the computer and what I see on Facebook, it's not the same. Anyway.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Anyways, I don't want to deal with people getting angry over the wrong information.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Another big fuck you to everyone spamming smash codes advice.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I have smashed codes. Here's a code. Burger.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
What?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000
What?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Smashburger.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Oh, God.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Not everybody has that chain is going to get the joke. Oh, my God.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Let's see.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Another F you to...

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Pretty much anybody who tries to just kill George just any conversation whatsoever.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.000
It's, like, it could be the happiest and people just completely killed you with complaining and moaning and whining and bitching.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Oh, like Debbie Downer?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
You seen that Saturday Night Live sketch, Debbie Downer?

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I haven't seen that. I actually haven't seen that.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Oh, you got to look it up. It's hilarious.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:52.000
But in general, it's like, if people are that miserable, get some help. Just seriously, get some help.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
All right, Jonas, I got to cut you off on a three hour show. All right, Loki.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.000
F you to Microsoft and their stupid Windows update auto restart.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:14.000
If you don't turn it off and you get a nice 15 minute countdown and that's basically saying, listen, you have 15 minutes to save your shit and I'm just going to restart your computer.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:20.000
There's no way to click that off. You know, like I'm in the middle of a podcast or something and I need to not have that happen.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.000
So I had to actually jump in and stop the service from running twice because the first time it decided, hey, I'm going to do it again.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:37.000
So that's really annoying and they really should have a way to stop that from happening because I don't need to be granny through Windows updates.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:45.000
In fact, the fact that they have as many updates for Windows anyways is just annoying. So I got to manually shut that off now.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Diego, you want to go?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Right now, I actually F you to my carrier right now because Sprint likes to do what it wants to do.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Yeah, it seems to go on and off and I don't know, I can never have a connection and I do have a fast connection.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And whenever I go to Fanime, which is another convention that we do, it seems to just completely shut down.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:13.000
I'm completely useless at that point that I can't even talk to anyone. I might as well be dead.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.000
It's amazing how much we rely on mobile phones too. Like that's just, I mean, we have to have that.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Oh, right. And when you have so many people in, especially conventions, especially conventions anyway.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Yeah, especially when you're in there and people are using all the phone, all their phones at the same time, spamming up the air with all these waves. It's just crazy.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Also, F you to some people at the con who just don't realize that they should take a shower.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Welcome to Confunk.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Especially that, especially just the sound or the motion of just seeing sweaty bodies go around and not just having the correct personal hygiene.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:21:01.000
At least not even using the proper amount of soap for a proper amount of cleaning of itself. After that it just gets into more nastier, creamy details.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Let me, let me ask this as, cause you guys do the, the game room and stuff. Are there certain people where like after they touch the controllers and things you like, as soon as they turn around, you go for breeze.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Like, is there, is that like a thing?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.000
It's like degreaser. I mean, sometimes that pretty much becomes our new cologne. If you think about it.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I mean, after the whole incident with Jonas's a we string that looked like someone just, I'd be like, fuck it to the guy who pretty much floss his ass with it.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Sorry. That's a little too much there, but that's what happened. That's what it seems like happened.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Wow. All right. I'm cutting you off too. All right. Uh, let's see my, a few of the week, my a few of the week goes to the fact that, um, I, I, I'm trying this lifestyle adjustment where I'm eating a little differently, which has been good because I've lost a whole four pounds this week.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Sorry about the candy corn. Not sorry.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Yeah, but I ate that bag of candy corn anyway. But also as a result of this eating change that I'm clearly not doing very well on, uh, I haven't had a taco all week.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Like F you to the lack of tacos in my life. It's, it's depressing. And like Jamie had to go and say Jim boys earlier.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Ah, he's the one who brought it.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Jerk.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:24.000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on past the FUs of the week. Let's get to a few more stories for you guys. And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. But first, Loki.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:37.000
If you have a PSP and no other system, you're going to be in trouble if you're in Europe or Asia because you're going to lose access to the PlayStation network starting tomorrow. Too bad.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I mean right now then probably.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Yeah. So, uh, yeah. So apparently, you know, of course they, um, halted the production of the PSP, um, back in June of this year in Japan. Wow. That's been going that long in, I guess January, um, for North America.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:05.000
But I don't know. Hopefully most of you have like a, you know, a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 and you can download stuff with that.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I was going to say, those of you that have a PSP Go are really fucked at this point, aren't you?

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Oh shit, yeah.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Cause you can't even use discs.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Oh wow, yeah.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
That's, uh, life sucks for you.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:27.000
I'm surprised we haven't seen that, like, you know, that headline, you know, on, I guess no one's realized it because everyone forgot about the PSP Go.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I didn't forget, Loki.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
I didn't forget.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Never forget.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Never forget.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I got overshadowed by PS Vita.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Yeah. I just, yeah.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Completely.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:54.000
My recommendation would be, um, if you really, really want to use your PSP and, I guess, get a Vita. I mean, you can transfer all your digital purchases over that way and, uh, shit, they've got to be coming down in price at some point soon since, uh, you know, PlayStation TV is going to be dirt cheap, so, you know.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Right.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Or get a PlayStation TV if you play at home all the time.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
There you go.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Alright, and, uh, lastly, uh, kind of a sad note to end the show on, but, uh, you know, when there's a passing in the game community, we like to take a minute to acknowledge their contributions to the community and this is, uh, this is really strange timing because, um, I did this as a Classic Game of the Week just a couple months ago.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:29.000
I don't remember the episode number off the top of my head, but it was a week that Dark Soccer wasn't here because, you know, when she's not here is when I, myself or Loki, end up doing the Classic Game of the Week and just a couple times ago, I picked Lode Runner, that's L-O-D-E Runner, as the Classic Game of the Week.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Uh, 1983 was when this game came out and the creator was a man named Douglas E. Smith, who unfortunately passed away this past week.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Um, so, Tozai Games, who currently holds the license, which I'm sure is developing probably like mobile phone, because, you know, they are still making Lode Runner, uh, but, you know, even when Sierra was doing it, it just wasn't the same as the, uh, classic, classic game, which was not only a platformer run and use ladders and get the gold bars and everything, but it was also, uh, had a level editor, which at that time, you know, 1983 was practically unheard of in games to have, like, a full-on level editor.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
So, uh, very, very tragic to hear about this.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Um, so, uh, yep, just a reminder, Lode Runner began being developed by Douglas Smith during his time at the University of Washington.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:30.000
The prototype was originally called Kong, and then the finished version was called Miner, but Broderbund finally distributed it as Lode Runner for the Apple II, the Atari 8-bit, the MSX, and the Commodore 64.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Uh, Lode Runner Classic was released in 2012.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:42.000
That was, uh, on the Xbox Live and all that stuff, I believe, and had some features in the original version that Broderbund Software distributed.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000
So, uh, rest in peace, Doug Smith, who passed away this week.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Very sad to hear. Somebody made a level with his initials, D.E. Smith.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I guess it's a memorum type of thing.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Alright, uh, that is going to do it for Stories here, but that means the Skype line's open if you want to call and talk about anything we've discussed tonight.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:08.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000
And some folks in chat reminiscing a bit about Lode Runner.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
SSJ100Matt says, I've been kicked out of the computer lab in school because of Lode Runner many a time.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:24.000
We never played Lode Runner in the computer lab at school. The thing that we always played the shit out of was Scorched Earth.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Scorched Earth and... What was the other tank game before that? Like, VGA tank or something like that?

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I don't remember.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Tank VGA? We need to livestream some Scorched Earth sometime. That would be...

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
That would be awesome.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
That would be fun, wouldn't it? Think we can still get the shareware version of that somewhere? I don't know.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Alright, well, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Local residential convention whore DJ Rama S.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Hey, Rama. How you doing?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I'm doing pretty good. How about everybody in that studio?

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
We are doing fantastic.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Doing good. Hello, DJ Rama S.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Better now that you're here.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Hello.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Awesome.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
What's up, buddy?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Alright, there's a couple of things I want to talk about, then I'm going to get the heck up one out of here.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Now, you mentioned Con Funk earlier in the show.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I didn't mention it. I didn't mention it. Diego, our guest. That's Diego from the big anime game room.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Hi, there. I sure did bring it up.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000
So Diego understands the struggle, because I've been doing anime cons for God knows how long,

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:26.000
and if there's an arcade room with a DDR machine, you go in there early in the morning or late at night.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Other than that, yeah, you're going to need to change your clothes when you get out of that game room.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Oh, you better believe it.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Yes, because check this out.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:42.000
In a few weeks, New York Comic Con is going to be upon us, and everybody's going to be there, except for me because I got issues.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Wait, I'm not going to be there. Do I have issues?

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
No, you're on the West Coast. You're exempt.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Okay, cool. Good.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I'm 45 minutes away from this convention, so...

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And you're not going because you have issues?

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Issues are the fact that I'm not losing a day's pay to stand in a line for 8 to 12 hours for a badge,

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
and if you don't believe me, Google New York Comic Con badge lines.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
You'll see people standing in front of comic book shops for hours just to get badges.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I made a typo, and I typed Anime Expo badge line, and it got the same thing. Imagine that.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
No, no, he's on the right track.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Actually, it's more or less the same damn thing.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
No, this guy's on the right track, I concur, because the same thing happened at Fanime.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
It was something called Line Con.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
2013.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.000
2013, hence the word 13. Unlucky number right there. It was really bad.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
People were in line for 7 to 8 hours. They were just so mad.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000
They were coming into the game room they were running, and they were like,

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
So, did I make it to this? So, did I make it to that?

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I'm so sorry, but this just passed about an hour ago, and they were so pissed off

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.000
that it created more tension and more sweaty bodies that made much more odor than there should be.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
It's like a fucking skunk.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Exactly. Made my level...

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Did you get sprayed?

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I think I drenched myself in an entire bottle of Febreze.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.000
It was just a big bathtub. I just had to get out of that room after a while.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
You know how they have those spray bottles with water and a fan on it?

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
You just put Febreze in there instead.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
See, but here's the thing.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000
You can't do the Febreze because there are people that are actually literally allergic to some of those chemicals.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
You have a problem and a lawsuit on your hands.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
That is true.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
The list of line cons. Anime Boston 2008.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I was there for that!

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Oh, there you go.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
But here's the thing. Here's the thing, though.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I was working the dealer's room, so I had no idea what was going on.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
So I came out there, and I was like, Holy shit.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:56.000
And if you go to Anime Boston's forums for 2008, someone wrote a parody of Still Alive to Anime Boston Still In Line.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Well, it's okay if they sue you anyways.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:03.000
You can always settle for just an extra hour in the ball pit, so it's okay.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Oh yeah, my convention is getting a ball pit just for that.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000
We've kind of fell off the beaten path here, but here's the thing.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
There are a bunch of volunteers, and I salute them.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:24.000
They are handing out free deodorant at New York Comic Con that says New York Comic Con on it.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Sponsored by deodorant.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
As long as it's not Axe.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:34.000
It looks like it's actually, you know, the dry roll ain't no spray.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Wow.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:42.000
And you know someone's gonna be offended by this, and to that I say, well that person must stink the holy high hell.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Oh yes, I had my fair share of smelly. Oh gosh.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Oh my gosh, it's just like, just stand under some hot water at least, if nothing else.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Okay, well, geez Rama, thank you for stinking up the show, I appreciate it.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I stunk it up in a positive way, at least I'm not as bad as some of those people who are selling Smash Brothers codes for 50 bucks a week.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Oh no.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Now that stinks.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:18.000
It does stink, but you know what, I wouldn't do it because not for nothing, like almost everybody here in the chat room and in the studio, we all got bills to pay.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.000
That's right, we got bills to pay, we got, you know, things to buy from the store, like deodorant.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Are you kidding me? Those people won't even think about buying that, they're too busy spending all their money in the dealer's room.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Alright, I gotta let you go buddy so we can get more calls.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Alright.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Alright, later, bye.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
For the record, my husband uses Axe, so.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I do too, and you've never said anything about it, so you know what.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
You just need the GameCube and the...

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
It's the guys who bathe themselves in the spray.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I don't bathe myself in it.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000
That's just gross.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Alright, let's get to another call.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio, who's this?

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Legend of Zaku here.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Hey Zaku, how you doing?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Oh, not much, just recovering from any possible jet lag incurred as a result of coming back from Tokyo after spending ten days there the past couple of weeks.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Welcome back!

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Okay, Nasai.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Did anybody smell on the plane?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I mean, it was just like, all I know is that aside from a minor bout of motion sickness heading there from Vancouver, the flight back was a lot easier for me to sleep on.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
I freaking love Vancouver, but we'll get into that another time.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
How was Tokyo? What'd you see there?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Pretty much the usual spiel of stuff, and not to mention all the arcades in and around the areas, even close to where we were staying.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Since let's just say that, in a nutshell, it's just vending machines, packed subway cars, fancy arcades, UFO catcher spoils.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Case in point, one of these that I managed to win at the UFO catcher.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.000
What is that? A model initial D car or something like that?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Oh, it's an actual RC.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Oh my god.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Yup, an actual RC car that I wanted the UFO catcher.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Wow, they give away some pretty nice stuff in those things.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Now, how much did you have to burn to get that? Alright, don't answer that.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.000
It was only a hundred, it was on my first try, a hundred yen.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Wow, alright.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:23.000
So, tell us about, okay, so you've been big into arcades over here in the US and you've kind of seen them rise and fall.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.000
What kind of struck you as different with the Japanese arcades versus US arcades?

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Holy hell, just the fact that the rhythm gaming scene is still thriving there.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And not to mention the fact that even other types of arcade games, like the Gundam Pod one,

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:51.000
where you sit in this huge pod-like cabinet where you open the door and you sit on a cockpit and you move controls just to play around.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000
And more importantly, 2DX machines are just like at least more than one in every single arcade.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
And it's all ordered and you can smoke in the arcades.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
What? Oh my god, that can't be...

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Yes, there are smoking sections in the arcades in Tokyo.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
That's like casino status right there.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I know, I haven't seen smoke in the arcades.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Yeah, it's exactly like casino status. Same thing with the pachinko parlors.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Oh yeah, the pachinko machines, that's right. I was going to ask about that.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Yeah, I tried, but it's like...

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Where I was staying at, it was really hard to understand how to actually put money to get the actual balls.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I mean, I played it before in the past, but it was too much of a hassle, so I just like bailed and went to the nearest adores,

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.000
which is one of the arcades, chain of arcades there, aside from Taito Game Station or the Sega Club.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000
So yeah, I was pretty much in and about all the major places, including but not limited to Akihabara.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Were you there for the Xbox One launch then?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.000
I think I actually, yeah, I was there during that time, like the day of the launch,

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.000
I was actually in Shinjuku, me and my girlfriend were in Shinjuku and Big Camera,

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.000
one of the big malls, you know, one of the big chain stores there.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And yes, they were like Xbox One folks handing out flyers.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:16.000
It was pretty depressing because there was only like one or two people playing demos in there.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Yeah, it was that bad. I mean, everything else like PS4s and whatnot were selling pretty well,

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.000
especially the PS3 games that I managed to grab. Oh shit, it's all the way.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Wait, were you there for the launch of Smash Brothers then?

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Because that just launched on what, Friday?

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.000
No, no, no, I actually came actually flew back on Friday. So I was actually, I wasn't there.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I was close. I was seeing those ads on the subways heading there, you know, when I was,

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
you know, when I was out there, I was seeing all those subway ads for Smash Brothers all over the place.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:56.000
But no, it was by the time I left, it pretty much launched.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000
So other than that, it's just the usual, the usual stuff.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.000
The Gundam statue, the Imperial Palace, Mount Fuji.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Oh, one of these days, one of these days I need to get over there.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Did you do like a touristy tour type of thing or were you there visiting like some of these relatives?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:22.000
No, we stayed in a hotel, but most of it was just me and my girl kicking around in the subways.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Except for the one day that we did like a tour up to the Ghibli Museum

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.000
and then a full day tour to Mount Fuji, Hokone, the big area, the mountainous areas.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Sounds like fun.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I know, it was, well, yeah, it was definitely fun, not to mention cheap food, cheap liquor,

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:47.000
UFO catchers everywhere, convenience stores, as far as the eye can see, vending machines,

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.000
especially the same thing they used to get into the subway you can use to get stuff from vending machines

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:59.000
and UFO catchers, it's ridiculous. It makes New York look like Atlantic City.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Yeah, I heard you can get pretty crazy things in those UFO catchers.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Yeah, I mean there were plenty of things, I mean some of them are, like the really good ones with the good prizes are kind of rigged.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Like there was one in Shijuku that had like tablets and PS Vita's and 3DS's, but I knew they were rigged.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Well, Dave Busters rigs it too, come on.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Yeah, but that depends on the actual chain, like most of them, the way you actually win at the UFO catchers,

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:32.000
you have to play the foreigner's stick. In other words, if an attendant sees you playing the UFO catchers

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:40.000
and you try to, you know, you do your best to try to get the prize out of the, you know, try to get the prize into the chute,

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:47.000
and you fail, what they will do is they will try to reset the prize, but they will try to set it up so that way

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
it's very easy for you to just grab it and push it into the chute.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Because that, in their minds, that pretty much, you know, that translates into word of mouth.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Because then you'll have a good experience and then you'll tell your other friends that you won big at those UFO catchers

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.000
and they'll multiply.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Just like you told us and bragged about your little RC car that you got.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:14.000
No, my girl made out with even more stuff. I was trying to get like the portable battery chargers

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:23.000
and all the other, all the other like high-end items, but yeah, I think we spent like one or two hundred,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:30.000
we spent almost the equivalent of one fifty to almost two hundred bucks on UFO catchers alone throughout the entire trip.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
That sounds like our soccer and crane machines back in the day, but anyway.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I didn't spend that much and I got like eight things out of that one at Walmart.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Alright. Zaku, I gotta let you go because you're making me jealous more and more by the minute because I've never been to Japan.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
But take care buddy. Glad you had a good time.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Yep.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Alright.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Yep, I definitely did.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Alright, take care.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Yeah, like a bandit.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Bye.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I want to go to Japan.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So do I.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
You never been either?

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000
No, never been there.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
It's not just me.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Only in a dream.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Only in a dream.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
I don't know, the culture shock would be so hard though. Like I don't speak a lick of Japanese.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I mean, you've heard me do Japanese release dates on this show. I don't speak a lick of it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Oh yeah, mine's horrible too. It's just...

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Like if a Kumbu JP isn't there to help me out.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
You'll have too hard of a time finding people who speak English.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
I guess that's true.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
But, anyway.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Alright, 187...

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Oh, I shouldn't even bother saying that because it's already lighting up all over again.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Let's get back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Hey, Kaijuto. What's up to you, my buddy?

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
I'm going to keep this real quick.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Alright.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I can't hear anybody. Can you say something again?

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Yeah, hi. Hello.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Alright, there you go.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Alright, yeah, I'm going to make this real quick.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Sure.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.000
The thing about Smash Brothers and the 3DS, I'm getting it for the 3DS and I'm only getting it for the 3DS.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I don't know what people are complaining about with the little screen.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I've been playing Jump Ultimate Stars for god knows how long and that was basically Smash Brothers before we got Smash Brothers.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000
It was for the original DS and I still play it to this day.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:00.000
I remember back in the day when the DS came out, everybody was crying for a Smash Brothers port.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Now we got it and now you have people complaining about something as lousy as a screen.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Every week, Nintendo is surprising me with the stuff that they're doing.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Like I said last week, it sounds like they're listening to the fans and they're giving us what we asked for and I appreciate that.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
That's all I have to say.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I didn't play any of that stuff.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Here's the thing, I didn't think the Smash demo was terrible by any means.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000
It does get a little crazy when things zoom out.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:35.000
All that crap aside, there really isn't a lot of differentiation between the 3DS and the Wii U version.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000
I'm not seeing the urgency to get both.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.000
I'm kind of like, I'll just get the Wii U version that better fits my lifestyle.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I happen to own a Wii U anyway for other stuff.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Unless I have a bunch of friends that are going to have the 3DS version, I'm not really feeling that urgency.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:56.000
I can wait for the Wii U version. It's only going to be another 6 weeks.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000
For me, if I did have a Wii U, I don't have a Wii U.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:03.000
If I did, I would actually get two copies of the game.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000
The main reason why is because I do like to play multiplayer with friends.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:14.000
From what I know from past experiences with Nintendo handhelds, that can get very expensive.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:20.000
If you actually have friends who don't actually have the system, you would need to let them borrow one of your 3DSes.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000
You would also have to buy an extra cartridge, which I've done before in the past.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I've actually had multiple cartridges so that if I had someone over, we could play multiplayer on a 3DS game that you can't play anywhere else.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Just for that reason alone, I would get it for the Wii U.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:42.000
I know that I can just play local multiplayer and everybody around the television, and that's about it.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.000
But it's not for screen size. It's just basically so I'm not broke.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Will Smash Brothers not have the whole, you can beam a limited copy of the game to somebody else?

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Yeah, but that's always crap. You're probably going to be playing as, what was the thing with the Mario Kart?

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
You play like a little ghost dude, who's that guy?

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Yeah, that's right.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.000
It wasn't that bad though, considering the other person...

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
No, it sucked.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.000
That was fun because it was like, you could still join in the game and such.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Yeah, but your cars always sucked. Everything was default. You're just like a default character.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:23.000
The DS version was kind of broken, because once you figure out snaking, it's impossible to catch up on anybody.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000
True.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:31.000
I played someone on DS, and they had the robot. What is it, Robbie the Robot? And they did that snake crapping.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Yeah, but I gotta go.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Alright, I appreciate the perspective, Kaijuto. Enjoy the game.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Alright, later.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
I should have asked if you had the demo.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Okay, if you guys want to code this one, but I was more like, if he's already had a chance to kind of sample it and see if it's what he's hoping for.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.000
But yeah, I mean, I forgot about that Jump Ultimate Stars, which I actually have played.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.000
But for me, it was one of those things where I was just like, hee hee, this is funny.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:02.000
I wasn't feeling the urgency to buy it or whatever, but that's cool.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:10.000
I've been getting some of the feedback on the new Smash Brothers, since some people have been testing out the combinations and so forth to try and get better at the game.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:17.000
And people, of course, I can understand what he was saying, Kaijuto was saying about the critics and stuff, but him just focusing on this game.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000
And saying because people have done this from the past since the first game and ground up.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000
And just experimenting on them and all that stuff to see how the differences are.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Because some say it's toned down or it's gotten to a point where it felt like it went back to the first game, it's felt.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
That's what some people say that it feels.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Interesting.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Alright, we have one more call coming in. I guess this will probably be it for tonight and then we'll wrap up.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio. Who's this?

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Hey, this is Agdeft.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Hey, Agdeft. Thanks again for that code. You rock.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Well, I feel like a dealer now because last week, there was a factory and now the Smash Brothers code.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Wow, Agdeft, you're literally ruining my life. Well, I gotta let you go. I'm just kidding. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Well, I just wanted to add to Caillou's call right now.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Especially because the string complaints people are having are pretty legit complaints.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000
I have played the demo, of course.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:23.000
And I don't have that problem that much, but it's still a problem. I can see it.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:36.000
And I was talking to Bobby on this earlier on his show that with all the action, what's happening on the screen, especially with four players, even with three players, it gets a real frenetic.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:44.000
And it's kind of hard to follow where you are or to locate where your character is.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Do you have an XL or do you have an original DS?

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I have an XL.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:59.000
See, Bobby's rocking the original 3DS and I can't imagine how that's gotta look. I mean, I kind of want to see it now. I don't even know anybody that has an original 3DS.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:08.000
But I can imagine it's gotta get tricky when it's three and four people all zoomed out. I can see where that gets really annoying.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Yeah, and I have played on a normal DS. Not the Smash Brothers demo, but I have played other games on a normal DS, like the other of them.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:31.000
And I look at the screen and I'm like, oh my god, this is really small. Even looking at the original DS screen that's even smaller, I really don't know how people are gonna play at least comfortably with multiple people.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Maybe one person or another person. Yeah, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay. But playing with four or three, yeah, it's gonna be really hard to see.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Bobby actually chimes in on that too in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying the screen size complaints are definitely a personal problem.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000
For some people, it's okay. For others, like me, it's not. So, you know, a lot of it is personal preference. Diego wanted to jump in with something too here.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Yeah, I believe they were also discussing about making a new XL with the C-Stick on it. I think specifically for this game as well, I believe.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Well, is that that new 3DS? That's a whole other thing because, you know, now they're talking about games that will only be playable on that.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:22.000
And then I guess the thing with Smash Brothers, the thing I was hearing is that you can't post to Miiverse in Smash Brothers because the system can't freaking handle it unless you have a new 3DS which does have the processing power to be able to do it.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Yeah, that's right. Interesting, huh?

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Yeah, and speaking of the new 3DS, it seems like it's going to be released for Smash Brothers especially because it definitely serves a lot of the people's complaints about the C-Stick, maybe the screen.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:53.000
But I don't think that much because if I remember correctly, the screen is going to be the same size for both bottles, the normal and the XL.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:54.000
I'll remember.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:03.000
I'm wondering how that C-Stick actually feels because it looks really tiny and it doesn't look like, remember with the little analog sticks they have on the PSP and everyone fucking hated them?

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:11.000
It's still so weird to me that Nintendo, like, you know, Nintendo's got to know how rabid their fanbase is and it's like, it's no freaking secret.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Japan's getting a new 3DS. Like, why won't they comment more about, like, are they going to do it or not for America?

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Like, even if they're just kind of like, oh, well, we're evaluating the market. At least I'd like to hear something like that.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:31.000
They're keeping, they're definitely their fanbase because they don't want to, fans do not want to see that controller change, especially for the Wii U.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
That's why they put in the adaption for the GameCube controller.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Not only that, I was going to say, not only that, but they also, you know, they just put out or announced a bunch of exclusive new 3DS systems that they're going to have available that they obviously want to sell.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Oh, right.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Also, they're not going to say, oh, hey, save your money because a new 3DS is coming. They don't want to tell anybody that.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.000
They want you to buy that system and they go, oh, I want that system, too.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000
And I really want the NES one, but GameStop's exclusive.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Oh, yeah, I saw that one, too.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:08.000
It's a picture of a Nintendo controller on the top part of the DS. Like, when they did that Game Boy, it was, what, the Advance SP?

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Yeah, the Advance SP.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
That one was rad because you opened it up and it looked like an NES one.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Yeah, the flip one.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Yeah, that one was cool, but this one doesn't look that inspiring, but I don't know.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Yeah, and he was going off the one about the NES one coming out next month as well.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
That's pretty cool as well. Like, really retro.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Anyway.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000
All right, well, Act F, any other thoughts before I let you go?

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.000
And did you talk about how the 3DS is going to function as a control for Snatch Brothers?

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.000
It came up briefly when we were talking about the demo, but what are your thoughts on all that?

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:52.000
I think it's pretty cool. Using a 3DS controller, especially, it's something that should be done more frequently for especially games that aren't on both consoles.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:59.000
It's almost like I suggested that on this show a few months ago. Who knew?

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:10.000
It's almost like it should be something that's just built into the fucking system that should be just a controller that can be used for any game and not just, you know, this one particular game.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.000
All right, Act F, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call, buddy.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:19.000
All right, have fun smashing. All right, later.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:25.000
All right, and I don't think I really asked him how he liked the demo, but I guess there's always next week.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:38.000
All right, I am going to close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through, please feel free to tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, or you can always send us an e-mail as well, participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Speaking of Twitter, I didn't see it light up a whole lot this week, although I did get a little bit more taunting about the whole Mass Effect on Wii U thing.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Just so you guys know, I bought my fourth copy of Mass Effect 3 last week live during the show because I now own it on four different platforms, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and now Wii U.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:05.000
And so, of course, everybody's giving me shit about it because it's like, dude, you bought the same game four times, and I'm just like, you know what, you don't know me or my life.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Pika Uno tweeted saying, just wanted to chime in with the support. I, too, would buy Mass Effect Trilogy if I had the money, the Wii U, and less cents.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:22.000
I'm not sure that was totally a support, but thank you.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Let's see, Dartitsuya said, I want to give a plug to Construct 2. It's a game programming tool for those that can't get the hang of Unity. Great for 2D retro games.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Oh, well, programming for dummies sounds right up my alley, so I'll have to check that out. Construct 2, I'll check that out.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Loki, any last minute stories for us tonight?

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Uh, no.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.000
No? Alright.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000
I don't have anything important.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Dartitsuya, how you doing?

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000
I'm talking to Marissa.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Hi, Marissa!

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Marissa's in chat, and I love her to death.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:58.000
I love her to death, too. Well, I mean, I wouldn't want her to die. I just love her a lot.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:06.000
I love her with the crushing force of a thousand black holes.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Wow, you should write, like, Hallmark greeting cards.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:16.000
I love you with the force of a thousand crushing black holes.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:19.000
And then I'll put the formula inside.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Then there's a picture of a kitten. Alright.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Anyhow, that is going to do it, then, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Hey, guys, thanks so much for visiting the show again this week. I appreciate you guys stopping by. Feel free to come by anytime.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Definitely. Our pleasure.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Be sure to throw out the plugs. How do we find out more? If I'm in the Northern California, Northern Nevada region, probably Portland at some point, region where you guys travel, how can I keep tabs on you guys?

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:55.000
We have Facebook, Twitter, official website, obviously.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
And where would that website be?

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:01.000
tbagger.org.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Alright, sounds good. Thank you guys very much for being here. Diego, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Actually, not exactly. No, not really. Nothing coming to mind at the moment.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Just a very, very zen...

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Well, besides going back to the Congo, just try and keep clean.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Yeah, wash your ass, for God's sake.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Please do. And don't floss it with things that need to be played on.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Alright. Jonas, your final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Oh, yeah, I have a couple of Smash codes, but not for Smash Brothers game.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Shut up. Alright.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
You're not welcome here anymore, you tease. Alright, I'm just kidding.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:56.000
You just need to make a video that says Smash codes, and you write down codes, like, you know, the Konami code, and you take a hammer and smash it.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:05.000
My final thought is, you are all super dumb right now. Just saying, I don't often feel like the smartest person in the room, but right now, I'm getting close.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Alright, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Good riddance to bad rubbish on my Facebook page.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Oh, Snapples. This sounds like some drums. Some drums.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I just have a particular issue with people who only pick and choose, quote, facts to believe, and don't accept that, yes, there may be good, but there are also bad.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Understanding both sides of this is what makes an intelligent person.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Wait, people think differently than I do?

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Exactly, that's why one version of the soundtrack for Sonic is better than the other version, I'm telling you.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Oh no, did you drop Bobby as a friend, are things gonna get awkward?

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:47.000
No, I don't give a shit which version he likes.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
He can be wrong if he wants.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:59.000
And isn't that how we should all get along? If you want to like the wrong version of Sonic, then you know what, you go right on ahead, that's your right, but you are wrong in that right.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
I'll just play some Sonic 3D World.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:11.000
I'm just gonna put it this way, if you can't see the flaws in the thing that you are supporting, then you can't be a true supporter of it. You have to know the flaws to be able to know what to make changes in.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.000
So what are the flaws in Orange Lounge Radio?

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Me not having a taco.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I eat all the tacos.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.000
And on that note, that's gonna do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the program and spending time with us. Hey, if you like the show, you know what we ask, please tell a friend or three or fifteen about our little program and help spread the word, because we don't have like a million dollar magazine or website backing us.

All we have are our big ass mouths, and your big ass mouths, helping spread the word of the show.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Thanks a lot. Be nice to each other when you're playing games online. Remember, there are human beings on the other side, and for the love of God, do not swat people, or Supernanny will spank you in the town square.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Think on that for a little while. Until next week, good night.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:03.000
