0	17400	This week gamers may hate everything, but that list includes gender inequality.
17400	21480	Feedback convinced the IESF to open a gender neutral division for their esports competitions.
21480	23280	Also, ClickDB returned, hooray!
23280	25240	Gears of War 4 did not confirm.
25240	27720	We'll explain on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27720	34980	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34980	36600	where every gamer has a voice.
36600	45240	It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday July 6th of 2014 with the 559th episode of
45240	46640	our show.
46640	51200	We are here over the next few hours to talk about video games with you guys in our chat
51200	56040	room live.voggenetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific
56040	59120	at 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
59120	64120	In studio, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie
64120	65120	Summers.
65120	66120	Uh-uh.
66120	67120	Uh-huh, uh-huh, you're here.
67120	68120	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
68120	70560	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
70560	71560	You kind of tired.
71560	72560	You're tired.
72560	75320	You were very peppy during the Bobby Black Wolf call a little earlier though.
75320	77280	Yeah, the caffeine's already starting to wear off.
77280	78280	I see, you had your cup of coffee.
78280	81040	I had orange chicken tonight and it makes me dead inside.
81040	85720	Are you excited to go to convention with Rob and Alan this weekend, GamerX?
85720	92760	I'm too busy to be excited because of cosplay props and the fact that I had a moment of
92760	99280	stupid and forgot that, um, spray paint dissolves styrofoam, so I'm having to make a new skaia
99280	100520	for my giant fork.
100520	101520	Oh no.
101520	104800	Are you going to tell us a little bit about your cosplay or is this a surprise?
104800	105800	It's not a surprise.
105800	112040	I'm cosplaying as, uh, the crocoteer Jane from, uh, uh, Homestuck.
112040	115360	Which is why I had to, when you said the character, my eyes glazed over.
115400	116400	I totally cleared it up.
116400	117400	Oh, hi, Techmaster Loki.
117400	118400	How are you?
118400	119400	I'm fine.
119400	120400	Hey, I'll come back to you in a minute.
120400	122800	Now, Dark Sucker, who is this character for those that don't know?
122800	131320	Jane Crocker is the heir to the Betty Crocker, uh, uh, corporate monopoly of the universe.
131320	132880	Like the people that make cakes?
132880	136760	Yes, except it's really a troll who is the Batter Witch.
136760	137760	Okay.
137760	138760	The Batter Witch.
138760	139760	Okay.
139760	143240	So anyway, there's your fandoms are so strange, but all right, you know what?
143240	144240	I watch Big Brother.
144240	145240	It's totally trash.
145240	148480	So she has this, her, she doesn't have a laptop.
148480	154180	She has a tiara top and she gets taken over after she's already got here, which makes
154180	157320	her kind of evil.
157320	159480	I don't know why, but Homestuck sounds like that.
159480	163400	It sounds like that game that you play where like you have a folded piece of paper and
163400	167340	somebody writes one line of a story and then you fold it and somebody writes the next line
167340	170080	of a story and you fold it and somebody writes the next line.
170080	175160	And then you have like this total like mishmash hodgepodge, like random crap story that comes
175160	176160	out of it.
176160	179320	And somebody, if you'll follow the story, it makes sense.
179320	180320	I understand.
180320	185080	It's especially when you go back and go, Oh, that's what that weirdness was from.
185080	186080	I'm not a hater.
186080	189760	I'm just, just saying it's, well, this is the time to get into it because we're at the
189760	190760	gigapause.
190760	191760	Okay.
191760	194460	Do I, should I even ask?
194460	196640	Because the Homestuck game is under production right now.
196640	203240	So put the final, uh, arc of the story on pause until the game is done because people
203240	206160	paid $2 million for it through Kickstarter.
206160	209080	Oh, so that's a little bit of an obligation to make the game.
209080	210080	I see.
210080	212320	So yeah, we're getting Homestuck game.
212320	213320	All right.
213320	214960	And no expanded universe for you.
214960	219360	Oh, there's also, um, there's actually a new comic series.
219360	222560	That's like little mini comics that expand on different things going on in the Homestuck
222560	224720	universe called paradox space.
224720	225720	All right.
225720	226720	You know what?
226720	227720	We all have our fandoms.
227720	228720	We all do.
228720	229720	All right.
229720	230720	I am looking forward to seeing your cosplay.
230720	233280	I'm sad the animal crossing villager thing never panned out.
233280	235240	I was, I could still hit you with a bug net.
235240	236240	Oh yay.
236240	237240	All right.
237240	238240	Really?
238240	242000	All I have to do is wear clothes and carry a bug net.
242000	246760	Maybe, maybe we can hit up a fabric store really quick and try to try to figure out
246760	249880	how to make that caught like one of those really funny hats they wear in the game.
249880	250880	Okay.
250880	251880	We'll figure something out.
251880	252880	All right.
252880	253880	Anyway, uh, tech master Loki's here as well.
253880	254880	Of course.
254880	255880	Cause you heard him earlier.
255880	256880	How you doing Loki?
256880	257880	Doing fine.
257880	261040	Which fandoms do you have that other people probably wouldn't get?
261040	264000	Um, I don't think I have any.
264000	265000	No.
265000	266000	Yes you do.
266000	267000	Yes you do.
267000	268000	Before the show, before the show, you were talking about that you're going to take a
268000	272680	day off of work in August to go see, that's not weird.
272680	274600	I think I would do it.
274600	277760	There's a lot of people that are looking at that new movie going, eh, I don't know.
277760	281220	I guess, I guess it is looking a little better the more that comes out about it.
281220	285640	It doesn't look as horrible as some of the ideas first thought, but I don't know.
285640	287440	So you're like super into Ninja Turtles though.
288000	289000	I'm not super into it.
289000	292560	I mean, I haven't watched any of the stuff that Nickelodeon's really done.
292560	295760	Um, I'll just go see the movie.
295760	296760	I liked the last movie.
296760	298960	I was just kind of sad they didn't really continue on with that.
298960	299960	Everyone hated it.
299960	303880	I don't understand why I thought it was, it had the perfect vibe to it.
303880	306120	I thought to use me in Ninja Turtles always made pretty good video games.
306120	313120	I used to love the cartoon when I was a kid, um, it could be worse than some of these other
313120	314120	movies.
314120	316720	Like I just watched, um, was it World War Z?
317120	323200	Yes, the zombie movie where they kill the, or they cure the apocalypse with meningitis.
323200	327240	I heard they totally changed the movie version from the book though or something.
327240	329640	It was so stupid, but whatever.
329640	332160	Um, so I don't know.
332160	337680	I don't really care that it's Michael Bay doing the movie and stuff as long as it doesn't
337680	339240	seem too cheesy to me.
339240	341960	You know, like the Transformers movies were just kind of retarded.
341960	342960	I don't know.
342960	343960	Mm hmm.
343960	346360	So I, and painting game was good.
346360	347680	I mean he did that.
347680	350680	So bad boys was supposed to be pretty good.
350680	352480	So was he Independence Day?
352480	356800	Oh no, that was the, that was the Emmert guys who did Stargate and stuff.
356800	357800	Yeah.
357800	361720	No, they have, was it that Pompeii or some bullshit, I don't even know if that's come
361720	362720	out.
362720	363720	No one, no one cared about that.
363720	364720	Yeah.
364720	371120	It's like, no, I think after, what was it, what's the last movie that they had the last
371120	375520	disaster movie with, uh, what the hell was that?
375520	379920	Uh, the Mayan apocalypse apocalypse or I don't even know what the fuck it was called.
379920	382680	Was that the one where like they're trying to take out, yeah, 2012 and they're trying
382680	384560	to take off from the airport.
384560	388480	They outrun an earthquake like three times in an airplane is like, okay, this is such
388480	389720	filler right now.
389720	390720	It's ridiculous.
390720	391840	But okay, whatever.
391840	398240	Um, I just, but see that movie though, those kinds of movies are just, you know what to
398240	399240	expect in the end.
399240	400240	You know what?
400240	401720	I am totally psyched for independence day too.
401720	402720	Who gives a shit?
402720	403720	Is that actually happening?
403720	404720	That's actually happening.
405720	406720	Who gives a crap?
406720	407720	Who cares?
407720	408720	I don't care.
408720	409720	All right.
409720	410720	I will see that.
410720	413720	I'm, I'm really sad though because Harvey Firstine, his character died in the first
413720	415040	one, or at least it's implied.
415040	419040	Maybe he somehow survived, you know, because that was, that was the character to root for
419040	420040	the full bonkers.
420040	424360	I mean, it's in the future now, maybe they've rebuilt him to cybernetic, you know, Harvey
424360	425780	Finds.
425780	426780	Maybe it involves his mother.
426780	428920	Cause you know, in the first movie, I got to call my mother.
428920	429920	Yes.
429920	434520	And he can be dressing in drag as his mother.
434520	435520	And better.
435520	436520	Yes.
436520	437520	Was there a video game for independence day?
437520	438520	Oh yeah.
438520	439520	It was terrible.
439520	440520	It was PlayStation one.
440520	442240	There's always like interesting movie game tie-ins.
442240	446560	We'll talk about that in a minute here, but I got to go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com
446560	451000	because of course we do tape live at Sunday nights at the voice of the East network, voggenetwork.com.
451000	455720	Blender's a fan of world war Z, the book saying the book is awesome.
455720	456720	Let's see.
456720	460400	Tigerclaw would like you to know Loki, Michael Bay is not directing it, but act after saying
460400	462680	Michael Bay is involved and that's enough.
462680	463680	It doesn't.
463680	465280	I see even that I don't really care.
465280	471360	I mean, it's just like eventually it's statistically possible that M Night Shyamalan will make
471360	472360	a good movie again.
472360	478240	I mean, so that will happen someday, but it's just like Michael Bay, you know, I don't hate
478240	479240	everything that he does.
479240	483520	I just hate the transformers movies, like the last few of them, cause they've been really
483520	488920	just kind of stretching that franchise then it's just not really about the transformers
488920	489920	anymore.
489920	492420	It's just kind of this thing that they spun it into.
492420	496000	That's what I don't like about Michael Bay, but his movies are fine.
496000	504300	I know going into it, I expect a very low intelligent, lots of explosions action movie
504300	505380	and that's what I get.
505380	508780	So I'm not let down by Michael Bay.
508780	514820	It's just when they start making testicle jokes in transformers 2 that's a little kind
514820	519020	of like, okay, this is a little weird.
519020	520020	Let's see.
520020	529820	I did not realize, well, Jack Bauer is soon going to be, soon going to be solid snake.
529820	531700	So you know, that guy's everywhere.
531700	532700	Even soon.
532700	533700	He already is.
533700	534700	Yeah, it's true.
534700	535700	He is.
535700	536700	So, uh, let's see.
536700	541420	A dark to Tia says, I don't think the Bay TMNT will top the 1990 original, but I don't
541420	543260	think it'd be any worse than TMNT three.
543260	548940	Hey, I am a little TMT three kind of had like camp value because I had a little bit of that.
548940	549940	It's so bad.
549940	550940	It's kind of good going on.
550940	551940	A little disappointed.
551940	553180	Casey Jones isn't going to be in the movie.
553180	554180	Oh really?
554180	557700	Um, but I guess they have to save stuff for sequel and I know they were talking already
557700	559740	for the sequel, like Bebop and Roxy.
559740	561740	So I'm, I'm down with that.
561740	562740	There you go.
562740	566540	Um, so we're talking a little bit about, uh, you know, games based on movies of, or that
566540	570560	we bring up this topic once in a while, but I think it's good as we get a lot, we get
570560	574180	into the big summer movie season to kind of revisit this once in a while.
574180	578780	Like what are the big movies that are out there that you're really surprised don't have
578780	581020	like a video game behind it?
581020	583900	Because for me, like whenever I think about that question, especially now, like these
583900	587540	past couple of years, I'm always surprised there's not really a video game for the hunger
587540	588540	games.
588540	591340	And yeah, I know there are some, there's the iPhone games.
591340	596300	I do know there's that, but I don't, I mean like those really just seem like totally different
596300	597300	ideas.
597300	599740	I mean, essentially who's the target audience.
599740	600740	That's the thing.
600740	601740	I know, I know.
601740	605580	But the one hunger games game that I can think of was basically a two D temple run that just
605580	608620	had a hunger game stuff slapped all over it.
608620	609620	You know what I mean?
609620	614380	Like I would like to see like a legit, like multiplayer you're in the arena type of thing.
614380	617580	Closest thing you're gonna get to that is the Minecraft mods where you can play hunger
617580	618580	games in that.
618580	619580	Yeah.
619580	620580	And that's actually pretty cool.
620580	623140	You know why they won't do one, right?
623140	628340	Because it's because kids, why wouldn't there be a battle royale video game?
628340	629460	Yeah, that's true.
629460	633220	I realized that kind of subject matters a little iffy, but I mean, catching fire, I
633220	634220	hope this isn't spoiler.
634220	635220	I don't think it is.
635220	641580	The catching fire does involve adults, not kids still, you know, fairly young, still
641580	642580	teenagers.
642580	643580	Hmm.
643580	646460	They could, they could find a way to work into the video game to make it less controversial.
646460	647460	I don't know.
647460	651220	I mean, it worked in the movie without being like, you know, those movies aren't like offensive
651220	652220	or whatever.
652220	655440	Remember people categorize movies and video games differently in this country.
655440	659300	And those people are dumb, which is, you know, which is always a little weird to me, always
659300	663860	a little weird to me, um, dungeon buster in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
663860	668640	says X-Men days of future past should have gotten an X-Men legends or Marvel Alliance
668640	670140	kind of game.
670140	671140	Yeah.
671140	675700	There hasn't there, has there been a new X-Men game to support this, these, this new movie?
675700	676700	I don't think there has been.
676700	679700	Activision used to do the licensed movies for the Marvel properties and stuff.
679700	680700	Yeah.
680700	684600	Now they aren't, um, cause they used to do all the sorts of movie tie-ins and even their
684600	685600	own things.
685600	690580	And they tried rebooting like the X-Men with, uh, I remember the last X-Men game was, but
690580	692100	it wasn't very good.
692100	697060	Um, and I think they've just kind of given up on that, although they will, they occasionally
697060	702980	will do the quick cash-in on movie franchises, like the walking dead, which was terrible
702980	706860	or, um, the fast and the furious, which was also terrible.
706860	710740	That walking dead one in particular was always so weird to me because you had two walking
710740	711740	dead games.
711740	717300	And I think I get it because Telltale licensed the, the original comics, right.
717300	721260	And then Activision licensed the show and that's why you had the two walking dead games.
721260	722700	One of them, fantastic.
722700	725140	The other one, absolutely awful.
725140	726140	Yeah.
726140	729580	It's in the fast and the furious game was just ridiculous.
729580	730580	It was just stupid.
730580	733300	Um, and, and Activision will do that.
733300	737380	They will, you know, make a quick buck on some of these, you know, licenses and stuff,
737380	740460	but they just haven't done that recently.
740460	744920	I think the closest that you've gotten to new superhero games recently is probably the
744920	747100	Lego Marvel superhero stuff.
747100	750620	That's really, I mean, those are actually not bad.
750620	754700	It's just all the Lego games start to kind of blend together eventually cause it's all
754700	755840	kind of the same form.
755840	756840	It's a formula that works.
756840	757840	Yeah.
757840	758840	They have the same sense of humor.
758840	760100	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
760100	762420	Um, let's see some comments in our chat room.
762420	765320	Tiger class as most movie tie in games were mobile games.
765320	766320	That's that is true.
766320	767320	That's true.
767320	768320	The X-Men had a mobile game.
768320	770420	I want a Pacific rim fighting game.
770420	776460	There they had won a Pacific rim game, but it's X-Box live arcade and PlayStation network.
776460	777460	It's shit.
777460	778460	Oh, sorry.
778460	779460	That's too bad.
779460	780460	Yeah.
780500	782940	It's like street fighter two, the movie, the game.
782940	787220	I think it, at least I think it was those platforms and not just, um, I could be confusing
787220	788660	it with real steel.
788660	793500	Um, but it was both of those games are actually very similar and it was just not very good
793500	794580	at all.
794580	798920	Um, going into current events, uh, something we were talking about briefly last week, act
798920	804140	deaf in our chat room says Activision is why I'm weary of platinum's legend of Corey game.
804140	805140	Hmm.
805140	806140	Uh, let's see.
806140	809980	It's some, there was some talk in chat about, uh, let's see, Blender says, Pulp Fiction,
809980	815140	the game, bring out the gimp bonus around, uh, blueberry responded and said, isn't basically
815140	817940	saints row Pulp Fiction, the game.
817940	821300	It used to be, um, now it's just fucking nuts.
821300	822300	That's the thing.
822300	825100	I mean, seriously, no, it's saints row five.
825100	826100	It's fucking nuts.
826100	828100	It's no seriously there.
828100	829100	You go and play.
829100	830740	I mean, do yourself a favor and go play.
830740	835820	I think one of the best in the series was saints row to at least best when it was kind
835820	840660	of still hinges around the fact that it's a gang, then they're, you know, fighting to
840660	845500	get their territory back and that kind of stuff, um, with, you know, the wacky kind
845500	852020	of mini games and stuff and just the humor and see the part of, I think the saints row
852020	856380	series that they've lost in three and four was the brutality of like, cause it's a true
856380	858780	to you fucked up.
858780	863020	Like those gang leaders, like when they got revenge, they got revenge in the most fucked
863020	864020	up ways.
864020	867060	And then there was one where this guy ends up killing one of your crew members.
867060	871380	So we do you kidnap his girlfriend cause he's a monster truck, you know, um, monster truck
871380	877020	driver and you, you, uh, stuffer in the trunk of one of the cars that he's going to crush
877020	878220	and he kills her.
878220	882340	He forces the gang member to kill his girlfriend for people.
882340	884340	See that was just like brutal.
884340	889780	But in, you know, three, it's just like, it's just got ridiculous.
889780	893980	And in four was just, it's not even, I don't even see that as part of the series.
893980	896220	Any more ridiculousness is what appealed to me though.
896220	899220	Because like that's, that's all I ever played the grand theft auto games for.
899220	900220	Yeah.
900220	905420	But like two was it, two had a good balance of ridiculous and like still kind of grounded.
905420	911340	I mean it wasn't, it was, I mean you had the septic Avenger where you'd spray poop on people,
911340	913180	you know, with, uh, with a septic truck.
913180	914180	And that was awesome.
914180	916540	That was absolutely awesome.
916540	920340	And they had, you know, the ability where for no apparent reason whatsoever, you're
920340	924900	going to have the ability to, you know, uproot things off the, you know, the street and
924900	925900	use them as weapons.
925900	929220	So, Oh hey, look at that, you know, fire hydrant, I'm just gonna rip it out of the ground and
929220	930220	hit people with it.
930220	931820	That was, that was awesome.
931820	934140	It just made no sense, but it was awesome.
934140	940880	But being a, you know, uh, the president of the United States and being trapped in a virtual
940880	946040	matrix world and stuff and being a superhero, it's just so ridiculous that it's just kind
946040	949900	of, I don't know, it's like, it's like they wanted to make a different type of game, but
949900	951180	they had to make a saints row game.
951180	955580	It's like, Oh, well we have to make a saints row, you know, sequel, but I really want to
955580	956580	make crackdown.
956580	958580	It's, that's what it seemed like to me.
958580	959580	All right.
959580	961740	Let me read a few more comments here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and then
961740	964540	we'll get into our gaming weeks and tonight's gaming news.
964540	969740	Um, let's see, uh, Blender says, surprise, nobody mentioned Firefly.
969740	975220	Now it usually does come up in these types of conversations about what, you know, movies,
975220	978940	which I guess technically the movie was serenity, but y'all know what we're talking about.
978980	983180	Uh, what usually that's that whole universe comes up as something that could be ported
983180	984180	to games.
984180	987820	And it does seem very surprising, you know, because it's very clear at this point, not
987820	993180	even Netflix and Hulu and Yahoo, not even Yahoo screen or whatever saved community.
993180	994940	Not even that is going to say Firefly at this point.
994940	997000	I mean, all of those actors have moved on to other projects.
997000	998220	It's getting older and older.
998220	999220	Right.
999220	1003060	But I'm really surprised that like the story couldn't continue in a tell tale esque kind
1003060	1006980	of episodic game, you know, classic point and click adventure type of thing.
1006980	1007980	There were comics.
1008020	1009380	Yeah, I guess that's true.
1009380	1012340	There were a lot of the weed and stuff has been continued in comics, hasn't it?
1012340	1013340	Yes.
1013340	1014340	Sadly for Buffy.
1014340	1015340	Yeah.
1015340	1018580	You know what would make a really awesome movie, I think is Borderlands.
1018580	1023700	Borderlands has a really good kind of, uh, you know, environment and characters and just
1023700	1024700	that humor to it.
1024700	1025700	I think that'd be really good.
1025700	1028740	I got to see a little bit of the tales from the Borderlands at E3.
1028740	1032020	We, we were lucky enough to go to a telltale presentation for that where they played through
1032020	1033700	the first 20 minutes of the game.
1033700	1037420	And I must admit my knowledge of the borderland bland universe is not very deep.
1037460	1041460	I have familiarity with both games, but I just never got like sucked into them the way
1041460	1045260	a lot of other people have, but I was still able to follow the game that they were playing
1045260	1046260	well enough.
1046260	1047260	And it was amusing.
1047260	1048260	It had its parts.
1048260	1052820	And I, I was very, um, kind of taken aback how the art style worked so well and the way
1052820	1056460	the game looks in this completely different type of game.
1056460	1060980	So there's that, you know, the tales from the borderlands is shaping up to be pretty
1060980	1061980	interesting.
1062020	1066620	Um, anyway, uh, also go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com.
1066620	1072620	Um, Kaijudo said most video game movies are bad, so I'm glad they seem to be making less
1072620	1073620	of them.
1073620	1077660	And blueberry jumped in saying, I agree with Kaijudo, I don't miss the console movie games.
1077660	1080620	They had zero ambition, negative ambition level.
1080620	1085500	See they didn't use to like, I remember back in the day, like what the Batman game on the
1085500	1086500	NES was awesome.
1086500	1087500	Oh yeah.
1087500	1091820	Uh, the star Wars, super star Wars on super Nintendo was like some of the best platformers.
1091820	1094180	Both had a claim to these.
1094180	1095180	Yeah.
1095180	1096180	I knew their shit.
1096180	1097180	Yeah.
1097180	1098180	They did.
1098180	1099180	When it came to those games.
1099180	1100180	I mean, those games are on point actually.
1100180	1102620	Now that I think of it, claiming a ton of fucking awesome use all the Simpsons games.
1102620	1104860	I mean, those are just fantastic.
1104860	1105860	Yeah.
1105860	1108300	Some of those Simpsons games really weren't bad.
1108300	1113380	Like they seriously knew how to take a franchise or your license and make a decent game out
1113380	1114380	of it.
1114380	1115380	But they had a few stinkers too.
1115380	1117580	I mean, they, they didn't, they didn't bat a hundred.
1117580	1127060	He did do a, the Barbie games, which, all right, um, all right, let's get into, uh,
1127060	1128060	our gaming weeks.
1128060	1132200	Cause we always like to, uh, towards the top of the show, establish our frame of reference
1132200	1136060	and where our heads are at this week by talking about what we have been playing this week
1136060	1137060	in video games.
1137060	1138060	Dark soccer.
1138060	1139060	How was your gaming week?
1139060	1144660	Well, um, I, I've actually hardly touched my DS except to do puzzles, you know, for
1144660	1145660	shoot pass.
1145660	1152700	Um, I played some final fantasy 14 yesterday, finally finished the rescue quest.
1152700	1163060	Now I don't get another quest until 49, which sucks cause I'm almost a 47, um, there, uh,
1163060	1168580	drew was at my, uh, uh, July 4th party.
1168580	1173060	I was like trying to say Friday something, but it was Friday, but it was also July 4th,
1173060	1178060	um, and brought over the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure game for PS3, which was pretty cool and about
1178060	1180340	as over the top as I expected.
1180340	1183860	Um, and you guys are kicking some classics on the 4th of July too.
1183860	1191420	We had some super Mario world going on and Julian was introduced to children's in time
1191420	1196460	and got frustrated in through the controller, which meant no more super Nintendo for him.
1196460	1197460	Right.
1197460	1200740	At least, at least they used to build the controllers to take a beating back then who,
1200740	1203700	which one of us didn't throw a super Nintendo controller back in the day?
1203700	1204700	He said it slipped.
1204700	1205700	Of course.
1205700	1206700	Of course.
1206700	1208780	I said slipped with a lot of force.
1208780	1209780	No.
1209780	1215420	So anyway, um, but yeah, he got introduced to turtles in time, which is like one of the
1215420	1216740	best games ever.
1216740	1222860	And I, uh, excuse me, I got, then you took a nap.
1222860	1223860	No, I'm sorry.
1223860	1228860	I got that adventure time game, the, because I don't know, oh, the, why are we in the dungeon?
1229380	1230380	How is that?
1230380	1232620	Let's do the dungeon because I don't know.
1232620	1235940	Um, I actually need to have my controller hooked up to play it.
1235940	1237940	Let's explore the dungeon because I don't know.
1237940	1238940	Oh, okay.
1238940	1239940	Whatever.
1239940	1243220	Anyway, I've heard very mixed things on it and mostly negative, I gotta say.
1243220	1247420	It looks cute, but I haven't really gotten to play much of it.
1247420	1252180	Um, I, I have, I just found the controller to hook up to it.
1252180	1256940	I'm gonna try to play a little bit, but I have cosplays to work on, so no.
1256940	1257940	Fair enough.
1257980	1261620	I have blue balls on my desk.
1261620	1262620	Okay.
1262620	1263620	Hemispheres.
1263620	1264620	I have blue half balls.
1264620	1268340	You're going to have some vog balls next week at, or this coming weekend at GamerX to give
1268340	1269340	out.
1269340	1273980	I will, I will, uh, keep them close to my heart and then throw them out.
1273980	1274980	Sounds good.
1274980	1275980	All right.
1275980	1278500	If that's it for your gaming week, let's check on Loki.
1278500	1279500	How was your gaming week?
1279500	1281220	Um, I didn't play a whole ton.
1281220	1287300	I did play, um, Mario Kart Wii because I did borrow that from you and, um, I tried to get
1287300	1288300	my son to play it.
1288300	1289420	Of course, he wanted to watch.
1289420	1290420	I did.
1290420	1291420	Actually, he played it a little bit.
1291420	1294180	And to be clear, you're not talking Mario Kart 8, the newest one you're talking about
1294180	1295180	last year.
1295180	1296180	Mario Kart Wii, yeah.
1296180	1303540	And, um, I tried using that Wii wheel, you know, like, I, at least I had him using it
1303540	1304540	and stuff.
1304540	1305820	That thing is fucking terrible.
1305820	1308700	I don't know why they'd ever try to do that control scheme.
1308700	1310380	It was just, it's god awful.
1310380	1314260	It's a little hokey, but they try, I guess, you know, kids really get into it.
1314260	1315260	Like, they really get into it.
1315260	1317700	I understand that, but, like, it's super hard to play it that way.
1317700	1322340	Did you know that Mario Kart 8 will let you use, like, the Wii controller in the same
1322340	1323340	way?
1323340	1326220	Like, you can still use the wheel in Mario Kart 8, and you can use the gamepad screen
1326220	1328260	as, like, a giant controller, basically.
1328260	1329260	Yeah, no thanks.
1329260	1333780	I don't need gyro controls for, you know, that type of game.
1333780	1336540	Again, I think it's kids versus adults.
1336540	1341060	Like, you and me, we want that precision that comes with the more, like, you know, tactile
1341060	1342700	response and feedback.
1342700	1346820	But I think for a kid, you know, who just spins the wheel everywhere and just watches
1346820	1348660	their car drive in circles, it's fine.
1348660	1354060	I'm actually interested in trying to, now that I've, you know, have that, since my system's
1354060	1359300	still modded, I'm trying to actually, to load in the custom tracks that people have made.
1359300	1362500	I've actually watched some videos of it, although a lot of those custom tracks aren't very good
1362500	1366640	that people have made, but it's still interesting that you can do that.
1366640	1370940	And there's even tracks in there that I forgot were in there, and so it was, I don't know,
1370940	1375100	it was kind of fun.
1375100	1379100	I don't know, I still like, I do like how they had the Mii integration stuff in there,
1379100	1382660	where your Miis are in the background, so I kept pointing out to them, like, well look,
1382660	1386420	see, you know, there's mommy in the background right there, you know, she's driving that
1386420	1389500	car and, you know, there I am right there.
1389500	1392980	So that was kind of fun.
1392980	1397060	And then really, that was, that's all I played this week, because I was, you know, working
1397060	1400180	on game stuff.
1400180	1403860	Once again, now I'm trying to still skim by with, you know, just learning a few things,
1403860	1405980	but it's like forcing me not to.
1405980	1412840	So I started learning how to write shaders, which, you know, that's basically the language
1412840	1420180	that you use for telling how to draw stuff on the screen, so you can have, like, reflections
1420180	1421180	and all that fun stuff.
1421180	1425240	And when I hear, like, shaders, it makes me think about, like, drawing the shade and those
1425240	1426860	sorts of, like, yeah.
1426860	1432220	It's working with, like, you know, lighting and stuff like that, so I'm making a really
1432220	1436180	custom shader for what I need it to do.
1436180	1439480	So I've been trying to figure that out, and originally I was gonna, you know, cut corners
1439480	1444740	and do it as a surface shader, because that's, the language is very, it's high level, so
1444740	1445740	it's really easy.
1445740	1449780	You just put, like, you know, lighting on, diffuse, yes, you know, and that, you know,
1449780	1450780	just really simple stuff.
1450780	1456280	But I can't, I have to do it as a vertex and fragment shader.
1456280	1463560	So I have to learn everything to actually do it instead of just skimming, you know.
1463560	1468720	So once again, I went through the whole surface thing, and I kind of learned how to do that,
1468720	1472480	and then I went back, because I had actually started doing the vertex fragment stuff first,
1472480	1474040	and I was like, I don't get this.
1474040	1477560	And then I went back to it, and I kind of understand it a little bit more now.
1477560	1482040	And now I'm actually trying to write it as I'm kind of watching the tutorial series,
1482040	1483960	and it's helping.
1483960	1489020	So I kind of understand why things are being done in certain ways and stuff.
1489020	1494780	So I'm hopefully gonna get that done, and then, once again, the goal is to create assets
1494780	1496480	so I can keep moving on with the game.
1496480	1500800	But at the same time, I'm kind of learning how to do interesting things, and once again,
1500800	1505880	I came up with some really high concept, you know, idea of something I could implement
1505880	1506880	in there.
1506880	1510080	I'm like, I don't really need to do this, but that would be so cool if I could.
1510080	1512440	And so, we'll see, I don't know.
1512440	1514280	Well good for you for still sticking with it.
1514280	1515280	Yeah.
1515280	1516440	Have more time, so.
1516440	1520040	I imagine at some point we should probably address something you've been tweeting about
1520040	1521980	this week as well.
1521980	1527240	You found out this week that a lot of your news and information you've talked about on
1527240	1528360	this show has come through.
1528360	1533680	You know, your work, you work in gaming distribution and so forth, but this week.
1533680	1540860	This week, we found out, see, here's the thing, it's funny, because we were told one thing,
1540860	1544820	they put out a press release saying another thing, and you know, I think they were trying
1544820	1550820	to spin it so that it wouldn't seem so bad on the one company, but basically what happened
1550820	1553940	is the owner of the company, he wants to get out.
1553940	1560380	He's been doing it for 30 plus years, and he's not young, you know, and he wants to
1560380	1564660	sell the company and just kind of move on, and the company's not as profitable as it
1564660	1569540	used to be, and it's kind of just like treading water, so he's gonna get out.
1569540	1574800	So he sold it to the next biggest competitor, which is Ingram Entertainment.
1574800	1580500	So they're gonna buy it, but they're doing it as an assets person, which means that they're
1580500	1581980	buying the assets of the company.
1581980	1589580	They're buying the customer lists, and they're buying the inventory and whatever else, you
1589580	1590740	know, that kind of stuff.
1590740	1596560	So not the employees, but they're having everybody stay on until the end of September to help
1596560	1601000	transition all the customers over to the, you know, the new company and just to kind
1601000	1603000	of smooth that stuff around.
1603000	1608760	So you can quit now if you want, but you don't get a severance, and if you stay on, you get
1608760	1614220	a severance, and the way they spent the press releases, they're like, yeah, you know, there
1614220	1619640	may be some layoffs, but you know, or there may be some layoffs, they said, but it's really
1619640	1624460	from what we were told, it's everybody, maybe there might be a few people.
1624460	1627900	It sounds like if you wanted to stay, you'd have to relocate to Tennessee or wherever
1627900	1628900	these guys are located.
1628900	1629900	I don't even know.
1629900	1630900	Yeah.
1630900	1635580	And they have, like, their main business, Ingram, is beer distribution.
1635580	1638780	That's where they make a lot of their money, is alcohol distribution stuff, because they
1638780	1641480	do a lot more than just entertainment stuff.
1641480	1647580	They do, you know, alcohol, I think they do music, books, you know, all sorts of stuff.
1647580	1648580	Alcohol.
1648580	1649580	Tell me more.
1650100	1654140	And they also do, like, they sell to different customers than we did.
1654140	1658360	Like, they do grocery store, which, you know, usually has high returns, and we didn't mess
1658360	1659700	with it.
1659700	1665700	So I don't know, it's like, so, you know, I was kind of looking to get out of the company
1665700	1671180	anyways, because it was kind of just a dead end, it seemed like, and now kind of just
1671180	1675180	have more motivation to do that, because I have really no choice in three months.
1675180	1679420	But at the same time, it's a little bit of a relief, you know, and but for everybody
1679420	1684260	else, so they're, like, really bummed out and crying, but I'm just like, for me, it's
1684260	1687180	like a whole lot less stress, because I'm like, wow, I actually don't need to worry
1687180	1691340	about order forms that are in December, because I'm never gonna, I don't have to do that,
1691340	1694740	you know, I don't have to worry about getting this done, because it's not.
1694740	1698260	I'm glad you're spinning what can kind of be a crappy thing, like layoffs kind of into
1698260	1702660	the positive, and yeah, you're a smart guy, you're gonna turn out just fine.
1702660	1706180	If anybody out there listening might have some leads for Loki, email the show.
1706180	1708860	Well, it's just gonna be tough, because I haven't interviewed, I mean, I've been there
1708860	1714820	for 14 and a half years, so I haven't interviewed in 14 and a half years, so, you know.
1714820	1719980	Now's the time to start researching with that and all that, so practice, practice, practice.
1719980	1722660	All right, well, good luck to you, Loki.
1722660	1725100	I'm sure you will be just fine.
1725100	1728280	Which means, though, in the meantime, though, I will be bringing that cabinet over at some
1728280	1730820	point, because I can't stay there.
1730820	1731820	I can't stay there now.
1731820	1739100	You wouldn't happen to want a framed poster of True Crime New York that's signed by the
1739100	1741100	entire cast.
1741100	1743940	I don't know where we could give it away.
1743940	1744940	Maybe a listener wants it.
1744940	1745940	We can give it away.
1745940	1746940	There you go.
1746940	1747940	All right.
1747940	1752940	And a lot of kind words there from our chat over at live.vognetware.com.
1752940	1755880	Dungeon Buster says, good luck, I'm sure you'll land on your feet somewhere.
1755880	1756880	So you will.
1756880	1757880	All right.
1757880	1760860	On to my gaming week, and the types of games I've been playing this week.
1760900	1762460	I've kind of been all over the map.
1762460	1767580	For MMOs, I've still been continuing on both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, which
1767580	1771340	I talked already about XI a little bit and my resurgence with that last week.
1771340	1776980	I got my Corsair up to level 37, I think, and I'm doing my rank commissions right now.
1776980	1779580	So if you've ever played the game, you know that at one point in the game, you have to
1779580	1786460	travel to all the different cities and kill a dragon boss is the big thing to do.
1786460	1787460	That's kind of where I'm at.
1787460	1788460	I forgot about that.
1788460	1792060	It's so much easier now though, because once you go to a city, once you activate the telepoint
1792060	1795580	and now you can work to that telepoint, whatever you want for 500 gil.
1795580	1798060	It works like it doesn't.
1798060	1801980	So I made the trek to Windhurst on the boat and everything one time, and now I don't ever
1801980	1804420	have to do it again because I can just work on the telepoint.
1804420	1805420	Aw man.
1805420	1806420	Aw man.
1806420	1807420	Aw man.
1807420	1808420	Aw man.
1808420	1809420	Aw man.
1809420	1810420	Aw man.
1810420	1811420	Aw man.
1811420	1812420	Aw man.
1812420	1813420	Aw man.
1813420	1814420	Aw man.
1814420	1815420	Aw man.
1815420	1816420	Aw man.
1816420	1817420	Aw man.
1817420	1818420	Aw man.
1818580	1819580	ig
1834740	1838520	just gonna live in the guild house forever our guild house is pretty sweet i gotta say
1838520	1842780	if you happened to be on uh midgar summer on virus c14 you should look us up have fun
1842780	1846520	with us darn what do you do in the guild house can you actually arrange stuff in there and
1846720	1848240	parties
1848240	1855340	guild officers and and the like shane is the guild leader he can designate people who can rearrange the furniture and i know i'm
1855340	1857000	Allen and this guy zach
1857000	1860000	that plays with us have both been very big on like
1860100	1866200	arranging the house and putting everything in and you can actually build a lot of the furniture through crafting and some of it takes rare
1866280	1872920	materials that you can only get from certain bosses they're like rare drops from bosses for example crystal tower which is the big 24 man raid
1872920	1877600	in the game right now has a chance to drop an item that you turn into these glowing sword
1877600	1881680	arches that you put out in front of your house so i think that's a really clever little way
1881680	1885920	to incorporate the housing with the rest of the game is that you know the better you are
1885920	1889960	at farming certain items that can actually go into your house i'm really looking forward
1889960	1893920	to some of the pvp they're building it in the new patch because right now the only pvp
1893920	1897580	they have in the game is called wolves den which is just an arena style pvp it's four
1897580	1902380	versus four kill or be killed that's it just straight up you know arena play but now what
1902380	1907060	they're putting in in the patch they're gonna put front lines is what it's called and for
1907060	1911260	those that have played wow it sounds a lot like arathi basin and it's basically king
1911260	1916200	of the hill with the several different hills like you try to control the nodes for as long
1916200	1922560	as you can but here's the thing because there's no factions in 14 you know world of warcraft
1922560	1928420	has horde versus alliance star wars the old republic has you know the force and you know
1928420	1933060	the dark side and all that you know it has all the most games they don't do it like they
1933060	1938060	did in 11 where it's the starting you well there is that but keep in mind that in final
1938060	1942660	fantasy 14 that doesn't mean like usually in games you can't talk to people on the other
1942660	1946260	faction you can't party with them you can't work with them but in final fantasy 11 and
1946260	1952360	final fantasy 14 you can you do pledge allegiance to a nation um but you you aren't like like
1952360	1956380	bound to them for all your interactions and things you can still do things with other
1956380	1961540	people but it does sound like in this battlegrounds it is gonna be representing the nation they
1961540	1965780	haven't really said yet if you can rally for another nation or how you're gonna play with
1965780	1969100	your friends i guess we'll know more about that on tuesday when the patch hits but it's
1969100	1977260	going to be 24 versus 24 versus 24 72 player battlegrounds it's gonna be a cluster fuck
1977260	1983020	i can't wait i'm surprised you haven't tried to put was it ballista in there i don't even
1983020	1986140	remember what the point of that was ballista was the whole thing where you were trying
1986900	1990820	when you would kill things you'd get the rooks or something you get the the feathers that you
1990820	1995340	throw at the roof i don't know it's weird anyway uh okay enough mmos because there's been other
1995340	1999780	stuff as well um okay so steam had a big sale this weekend i'm not talking about the summer
1999780	2003580	sale man i know that was a big deal but this weekend i'm supposing in the honor of fourth
2003580	2007620	of july which by the way i hope you all had a happy fourth uh in the honor of fourth of july
2007620	2014900	they had duke nukem 3d the remake on sale for like 250 so i was like sold i gotta get this so
2014980	2020420	i played some duke nukem 3d i was playing through the first um and it's it they did they redid the
2020420	2025660	textures and it's so it's a little more hd but it still has that look and you can play the classic
2025660	2029220	like if you don't want to play the new one you can play the classic but i think the new one retains
2029220	2035740	that feel of the classic but yet you know works right and widescreen looks a little sharper and
2035740	2040180	on my computer which you guys know i upgraded my computer like four months ago blazing frames a
2040180	2049180	second boy i love it so it's just fast fast fast so much fun i need the um they need to get it so
2049180	2054620	i have somebody to play more i do have it i have it already we've got to set up a multiplayer night
2054620	2058780	because i i got it for the whole reason i got it is because they're saying that eventually they
2058780	2064500	were gonna have multiplayer there and then they added it yeah so i do have it in fact i'm checking
2064500	2069140	right now just to make sure um this has got to happen because i i want to play multiplayer so
2069140	2076100	bad and like i could play with strangers and the lobbies and stuff but um it's been a long time
2076100	2080820	i haven't played since high school that was my that was my college that was freshman year in
2080820	2087780	college in the dorms that was my game like i used to i used to build the crap out of those um let's
2087780	2092860	see duke nukem forever duke nukem 3d megaton edition so yes i do have that all right awesome
2092860	2096820	and then now one other game i'll give a quick shout out to is an iphone game believe it or not
2097140	2102260	but uh you know these guys nimblebit they make a lot of the really addicting iphone games like
2102260	2108820	tiny tower and oh god what else did they make the um uh airplane the pocket planes is that what it
2108820	2115300	is so they have a new one out it's called disco zoo oh my god and uh this is something one of my
2115300	2120740	friends was visiting this weekend and and she told me you've got to check out disco zoo and so i i
2120740	2126100	downloaded and checked it out and it's got you know unfortunately it has all the tropes of your
2126100	2132180	classic free to play iphone game like you try to find the hidden animals in a little puzzle
2132180	2136980	so like you have like 10 clicks in the puzzle to find the animals but let's say you don't totally
2136980	2141700	reveal the animal you get like three fourths of it a little thing will come up and say if you want
2141700	2147460	five more guesses you can either pay the one real world dollar or you can watch a quick video for
2147460	2152820	15 seconds and i'm just like ah but the game itself is really addicting and it has all that
2152820	2158260	cute stuff or like the you know the art style is very you know retro and the little people in the
2158260	2162660	zoo say things that are really funny if you look out for them like a bunch of memes everywhere
2162660	2168980	like in the pig pig exhibit there's a little guy that'll say that'll do pig and let's be honest
2168980	2177220	here you know given that's yeah i understand it's monetization but that's not so bad 15 seconds of
2177220	2181380	my time it is i i hit the button and i put the phone down and go do something else real quick
2181380	2187380	and then come back and yeah that's that's doable yeah it's it's totally doable so you know a nimble
2187380	2192100	bit does a really interesting job of kind of walking the line there on the it is free so i
2192100	2198340	mean you know whatever it is um but you know it's so easy to spend 99 cents to get your disco bucks
2198340	2203700	so so why is it called disco zoo this is the most so the big trick you know how in tiny tower you
2203700	2209940	have to like restock your stores so in the zoo you have to wake up your animals so you like your
2209940	2213940	animals will be awake for 20 minutes or whatever then you have to go wake them up but if you want
2213940	2220020	to get them to stay awake you can spend your disco dollar to throw a disco party and the disco party
2220020	2225700	will keep them awake and then of course it plays this really stupid eight-bit retro disco music
2225700	2231460	but then all the lights light up and if you have like uh trophies in your uh zoo pen or whatever
2231460	2237940	they'll light up and use all the animals start dancing it's really ridiculous but like who
2237940	2245380	doesn't love the idea of a disco zoo hello so anyway who doesn't like it rob the animals
2246420	2252340	let the cows sleep oh oh i can't i and that's the best part i can't wait for peta's response
2254500	2259060	i will say though you know it's the game does have like unicorns and shit in it that you can
2259060	2264340	have your zoo so you know there's is the unicorn shit rainbow i haven't checked yet but the
2264340	2272500	unicorns can wear fezzes you can get your animals i guess anyway all right look i'm gonna stop
2272500	2276580	pimping a game that they're not paying me to promote i just will say as far as mobile phone
2276580	2280900	games goes nimblebit tends to put out pretty quality stuff and this is just another one in
2280900	2286660	their little uh archive but beware of the temptation of monetization uh because that is
2286660	2293860	what it is all about right all right uh that's it for my gaming week let's do uh quick housekeeping
2293860	2298740	and then we'll get to the news tonight housekeeping very important update there will be no live orange
2298740	2304500	lounge radio next week we will not be here live in seven days very sorry guys but as you probably
2304500	2310980	heard uh dark sakura and i will be on our way back from san francisco and gamer x we will be
2310980	2315860	there this weekend sadly loki will not be in tow yeah here's the ironic part i'm actually going to
2315860	2320100	be in san francisco but i'm just not going to that get out what part you should try to swing
2320100	2325700	by and say no i can't take the taking the kids to an aquarium okay all right oh yeah the aquarium
2325700	2329860	is on the other side of city anyway but anyway uh that's that's kind of sad that it works out that
2329860	2335460	way but anyway uh dark stalker and i will be there um friday saturday sunday and uh if you would like
2335460	2342340	to see us in person the best place to catch us is the podcast cross zone panel so plan on being there
2342340	2348500	i realize we're up against the bio wear guy and uh uh i'm gonna butcher her name because i don't
2348500	2353540	have it memorized but she does all the videos um the very um the ones that make you think anita
2353540	2359620	sarkeesian is that her name yeah the tropes versus women yes yes yes she her panels at the same time
2359620	2364340	so i will hope though that you will strongly consider uh visiting us we'll be one of the
2364340	2373060	little smaller side rooms podcast cross zone uh ourselves uh game bar uh game buoy dot org
2373060	2378260	koopa club a horde house um i always feel like i'm leaving somebody out in this segment
2378260	2382500	a video game realness is there in spirit sadly they couldn't send anybody from canada
2382500	2387460	uh to come to the show uh but yeah we will all god why i always have the sinking feeling i'm
2387460	2392660	leaving somebody out i i am i apologize because i'm doing this off spur of the moment but um
2393460	2398020	we will all be there uh and uh talking about podcasting so if you want to come say hi and
2398020	2402420	learn a little bit about the art of podcasting how we do it the tech end of things uh come say
2402420	2409780	hi saturday at two o'clock if you're not able to come to gamer x um look for the uh archive of the
2409780	2414580	panel i'm sure will be on some of the feeds of the shows i just mentioned uh it'll also be up on
2414580	2423300	youtube eventually if last year is any indication so uh wait for that um also uh i should speaking
2423300	2429700	of panels and the like uh dragon con 2014 is happening uh and vog will have another panel
2430340	2435460	tentatively monday morning is uh when the vog panel will be uh more information to come on
2435460	2440580	that later but uh uh bobby and i making at least the two of us making appearances on a couple other
2440580	2446340	panels throughout the show i know travis donovan is going i believe john from critical myths said
2446340	2451700	he's going and i know some of his co-hosts also go to the show uh i think this is the year the
2451700	2455540	guys from British invaders make it out too so there'll be quite a representation from the voice
2455540	2461460	geez network at dragon con this year um so we will definitely think of a meetup something
2461460	2465140	something especially if some of you guys are going to be there in atlanta over labor day weekend so
2465140	2470260	a couple chances to catch us at various conventions um but sadly that means no olr this weekend and no
2470260	2476900	olr labor day weekend because you know conventions will uh take precedence uh on the podcast feed we
2476900	2482100	may or may not have something i would hope that maybe we can tape a little something something at
2482100	2488260	gamer x with maybe some of our friends so you may see something on the feed uh a little later
2488260	2492580	than usual i just hate to go a whole week without content on the feed i know it happens sometimes
2492580	2496740	though but i know some of your monday morning listeners really rely on us to get you through
2496740	2500340	your work day or your commute so we're gonna we're gonna try and have something for you even if the
2500340	2505940	best of but uh please forgive us if we do take the week off completely use the opportunity to visit
2505940	2510740	another fantastic independent podcast um because you know all these indie producers they work hard
2510740	2516820	at what they do so if you can't listen to us this next week listen to somebody else uh that uh that
2516820	2523300	loves to uh do this for free every week all right um let's get into some gaming news shall we
2523940	2528020	it's that time loki start us off all right let's uh let's talk a little bit about
2528740	2536340	um this is kind of interesting now we talked about this before lindsay lohan and had some
2536340	2540980	issues with certain characters or a certain character in grand theft five she thought hey
2540980	2547540	it's based off me i mean the character lazy jones is kind of i wouldn't say it's based exactly on
2547540	2554260	lindsay lohan but it's like you know the typical hollywood you know actress that's kind of
2555220	2559860	falling off the deep end you know getting into drugs and all the scandals and that kind of stuff
2559860	2564260	but now she's taking it further besides saying that this character is based off her she's
2564260	2572500	actually suing rockstar games saying that this character is you know basically just a complete
2572500	2579460	rip off of you know her personality her persona and she feels that she should be compensated for
2579460	2587700	it which it's parody stupid so i don't think she's gonna get any money but hey it's free advertising
2587700	2593220	there's a lot of people like uh this story by the way so here's a fun fact about me i bet you
2593220	2600340	would never guess i listen to conservative talk radio i do i do i i like to listen to how the
2600340	2605060	other side thinks that's kind of like you know i'm all about educating and listening to all
2605060	2608740	different angles right so and in this town there's really no other choice if you're going to listen
2608740	2613060	to talk radio on the drive to work if you want to hear how the traffic's going to be the reason why
2613060	2618500	i bring that up they do the news while i'm on my way to work you know all morning long this came up
2618500	2623540	on the drive to work and on the drive home they mentioned it that lindsey low hand was suing
2623540	2629140	grand theft auto 5 and i was just like okay so if this you know radio station is talking about it
2629140	2635460	then everybody's talking about this well she's basically saying okay that you know the character
2635460	2642900	in the game uh depicts her voice image and person personal style also that you know it's an in-game
2642900	2648500	they have an in-game spoof of the chateau mamont in west hollywood i guess where she lived for
2648500	2654260	several months and basically saying that lacy jones is a reference to low hand and the suit
2654260	2658820	claiming you know they want unspecified damages more like that they know that the game you know
2658820	2665620	made a billion dollars yeah 11 billion dollars they want some of that money it's good luck i
2665620	2672580	mean but i i just don't see how um you know they didn't call her lindsey low hand she doesn't look
2672580	2678820	like lindsey low hand it's just i don't know it good luck i just don't think that they're gonna
2678820	2684260	win i mean better people have tried guys you don't our chat room over at live.vog network.com says i
2684260	2689060	thought you could parody a person as long as you don't use their real or show name and complete
2689060	2694980	likeness well even in some cases though you can like remember in uh mba jam uh way back in the
2694980	2699300	day you had the codes where you could unlock like political figures in the game but i believe i
2699300	2702820	believe it's different when it comes to political parody and things like that like i think you can
2702820	2708980	use likeness and so forth but i'm just saying like the whole parody of real people is certainly not
2708980	2714180	new to video games it's in the same stuff happens on tv shows where you know you have like you know
2714180	2718660	your criminal you know dramas and stuff like that like law and order and stuff they'll parody
2718660	2724980	news um you know events and stuff like that to come up with their plot lines for certain shows
2724980	2729460	and you know the characters you'll see oh okay that that's supposed to be like a michael jackson
2729460	2734740	type character or oh that's supposed to be you know this type of person but it's not really them
2734740	2739940	it's different in this it's a similar scenario so you kind of catch the reference but it's not
2740980	2747220	it's not like directly saying you know oh this is lindsey this is uh minzy mohan and you know
2747860	2754500	uh you know it's not that you know direct i guess do you know what this reminds me of do you remember
2754580	2758500	a few years ago and i know we brought this up on olr because we were talking exclusively about
2758500	2763300	music games for a while but do you remember when the uh lead singer of delight the band that did
2763300	2768020	grooves in the heart like the epic 90s dance anthem right remember lady miscure who fronted
2768020	2775060	that band she sued sega for space channel five because of ullala's likeness to her or whatever
2775060	2779460	it was but there it was a little more rooted i don't know why like my mind goes to that but i
2779460	2784260	believe they settled i think she did get money out of that like i don't think they approached
2784260	2788980	her first for the role yeah that was that was the big difference too is that sega had actually
2788980	2794020	gone to her but i don't they obviously they approached lindsey lohan for anything and i
2794660	2802500	i just don't see to see them doing anything that she's not gonna get any money no but but yet now
2802500	2808260	every talk radio and you know buzz station in america is talking about lindsey lohan again it's
2808260	2812980	great it's great publicity since they have you know with the pc and uh you know ps4 xbox one
2812980	2818580	versions coming out i knew okay i knew he would show up the minute i invoked her name because
2818580	2824820	my partner alan huge fan of lady miscure right yes so what do you i know you got to say something
2824820	2829220	on this what happened set me straight the thing that gave miss lady cure the edge is that sega
2829220	2832580	had approached her about making a game and they pitched the game to her and she turned it down
2832580	2839140	and they made the game anyway so they talked to her like she had receipts to be fair jamie brought
2839140	2842660	that point up but you might not have heard it before you stormed in here yeah i'm sorry
2842660	2851780	it's the feed delay that's all right but yet you you still used to do you think that ullala was
2851780	2856580	i mean knowing because i think most people look at lady miscure and go you know they don't really
2856580	2860660	know her because they only know her from the one song but you followed her a little more in that
2860660	2867940	era uh so do you think that she had a point like was ullala a lot like her so all i'm gonna say
2867940	2873700	is that i imported that game from japan the week it came out for my modded dreamcast and i think
2873700	2879780	it was egm or one of the big gaming mags at the time that showed a preview of it of coming out
2879780	2887220	in on the dreamcast in japan and this this was what 90 99 2000 so ign looked like a really nice
2887220	2891860	geo city site there was the internet wasn't what it was and you couldn't like stream gameplay
2891860	2898020	videos and all that when i saw that game i was like they made a delight game that's lady
2898020	2902660	miscare without any i had no idea about that sega approached her i i just thought this was this
2902660	2907060	random thing that they put out i got that game because i thought it was a lady miscare game i'm
2907060	2911540	not even kidding that is so funny because i remember when this story came up on olr
2911540	2916500	five years ago or whenever it was that she sued we all looked at looked at it and went this bitch
2916500	2921060	crazy she don't have a case but yet we didn't know at that time that angle that that sega had
2921060	2925860	actually approached her or whatever you know and so so it ended up that they did have a point so
2925860	2931140	the the fact that it was a music game and i was really into para and all that and the whole 60s
2931140	2938900	mod sort of laughing gogo dancer futuristic um that style looked really interesting but when i
2938900	2943940	saw the character and how she danced i was like that this is delight the video game this is a
2943940	2949380	groove groove is in the heart video or music video the video game and that was just something that i
2949380	2956660	came up with from looking at the magazine footage there was ironic that yet in despite that lawsuit
2956660	2961780	then michael jackson really did turn up in space channel 5 part 2 space michael because he loves
2961780	2965780	sega he had a relationship with sega with sonic 3 the music but he just took his name off of it
2965780	2970980	because he didn't like how the synth sounded yeah yeah uh really quick before you go um what do you
2970980	2974740	think you know that this all being said revisiting the hot stories from five years ago what do you
2974740	2979540	think of this whole lindsay lohan versus grand theft auto 5 thing i know that she hasn't been
2979540	2984900	able to work much in hollywood because she's uninsurable and apparently she's been clean for
2984900	2990020	a couple years like one or two years i think well but even in our chat room live.vogniteware.com
2990020	2995300	nemesis 47 saying lindsay's show on oprah canceled because she couldn't stay away from the booze or
2995300	3001380	the drugs yeah i heard that the reality show was rough so she okay i was gonna say that being the
3001460	3005860	overly litigants to try to get money for the work that you're not getting because you're
3006580	3010100	an addict is something that an addict would do and i would think that if she
3010100	3016100	was clean and had good people around her they would maybe say um maybe you shouldn't do this
3016100	3020260	but the fact that she's suing is a weird sign because i think if you go back her and her mom
3020260	3024260	used to try to sue everybody because they needed money she's broke because she can't she can't work
3024980	3031620	so it's unfortunate if that's what happened all right well thanks for storming in here bye hey
3031620	3035860	wait wait before you run any any other thoughts for the listeners excited for gamer acts next
3035860	3041300	week anything you wanna say no just excited for the con and take lots of pictures i don't have a
3041300	3044740	3ds so i don't know what i'm gonna do in the lobby when we're waiting for people because everyone's
3044740	3049540	everyone's doing street passing and on their 3ds maybe you can borrow shane's yeah try to borrow
3049540	3056180	one of shane's there you go that works all right thank you alan for jumping in appreciate it uh
3056180	3061540	go to our chat i'm over at live dot vog network dot com uh kai judo says ullala looks nothing like
3061540	3066820	delight uh delight didn't invent the dance every e trip and chick was doing those dances back then
3066820	3071620	keep in mind though a big difference between delight the band and uh lady miss cure who
3071620	3075620	fronted it some of the members of delight went on to do other things too from what i recall like
3075620	3080820	tawa tay was one of the members of delight and he he does like or at least he did in the late 90s
3080820	3086100	early 2000s like he remixed every big pop song had like a tawa tay remix so i know uh i know that was
3086100	3090420	part of it uh dungeon buster says when the lawsuit broke i still didn't see her in the game and fifth
3090420	3094980	dream says i thought of her when i saw ullala long ago before i ever knew about a lawsuit very
3094980	3099780	interesting how some people see it some people don't and i guess to bring it back to current news
3099780	3103540	the same could be said about this whole lindsey lohan thing some people see it but they didn't
3103540	3109060	i don't think they approached her about anything i mean no because clearly parody yeah so good luck
3109060	3114820	well and grand theft auto kind of does a lot of parody the whole thing is parody yeah yeah i just
3116580	3122500	she's just great it's it's just a you know an attempt to get money and here we are she's she
3122500	3127620	knows she doesn't have a case she's hoping for a settlement all right lindsey you're just never
3127620	3135140	gonna be better than mean girls and it makes me so sad you know who will ensure probably for work
3135140	3145540	the porn industry anyway all right uh let's move on with some more news oops except i was very
3145540	3150340	ill-prepared and i don't have my story up jamie can we go to your story next sorry yeah there was
3150340	3158660	some um i would like to say that this is a a good turnaround i was very happy with this but there
3158660	3164500	was something going on with the iesf the international e-sports foundation or sorry federation where
3164500	3170180	there was a hearthstone tournament that they were going to have um be male only there was and they
3170180	3175460	had male only and female only divisions but there hadn't had anything planned for the female only and
3175460	3181060	weren't going to include anything for the male only they have sensed um and i know that everybody
3181060	3186340	knows about this bobby talked about it it's been all over the the facebooks and the the medias of
3186340	3193860	socialness but they've turned around this decision and are having an all-inclusive uh a division and
3193860	3201460	a women's division so basically um it's open for all they're going to be letting uh anyone of any
3201460	3206900	gender participate in the hearthstone competition and it sounds like anything uh going forward
3208900	3214820	i had remembered seeing something about that they were maintaining it as male only so that
3216180	3221140	and this i don't know if this was something just from one of the feminist forums i read or what
3221700	3226100	but that they didn't want a conflict when a man got defeated by a woman
3226100	3235060	and i'm like dude suck it up she's better than you deal with it i'm not saying this excuses it
3235060	3240580	but could it possibly explain it dark sakura because when i first saw this story i was like
3240580	3245540	this is a cultural thing right there's there's there's you know because obviously feminism
3245540	3250500	although we we have a way to go in this country we're still more progressed than a lot of other
3250500	3254580	places and so when i first saw this article i thought maybe cultural differences were coming
3254580	3259060	into play do you think that that was part of it it doesn't really matter misogyny is misogyny well
3259060	3266020	no no i understand that but i mean it's also kind of i don't know like uh how do i word this
3266660	3273940	it might be really hard to tell an entire country to change their culture overnight even though we
3273940	3280820	all look at it and we say this needs to happen the reality is change doesn't happen overnight
3280820	3285540	change doesn't happen overnight unfortunately so then what about the olympics in russia
3287220	3293380	were they supposed to make everybody adhere to strict uh you know cisgender
3294500	3297620	you know heterosexual relationships in public
3300340	3304260	were they supposed to enforce that on everybody else again it's very important i'm not saying
3304260	3310100	i support their culture i think this is silly that's how i'm equating it yeah you know okay
3310100	3316260	you have an international event you're supposed to accommodate all cultures yeah and the biggest
3316260	3323380	thing is basically being inclusive for everybody especially since they were like oh well we we
3323380	3329860	support this we you know we support women in games we need more than act like it you know
3330580	3335060	screw those guys i don't care if they you know me this is me saying this on a personal level
3335620	3342100	okay so what if a guy loses to a woman boo freaking who yeah no i agree with that women are
3342100	3347220	better than some you know it doesn't even matter it's not all women are better than this than guys
3347220	3352180	or all guys are better than women this it's some women are better the thing that i had a hard time
3352180	3355940	wrapping my head around and it's just again and again it kind of made me go is this like a cultural
3355940	3362180	thing i don't get or whatever is that they had this separate contest for women in like like only
3362180	3366500	women were able to do the tech and tag tournament contest and like that even wasn't something that
3366500	3371460	was open to men and i thought that was weird because i was just like well but it that's a
3371460	3376420	fighting game and this is a fighting game why does it have to be i mean it just it didn't make
3376420	3381140	any sense to me and i was like is there like a cultural thing where women play more tekken than
3381140	3391380	guys and i'm like totally missing it i i think that for um some some cases having the the
3391380	3397220	women's division and this is what my thought was with this that it was more like throwing a bone
3397220	3402980	you know basically oh here's something to keep you quiet because i mean how many different male
3402980	3409540	dominated fighting game tournaments have there been across the world as opposed you know how
3409540	3417220	many women show up to some of these events and report on being harassed yeah or you know flat out
3417220	3426020	being um assaulted at some of these events what can we understanding that it's going to be very
3426020	3430500	difficult to make something change overnight because a lot of rights issues unfortunately
3430500	3437940	take generations to change i mean like look begins at home it okay so excellent where we're how do we
3437940	3445460	how do we fix this how do we stop this crap where i mean i i think it is ridiculous that women get
3445460	3450740	harassed at these things and there needs to be more of a social check and balance where there
3450740	3456020	needs to be more guys out there that are willing to step up and say hey not okay to like another
3456020	3460740	guy because guys do this usually to impress other guys at least that was always a feeling i get
3460740	3464580	growing up when i'm being bullied or whatever is that people would bully me because they're trying
3464580	3470420	to impress their friends well it's also the infliction of of particular gender roles and
3470420	3477060	gender behaviors on people that you know if a guy shows weakness or you know any type of emotional
3477060	3483780	vulnerability then he's you know a quote a sissy or there's something wrong with him for you know
3483780	3490580	being having emotions for being human right or that if a guy doesn't you know pursue you know
3490580	3497860	pursue and get the woman that there's something wrong with him you know meanwhile women are taught
3497860	3502660	you know from a young age if you get a compliment you don't say thank you you go oh no no no you're
3502660	3507220	you're supposed to dismiss it like you're not worthy or that you've been given a great favor
3507220	3514340	by some person thinking that you're pretty you know forget that you know i might be a great
3514340	3522740	writer or that i have all these skills no it's pretty i don't want someone i would rather be
3522740	3529780	called smart and thoughtful than be told i'm pretty i would rather be told i'm strong or that
3529780	3535620	i can go to the gym and lift weights in the guys section and not be a novelty then be told i'm
3535620	3544900	pretty you know i think you're pretty pretty awesome thank you i know thanks but i mean the
3544900	3552660	same thing is that the the and and i mean this is yeah i'm going outside of the whole uh you know
3552660	3560820	video game tournament thing you soapboxing on this show never what go for it but i mean i think that
3561140	3566900	the tournament's just a symptom the the fact well yeah i mean that's why i was saying it was
3566900	3571380	this is this is something this is a bigger cultural issue the fact that the press had
3571380	3575780	to check them on this to get them to change their mind is what was sad it shouldn't have
3575780	3581620	been an issue to begin with it should have not even occurred to them that they would have
3581620	3588660	anything that was un-inclusive but again i mean i i hate to harp on this but again that is is that
3588660	3593060	a finland way of life versus i don't know i don't live in finland i don't
3593060	3600020	no i'm not i'm not saying it's okay but it is interesting how you know this cultural thing over
3600020	3606340	here goes viral over here and blizzard has to step in and be the ones that fixes it which i
3606340	3610340	will say in this situation i think blizzard deserves the kudos because they're the ones
3610340	3613940	that put their foot down and said hey i don't care who you are or where you're from if you're
3613940	3619220	gonna use our game this is not okay well like i was saying before i don't think it really matters
3619220	3624500	so much that it's finland that the decision was coming out of finland i think it's if you know
3624500	3631540	you have an international community you go by international standards meaning you be inclusive
3631540	3638660	you don't do things that are gonna offend the people that you are hosting okay i have to play
3638660	3642340	devil's advocate here though just just just to be fair because when we talk about international
3642340	3645940	you brought up the olympics earlier and doesn't the olympics separate every sport in men's and
3645940	3656340	women's not every i think i think that they're i mean there are they there's definitely some that
3656340	3664020	are co-op but i think that they um there was some drama coming up about that because i honestly
3664820	3670340	i believe that if you're gonna segregate those it should be by like weight class
3671220	3677860	yeah i i mean i kind of get the separation a little more when it's i don't know it's
3677860	3682660	it's a tough issue because like i kind of get it from a like olympic sport style standpoint
3682660	3688100	because it's just the fact of the matter is men are statistically going to be this average women
3688100	3693380	are statistically going to be this average so i from a physical but hearthstone is overthinking
3693380	3697860	this is hearthstone yeah exactly hearthstone isn't that that's my point at the end of the day
3697860	3702660	hearthstone and esports in general are not physical competitions in those way and you
3702660	3707540	could argue me and say oh but it's physical because the hand-eye coordination or it's
3707540	3712980	physical okay whatever so what if some guy gets butt hurt i don't care it's not physical in the
3712980	3718660	way that you know agility average or weight average but but you know you're also right
3718660	3725540	there's that there's a lot of women built like men a lot of men look like women here's one of
3725540	3731060	my examples and i know this is stupid but look back to wrestling in the 90s when you had china
3731860	3736820	did she wrestle in the women's category no she wrestled with the men because she was built like
3737460	3743300	one of the guys i mean she did take testosterone for a while for weightlifting i mean she well i
3743300	3750340	mean not testosterone she was taking just the the anabolic steroids but still um i know that's
3750340	3754420	a dumb example but that's one of them but you know and at the same time with me saying that
3754420	3759620	i don't care if you know some guy gets butt hurt if a girl beats him on the same token i think that
3759620	3763300	if a girl is beaten by a guy she needs to be gracious and just acknowledge that he beat her
3763300	3767940	fair and square has nothing to do with their gender uh bobby blackwolf in our chatter live
3767940	3772660	dog network com says there are some mixed competitions pairs figure skating for instance
3772660	3777540	uh and there are mixed doubles tennis but i can't think of where you have just a man competing
3777540	3783780	against just a woman in the olympics uh ballroom dancing was once an olympic event too a test event
3783780	3788500	that never went anywhere well you know and i don't i think on our our little podcast we're not
3788500	3792500	going to be able to solve this issue very easily this is something that you know this is obviously
3792500	3799380	a much bigger issue but i think this is something that is going to be a generation as we shift into
3799380	3804980	another you know this this generation where you have a lot of like moms and dads like you know
3804980	3810180	folks like loki right raising his kids loki was raised on video games and so that's going to be
3810180	3815460	a part of the culture that he hands down to his kids and what i mean with that is that e-sports
3815460	3821140	as it becomes more and more mainstream that's going to become a part of culture too and i think
3821140	3826740	as these stuff mature as these things get more social acceptance then i think a lot more of these
3826740	3832580	bigger difficult questions are going to have to be tackled as to why do we separate these genders
3832580	3836340	should we separate these genders is this a good idea my other thought is that i
3837060	3842580	in the realm of public sports like actual physical sports i would still like to see things divided by
3842580	3850260	weight class or by ability class or by a particular level like that because and um because not only do
3850260	3856260	you have the genders that people are born with but you have people sure who are transgender sure
3857060	3864020	meaning or even identify as gender neutral or true or z or and and this is going to be kind
3864020	3869540	of touchy for me to say it this way but there are still physical there are physical difference
3869540	3875300	differences in the type of muscle that women and men build i'm studying this learning anatomy and
3875300	3881620	my own weightlifting right and even if you have a trans woman she's still going to have some of the
3881620	3887860	the male musculature physically i'm just talking physically only right you know so that in and of
3887860	3893060	itself where you have someone identifying as a woman she's going to be eligible to go in the
3893060	3901300	women except that there's that touchy part of how her body is built so i honestly would like to see
3901300	3907380	you know in the realm of sports just have the categories completely wiped away like that have
3907380	3911220	it all be based on physical ability and the same thing goes with these tournaments like that i'd
3911220	3918180	like to see it based off of personal ability rather than be some boys club all right well to
3918180	3924100	be continued um yeah again not not an easy topic that uh society is going to solve uh with just
3924100	3928260	this i i think this is something that's going to continue but i will say kudos to blizzard
3928260	3932260	for kind of going okay when it comes to and i hope you all know that sometimes i just want to present
3932260	3938260	devil's advocate opinion on this show i i do feel that uh you know blizzard stepping in and saying
3938260	3943780	who cares if you are a guy or a girl it is all the same it's all even when it comes to hearthstone i
3943860	3948740	think that was a great great thing um and i also you know what else i think is also a great thing
3948740	3955540	that pretty much everybody i saw on twitter in response like you know people that regularly speak
3955540	3960020	up on feminist issues and people that don't it seems like everybody out there on twitter was
3960020	3965380	kind of you know of the mindset of this is not right this is not the way it should be and so
3965380	3970420	maybe the positive at the end of the story is maybe that is a sign that things are getting
3970420	3979300	better if not at a snail's pace okay anyway let's move on speaking of uh things that are moving
3979300	3984660	along very very very slowly uh the playstation vita you know a lot of people are wondering if
3984660	3990500	sony's given up on the playstation vita because they haven't really been pushing any games for it
3990500	3993940	they're relying on third parties and thought i heard that they weren't doing any first party
3993940	3999460	games but then again they have um they do have one game coming out from sony japan later this year
3999460	4006420	but that's it well uh here's the thing uh sony in a recent interview said that uh there's uh
4006420	4010500	the new slimmed down model of the playstation vita of course you know we've heard about that
4010500	4016100	especially over in japan and so forth um it has spurred quote strong interest among gamers and
4016100	4020740	that there will be more stock coming quote to ensure continued momentum leading into the
4020740	4026020	holidays um the numbers for the playstation vita they've noted have been picking up towards the
4026020	4031620	play or as the playstation 4 is launched but we haven't seen the exact numbers for the playstation
4031620	4037380	vita in some time right now the vita is unable to be purchased from sony at least as far as i'm
4037380	4041060	concerned do you think that company do you think that could be because they're trying to put a lot
4041060	4044420	of stock and one thing that isn't mentioned in this interview or in this article or in this
4044420	4050020	discussion is the fact that there's a momentum shift coming towards this playstation tv which
4050020	4058260	will be able to handle the vita well um i know right now that it's um they've it's unavailable
4058260	4062980	um not i didn't think it was selling that fast in the beginning anyways and even with the redesign
4062980	4068580	i don't think that really pushed that many extra systems out there maybe it did but um right now
4068580	4074580	it's a temporary it's temporarily unavailable to be purchased so whether that means that they're
4074580	4081700	allocating those systems to other retailers or that kind of thing but the fact that nobody it
4081700	4085540	seems like from when i was reading like a neo gaff and stuff that people aren't finding them at
4085540	4094100	retail that kind of makes me scratch my head a little bit like why so maybe they are my guess
4094100	4099620	is that they're scaling down the production on those systems just because they are thinking that
4099620	4104340	the playstation tv is going to take a bigger chunk out of the market over here maybe and
4104340	4109940	they don't want to be left with a bunch of extra hardware that they can't sell um maybe that's the
4109940	4114820	thought um i don't know i do think though that it might pick up a little bit because i know
4115380	4120980	was it with uh they just would have they just added support for unity for playstation mobile
4120980	4126340	so like if i wanted to now i could publish a game to playstation mobile and what's kind of
4126340	4131540	cool about it is i can actually test it on a retail um a retail system just like i can you
4131540	4137300	know an android or iphone game all right go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com fifth
4137300	4143940	dream says i buy more games for vita than anything ionotropic says so many free vita games via
4143940	4149460	playstation plus had to buy a 64 gigabyte memory card kai judo on the other side says they need
4149460	4155220	to stop this vita thing it's a waste of their time and money no one is buying that crap well i i
4155220	4159620	bought that crap but i also bought it based on you know the launch titles and some of the things
4159620	4163700	that were out then and it is a little bit disappointing to see sony not really putting
4163700	4168980	out a lot of new stuff themselves but you know like the the chatter who said that they do seem
4168980	4174900	to still support it through playstation plus an awful lot and it is kind of cool that you have
4174900	4180900	the whole uh streaming through the playstation 4 is is is a pretty neat feature that i do use
4180900	4185380	i think though that unfortunately that the failure of some of their big temple titles
4185380	4189940	that they had like the call of duty you know black ops game yeah that was supposed to be fantastic
4189940	4194660	but then it was done by the same guys that did the resistance game which was not good and then
4194660	4199060	that game was not good and it's just very underwhelming like if that had like actually
4199060	4204580	turned out to be a really good game i think that could have really helped you know push the system
4204580	4208580	on a side note um i don't have the story in front of me or anything i'm just going kind of going off
4208580	4212900	of memory but i thought i saw something where ea officially dropped support for vita in this past
4212900	4220580	week which not true because they have well not exactly they have the legacy version of uh fifa
4220580	4227700	oh roster update yeah roster update reskin of fifa you know um so that's technically coming but um
4227700	4233860	yeah they don't have anything coming to um that system and ironically they do have a wii version
4233860	4241060	of fifa coming as well but um nothing for the wii u uh rama says just price cut the darn vita to 149
4241060	4245460	and watch it sell like fucking hotcakes that comment live dot vog network.com probably will
4245460	4251380	well it the playstation tv 99 that's why i'm saying the playstation tv is going to be the
4251380	4257620	thing that cannibalizes the already very very tiny vita sales it could drop that system down
4257620	4262260	99 dollars that'd be really interesting to see that happen it would if they could get if they
4262260	4266020	could get it under the ds's price but i can't imagine the hardware i mean they'd have to sell
4266020	4270100	that thing at a loss i can't imagine the hardware is only 99 bucks to build those things no not with
4270100	4274740	that screen on it unless they're well they could consider dropping the touchscreen or something
4274740	4281300	dropping the touchpad in the back who knows um you know i honestly think the back touchpad thing is
4281300	4287220	kind of dumb the beginning but i don't know it's just i think it's that screen that's really costing
4287220	4294020	them all right well let's move on loki all right so amazon is right now fighting against the ftc
4294580	4300900	because they're trying to get them to restrict um add-on purchases within their mobile apps
4300900	4305540	so basically what they're trying to do right now which i don't know i'm kind of on the fence with
4305540	4310660	both of the stuff like they're trying to require password entry for in-app purchases which i think
4310740	4316980	i'm okay with um overhaul their refund process to aid parents seeking um you know
4317700	4322420	recompensation for unwanted purchases made by children okay that i have a problem with
4322420	4329060	because they should be limiting what they should have a limit of how you know their children
4329060	4334420	shouldn't be able to access in-app purchases i think the best way around it would be to say
4334420	4340020	create a second password maybe like a pin like you had for like it you know an atm card or
4340020	4344260	something like that where you just have like a four or five digit pin that you enter in
4344900	4349540	to authorize those purchases instead of you know having to remember your whole password if you know
4349540	4353780	if the whole point is oh well we want to make sure that's streamlined enough so people don't
4353780	4357860	go oh well i don't want to log in to buy this i don't remember what my password is or something
4357860	4361940	and so i'm just not going to do that um and they're thinking that that's going to cut into
4361940	4365940	sales but at the same time i think parents need to be responsible for their children's purchases
4365940	4372980	in these games also it should be on amazon and even you know apple or um you know google to
4372980	4380340	be policing these games or apps that are on their services that are just blatantly trying to trick
4380340	4385940	people into making in-app purchases i think that needs to be a little bit more um policed but
4387700	4391460	i think both they need to kind of meet in the middle a little bit i only i think it's a little
4391460	4397860	ridiculous to you know make it so that it's easier for them to get uh refunds on the stuff
4397860	4402180	one it should really be up to the parents i mean we've got to put some responsibility on these
4402180	4407380	parents here you know that oh well i didn't know my my my children you know were playing with this
4407380	4412260	and i logged it you know logged in for this well why are you logged in first off for purchases made
4412260	4418980	on this stuff um it's i don't know it's like if you leave your credit card out and you're you know
4418980	4423220	kids run up a bill on something like that are you gonna you know call the credit card company
4423220	4428660	and go well can you give me a refund because i didn't know doing my kids are making purchases
4428660	4436660	on this stuff i mean i don't know so they're fighting it right now and apparently um they have
4436660	4444580	not uh the fcc has not responded to amazon's latest statement which is you know uh that they're
4444580	4454500	already doing enough i don't know it is a very interesting issue the whole uh kids making these
4454500	4460260	purchases on the devices and you know as it gets easier and easier to do that you know just touch
4460260	4465780	here to buy you know there's it's so easy for kids to do that but yeah i mean i believe on the
4465780	4470660	iphone you have the whole you have to put your password in again yeah they have they have the
4470740	4474100	or at least you can enable iphone i think you can enable that and they even said you know when
4474100	4477780	customers told us kids have been purchases they didn't want we refunded those purchases
4477780	4483460	and they're also saying that you know uh they have you know currently implemented a prominent
4483460	4487940	notice of in-app purchasing effective parental controls and real-time notice of every in-app
4487940	4493860	purchase and i think if i remember correctly and i'm not sure how amazon's you know stuff is forked
4493860	4499140	as far as android goes or even i know they have that amazon os or whatever for their phone or fire
4499140	4505460	os and stuff but they've got you know in google i think they've got support now for multiple user
4505460	4510820	profiles for these things and i think you can assign stuff to children assign stuff to parents
4510820	4515700	where you can maybe have it where you know the parents have to authorize those purchases or
4515700	4519940	even just not give them the option to be able to purchase anything you know what i think they just
4519940	4524100	need to do is they need to turn on some of those parental controls by default i think that would
4524100	4527540	be the right thing to do is that the whole requiring the password every day that should
4527540	4531220	be on by default of course then what happens when the kid finds out your password but
4531940	4535940	well that's that's another on top of that also or or the fact that you know
4536500	4540820	um if what they need to do is they need to override it for free purchases because i know
4540820	4545860	even still like on um the apple store and stuff you still have to put in your password for free to
4545860	4550820	download so let's just get rid of that for free purchases that way your kid isn't bothering you
4550820	4555540	for stuff i'm laughing because i know how they're going to stop it is because we're talking about
4555540	4559860	iphone what did they just put in those newest iphones they have the whole thumbprint sensor
4559860	4563140	so it's only going to be a matter of time before it's like okay you want to buy this put your thumb
4563140	4567860	on the thing and then now a kid is kids not going to be able to do that what do you cut off daddy's
4567860	4572820	they they want they want as little little resistance to make those in-app purchases
4572820	4576660	because i know that this is why the government's pushing back but that's why i'm saying do the you
4576660	4580820	do the pin do the pin so it's real easy it's just like the security on your phone just put in the
4580820	4585140	pin and be done with it and then that way you don't have to remember a big long password if
4585140	4589620	that's what you really want to do have that option in there um because i think they have it
4589620	4593780	like on the xbox and stuff where you can put a pin in for like parental controls very interesting
4593780	4598180	comments in our chat room over at live.vog network.com kai judo says i remember in the 80s
4598180	4601700	we used to call the 900 numbers and run up the phone bill parents would tell the phone company
4601700	4606980	their kid ran up the bill that sounds like this all over again um s2100 matt says those same
4606980	4611620	parents complaining are the same people that were once kids that ran up their own parents phone bill
4611620	4616580	via dial-up gaming and porn phone lines that's a very interesting sort of generational perspective
4616580	4622740	there that this isn't necessarily a new issue yeah exactly but like when i ran up the phone bill
4622740	4626500	because i connected to a phone number that happened to be long distance for you know
4626500	4631860	prodigy or whatever because i didn't know you know i didn't i didn't know that this was going
4631860	4636260	to be even though it's within my area code that this is going to be a toll call or whatever
4636260	4640660	you know that kind of crap because the phone company does weird shit like that um because
4640660	4644180	i didn't know that my parents didn't go oh we need to call the phone company tell them that
4644180	4648180	it was my kid connecting we got to get a refund fucking take some responsibility they they took
4648180	4653300	responsibility and said okay this was your fault because you didn't know this don't do it again
4653300	4657060	but we still have to pay this and because you know it was our fault that you did
4657860	4664260	take responsibility for your actions or your kids actions take responsibility yeah oh i know i it's
4664260	4668100	funny when you brought up prodigy because i i guess it the whole generational thing i did do
4668100	4672820	that remember when they used to charge by the minute for chat rooms oh my god one month i ran
4672820	4678740	up a very big bill and by using like chat rooms or whatever and oh i felt the wrath of my mother
4678740	4682900	oh yeah oh yeah and i got restricted from that stuff and it got to the point where like
4682900	4690820	she would intentionally pick up the phone to screw up my my uh my modem connections if she
4690820	4694260	knew i was on the computer when i wasn't supposed to be like on the modem or something she'd just
4694260	4700980	pick up the phone she knew it would kick me off and leave it off the hook nice
4703220	4708740	oh boy and uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room live.vognetwork.com similar story i ran up the
4708740	4714340	bill for quantum link or q link since it was 30 cents a minute or something i ran up a 400
4714340	4722500	bill one month and it was never on it again very interesting generational shift there all right uh
4722500	4727700	moving on some unfortunately sad news to follow up those stories but we have news of another
4727700	4734420	developer closure airtight games unfortunately shutting down their redman office no announcement
4734420	4740260	uh the studio just kind of disappeared and uh it disappeared less than a month after their
4740260	4745940	big game murdered soul suspect had just come out this was confirmed on twitter through tweets from
4745940	4751940	the company thanking those who quote supported us and made the last 10 years possible that's
4751940	4756900	never a fun thing to report on i mean luckily redmond is is also the home of you know huge
4756900	4761540	mother ships for nintendo and microsoft so hopefully those folks can find gameful employment
4761540	4767220	somewhere else but never fun to report on that i will say though i did not hear a lot about
4767220	4771540	murdered soul suspect um i've only heard of this like through other people that are like oh yeah
4771540	4775620	i wanted to check that out it was okay i just don't think it was what they're expecting it to
4775620	4780740	be i mean i didn't really have high hopes for it anyways it seemed like kind of a supernatural la
4780740	4788180	noir um and i just don't know if it was it wasn't that big of a title i think and it just unfortunately
4788180	4793860	just didn't you know get the reviews or anything that they're hoping it didn't kind of get the buzz
4793860	4798740	yeah i think a game really well it's being really marketed too much either so i mean i don't know
4798740	4803380	maybe the maybe the publisher didn't really uh believe in it i don't know all right well that's
4803380	4811060	unfortunate uh moving on before we get to uh release dates dark sakura lol lol a lot um
4811060	4818180	basically uh and i i don't know how many people listening believe any of that crap that displayed
4818180	4824260	on fox news but there's a show called fox and friends or a segment that has rick perry the
4824260	4831060	asshole um inviting in this particular segment invited uh president obama to the texas border
4831060	4838980	to see the uh quote immigration crisis ooh um the banner that they used for this for
4838980	4847380	defending the homeland looks quite a bit like the bioshock infinite uh you know logo
4848740	4854020	which is funny because basically isn't the point of bioshock infinite fighting the right wing and
4854020	4863700	winning kind of the ultra right wing doesn't it involve that sorta yeah yeah so um basically
4863700	4870660	ken levine got a wind of this and he said glad to help fox glad to help and then my favorite thing
4870660	4876020	is it's not the irony of that fox news thing that bothers me so much it's the type setting
4877300	4883620	it really is bad because that n and d are too close together it's just awful do you think fire
4883620	4888020	your designer do you think they really like lifted it from a bioshock game or is there
4888020	4896500	something their designer did yeah yeah i mean we we sample other we we quote other people's work
4896500	4900420	from time to time and doing it
4903220	4908820	in this blatant way means their designer is not no especially since the typography is actually
4908820	4915700	kind of bad um yeah i think that they ran out of ideas um you have uh some comments in the chat
4915700	4920900	room there that i think define this a little better uh act f saying with your uh what bioshock
4920900	4927140	it's all about kind of but not exactly is what i said but the point was comparing it to fox news
4927140	4933220	alan alchemy makes a great one though here it's mostly a parable about jingoism segregation
4933220	4941060	nationalism uh is a better way to describe it and eugenics is a huge one so i know i think
4941700	4948180	i don't know that's not as funny when you say it that way but my point was it was basically
4948180	4954500	the the worst of conservatism yeah of that era right and fox is the worst of conservative well
4954500	4960580	not the worst but the uh the the about as far worse as you can get that and still remain public
4960580	4969220	uh uh what's the word i'm thinking of socially acceptable on air yes all right
4970020	4973620	uh loki were you gonna jump in with something real quick i just think that i don't i don't know
4973620	4978660	if they i'm sure that they don't even know what bioshock infinite is and most likely that they
4978660	4983140	just probably drew from the same sort and same inspiration that bioshock infinite that's what
4983140	4988500	i was wondering is that maybe is it it's not fox news it's whoever they hired as their designer i
4988740	4993940	i can't i could see though jamie's idea of like a rogue granted the banner shape is the same but
4993940	4999620	it's it's kind of a stretch i mean it's aside from it having kind of the same theme to it it's just
4999620	5004420	it's not like they you know it's not like the daily show where they they take you know an
5004420	5008340	actual logo for something they kind of rearrange the words so they like to do really bad photoshop
5010740	5017380	all right anyway that's that's not how basically the way the way having a designer works is that
5017380	5024900	the designer said okay wage slave do this so that we'll pay you for something okay you haven't you
5024900	5032740	have until five minutes to make it ah okay designer presents work can you do it in comic sans
5033460	5041860	fuck you fine and some person who has absolutely no idea about what design or good typography is
5041860	5048580	approves it and it goes on air i want this to look a little more friendly and whimsical maybe uh
5048580	5052020	there's this font on my computer comic sans have you thought about trying that one
5052660	5057700	i would like to print out everything i would like to print out the phone book in comic sans
5057700	5059940	turn it into a giant spike and shove it up your ass
5062500	5070820	hey that's mean and then i'm gonna take papyrus and print the bible in that and shove it up your nose
5072180	5076100	or maybe just an unabridged dictionary that's a little bit longer
5078500	5083940	oh oh oh i'm going to lock you in a prison where all the walls are printed in helvetica
5083940	5088980	i was gonna say if i if i say you will learn what good type looks like if i say three hail
5088980	5097220	helvetica's will i be forgiven we need three hail helvetica's and a myriad pro all right moving on
5097220	5102340	let's travel around the world and check out some release dates okay nemesis wingdings is
5102340	5109060	still better than comic sans i kind of love those wingdings but wingdings will never be
5109060	5114100	as good as the emoji set that is now uh on all the phones and that's ridiculous
5116420	5122340	it's ridiculous well you don't like emoji no emoji emoji is my favorite way to respond to
5122340	5127300	facebook posts now because you know extrovert is on this big trip in europe and he keeps tagging
5127300	5132420	all this like really dumb shit he sees look it's rob on money look it's rob on money and it's like
5132420	5137140	i don't know like why it's supposed to be funny but i'll just reply with that emoji that just
5137140	5142420	has like the like look on its face like i hate you so much you know which one i'm talking about
5142420	5146900	if you look at all the faces there's one that has like the eyes pointed to the side the you know
5146900	5153300	the slyly judging you i hate you candy look at that face all right anyway uh let's travel
5153300	5157220	around the world and check out release dates there's nothing coming out this week what nothing
5157220	5162740	coming out this week nothing coming out this week yeah it's absolutely dead not a single thing well
5162740	5167860	that was a short release date say yeah exactly yeah nothing nothing coming out oh i'm sorry i
5167860	5177060	take it back there was the uh 3ds uh was it scooby-doo and looney tunes cartoon explosion
5177060	5181060	or something like that i don't know so basically there's a no one cur coming out it's scooby-doo
5181060	5188020	and looney tunes worlds combined you know it's like it's like space jam but less jam well now
5188020	5193780	see and before you said space jam i was gonna say well which of our listeners have actually pre-ordered
5193780	5199700	that but then you go and say space jam and i'm like oh space jam was a pretty rad movie
5200740	5206100	come on warner brothers you've got midway now so i mean you could you could technically make
5206100	5213780	a new nba jam game that's space jam space jam oh my god oh hey hey working on another space jam
5213780	5218260	they are working on another space jam movie so this could possibly happen it prison happening
5218260	5224820	with lebron or something yeah oh man that would be amazing that would be cool michael jordan needs
5224820	5229300	to make a cameo until we get space jam 2 let's travel over to japan and check out some of the
5229300	5234020	releases that are coming out over there no space jam 2 to report but we do have on the playstation
5234020	5242580	3 this week on july the 10th uh sakio shogi geckie sashi 13 comes out this week uh this is some type
5242580	5248180	of board game series that is on the playstation um i don't know what much more of the game than
5248180	5253540	that though you said it was shogi right yeah it's it's a classic game very very classic board game
5253540	5259060	that would be like strategy kind of like i think it follows a lot of the same principles of go
5259060	5264260	i would imagine it's kind of like how they release monopoly on every single console and handheld and
5264260	5268820	everything right it's like classic american board games get released on all that stuff wheel of
5268820	5276100	fortune too game shows anyhow uh on the xbox 360 this week in japan oh nothing nothing until the
5276100	5280260	17th it looks like it's a pretty dry week in japan as well because there's nothing on the weu this
5280260	5288100	week either uh taking a look at the 3ds though there is some type of special pack a 3ds xl pack
5288100	5294020	uh it's called the yukai watch edition uh that i think just includes that game and it's a 3d that
5294020	5299220	has the little character there on it uh for those of you that need to import a japanese 3ds i suppose
5299220	5306660	there's that uh yukai watch 2 also comes out ganzo and hankei come out in um uh japan this
5306660	5311540	week on july the 10th so kind of a slower week in japan as well how about uh how about the uk dark
5311540	5320420	sakura we actually do have a couple um on the 8th is cubit rebooted for the pc and on the 9th
5320420	5327620	mousecraft whatever that is is that like mousetrap the amazing board game for me it's on
5327620	5336900	ps everything i believe it's a puzzle game i believe it's falls in the don't care category
5336900	5346260	it's like okay compared to tetris and lemmings combined so boring to register participation
5346260	5351140	for this week's episode of orange andreja at vognetwork.com use the passphrase move all
5351140	5356340	right just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week but first loki all
5356340	5367300	right um so i don't know i mean i'm not too excited that he's back but cliff uh cliffy b
5368180	5374020	he uh tweeted i'm officially back making video games again because apparently he retired for
5374020	5383700	a while um so yeah and of course you know he was uh the main developer behind uh or main i should
5383700	5391860	say the lead behind uh the gears of war series and um kind of with that you know it's not surprising
5391860	5397540	since everyone's expecting a next gen gears war game uh one of the voice actors uh who did cold
5397540	5402980	trains voice was contacted for the next gears war game so put two and two together cliffy's
5402980	5411540	probably working on a new gears war game i don't know if that's necessarily a given i don't know
5411540	5418900	but i mean i if i were cliffy b i might want to do something else too maybe he's going to go around
5418900	5423540	and form his own independent game company you know like he can he can kind of do the miyamoto thing
5423540	5428340	and oversee gears of war 4 but he doesn't necessarily have to be like actively involved
5428340	5434020	if that makes sense i guess i don't know all right well i think everybody might want to get
5434020	5440500	involved with this because it involves food oh wait it's denny's food blah that's that's a
5440500	5445300	stretch of the word remember this red velvet pancake so we had at christmas i'm sorry they
5445300	5451060	weren't there died with blood denny's was awesome when i was 21 and like regularly went out to
5451060	5456260	dinner at two in the morning but now that i'm in my mid-30s like i really three people splitting
5456260	5463540	a sampler bam exactly where we have enough money to afford a sampler amongst the five of us yeah
5463540	5470420	i claim a cheese stick mozzarella sticks sound great now if i want gas we've been playing vampire
5470420	5476500	live action for the last seven hours mozzarella sticks man you said see it used to be like this
5476500	5483460	here's the routine go to qsar do a half day pass playing qsar for five fucking hours get out of
5483540	5490580	there midnight go to denny's sampler well anyway is denny's a big thing nationwide or is that more
5490580	5493620	of a west coast thing because i know we don't really have diners here in california like they
5493620	5499700	do the east coast they have denny's back east yes i don't know like i just said i used to finish
5499700	5506260	playing live action vampire i larped keep in mind go eat at denny's we don't have waffle house here
5506260	5511700	or you know dunkin donuts every denny's is everywhere rob all right fine and you know what
5511700	5517300	we don't have waffle house out here yes because the nine dollar minimum wage because assholes
5517300	5522580	yeah all right anyway uh so why do i bring up denny's on our video game show because
5522580	5530180	uh denny's is doing a greatest hits remixed menu that involves working with atari to create video
5530180	5537620	game food remixes so there's classic atari games like asteroids centipede and breakout
5537620	5546900	so one of the games is hashteroids where you're delivering 40 tons of condiments to uh the fourth
5546900	5552340	planet in sector 7d whatever that means uh so i guess you're fighting giant hash browns instead
5552340	5559780	of the pixely asteroids uh sector 7d isn't that like the same isn't that where like homer simpson
5559780	5566180	works and maybe maybe uh takeout instead of breakout is where denny's food is built up in
5566180	5570820	a wall and you have to take it down by feeding customers and then there's something called
5570820	5576100	centipup which i think is made out of uh those hush puppy little deep fried balls of dough or
5576100	5582340	whatever those things are they sell so how would you feed customers um with that do you like bounce
5582340	5586900	them off of like a you know the wall i don't think that's actual this is not actual food that you
5586900	5591940	order in stores it's a promotion they're doing online uh through mobile app you can actually
5591940	5598180	play these three games on denny's mobile iphone app i will say this though it to denny's credit
5598180	5605620	as much as i think their food is is really really bad um i think denny's is a master at social
5605620	5611140	marketing because their twitter account is always on point and their tumblr i'm always seeing them
5611140	5615940	on tumblr because they're saying hilarious things all the time so i will give them that so they are
5615940	5621620	pretty good at following the pulse and they did social media they did try to do that whole bacon
5621620	5627460	food menu and actually tried you know was it their bacon milkshake thing but it was not i thought
5627460	5630980	that was jack in the box did the bacon milkshake uh well okay i think that was everyone that did
5630980	5636420	bacon everything uh jack in the box did the bacon milkshake but that was with a jack in the box they
5636420	5642900	don't technically have any other milkshake other than just vanilla they just put different syrups
5642900	5647940	in there um and then denny's actually i think it was a bacon sunday is what it was and it was
5647940	5654580	disappointing unfortunately all right well we are going to take a trip to simpler times but quick i
5654580	5660180	want to read this because this literally just came in on twitter from akuma jp uh who actually lives
5660180	5664740	in japan and wants to kind of follow up on something that i was saying during the japanese
5664740	5670900	releases uh saying that it's not a slow week because yokai watch is the biggest game in japan
5670900	5675300	right now and people don't and who wants to compete against that even pokemon needs to think
5675300	5679380	twice interesting i guess that's one of those games that hasn't crossed the cultural barrier
5679380	5684420	yet because i don't do you even yokai watch i don't know that game i i know of it i haven't
5684420	5688020	like the name sounds familiar but it's not something that's really crossed over here yet
5688020	5692340	as far as i know and to go back real quick about mouse craft because now i just found the
5692340	5696740	screenshots that remind me of myself what it was it's like a cross between lemmings and tetris you
5696740	5703300	drop like tetris pieces to help the mice get through like a maze of all sorts of things and
5703300	5711380	you have a cat that's kind of crazy it looks cool oh yokai watch is a cute cute cute thing
5712100	5719460	uh it's a 3ds the original game was out in july of 2013 and uh it is not something that's been
5719460	5722740	released here it's only in japan so maybe it's something like bravely default well they'll bring
5722740	5727540	it over eventually uh there have been manga adaptations of the game uh that they've done
5727540	5732580	there's an anime tv series that they did that started in japan in january 2014 and they're
5732580	5738020	doing a movie at the end of this year so yeah wow this is a pretty big deal over there so uh
5738740	5744580	let's see uh the protagonist is searching for bugs in the world woods of sakura new town he
5744580	5749860	comes across a peculiar capsule machine next to a sacred tree uh when he opens the capsule it
5749860	5756740	brings forth a yokai named whisper who gives uh kita ghost butler a device known as the yokai
5756740	5761700	watch using this kita is available to identify and see various different yokai that are haunting
5761700	5768020	people and causing mischief so it sounds like ghost pokemon katai i've been dealing with that
5768020	5772180	kata his name is kata well then i'm surprised this isn't something they've tried to bring over here
5772180	5779700	yet maybe coming done by the same group responsible for professor latin and inazuma 11
5779780	5784260	well this is why i like doing the show live because you know what i i know i don't think
5784260	5791060	any day i learned any human being cannot play everything so this is always nice to you know
5791060	5795220	find out about things especially worldwide that are big elsewhere so thanks for the tweet
5795220	5801700	akuma jp appreciate it all right uh let's get to the classic game of the week let's go to a time
5801700	5804980	when there was a lot of stuff that came out in japan that i've never heard of that's for sure
5805780	5811780	but this game this game is definitely more than all of us in this room this game but this game
5811780	5818900	is definitely oozes murica murica murica this is a this is an american game an all american game
5818900	5824500	how how appropriate for this uh long weekend thanks to the fourth of july all right so dark
5824500	5831940	sakura what is the classic game of the week the oregon trail i figured it was about time
5832740	5837460	this is a great selection i just want to point out the audio we're gonna hear tonight for the
5837460	5842180	oregon trail this comes from not like from the fifth edition yeah the apple 2e edition
5842180	5848580	like didn't have music like maybe like a really bad synthesized you know theme but that's it so
5848580	5853780	we're gonna hear some uh digital fart yeah so slightly and and if uh j this music is appropriate
5853780	5854420	yeah jason's
5857380	5865300	it's really quiet but there it is anyway the oregon trail um was developed in 1971
5865860	5871860	by three school teachers in northfield minnesota uh the primary one being don
5873060	5879620	rawich i guess that's how its name is pronounced raw it's um two of his buddies who are also
5879620	5885060	teachers helped develop the game and this was done using the hp time shared basic
5885700	5891540	running on an hp 2100 mini computer back when we actually categorized them as such
5893140	5898980	um he had the game running for that semester when semester was over he deleted the program
5898980	5905140	but he printed the source code in 1974 the minnesota education computing consortium
5905780	5911780	uh was developing educational software and they hired him and so he basically uh
5912980	5920100	redid the oregon trail for them and it ended up being very very popular in 1978 mecc
5922580	5928420	was trying to get more people to use the apple 2 computer and so the oregon trail was uh in
5928420	5934740	creative computing's uh may through june 1978 issue written in basic 3.1 and then
5936100	5944020	there was the apple pds disc series um oregon trail 2 that came out in 1978 as well um so
5944020	5949140	basically there have been a bunch of different versions of oregon trail come out since then
5949780	5954900	but all of us here we have been you got a rough trip ahead of you partner we've known of this
5954900	5958580	game for a while the narration's a little louder than the music was sorry about that
5958900	5965220	well in in this case the game has been something that has existed as long as we've been alive
5966340	5975300	right so starting off with other editions outside the 70s versions there was uh the 1985 uh oregon
5975300	5980900	trail for apple 2 1990 had the oregon trail classic edition for macintosh um there was
5980900	5988100	oregon trail deluxe 1992 for das and macintosh uh 1983 through 96 oregon trail version 1.2 for
5988100	5995540	windows 1986 oregon trail 2 for windows 97 oregon trail third edition then we had fourth fifth there
5995540	6005300	was a dsi where uh in 2009 uh oregon trail for we and 3ds uh the oregon trail american seller for uh
6005300	6009940	ios and android and then in 2012 there was the oregon trail for windows phone
6010740	6016820	so what was the big thing that we used to have to do in this game apart from you know forting
6016820	6022500	rivers and whatnot shooting buffalo shooting buffalo and only being able to carry 100 pounds
6022500	6029540	back to the wagon you had to hunt and basically i know loki was the type that tried to shoot up
6029540	6038500	5 000 pounds of buffalo and i did everything died in the original version you had basically
6038500	6044500	no graphics and you were timed on how fast you could type bang wham or pow and misspelled
6045060	6050100	words were a failed hunt in the graphical version you had the little man with his rifle
6050900	6057620	um you could get bison they yielded the most food and were the slowest moving rabbits and squirrels
6057620	6066500	were fast you could have uh deer and elk and bears and other bison and other type of animals
6066500	6070340	but you could like you said you can only carry 100 pounds in the early versions of the game
6070900	6077060	it uh in later versions as long as there were two members of the wagon party 200 pounds could be
6077060	6082020	carried back and then later versions you could actually have different hunting environments
6082100	6088660	so you could hunt in the snow or the grass and the overhunting of animals would result
6088660	6094020	in a scarcer game and it would reduce the number of animals that would appear later on in the game
6094020	6098500	so it did teach a bit of conservatism you know um you could die in the game well
6100100	6107140	by you i mean all of your family uh they could die of various diseases like
6107140	6114420	measles snakebite dysentery typhoid cholera and exhaustion and in later versions um
6114420	6119780	you could have a funeral if the environment allowed you to have a funeral and you could
6119780	6126580	write a tombstone um but you still couldn't have a viking funeral which sucks but you could write
6126580	6131780	this person blew donkey goats or you know donkey balls or something on their tombstone and that
6131780	6140020	was always great you could uh you actually had a score you had um an unscaled number of points
6140020	6147380	that was for each remaining family member weighed by party health um your possessions and your cash
6147380	6156420	on hand one point per dollar and then you would have a difficulty scaler so it was it was kind
6156420	6162660	of interesting but you know now there's been of course all kinds of clones um mecc did uh the
6162660	6168820	yukon trail and the amazon trail and of course we know you have died of dysentery is on a number of
6168820	6173380	t-shirts and memorabilia i have a you have died of dysentery sure i have to say this real quick
6173380	6178980	though because the whole tombstone thing one of the big features was that not only would you fill
6178980	6182580	out your tombstone you know putting like pepperoni and sausage or whatever you want to put on your
6182580	6188020	tombstone right that what would happen is that when other people play the game their wagon would
6188020	6191460	come through and it might say like there is a tombstone here do you want to stop and look
6191460	6195860	and you would see like you know the tombstone of whoever had played before you it was like
6195860	6202420	that was me versus circa 1983 but then you know you know kids kids did all sorts of dumb shit
6202420	6206020	right so like you know we would be there and we would walk up and we'd do you want to see the
6206020	6210020	tombstone yes and it would come up and it would say you know teacher name is a fag or whatever it
6210020	6215380	would say there because you know unfortunately uh years ago it was okay to say those things
6215380	6222020	but um you know that's that's that's what kids did in school play the oregon trail and write
6222020	6228500	obscene things on the tombstones there were uh of course all different types of parodies that
6228500	6233460	were done for promotional tools there was uh the one that fool did in 20 what
6233540	6240820	do you friend i'm new here nothing i'm making you sound like um mutley i'm reading a little bit
6240820	6246260	okay because i find it funny the act deaf is like i've never played the oregon trail and then like
6246820	6251140	miss shame you know it's like act deaf dude well you know i know i know she said it with
6251140	6254420	tongue in cheek but i just laughing because i'm like well he's mexican of course he's
6254420	6261540	never played the oregon trail well they didn't play that in school for other uh uh different
6261540	6266740	types of uh alterations made in the game for marketing fallout boy did the fallout boy trail
6266740	6275300	so um there was a game loft did the updated version for cell phones um for ipod uh touch
6275300	6283220	and iphone and those that were have been on the app store since march 11 2009 various other
6283220	6287780	versions came out and basically the cell phone version is very similar but you have three
6287780	6294020	different wagons you have the basic wagon a prairie schooner or a conestoga wagon and you
6294020	6300740	can be a banker a carpenter or a farmer um of course there were there's a facebook version
6301540	6307220	uh then there's the oregon trail and it was released by the men who wear many hats
6307780	6315940	and it's basically trying to uh survive the zombie apocalypse so uh there you go
6317780	6324100	have you played the oregon trail no that game is funny i am not you have to check that out
6325620	6331380	so i i think that the the version that i found the video for is really funny because you start
6331380	6337620	off as this enthusiastic girl narrating the story and i'm like bitch you're gonna die you're gonna
6337620	6343060	be the first to get dysentery or drink the cholera infested waters this version that we're looking
6343860	6348740	this version that we're looking at here is like one of those classic cheesy 90 cd-rom games
6348740	6355140	like classic like i'm expecting the sim city anchor woman to come up on screen any minute now
6355940	6361060	those 90s uh cd-rom games are so cheesy that i like when people give me links in the chat room
6361060	6367620	that i cannot check on my phone there was there was also one it's not the oregon trail but it was
6367620	6375140	a um it was kind of like a mini game type version of the oregon trail that was on steam um i don't
6375140	6378820	remember the name that might be what they're linking to it's not the oregon trail but there's
6378820	6382660	one that's pretty funny it's just like you know you're just shooting everything throughout the
6382660	6387220	whole thing nice just guns everywhere i just can't remember what it's called because i have 240 some
6387220	6392020	games in here all right uh we're gonna take a break we're running kind of long tonight so uh

6454500	6462100	night off you just have to work at your other job of being a parent huh yeah all right i'll probably
6462100	6469860	get dragged to anelli's parents house and then i'll entertain josh which is a 24-7 well i thought
6469860	6475780	you might get to at least play maybe one more video game than you usually would or uh no i'm
6475780	6481460	still gonna be working on shayer stuff i still have to figure out how to exactly implement my
6481460	6485700	you know shane will still be here because he has the whole work thing he couldn't get out
6485700	6491140	of it for gamer x so uh you know you just come over and hang no i already told i already told
6491140	6496420	her that i'm already not done so yeah you didn't think ahead no i did it's just it's it's not fair
6496420	6504420	you're an honest man she already posted something like i have it was she has like frosty in her eye
6504500	6510980	and i'm like what how the hell did you get frosty in your eye and how is that my fault again i'm
6510980	6514820	sorry i don't understand what are you doing with frosty in the first place because i did not
6514820	6519620	realize there was going to be frosting related things happening now i now i have a craving for
6519620	6525220	cupcakes damn you loki but uh so i i don't know that's probably what i'm gonna be doing just
6525220	6532660	working on i mean i i probably will end up going to her parents house i wish i could stay home
6532660	6538900	maybe maybe i can convince her that i could stay home and nap because that would be nice but um
6539700	6543380	i don't know i'm gonna work on it during the week that's why i do my lunch nowadays because
6543940	6550260	there you go nobody that played games with me works with me anymore and uh our game room's gone
6550260	6555780	and uh it's kind of sad but i'm glad you're speaking of which i will be i will be ebaying
6555780	6562420	most of my gaming related stuff uh from our game room on ebay so look for xbox 360 and playstation
6562420	6569620	3 systems oh nice so i got playstation 3 160 gig systems that are they are pretty much brand new
6569620	6575540	the box got beat up and that's it oh do you have any ps3s or ps2 compatible no damn that's just
6575540	6580580	my original one at home but no these are all 160 gig systems they're the first redesign all right
6580580	6586420	so uh so hopefully i'll be putting that up and then um whatever else i have i have a lot of
6586420	6592340	crap at my desk and i need it it all needs to go so uh we'll see i'll be auctioning some of
6592340	6598740	that stuff just to make some extra money because uh because i'm broke okay maybe maybe i see that's
6598740	6603380	the other thing too is maybe i'll just trade that stuff in the game shop or something for uh
6603380	6609940	playstation 4 and uh there you go xbox one or wii u or something um so there's that option too because
6609940	6615140	i know one time they were giving you 100 bucks for playstation 3 well be careful because it's
6615140	6619380	gonna keep going down and down and down so you gotta figure out what you're gonna do yeah sorry
6619380	6623460	uh anyway quickly speaking of cons dark soccer i know you used to go to this comedy you haven't
6623460	6627540	been in a while but i think this past weekend i believe i heard anime expo had its big weekend it
6627540	6633540	sounded like registration was a freaking mess when has it not been a freaking mess why can't
6633540	6637380	why can't conventions figure out their registration lines what is what is up with that
6637380	6643780	the understaff and overbook all right well the story fingers crossed the gamer x will not have
6643780	6649060	that problem but i suppose just turned to crap last year it went very well the gamer x registration
6649060	6653620	went very well last year but getting in on the thursday night really really helps with that so
6653620	6659300	um let's see uh i want to quickly give a shout out to another program on the network as well
6659300	6664500	the voice geeks network vog network.com uh saturday nights on the network is when understation
6664500	6670900	live can be heard understation live a very very very long running program because uh well travis
6670900	6676100	one of the hosts is very very very old just kidding love you travis uh they are going to be back
6676100	6679780	after their short hiatus on july 12th so i just want to give them a shout out and encourage y'all
6679780	6686020	to check them out if you uh if you like your uh very random sci-fi chatter that is very
6686580	6692100	it's the type of show that you can really only do in the internet environment that vog has and it's
6692100	6696660	it's a lot of fun and very kind of like family uh entertainment so check that out i don't mean
6696660	6702660	family friendly dysfunctional family yes exactly i mean like dysfunctional family exactly exactly
6702660	6706580	love it but that's where dark soccer and i got our starts so i just want to give them a shout out
6706580	6710180	okay rapid fire news we got a lot of ground to cover we got to keep things moving so we have
6710180	6714500	plenty of time for calls so let's get to it loki some rapid fire news okay so this is kind of neat
6714500	6719620	because i didn't even know that this worked as it was wired now i guess wirelessly but apparently
6719620	6724500	the dualshock 4 controllers work with the playstation 3 which that's totally news to me
6724500	6729300	because i totally miss that um but yeah they have a brand new ps3 firmware update that now allows
6729300	6735380	you to wirelessly sync your dualshock 4 controller with your playstation 3 so for me that's a good
6735380	6741380	reason to get dualshock 4 because i only have a playstation 3 right now but i didn't know that
6741380	6747380	that worked so that's pretty sweet um so yeah and i guess um if you do sync it to your playstation
6747460	6752500	remember you're gonna also have to re-sync it to your playstation 4 but that's just as easy as
6752500	6758420	connecting it with a usb cable and pushing you know a button i'm excited about this i love the
6758420	6764180	ps4 controller yeah so that's really cool it's great um they don't have it where you can use the
6764180	6769300	playstation 3 controllers on the playstation 4 do they i don't believe so playstation 3 wouldn't
6769300	6773700	have the touchpad either which is kind of an essential you actually have to click that that
6774260	6778660	you actually have to click that that that replaces because there's the share button
6778660	6785380	the uh the tapping the touchpad replaces like what used to be the back back or select button that
6785380	6789380	replaces it well they could just emulate that they could have you know left side of that is
6789380	6794900	starred or left side is you know back or whatever um we'll see i think oh they actually that's
6794900	6800500	exactly what they do in a ps now so they do they do have a setup for it now that you mentioned so
6800500	6804740	that'd be kind of cool if they had that option but i i they wouldn't want to probably you know
6804740	6809220	cannibalize their playstation controller sales but very true it would be nice you know if they
6809220	6817620	had that um they had a special grand theft auto um patch this week that was a free update the
6817620	6822500	independence day special included a bunch of cool stuff including american fly t-shirts
6822500	6828500	uh mullet haircut for females and a fireworks launcher also um a giant monster truck that you
6828500	6834980	can buy um in game what's also cool is they have the option to buy fireworks and actually set up
6834980	6841220	your own fireworks show you can actually set timers on each one and you know launch fireworks
6841220	6845860	which was really cool um apparently though that's only going to be well at least the fireworks part
6845860	6851060	is only going to be limited to this week um which is very disappointing because that sounds really
6851060	6855940	cool i wish they would just open that back up but maybe they'll be just like there was snow at
6855940	6860980	winter maybe that something they're gonna add each year or something just to kind of keep it
6861700	6868820	fresh but uh that's really cool and you can download that for free so check it out and then
6868820	6876660	uh last but not least there's another oculus rift demo now for uh south park and it looks like
6876660	6883460	that they've just basically taken the south park stick of truth um environment and also uh just
6883460	6888980	threw like some characters in there and stuff but pretty cool looking you can wander around
6888980	6895620	south park and just kind of get the look there you can even go in the hell and um i don't know
6895620	6905540	it's a neat idea although at least not as terrible as south park 64 there is that all right uh some
6905540	6910180	other quick news uh this is unfortunate about mario kart 8 you know for such a stellar wii u
6910180	6915620	game that has a pretty great online system it was really only a matter of time before as they say
6915620	6920820	hackers gonna hack and uh some youtube folks uh have published a youtube that show how to hack
6920820	6925140	mario kart 8 uh they're saying well i don't think it shows everything they're just saying it's a
6925140	6930660	proof of concept for now but basically using a browser exploit they can make moo moo meadows
6930660	6936580	play the final lap music immediately or make it play no music at all uh they can rename things
6936900	6942500	like they rename moo moo meadows to shitty luck course they can corrupt the font they can crash
6942500	6947300	the wii u and alter the wii u menu fonts unfortunately the the thing about this is that
6947300	6952820	these exploits could lead to online cheats and i'm hearing that some of that is being spotted as well
6952820	6957140	that folks are able to cheat online hopefully nintendo will patch it and put the ban hammer on
6957140	6961540	this quick now that they have a system capable of patching uh because the wii u can do that for
6961540	6966420	games hopefully they will clamp that down and uh fix that it's not even with the games though it's
6966420	6972580	with the internet browser yes on the wii u so yeah but they could still patch out the exploit
6972580	6978020	in the game yeah so all right and uh this was mentioned earlier during the release days dates
6978020	6983380	but uh just to make sure we all know qbert rebooted is a thing and that is happening it's
6983380	6988660	coming out on mobile and steam uh qbert hasn't been seen in a while unless you caught his cameo
6988660	6993940	in wreck it ralph but qbert was that little orange fuzzball with a very long nose that used
6993940	6999940	to say a string of punctuation when he would fall to the bottom and little known thing back in the
6999940	7005220	day those old arcade machines actually had a little like device that when qbert would hit the bottom
7005220	7009940	it would make a very loud thud it would actually make like this big clamp uh a sound of a sandbag
7009940	7014020	hitting the bottom or something but anyway uh and then qbert would say a bunch of punctuation which
7014020	7019300	we all know was just fuck you know like what i usually say when i die like really easy cheaply
7019300	7024660	in a game like that anyhow now you can say swear words all over again with qbert on steam and
7024660	7031700	mobile devices it will have the isometric gameplay of the original arcade game uh in a 2d pixel style
7031700	7039140	and a 3d hd overhaul think kind of what pac-man and some other arcade remakes have had so uh
7039140	7044820	should be interesting hopefully it's not too overpriced uh mighty number nine
7046100	7051940	uh the company that was developing mighty number name cons concept usa which as you all know this
7051940	7056980	is inafune's pet project that's basically mega man without saying mega man right this is the
7056980	7062100	whole like screw you for not bringing any regular mega man games here is what we're going to do uh
7062100	7068980	anyway uh concept has announced now a new second paypal funding campaign to cover new stretch
7068980	7077700	goals for mighty number nine uh a 100 000 target for english voice acting uh the update that
7077700	7082100	concerns this whole drive is that anything collected in this new effort is only going to
7082100	7087220	be used to address new features the original donation toll is still dedicated to the original
7087220	7093860	game and the first round of stretch goals which um it's very interesting that english voice acting
7093860	7098420	was not considered in the original but you know i suppose usually the english voice acting turns
7098420	7106660	out terrible anyway so um not always uh anyhow um you can do that on paypal a 23 pre-order will
7106660	7112660	basically be a digital pre-order but there are other bonuses as well uh there's also a animated
7112660	7118980	series coming out of this there's lots and lots of lots of new stretch goals so there you go dark

7165300	7172580	weu version as well of that um should be should be interesting because uh it looks fantastic
7172580	7176340	um and the fact that they finally got a publisher because i know for a while there they didn't have
7176340	7181860	anybody um pretty exciting to see something like that come out since it's it looks to be
7181860	7189940	the same caliber of like a gran turismo or forza um other uh good actually this uh
7189940	7196980	is that a shovel knight is going to have butt mode yeah um basically will it friend your butt

7296500	7305140	to make up for it all right uh finally rob huh but lol but uh let's go to the frugal question
7305140	7309220	of the week you take facebook you take google plus you slam those words together you get frugal
7309940	7313940	it's
7316980	7322100	every week we ask a question of our social media communities and we read some of our favorite
7322100	7327140	answers on the air and this week we asked uh have you seen this whole story about the Denny's and
7327140	7332980	Atari thing and be honest has there been any of these video game commercials that you've actually
7333060	7339380	enjoyed as a sort of guilty pleasure be honest we won't judge you even if it's yaris and then
7339380	7343860	i put a little footnote we actually might judge you a little bit for yours so let's see what what
7343860	7350740	commercial sponsored games will our fans admit to actually liking a little bit and starting right
7350740	7356900	off tech 2030 says a little shame to admit i actually like the yaris video game on xbox 360
7356900	7363220	it was simple but addictive covers head with paper bag and you should feel ashamed
7363220	7366180	yeah well that that look of silence is you being judged right now
7368420	7374580	thank you for your honesty i appreciate it all right um let's see becky m replies and said my
7374580	7379380	guilty pleasure is yo noid the nintendo game that featured the noid character from dominos pizza
7379380	7385220	commercials uh febreeze a replies and said the doritos games on xbox live were amazing
7385780	7391620	dark tetsuya says i still have sneak king on the xbox which was fun albeit creepy as heck though
7391620	7397380	i think my favorite of these was spot on the nes a puzzle or board game starring the old seven
7397380	7401540	up mascot i think he did that for a classic game of the week cool spot was awesome and sneak king
7401540	7407060	the only game i can think of that actually was a hybrid game that both the xbox and xbox 360
7407060	7411860	versions were on the same disc that's right played in both systems why they didn't do that more
7411860	7415860	often especially with some of those games that were pretty close to each other yeah it was beyond
7415860	7420180	me uh let's see critical myth also green sneak king was hilarious especially when you realize
7420180	7424980	that the king was an uber stalker and that was supposed to be quote good advertising uh renee
7424980	7430500	replies and says not just yo noid in the dominos tie-in but i also enjoyed mckids hell of a
7430500	7436340	platformer despite the obvious tie-in andy r says motorstorm rc on the vita comes to mind
7436340	7443300	i'd forgot about this one that was a that was like uh iron man off-road racing from the pizza
7443300	7447860	parlors back in the day that game was cool uh andy r also says the game wasn't great but it was free
7447860	7452660	in the u.s thanks to the advertisement promotion which is a price i can get behind uh burr says
7452660	7457860	cool spot was actually a pretty decent platformer with impressive graphics for its time i really
7457860	7462740	enjoyed playing through that one of my amiga 500 ospher says remember when burger king gave us a
7462740	7468100	code to let us unlock memories for ddr extreme on the playstation 2 us version it was a while
7468100	7472980	after the game's release too that's right and that that was like a year after the game was that was
7472980	7477140	crazy yeah it was one of those things where they knew that the song was in there but there was it
7477140	7481860	was locked and they thought it was just like oh this is just something that they left on there
7481860	7486340	but they didn't really you know utilize it yeah and then come to find out oh there is actually a
7486420	7492980	lock code there yep yep uh nemesis 47 replied and said there was the ronald mcdonald game on
7492980	7499620	the sega genesis which was enjoyable and also sonic 3 fruit roll-ups anyone uh degener johnny
7499620	7503300	says to be completely honest the one commercial game i keep close to my heart is the seven up
7503300	7507220	spot game for the sega genesis to this day it still ranks as one of the most enjoyable
7507220	7511940	platformers i've ever played by the way where is that little guy that's a good question whatever
7511940	7518340	happened to spot i guess all the best advertising you know things go away after a while though it'll
7518340	7522580	come back in 20 years it's just like no one remembers the california raisins and they had
7522580	7527860	you know that game too i will always i will always remember the where's the beef lady i mean i
7527860	7532900	understand she probably died or something but you know a long time ago but where's the beef that was
7532900	7539220	the she was wondering where the beef was because only the beef would have saved her life the beef
7539220	7544900	unfortunately contained the cure for her uh illness and she never found it so she died all
7544900	7550420	right uh hitstun says yo noid was random and bad and i loved it everything everyone and everything
7550420	7555140	are trying to kill the dominos pizza mascot or make them lose a card game the game requires
7555140	7559380	throwing a yo-yo at random places to find invisible items that you needed to survive it would have
7559380	7565220	been nearly as interesting if it starred a masked ninja with a bird all right and uh lastly going
7565220	7571220	over to google plus and looking some of the answers over there appletainment replies and says
7571220	7576580	to be honest as i sit here sit being my heineken while listening to the new coldplay cd i abhor
7576580	7582100	product placement in all of its forms i avoid product placement similar to how i avoid the noid
7582100	7586980	i can even think i can't even think of any good or bad product placement in games especially the
7586980	7592900	new mirror's edge coming in time for the future that answer reminded me of that one scene from
7592900	7601540	wayne's world that's exactly right i will not bow down to corporate sponsorship uh and lastly
7601540	7606420	act dev says probably the burger king games and the doritos games on xbox though there are a few
7606420	7612100	games on mobile devices that are fun enough as well uh quickly going around the room any um
7612100	7619060	commercial based games that you enjoyed i like the burger king games i'm very sad they never came out
7619060	7624260	with they're supposed to be doing more with connect yeah like what the hell um then they
7624260	7629380	also checks quest because that was pretty awesome i just got a text message from our buddy jason who
7629380	7634020	i believe is stuck in traffic in the bay area right now who said checks quest uh so that's
7634020	7640660	awesome and then uh i did like cool spot cool spot was one of my favorite games uh dark sakura did you
7640660	7647060	have a commercially sponsored game that you admit was a guilty pleasure not really i thought you
7647060	7653620	liked the spot game no oh all right um yeah i actually really didn't have too many of the
7654260	7661140	sponsored games i just i'm trying to think and no i don't really think i did i was a big fan
7661140	7665540	of sneak king that would have been my answer but some of the chatters uh beat me to it alan's here
7665540	7670100	hi alan hello what do you want to say just submit all right submit so does it have to be a game
7670100	7676020	specifically put out by a product company or just can it be a real game with all that also
7676020	7680580	had the sponsors sure a real game that has sponsors why not crazy taxi is an amazing game
7680580	7687540	and that had real stuff in it pizza hut kfc and what else that that was uh the the offspring
7688180	7692580	yeah well no that was just licensed music but i mean like take me to p take me to pizza hut like
7692580	7698100	the the people it was a part of the game yeah that's a good answer i could vote for um crazy
7698100	7702660	taxi didn't they take that out of some versions like later on they didn't they would just say take
7702660	7708340	me to pizza or something or they'd just say take me to the hut yeah they were just generic
7708340	7714340	also take me to the shoe store because of when this happened and just how it was so weird but
7714340	7721140	space quest 5 um which was only done by one of the two guys from andromeda the sierra online game
7721140	7726740	space quest 5 had in it it was mostly a star trek parody uh because you were the captain of a junk
7726740	7731300	ship and whenever you pulled up the comm screen like in star trek when they talked to the guy in
7731300	7737620	the window there would be a switch to sprint and the sprint logo for real like they paid for that
7737620	7744020	placement and it's like and this was like 91 or 92 so this was i want to say it was groundbreaking
7744020	7749140	but it was like what is going on wasn't that back when like murphy brown was doing sprint commercials
7749140	7754180	yes and it was the weirdest thing and it's a perfectly good point and click adventure game but
7754180	7760020	sprint the phone company was in space quest 5 whatever happened to candice bergen it was
7760020	7765940	random thought and then in space quest 6 when they brought back the um announcer from laughing
7766980	7772740	if you try to click on like the edge of a bridge that's broken um if you want to like try and jump
7772740	7778500	across it it's like no no and uh you have to you have to do a walking jump because in this game
7778500	7784900	you can't switch to sprint so they referenced the previous that there was sprint sponsorship in five
7784900	7789860	and six wow that's those are some good answers alan i'm glad you popped in here game you're welcome
7790580	7795300	i run away now all right bye until you hear something else you want to comment on see alan
7795300	7798660	has the luxury when he wants to comment on the show he doesn't have to try to get my attention
7798660	7805540	in chat room he just walks in here i got something to say but we do we do love you guys too at our
7805540	7811460	chat room live dot vog network dot com oh thank god somebody got my murphy brown reference thank
7811460	7818580	you mega man 400 my buddy from video game realness which you're going to be missed this weekend my
7818580	7823940	friend all right uh which also reminds me to say i not only i hope you all had a happy fourth but
7823940	7830260	a happy canada day belated to all our canadian friends because that was what monday so all right
7830260	7836020	uh that was day the first oh tuesday so i i got my calendar all made jeez rob i know it was the
7836020	7840500	first one would think you didn't live in canada well actually i have a really funny story about
7840500	7844660	when i went to canada for the fourth of july yet we found ourselves there on canada day but i'll
7844660	7847860	have to tell that another week because we're running long all right uh let's get back into
7847860	7857220	some gaming news loki all right um so the oculus um they of course are been sending out dev kits
7857220	7862580	and you know uh there's dev kit 2 coming right around the corner in fact i think they started
7862580	7869220	shipping that but they had to suspend sales of dev kit 2 actually to china the reason being is
7869220	7877620	that they've had an extreme reseller um purchasing problems in china and so they're just flipping the
7878100	7883780	over there to make a quick buck and they're basically saying no we need to make sure that
7883780	7888580	we're doing what we can to make sure that um resellers that are looking to flip our product
7888580	7893620	for profit are not taking stock away from legitimate developer purchases globally our
7893620	7898580	product in its current form is development kit and meant for developers to develop vr content and
7898580	7903700	we're looking into alternative ways to make sure that our development kits are gained to legitimate
7903700	7908660	developer hands in china and because of that now we're forced to suspend an entire country
7908660	7915860	from purchasing i'll let you put two and two togethers um so i don't know in other words
7915860	7920740	we're gonna make sure that bobby blackwolf's uh oculus development kit does not end up in china
7921620	7927060	on a shady street corner it is kind of lame that they're doing that um that sucks for the legit
7927060	7935540	people but piracy is crazy in other countries well there's even people like just legit just
7935540	7939940	reselling the original kits and i'm sure a lot more are going to be doing that now that
7939940	7944100	you know the dev kit 2 is coming out but i'm sure there's going to be a lot of people just
7944100	7949380	even all over the country buying that stuff but you know not in bulk i think that's a good
7949380	7952500	question hey bobby i know he's in our chat room because bobby's commenting on this saying they
7952500	7956580	haven't started chipping yet i'm in the first batch here this is a good question for bobby
7956580	7961140	what are you going to do with your dev kit 1 when you get dev kit 2 i don't know well bobby's also
7961140	7965300	the type he's probably keeping it he's like i'm gonna have them both um but i'd be curious what
7965300	7968820	a lot of people out there are doing with their dev kit ones i wonder if those are the things
7968820	7973220	that are going to end up you know it's it's got it's like how um uh you know like the biggest
7973220	7978100	buyers of like used iphones are people in other countries where they don't have iphones officially
7978100	7982180	you know so i wonder it would be kind of fun to have one just to mess around with but yeah
7982740	7988180	i mean i don't know i don't want to spend that kind of money yet yeah you got you got you have
7988180	7994900	to finish your 2d game first before you can start on your technically in 3d yeah you have to finish
7994900	7999540	that first before you get to your he says he's keeping it he said he said that in chat he's
7999540	8004820	keeping it yeah all right i had a feeling knowing bobby he he likes to demo that stuff too so he
8004820	8007940	would get used to having two of them but i bet there's a lot of people out there that are going
8007940	8015380	to unload their dev kit ones so all right um going back to uh some more news and uh i know
8015380	8019380	this is a game that uh loki loves a lot although i don't know if you play this version of it
8019380	8025140	minecraft pocket edition i have pocket edition i just don't play it uh pocket edition is of course
8025140	8031460	the one that's uh on the ios and android and uh i think they have it in some other places too
8031460	8036580	uh did the uya get the pocket edition no they they advertised that they were going to be getting that
8036580	8041300	but they never did they never did all right well anyway um a huge update coming for minecraft
8041300	8045540	pocket edition it's going to be launching on thursday was that thursday this past week or
8045540	8052660	this coming thursday i think that was uh this coming thursday minecraft pocket edition 0.9.0
8052660	8059380	and this version will feature infinite worlds that's a big one caves new blocks and items
8059380	8065460	including monster eggs and huge mushroom blocks wolves where you can tame a loyal companion loads
8065460	8072660	of new flowers uh new mobs including endermen and mushrooms new biomes from the pc version mesas
8072660	8078020	jungle swamps and extreme hills abandoned mine shafts villages and other cool places again that
8078020	8083860	sounds like it's from pc uh an interaction button so you'll never accidentally punch a sheep again
8084820	8090180	uh and there'll be a new new feature generation including lakes vines and monster rooms and of
8090180	8097860	course the ever popular bug fixes so if you are uh and this thing still sells like crazy on the
8097860	8104260	ios like the itunes yeah it's good that they're getting it up to that same level yeah and i mean
8104260	8113300	if you buy one of these you know uh you google tv you know the android tv or i think you can
8113300	8118420	sideload in newia but the version that they had available didn't have controller support so that's
8118420	8122180	why i could never get it to work although that was supposed to be coming so i don't know if that
8122180	8126820	has been added in there at some point i hope it does because i can't play that game on the
8126820	8132340	touch screen it just it's not fun at all yeah and they did they had a version with controller
8132340	8139700	support for the um what was it the expiria play but they never ported that stuff over to the
8139700	8144580	regular pocket edition which is kind of lame are they still planning on the whole uh playstation
8144580	8149060	4 version will bring in the playstation 3 worlds yeah they're still doing that they just haven't
8149060	8154500	released the play or have they released the playstation no i believe it's on deck for
8154500	8160180	july or august so i think it's excuse me pick up it's soon it's around the corner yeah because
8160180	8164420	they're going to have the via version coming out also in the xbox one version i'm sure they're
8164420	8169460	going to disc based versions for all those as well um i'm interested to see what they do with it i
8170420	8174740	it's been so long since i played minecraft and i feel bad about it because i'm still paying for
8174740	8180500	the server and it's just like i understand you got yeah well it's just like you know i
8182180	8188100	it's hard to get people playing all the time you know uh if i opened it up publicly maybe
8188100	8192260	but then that then you have to maintain you have to deal with trolls and who knows what
8192260	8199860	well there's ways around that but it's just yeah it's tough all right well let's move on
8199860	8204420	with some more news dark sakura well we do actually have more news isn't that great
8204420	8210740	yeah this one has to do with uh magic 2015 as in magic the gathering oh raginator will be happy
8210740	8217540	which is why i picked this uh um basically wizard of the coast is uh getting together with 14

8256500	8261060	because i used to have a goblin deck that makes me laugh sorry this whole story is making me
8261060	8265700	snicker because i realized we just had a missed opportunity to do a list list here with card i
8265700	8273140	would put in magic 2015 maybe in a future week because i was thinking oh they have all these
8273140	8279300	celebrity designers but i don't see dark sakura doing a card for magic 2015 but mox mox prism what
8279300	8288740	if she could tap to win the game bored yeah tap the wing game board uh wouldn't that be the
8288740	8292420	wouldn't that be what the notch card would do is you tap this card to throw all the cards up in the
8292420	8300420	air and quit table flip card to win game or to be done at least all right uh go to the chat room
8300420	8305540	over at live.vog network.com dark tetsuya says i saw richard garriott's card it even references
8305540	8310820	the avatar from the ultima series well that's pretty cool i like those little little references
8310820	8317860	to a classic gaming's past especially a series as legendary as ultima all right loki oh thank
8317860	8325140	god ubisoft is uh managed to uh come out victorious against a lawsuit a patent lawsuit against them
8325780	8333060	you play apparently a company or a digital a company that held the patent digital regs
8333060	8338660	of texas um which i'm trying to see what the patent actually was called you know because
8338660	8346580	it's always something very generic uh i guess uh was it remotely tracking access to software after
8346580	8352900	distribution post distribution security and other typical functions of digital rights management
8352900	8360420	software um of course they had various numerous reasons among them that you know i guess an
8360420	8366420	agreement between digital reg and valve covering third-party use drm or something whatever i'm just
8366420	8373540	sad that it did actually end up going through because now uplay's gotta still be there and
8373540	8379220	uplay sucks they do really try to shove that you play thing down people's throats stop trying to
8379220	8384100	make it work no one wants you play it's not the worst thing in the world actually i like the fact
8384100	8387860	that it kind of has the synergy between all the different games but the problem that ends up
8387860	8392260	happening is that then every company wants that and things get so fragmented it's like what's
8392260	8397220	starting to happen to netflix everybody's pulling their crap off netflix because hbo wants to do
8397220	8401140	their own thing and you know these other companies want to do their own thing and it's like when
8401140	8406100	things get super fragmented then it's just like oh fuck this this isn't worth it anymore i'm not
8406100	8410340	going to sign up here here here there needs to be a centralized thing that's that's the only thing
8410340	8416900	i i problem i have with uplay but i liked that you know i could get achievements or do things in one
8416900	8422180	game and i could get a reward somewhere else like trying out assassin's creed and getting a few
8422180	8425940	points there could unlock a song and just dance or something like that that was i gotta think
8425940	8431380	though that that could still be accomplished through like steam or something i mean there's
8431380	8436900	gotta be the way to check to see if you have an achievement or something of another game true i
8436900	8440980	would think i mean i at least there should be a way to do that but then they can't get your email
8440980	8449780	address and track you and oh target ads all right uh hey a twitch app may be coming big rumor may
8449780	8454340	be coming to the 3ds and the playstation vita hold on this doesn't mean you're going to be able to
8454340	8460340	stream your games um but in a recent interview the co of twitch kevin lin said that the company
8460340	8466100	would like to bring the twitch application to the 3ds and playstation vita however it would
8466100	8472500	only be for viewing this by the way following comments from reggie fees may at e3 that twitch
8472500	8476420	wouldn't come to the wii u because they don't think that streaming 30 minutes of gameplay by
8476420	8483060	itself is a lot of fun so it's because the wii u can't handle it which we all know is really the
8483060	8488580	case and we you can and he can't come up there and say yeah we'd love to do that bar systems
8488580	8493620	underpowered and we can't handle that he can't say that but he really should have just more stuck
8493620	8498580	to the you know well we've chosen to go with youtube and we think that mario kart 8 looks
8498580	8502820	great on youtube and people are having a lot of fun with this and and look at the angry luigi
8502820	8507220	meme that meme that came out of this like that that like you don't have to dog what's happening
8507220	8516580	with twitch because again like honestly ironically nintendo at e3 kind of mastered the twitch game
8516580	8522340	like they got a lot of people really interested in their shit and a big part of that is because
8522340	8527300	of the twitch and you see a lot of people really commending them for hey you know what was awesome
8527300	8533220	about nintendo nintendo like showed actual fucking games at e3 and the games that were in motion they
8533220	8538260	didn't show cgi packaged things or these pre-packaged demos like they showed the real
8538260	8542420	stuff and they put that out there so it's it's kind of weird that reggie would say something
8542420	8548100	like that when like nintendo actually has a lot they can gain from twitch but i understand if the
8548100	8554500	wii u technologically can't stream the whole twitch thing like the xbox 360 and the xbox one
8554500	8560100	can well let's focus on what it can do the mario kart 8 stuff on youtube was was pretty cool you
8560100	8564900	know and surprised the hell out of me honestly you guys all know when i first talked about mario kart
8564900	8574020	8 i was like welcome to online nintendo and it is good very very good so all right anyway um
8575380	8579860	let's move on are we are we just about to the mailbag i think we are it's that time where we're
8579860	8584900	going to open up the mailbag because you guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orange

8591140	8596980	did didn't i sorry participate at orange laundry i'm not so much diving as much as just flipping

8603460	8607620	i might have to try activating the old account and set up a forward or something

8613140	8617220	it's gone but we'll we'll see i don't know it's never gone yeah that's true it's never gone
8617220	8621380	participate at orange on twitter.com is the place to send us an email uh and you can participate
8621380	8629380	with the show and dark soccer will read the emails right now hello lr while traveling to and from the
8629380	8634900	too many games convention in the philly area last weekend i listened to last last week's show rob
8634900	8640420	you're welcome if ever there's a sequel to bungee ferret toss uh tossing i will ask you and others
8640420	8647700	for even more cat pictures oh this is cyyr speaking of bft i was hoping to port it to unity
8647700	8653780	over the next year destination steam the hardest part will be figuring out a control configuration
8653780	8659220	that matches the precision and flexibility of an xbox 360 controller but also works with a keyboard
8659220	8664180	and mouse i do have a few ideas and i'll be working on it so wait do we just like kind of
8664180	8669460	sort of get confirmation that bungee ferret tossing is planned for steam not that it's
8669540	8676660	happening but it's planned hmm you guys were talking about the current dismal state of konami
8676660	8680900	and there is one thing you guys missed bimani is still a significant portion of their business model
8681860	8688580	they are still running 2dx ddr pop music and guitar alongside their newer releases
8688580	8697140	jubit um reflect beat sound voltex booth and dance evolution arcade all of those games are current
8697140	8701940	and regularly updated with new songs and unlocks true none of it is on home consoles and none of
8701940	8707860	it is officially in america with the exception of some ios versions but neither of those markets
8707860	8712980	seem viable right now so i don't blame them is this the majority of konami's business heck no
8712980	8718260	but it's obviously significantly enough to be a measurable part of their bottom line and seriously
8718260	8722500	if you haven't already you guys should take a day trip to sunnyvale and try out ddr 2013 it's pretty
8722500	8727940	fantastic i didn't realize they had that around here um i think they're getting that actually at
8727940	8732500	scandia soon i want to say that they're i thought that they were upgrading to that it wouldn't
8732500	8738820	surprise me because they have a lot of other stuff at scandia but um i i i do it's kind of one of
8738820	8742500	those things where it's like okay i i get that point and i respect that viewpoint and everything
8742500	8747860	but it's still it's very hard to sit here after we kind of had that whole peak of ddr in this
8747940	8753780	hey you know what i was like disappeared i i will take a playstation 4 xbox one game
8753780	8759140	that's in japan because you can import that shit and it's region free so that's fine i will take
8759140	8764740	that but we're not gonna see it even like a dance evolution game or something i don't know it's very
8764740	8770340	frustrating i just kind of feel like it still feels so small compared to what it could or
8770340	8774500	should have been i don't know that's where my frustrations come from and i realize they're
8774500	8780500	still making it but how big is it really but maybe bigger in japan than it is here
8780500	8785220	and my perspective is screwed i don't know but i will say i still see more konami slot machines
8785220	8792260	than i do you know ddr machines anymore i too limit the lack of any ridge racer developed by
8792260	8798340	namco proper and i'm really disappointed that neither the xbox one nor the ps4 have a ridge
8798340	8804020	racer game at lunch heck the ps4 is the first Sony console ever not to have one and that's
8804100	8809940	counting both psp and vita i think that handling the franchise handing the franchise off to a third
8809940	8815380	party was a mistake the vita version was poorly handled and i worried that ridge will join f0 as
8815380	8821220	a prize he had ignored racing franchise i i hope it doesn't happen because six and seven were at
8821220	8826260	least in my opinion absolutely the highest point of the series loaded to the brim with the amazing
8826260	8832020	course design and lightning fast action namco does better than anyone else this goes out to loki as
8832020	8837780	well as anyone who wants to to program anything ever i may not be a pro i may have only developed
8837780	8843620	a handful of games but i wholeheartedly believe in the 80 20 rule you'll spend 80 of your programming
8843620	8850420	time on 20 of the result and vice versa a lot of it is spent on the things your players won't see
8850420	8855700	or fixing things or figuring out how to do things or just figuring out that everything really does
8855700	8860820	take three times longer than you expected yep that's about right three times is actually a very
8860820	8867060	accurate estimate and this really is the truth if you are seriously working on a game you don't
8867060	8872260	really have time to actually play much of anything but it's all part of the game no pun intended and
8872260	8876980	anyone passionate about creating green games will agree that's well worth it keep fighting that good
8876980	8883060	fight aaron yyr thank you for the very good email lots and lots of points in that email and i agree
8883060	8888260	with what he said about ridge racer i really hope it doesn't go the way of f0 and uh you know
8888260	8892340	disappear although i guess we had word that bandai namco is developing something else in
8892340	8896900	the racing area it's just they're not developing they're publishing oh yeah very good point you're
8896900	8901460	right very important distinction and not the same thing it's a cool looking game i mean it's
8901460	8906500	absolutely amazing dan's gonna probably have to pick it up because it looks fantastic but uh
8907540	8912820	i don't know uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says speaking of f0
8912820	8918260	i did play an oculus rift demo full game on kickstarter which is an f0 slash wipeout style
8918260	8923780	racer it was really good in vr mode oh my gosh i would think a game that fast would make me barf
8923780	8930100	on oculus maybe not i mean maybe they've they've toned it down or it's not as bad as i think it is
8930100	8937140	but uh that might be too much speed for vr it might be a bit much all right uh let us uh since
8937140	8941700	that's it for emails sadly but you should email us participate at orangelandtrady.com if you want
8941700	8945860	to be heard on a future week but now would be the time that we do the FUs of the week
8945860	8971620	um fu 2 last minute prop making for cosplays and uh aerosol paint
8971620	8979940	i've been there but it was costuming for stage shows so i feel your pain fu to the fact that
8979940	8984100	i don't have any cosplay at all for gamer x i'm going to be so uncool i really need to fix that
8984100	8989780	for game or for uh dragon con but fu to the fact that i'll probably need to lose about 20 pounds
8989780	8995300	first um and fu my my real real fu i wanted to do is if you did the fact that i slept wrong on my
8995300	8999700	back or something earlier this week and like my back has been hurting for like a week straight
8999700	9004100	it's getting better but it's just like one of those like oh it hurts it keeps me like somebody's
9004100	9010660	poking me poke poke poke poke poke stop it you're annoying stop poking me logan uh just after you've
9010660	9016260	been tired because even when i slept today he's made me more tired now's a great time to start
9016260	9021620	drinking coffee i oh yeah you got red bull all right yeah that's right you don't fuck around
9021620	9028900	all right still doesn't help uh yeah i wouldn't be conscious if it wasn't for that so yeah it's
9028900	9034260	it's uh it does help all right just a few more stories for you guys then we're going to take
9034260	9040260	your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on skype orange lounge radio if you do want to call i'm
9040260	9044500	going to warn you i'm not going to have it open for very very long so uh don't be shy make sure
9044500	9050260	you get through um but but first we still have two stories before we get there so uh loki so
9051220	9055380	when would you think they would announce the reveal the new doom game
9055380	9062900	well everyone thought quake con and yeah it's gonna be a quake on so uh july 17th you'll see
9062900	9071700	you'll get the first look at doom and um yeah is this like doom reboot this is the brand new doom
9071700	9077060	game yeah it's you know the one that they have the beta test for in wolfenstein new order yeah
9077060	9088100	yeah oh right right um i didn't pick up that game so so yeah cool i mean i don't know um
9089220	9093540	hard to say much more until we actually see it right i mean yeah doom is gonna be doom
9095220	9100420	um i'm curious to see who's actually doing it if it's actually id software or if they're kind of
9100420	9104900	outsourcing it like they did with uh wolfenstein newer because wolfenstein newer i hear is pretty
9104900	9112340	good yeah so um it'd be interesting to kind of see what it looks like all right well it's a
9112340	9115860	classic series that you know we've been waiting for a new title in for a very long time what there
9115860	9122740	hasn't been one since this would be doom 4 right uh so what doom 3 was xbox era right so i remember
9122740	9129460	owning that on xbox yeah it's xbox pc and then they did the hd remasters of those yeah um so
9130260	9135220	it's been a while all right well um i think this hopefully it's not as terrible as quake
9135220	9142180	4 because quake 4 not so good this is very interesting because uh there's a game on
9142180	9149140	uya called chess 2 and uh it will it does not have a synchronous multiplayer it used to
9149140	9155620	but what happened is that microsoft issued a court order this recently uh that is levied against the
9155620	9161300	game's dns management service um this is interesting microsoft apparently seized
9161300	9168900	22 of the domains from this no ip dns service that chest 2 ran because there was evidence of malware
9168900	9173140	creators distributing harmful software from the subdomains yeah i think it's just they are just
9173140	9178260	cutting the collateral damage of that it wasn't oh yeah i'm not saying chest 2 is the cause of this
9178260	9184580	but it just because of what's going on over here chest 2 got impacted with this so uh very
9184580	9188500	interesting but just in case you didn't know microsoft does have a cyber crime division and
9188500	9193380	they do work with law enforcement when there's uh like botnet driven internet attacks that happen
9193380	9199060	so yeah chess 2 did come out for the uya in january it is scheduled for a release on the ipad
9199060	9204420	and pc versions via steam no word if this is going to set it back at all if they're going to have to
9204420	9210820	figure something out there so we'll see what happens with chess 2 and if they can get it
9210820	9215220	back online now here's my question about chess 2 is it is it just chess or do they like actually
9215220	9222020	like i think there's things i think there's some like tweaks to it um i've i looked at it briefly
9222020	9227220	but i think there's actually tweaks to it that changed the way it's played very interesting uh
9227220	9231860	tiger claw on chat says i use the no ip service they have a free domain service well you might
9231860	9236820	want to look into this this might be a little bit a little bit alarming but i guess um i guess the
9236820	9240980	ceo of no ip says quote we have been throwing everything we have at getting you back online
9240980	9245220	with the light least possible delay for legal reasons we have been restricted from reaching
9245220	9249220	out to you but we simply cannot stay quiet any longer we are very close to a resolution and
9249220	9255380	we'll update you with more information as soon as we can like chess 2 the sequel is what it's called
9258020	9264420	it says compare the chess chess 2 relies much less on memorizing openings and more on positional play
9264420	9270100	there are fewer draws and uh the asymmetric gameplay with multiple matchups keeps the game
9270100	9274420	fresh and interesting that's kind of cool that somebody although part of this kind of reminds
9274420	9278900	me of what was that movie this is really cheesy comedy where they were putting on hamlet 2
9280020	9284740	where the guy was like called hamlet 2 oh was that oh the movie was called hamlet 2 okay yeah
9284740	9290180	i'm just thinking of demolition i'm not demolition man um last action hero and hamlet's taking out
9290180	9297780	the trash not to be uh hamlet 2 was one of those like really stupid funny movies where they had
9297780	9301780	like rock me sexy jesus and all this i don't even remember like why jesus was in hamlet but he was
9301780	9309460	anyway all right uh 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio the skype line is

9344420	9350420	really on here yeah so uh it's been an art movie uh i think so yeah it's about i guess they're
9350420	9355700	saying that um it's seeking to inspire his students uh dana undertakes to write and produce
9355700	9359700	an original play a sequel to hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters
9359700	9362980	and more controversial content including the introduction as jesus christ as one of the
9362980	9366900	characters and complete song dance number called rock me sexy all right look look i don't care

9488020	9494580	colorado cutthroat connection they had the destiny alpha available there and it is a pretty sweet
9494580	9500260	game on the ps4 oh right because that was the weekend like because that whole con happened
9500260	9504980	right after e3 so they got their hands on that and had it available for everyone to play that's smart
9504980	9508500	because it was only up for a limited time yep i actually got to play it though it's actually a
9508500	9515940	mixture of halo meets borderlands too so to speak minus the cortana crap of course i noticed the the
9515940	9519700	borderland so i that surprised me because i was expecting destiny to just kind of like be another
9519700	9524820	halo type of game but yeah definitely i felt some of that borderlands influence in it so i'm i'm
9524820	9528900	excited to see what the final product is like but even the alpha i got killed in the alpha way too
9528900	9534180	easy um i got killed like a couple times though but it's pretty it's it's pretty it's pretty

9642980	9648420	i just checked in in san francisco and my plans changed a little bit and so i will be in san
9648420	9652820	francisco until sunday evening so yes i will be making some sort of an appearance over next
9652820	9659380	weekend we're gonna see jason at gamer x yay but i'm sure again it's been literally weeks since
9660180	9666100	i know i know but you know it's been so long i need my jason fix i in all in in all seriousness
9666100	9670420	i know he didn't didn't call just to uh uh talk about your weekend plans what's on your mind
9670420	9675220	tonight oh why not i mean that's what the show is for isn't it just you know just driving around
9675220	9679540	and sick anyways did i in between dropouts and everything else that i've been dealing with and
9679540	9685940	sell coverage and all the concepts did i hear you call superstar wars a good game yes you are
9686020	9690980	fucking crazy sir what no you're fucking crazy wait are we thinking the super nintendo game
9691700	9699060	yeah yeah super nintendo super star wars empire strike back those games are fucking
9699060	9705620	terrible you you just sucked at them that's why you're mad i i'm i'm not i'm not gonna say like
9705620	9711460	it's it's funny to make this argument because i played them i will play them again but put
9711460	9717700	together those games are very very poorly put together they have a terrible engine they are
9717700	9723300	fucking hard i only made any progress on those games because i was a habitual game genie user
9723300	9730420	as a kid i remember renting the game i don't think i beat it but i had like a heck of a time with it
9730420	9736340	over you know uh yeah and then run it and that's the funny part is that that kind of a situation
9736340	9743140	can happen but the game is terrible like go back and play it you will be frustrated out of your
9743140	9747860	goddamn mind uh you can i'm looking i'm looking at the wiki right now because i wanted to see like
9747860	9751940	what the reviews were not that reviewers are the end-all be-all but i wanted to see like where
9751940	9759140	kind of opinion lied uh star wars was re-released on virtual console in 2009 uh which i don't know
9759140	9762420	if that necessarily means it's still available and that doesn't mean we you that means you have
9762420	9768260	to go into the we emulation and grab it out of that store uh but i will say superstar wars was
9768260	9774820	awarded best action adventure game of 1992 by electronic gaming monthly as well as best movie
9774820	9779220	to game but i don't know anything about like what their average review is but i thought this
9779220	9785380	has been a pretty well-received game um and like i said it's not it's not that i it's it's truly
9785380	9791780	not that i hate it because i played all three of them a number of times and like i said i will do
9791780	9797540	so again but put together like there's something there's something about those games that looking
9797540	9805460	at them in hindsight just doesn't really sit well with me um the and and at the same time it's even
9805460	9812580	weirder because there was the old the old uh 3d arcade uh star wars where you just pointed at one
9812580	9819300	direction of the screen and shot but it's like the good star wars games to me were x-wing x-wing
9819300	9824020	versus tie fighter rebel alliance and all those kinds of things star wars empire strikes back
9824020	9829940	superstar wars empire strikes back in return the jedi are really like monotonous mindless games
9829940	9835060	and it would be it would be a really good idea for you to revisit those you're still going to
9835860	9841860	like facets of the game but all told the game is just particularly strange
9843860	9848180	well you're getting a very mixed bag in chat uh bobby's threatening to fire you
9848180	9853860	from the voice of vog right now there's there's there's characters that aren't in the canon
9853860	9860420	the all of the vehicle levels are not that good the game like i said if i did not cheat
9860420	9866020	i would not have made any progress in many in large parts of those games i will have to revisit
9866020	9870180	these games shortly and tell you if if i still think they hold up all these times later but i
9870180	9874340	just remember really enjoying them when i was younger uh ssj100 mad i think kind of sums this
9874340	9879540	up well saying a superstar wars was great and terrible at the same time terrible isn't hard
9879540	9884020	yeah it it really is a huge conflict like that and i'll tell you what i don't know if you're
9884020	9888180	going to have time for this but because i'm here all week depending on when you guys get in this
9888180	9896260	weekend let's find an hour sit down and record the games and talk about it because i'm here you can
9896260	9900500	come to the office we have ample everything to be able to do this kind of stuff let's sit down and
9900500	9905220	play these games again you want because you want to do is a youtube series where we revisit these
9905220	9910020	old games i i don't know about a series because i can't commit to that physically but to have the
9910020	9914580	two of us in the same place all right revisiting what our memories are just seems like something
9914580	9918660	that we can do to take advantage of the fact that i'm out here for the time being all right you're
9918660	9922900	on you're on if we have time i would love to do that plus you need to see my office that i'm
9922900	9929700	currently parked outside so you know we do we do all right well jason you thank you for sharing
9929700	9934580	your opinion it is it is the show where every gamer has a voice even if they are using those
9934580	9941620	voices incorrectly it's fine no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding all right all right well you
9941620	9946340	know i have to use my voice more than just 30 seconds of time of show i know i know all right
9947460	9953060	act def says hey i'm jason grump i'm sky not so grump oh lord no no no we're doing our own thing
9953060	9958420	all right i somehow i knew he was going to make reference to that but in my defense my thoughts
9958420	9962660	on that game predates the the reference that he's making is that the game grumps played super
9962660	9967540	empire strikes back and and i thought that they went a little overboard on the fact that it is a
9967540	9975380	very hard game but my feelings on how the game works predates that by a fair amount so and we
9975380	9981620	will have dark sakura with us who is the biggest grump of all we all know that i would don't make
9981620	9985540	me get up from this chair welcome to come to i want to hear this deconstruction i want all
9985540	9989380	40 bucks to be there all right i would say four but i know what the plan already is yeah all
9989380	9992900	right all right jason i gotta let you go to try to squeeze in at least one more call before we
9992900	9997300	end things tonight but uh it's always good to hear from you buddy and i will see you this weekend yay
9998180	10005140	you absolutely will all right bye bye everyone all right uh 1877 game olr or username on skype

10014340	10018020	hour amongst the combo figure something out figure something out we can always do something

10064500	10070180	super nes and i will play those games yes they were hard but that was a fun kind of hard and
10070180	10076020	that's a type of hard difficulty level where you go i bet you'll get one of those professional
10076020	10084660	gamers who can play call of duty black ops 2 featuring carl winslow blindfolded one hand who
10084660	10088580	can go through the entire game you sit the little bastard right here in front of the super nes with
10088580	10093780	the game controller wouldn't know what the fuck to do rob didn't pick you up superstar wars now
10093780	10097300	got you super return of the jedi yeah super return of the jedi it's sadly it's in a box
10097300	10103220	somewhere but uh yeah we're definitely gonna have to uh uh go revisit the games but look look in in
10103220	10108020	jason's defense and i'm gonna i'm gonna just leave jason alone i'm gonna i'm gonna do this whole
10108020	10115540	thing there's always some game that everybody seems to like that sometimes we just don't get
10115540	10119300	like for me for the longest time that was minecraft like i'm readily admit like all
10119300	10123700	these people like going gaga over minecraft and i was like what's so fucking great about minecraft
10124500	10129140	kind of gave it a second look and i i finally understood but you know it's it's i i understood
10129140	10133860	what he was saying is that you know he's he's not dogging on the games for the present it's it's you
10133860	10139220	know the difficulty was so crazy that a lot of people didn't even really get to see the entire
10139220	10145060	games well i guess i was one of the lucky ones who did i tell you what i probably won't be able
10145060	10149220	to go through the entire game and do it again but i'll sit there and give them my damndest to do it
10150180	10152660	you you're you're hardcore my friend that's why
10154500	10159780	no i'm not hardcore it's just that there are some games that are out there either they're
10159780	10165300	so easy you'll play through all over multiple times where it's so hard that you you just won't
10165300	10169380	give up you just play it right through and it's just fun and enjoyable now if you want to talk
10169380	10174100	about a game that's a pain in the ass to complete uh the simpsons bark versus space mutants you
10174340	10179460	mean to tell me i get through the two the entire level without getting hit twice come on son well
10179460	10185780	how about you want like a hard game how about like battle toads or or uh ghosts and goblins or some
10185780	10191940	of that insane shit or the fact that rygar didn't have a save feature or even a password feature
10192580	10198740	like what the fuck whoops is all i have to say about that exactly exactly all right rama did
10198740	10203300	you just call in to yell at jason actually no i wasn't actually going to call in at all because
10203300	10208420	i was going to talk about something but since nemesis 47 opened the floodgates to turn the
10208420	10215620	chat into um general population and the fact that you mentioned anime expo i have something to say
10215620	10221460	uh oh uh oh all right well the floor is yours sir thank you as you know at anime expo they made the
10221460	10228660	big announcement that about this and toei about sailor moon and sailor moon crystal the entire
10228660	10235060	dubcast was doing the various voices well upon hearing about sailor moon crystal i have been
10235060	10243780	working on a little project on the side and i did a soft release on my uh facebook earlier today

10519220	10525860	ten dollars and it's already up to like six grand but kickstarter makes they're five percent or
10525860	10532660	whatever so hey and i mean it's aside for the fact that it's satire i understand that
10532660	10536260	and people are backing it but it's not necessarily people will go through with it
10537460	10544420	it's still technically a fun my life project but it's just it's so stupid and it's just gonna get
10544420	10549540	people to i mean why don't i do that i mean shit okay i'm gonna make myself a hamburger
10550260	10552020	done kickstarter for 10 bucks
10554180	10559460	free money yeah better be a tasty burger it will be for six thousand dollars uh we didn't get a
10559460	10563700	lot of tweets this week but i do notice that pika uno uh sent us a few tweets i want to make sure
10563700	10568660	i read these uh because he was referencing those emails we had about uh gaming in belgium remember
10568660	10573780	that so pika uno uh tweeted us and said shame on you for last week's brussels sprouts pun
10574580	10579460	also belgium is huge on comic books and stuff but the belgian people i know pretty much buy
10579460	10586340	all their stuff from amazon and online uh and pikaruna wants us to know hello i'm the person
10586340	10592260	who bought eye of judgment at a massive discount which is really the best way to buy eye of
10592260	10599860	judgment if you're gonna buy eye of judgment the best way is to huh for someone to pay you to get
10599860	10607380	rid of it please take this off my hands so here's this in a coupon one last bit of uh news here if
10607380	10615140	you're looking to purchase an xbox um well the connect version two the one that came with the
10615140	10620580	xbox one and you don't have one with your system or if you want it for pc i'm assuming this is just
10620580	10625780	for pc right now but pre-orders are up for it now it's going to cost you two hundred dollars
10627380	10632180	so that's a little expensive whoa the new ones are two hundred dollars two hundred dollars
10633140	10637860	that's interesting is that really trying to encourage people to buy the xbox one that have
10637860	10642660	it bundled i don't know but it's directly from microsoft and um you can purchase
10643220	10649140	if we're compatible with the pc uh that's going to be available september uh july 15th
10652820	10656420	all right well we'll see how well that works out how the sales that works for them
10656420	10661060	that's a little expensive a little expensive and honestly i mean for what
10662580	10669140	um and i don't even know are the stanley because they haven't really announced the price yet for
10669140	10674340	the standalone sensors for the xbox one so is it also gonna be 200 because that doesn't make any
10674340	10679940	fucking sense you drop the price of the system 100 and you sell the sensor for 200 that doesn't
10679940	10685460	make any sense and don't give me this shit that you know going from xbox one the pc that cable
10685460	10690180	or whatever is 100 bucks because that doesn't make any fucking sense either so i don't know i'm
10690180	10695620	gonna be interested to see what their excuse is connect one still 100 yeah it's still 100 bucks
10695620	10700980	uh maybe that's why it's sold no it doesn't make any sense reduce the price of connect one because
10700980	10705220	no one's buying it anyways you can buy them used fuck i have one that i want to sell you so
10705940	10710580	i don't know interesting all right i'm sure more on this will develop oh here here's the best part
10710580	10715620	the connects the connect for windows v2 sensor does not ship with any software is intended for
10715620	10722420	use with connect for windows uh sdk 2.0 licensed separately oh so what the fuck am i paying for
10722420	10729060	that 200 is just for the sensor because you have to license the sdk hopefully some clarity will
10729060	10732660	come to this in the coming days this seems a little ridiculous for right now maybe there's
10732660	10736900	got to be something something else to this all right for now though we're going to wrap up uh
10736900	10740420	we got to get out of here it's it's after nine o'clock on the west coast and after midnight on
